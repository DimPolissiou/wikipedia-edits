Retrieved June 29th, 2019.]</ref>\n\n=== Research on economies of transition===\n\nAn early area of Woodruff's research has been the role of institutions such as [[rule of law]] and [[property rights]] in [[transition countries]]. For instance, together with [[John McMillan (economist)|John McMillan]], Woodruff finds that [[Vietnam]]ese firms in the 1990s were more likely to give a customer credit the more limited the customer's access to alternative credit suppliers, the longer the duration of their trading relationship and the more information it had gathered about the customer beforehand, and the better the customer is linked to business networks.<ref>McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (1999). Interfirm relationships and informal credit in Vietnam. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 114(4), pp. 1285-1320.</ref> Moreover, in the absence of reliable legal enforcement, firms often agree to renegotiate contracts following a breach, implying that retaliation is not as forceful as predicted in repeated games models and not as effective as sanctions, even though community sanctions are occasionally invoked.<ref>McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (1999). Dispute prevention without courts in Vietnam. ''Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization'', 15(3), pp. 637-658.</ref><ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1290349 McMillan, J, Woodruff, C. (2000). Private order under dysfunctional public order. ''Michigan Law Review'', pp. 2421-2458.]</ref>\n\nTogether with [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[Daniel Kaufmann (economist)|Daniel Kaufmann]], Woodruff and McMillan also explore the legal system in post-communist countries. Comparing post-communist [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] to [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Romania]], they find the size of 'unofficial' activity to be much larger in the former two than in the latter three, mostly due to higher effective tax rates, worse bureaucratic corruption, grater incidence of mafia protection, and less trust in the court system;<ref>Johnson, S. et al. (2000). Why do firms hide? Bribes and unofficial activity after communism. ''Journal of Public Economics'', 76(3), pp. 495-520.</ref><ref>Johnson, S., McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2000). Entrepreneurs and the ordering of institutional reform: Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Russia and Ukraine compared. ''Economics of Transition'', 8(1), pp. 1-36.</ref> the central role of entrepreneurs in transition economies is further explored by Woodruff and McMillan in a ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives|JEP]]'' article.<ref>McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2002). The central role of entrepreneurs in transition economies. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 16(3), pp. 153-170.</ref> Overall, Woodruff, Johnson and McMillan argue that weak property rights rather than insufficient access to finance were the main binding constraint for private sector investment into post-communist countries in the 1990s, as weak property rights discourage entrepreneurs from reinvesting their profits.<ref>Johnson, S., McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2002). Property rights and finance. ''American Economic Review'', 92(5), pp. 1335-1356.</ref> Similarly, they also demonstrate the importance of trust into well-functioning courts for investment: while relationships can sustain existing interactions, workable courts support the creation of new business relationships.<ref>Johnson, S., McMillan, J., Woodruff, C. (2002). Courts and relational contracts. ''Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization'', 18(1), pp. 221-277.</ref>\n\n=== Research on enterprises in developing countries===\n\nAnother key area of Woodruff's research are (micro-)enterprises in developing countries and constraints to their growth. For instance, Woodruff and McKenzie find that start-up costs of Mexican microenterprises tend to be very low and returns to capital high, suggesting that entry costs are unlikely to provide an empirical basis for poverty traps.<ref>McKenzie, D.J., Woodruff, C. (2006). Do entry costs provide an empirical basis for poverty traps? Evidence from Mexican microenterprises. ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'', 55(1), pp. 3-42.</ref> In further research, Woodruff and McKenzie randomly provided Mexican retail SMEs with cash and in-kind grants, which led to estimated returns to capital of at least 20-33% per month, with the effects being concentrated among those firms with the highest financial constraints.<ref>McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2008). Experimental evidence on returns to capital and access to finance in Mexico. ''World Bank Economic Review'', 22(3), pp. 457-482.</ref> Together with [[Luc Laeven]], Woodruff has also found a positive relationship between the size of firms in Mexico and the quality of the legal system, especially for proprietorships.<ref>Laeven, L., Woodruff, C. (2007). The quality of the legal system, firm ownership, and firm size. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 89(4), pp. 601-614.</ref>\n\nMuch of Woodruff's research on microenterprises has been conducted with [[Suresh de Mel]] and McKenzie in [[Sri Lanka]]. In one study, after randomly assigning cash grants to microentrepreneurs, they find annual real returns to capital of 55-63% per year, i.e., much higher than prevailing market interest rates, with the returns varying by entrepreneurial ability and household wealth, but not by risk aversion, suggesting that insufficient access to credit might not be a key constraint.<ref>De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2008). Returns to Capital in Microenterprises: Evidence from a Field Experiment. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 123(4), pp. 1329-1372.</ref> Faced with the difficulty of measuring profits, they find that simply asking firms about their profits offers a more accurate measure than detailed questions on revenues and expenses, as firms tend to underreport a nearly a third of their revenues, and that while providing entrepreneurs with account diaries helps address that issue, it doesn't significantly change reported profits.<ref>De Mel, S., McKenzie, D.J., Woodruff, C. (2009). Measuring microenterprise profits: Must we ask how the sausage is made? ''Journal of Development Economics'', 88(1), pp. 19-31.</ref> Moreover, the positive returns to capital are found to be completely concentrated among enterprises owned by men, a fact that cannot be explained by differences in the entrepreneurs' characteristics, but rather suggests that capital given to female entrepreneurs is more likely to be consumed or misinvested by other household members.<ref>De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2009). Are women more credit constrained? Experimental evidence on gender and microenterprise returns. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 1(3), pp. 1-32.</ref> In further work on this issue, they randomly offer both existing and potential female microentrepreneurs either the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]]'s Start-and-Improve Your Business (SIYB) programme or a combination of SIYB training and a cash grant, then finding that the training only has an impact on business profitability for new entrepreneurs and that the impact of the combined support dissipates in the second year.<ref>De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2014). Business training and female enterprise start-up, growth, and dynamics: Experimental evidence from Sri Lanka. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 106, pp. 199-210.</ref> In a comprehensive review of research on business trainings in developing countries, Woodruff and McKenzie conclude that business trainings generally have only modest impacts on existing firms, partly because firm owners' application of the taught practices is often limited, though trainings seem to help prospective entrepreneurs launch start-ups faster and better.<ref>McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2013). What are we learning from business training and entrepreneurship evaluations around the developing world? ''World Bank Research Observer'', 29(1), pp. 48-82.</ref> Together with McKenzie and de Mel, Woodruff has argued most microentrepreneurs (\"own account workers\") are more akin to wage workers than larger firm owners, suggesting that most of them - unlike e.g. [[Hernando de Soto]]'s argument - are merely waiting for wage work and unlikely to become employers.<ref>De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2008). Who are the microenterprise owners? Evidence from Sri Lanka on Tokman v. de Soto. In: Lerner, J., Schoar, A. (eds.). ''International Differences in Entrepreneurship''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 63-87.</ref> Another key finding related to Sri Lankan firms is that providing informal enterprises with payments equivalent to two months of the profits of the median firm leads to registration of half of the firms, whereas the mere provision of information about the registration process and possibility of getting reimbursed for registration costs has no impact; land ownership issues are raised as the most common reason for not registering.<ref>De Mel, S., McKenzie, D., Woodruff, C. (2013). The demand for, and consequences of, formalization among informal firms in Sri Lanka. ''American Economic Journal: Applied Economics'', 5(2), pp. 122-150.</ref>\n\nFinally, more recently, when comparing the impact of cash and in-kind grants on the profitability of microenterprises in urban [[Ghana]], Woodruff, [[Marcel Fafchamps]], McKenzie and Simon Quinn found a flypaper effect whereby - unlike cash - capital coming directly into the business \"sticks\" there, though neither type of grants has an impact on enterprise profitability when provided to female subsistence entrepreneurs.<ref>Fafchamps, M. et al. (2014). Microenterprise growth and the flypaper effect: Evidence from a randomized experiment in Ghana. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 106, pp. 211-226.</ref>\n\n=== Further research on Latin America===\n\nFurther work by Woodruff has addressed the informal sector wage gap in [[Mexico]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Peru]] (with Douglas Marcouiller and Veronica Ruiz de Castilla),<ref>Marcouiller, D., De Castilla, V.R., Woodruff, C.

She is known for her political influence, as well as for her cultural impact: she acted as the adviser of Frederick III, and introduced ballet and opera to Denmark. <ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\">''[https://archive.org/stream/danskedronnigerf00jorg/danskedronnigerf00jorg_djvu.txt     Danske dronniger; fortaellinger og karakteristikker af Ellen Jorgensen og Johanne Skovgaard]'', Kobenhavn H. Hagerup, 1910</ref>   \n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life ===\n\nSophie Amalie was born at the [[Herzberg Castle]], in [[Herzberg am Harz]].  Her parents were [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] and [[Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt]].  Nothing is known of her childhood. \n\nSophie Amalie married Prince Frederick in Castle [[Gl\u00fccksburg]] on 1 October 1643. The marriage was arranged in 1640, as it was considered suitable for the current situation of the groom: he was, at that point, archbishop of Bremen and not heir to the throne, and was not expected to succeed to the throne.   It is believed to be a political match, though the exact purpose of it is unknown.  They had 8 children, including King [[Christian V of Denmark]] and [[Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark]] who married King [[Charles XI of Sweden]]. \n\nThe couple settled in Bremen.  In 1646\u201347, they lived in humble circumstances in [[Flensborg]], after having been forced to flee Bremen during the war between Denmark and Sweden.   In 1647, Frederick was elected heir to the Danish throne, and the following year, she followed him to Denmark. \n\n===Queen ===\n[[File:Sophie amalieof brunswick queen of denmark.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Portrait of Sophie Amalie as queen by an unidentified artist, c. 17th century]]\n\nIn 1648, Frederick and Sophie Amalie became king and queen of Denmark and Norway. \n\nAs her husband was introverted, she became the centre of a sumptuous court life, with exclusive luxury items and grand parties, which shed glory on the royal power.    Queen Sophie Amalie made a pioneer cultural act in relation to the court parties by replacing the old medieval court entertainments with opera and ballet, which was thus introduced in Denmark by her at the court festivities.   She enjoyed fashion, parties and theatre, arranged [[Masquerade ball|masquerades]] and made the French taste fashionable in Denmark.     She remodeled the court after a French and German pattern.   In 1649, a large order of items arrived for the new court life she arranged, followed also by new staff and new positions.  She hired a German chapel master, Kaspar F\u00f6rster, a French violin orchestra, a French ballet master, D. de Pilloy, and a French court singer and dancer, [[Anne Chabanceau de La Barre]], and a French theatre company was engaged to perform French theater.   Sophie Amalie did not understand the Danish language, but spoke German and French, took lessons in singing and dancing by instructors from France and Italy, was dressed by French maids in French fashion, conversed with her children in French and had a French chaplain, and as the first queen of Denmark took a French motto: \u201eEn Dieu mon esp\u00e9rance\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    Ballet, masquerades and theatre performances were performed, and she and her children participated in ballets and amateur theatre with the nobility; in 1655, she performed five different parts in a ballet at the same occasion.  She was interested in literature and composed a library of French, German and Italian writers.   She was noted to have great disputes with her Catholic brother John Frederick, in which her husband was called to participate in the debate.\n\nSophie Amalie was described as a charming beauty with entertaining wit and artistic taste, also in private correspondence not intended for her to see.  A Swedish guest described her as \"a lovely young person\" and a Frenchman described her in 1649: \"This princess was tall, blonde, with a very attractive complexion, mild and very accommodating toward strangers; she had a great taste for France, and she had everything it could give her.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   [[Sophia of Hanover]] was impressed by her and said of her that \"her goodness and great accomplishments won over all hearts to her\", while the French envoy noted that the queen's considerable charm was in fact reserved for those \"which belongs to her party or are of use to her interests.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   The Spanish envoy [[Bernardino de Rebolledo]] dedicated sonnets to her in which he described her as a [[seraph]].  \n\n[[File:Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg by Wolfgang Heimbach.jpg|thumb|180px|Sophie Amalie dressed in theatrical garb, as part of the theatre of court by Heimbach]]\n\nSophie Amalie was described as playful and enjoyed to disguise herself.  When the abdicated queen [[Christina of Sweden]] was travelling through Denmark toward Germany incognito after her abdication, queen Sophie Amalie, who was at that time staying in [[Kolding]], disguised herself as a maid and traveled to the inn at [[Haderslev]] to observe Christina while dining with her retinue, and then left without having introduced herself;<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  on another occasion, she made a similar anonymous visit to [[Hamburg]] and back disguised as a maid, despite the fact that Denmark was at that time at war with Hamburg.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/> She enjoyed hunting, particularly at her ''[[Jagdschloss]]'' of [[H\u00f8rsholm]], would hunt in any weather, once killed thirty [[deer]] in one day, and was for her success as a huntress compared to the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].  \n\nQueen Sophie Amalie is known as the hostess and central figure of the many grand representational parties that dominated Danish court life during her husband's reign.  The Spanish envoy Rebolledo described her in this role at a party which was hosted in the honor of the queen's brother John Frederick at [[J\u00e6gersborg]] in 1655.   After a deer hunt, where the royal couple participated similarly dressed in red and where \"the queen conquered her skill to satisfy her generosity\" by, as a good hostess, allowing the guests to win over her, a ball followed in which \"the queen danced all night with such a smiling distance and such a majestic dignity, that she attracted the attention and appreciation of all\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     She participated in the amateur theater and ballet at court and, in one famous occasion, performed five roles in the same ballet: as [[Pheme|Fama]], a maid, the [[Muse]] of war - \"in which she danced while waving a banner to the music with such superior rhythm, that she seemed to exceed herself\" - a Spanish lady and an [[Amazons|Amazon]]; a performance during which the king asked the Spanish envoy Rebolledo of his opinion and was given the reply \"happy is a nation with such a king, and happy is the king with such a queen.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/> \n  \nThe grand court parties where a part of a representation of royal power deemed necessary to enhance the status of the crown and attract followers among the nobility in the royal couple's goal to strengthen royal power, particularly among the German nobility, which where inducted in to the Danish nobility by the protection of the queen despite Danish opposition.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    The parties where however criticized by the royal council as provocative during the depression of the 1650s, when Denmark suffered from bad finances, and it was pointed out that the king, in order to please the queen, had spent April 1654 to June 1655 in [[Flensborg Castle]], where party followed party \"in an unbroken chain\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \n\nSophie Amalie is credited with a great cultural impact in Denmark, breaking with the old Lutheran religious atmosphere and introducing a new court life influenced by a more general secular European art and pleasure culture, which as a role model also came to effect culture in the rest of Danish society.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>\n\n===Political Influence===\n\nQueen Sophie Amalie was described as ambitious and was well known to participate in state affairs, with the blessing of her husband, and influence policy as his adviser.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     Her great influence upon her husband was widely known already before he became king: before Frederick had succeeded to the throne, a satire circulated in which this was caricatured in the form of a mock question: \"Can a husband make any decisions whatever without the consent of his wife? Signed Duke Frederick.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \nHer influence is contributed to the fact that she attracted her husband as well as was in possession of a willpower and energy exceeding his, as well as to the fact that they had the same political goals: \"With her vivacious nature she understood how to attract her husband, with her greater decisiveness and more fiery temperament she energized his more careful nature to action, and above all she was given power, because she wanted it with all her flaming soul.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     \n\nThe three main political goals of Sophia Amalie and Frederick III where to defeat the power of the nobility, symbolized by the ''Svogerpartiet'' (Son-in-law's Party); to defeat the Swedes; and to expand royal power in to absolutism, to which the queen gathered followers through her court festivities and by creating a net of contacts by handing out favors.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/> \n\n[[File:Hera og Zeus p\u00e5 Olympen (Wuchters).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Sophie Amalie as the goddess [[Hera]].]]\n\nQueen Sophie Amalie was from the start of her husband's reign famously involved in the power struggle between the crown and the high nobility, symbolized by  the so called ''[[Svogerpartiet]]'' ('Son's-in-law Party'), composed by six noblemen married to daughters of her father-in-law from his second morganatic marriage with [[Kirsten Munk]], among which [[Corfitz Ulfeldt]], married to [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]], was the leading member.  Upon her husband's accession she became the first queen in over 30 years, and she could never stand the half sisters of her spouse, who had fulfilled the position of [[first lady]] during their father's reign.   This conflict begun already during the celebration dinner of the king's accession to the throne in Copenhagen Castle 6 July 1648 with an incident Sophie Amalie and Leonora Christine: the queen being unusually quiet, Leonora Christine criticized her for her silence, after which the queen participated in conversation, but notably fell silent every time Leonora Christine joined in.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    By 1651, the ''Svogerpartiet'', was crushed, its members disperse, the Ulfeldt couple left for Sweden and their property was confiscated.     \n \nSophie Amalie is thought to have initiated the war against Sweden in 1657.   After the peace with Sweden in 1658, she presided over the celebration of the [[Peace of Roskilde]] when the Swedish king Charles X Gustav was received at [[Frederiksborg Palace]], during which she entertained with \u201eavec beaucoup d'\u00e9clat\" and conversed about the crossing of the B\u00e4lt by the Swedish army.   When the Swedish king pointed at [[Erik Dahlberg]] and stated that he had been the commander, Frederick III greeted Dahlberg by allowing him to kiss his hand, while the queen for a moment, according to Dahlberg, had an expression which stated her feelings toward him as \"not all which was good\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \nThe act for which queen Sophie Amalie is most famous was her behavior during the [[Siege of Copenhagen]] in 1658, during which \"Sophie Amalie was given the opportunity to show all the strength and decisiveness of her nature, now unleashed for a more noble purpose than a hunt or the most exiting adventure trip\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \nShe is believed to have exerted great influence upon the king, normally often passive and uncertain, in their mutual steadfastness never to surrender, and their act reportedly strengthened civilian morale considerably and earned them widespread popularity.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    During the Siege, the king showed himself on horse in the weak spots of the city both in night and day, accompanied by the queen, also on horseback, to strengthen public morale.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   The position of the queen was illustrated by the fact that military commands where known to give their messages to her when they could not find the king, and at one such incident, it was mentioned that she was positioned in the highest tower of [[Copenhagen Castle]], looking toward the Swedish troops.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    During the war with Sweden in 1658, she sent her own agent Lorents Tuxen to commit sabotage behind the Swedish lines.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\n[[File:Portr\u00e4tt, Frederik III och Sofia Amalia - Skoklosters slott - 85014.tif|thumb|280px|Frederik III and Sophie Amalie]]\n\nSophie Amalie probably took part in the decision to introduce the absolute monarchy by the [[1660 state of emergency in Denmark]].   This happened while the popularity of the royal couple was at its highest after the Swedish siege of [[Copenhagen]] in 1658\u201360.   She was very popular at that point for her moral support during the siege.   \nDuring the Assembly of the Estates and the [[1660 state of emergency in Denmark]], which eventually resulted in the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark, the queen was likely one of the most important participants as the adviser of the king, but it is difficult to determine her concrete actions.  \nIt was reportedly Sophie Amalie, who on 10 October 1660 convinced Frederick III to go through with the plans to introduce absolutism by force in a difficult moment when the estates had refused to agree to introduce it.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    \nThe queen was however not involved in the creation of the ''Kongeloven'' (Lex Regia), the \u201cconstitution\u201d of Danish absolute monarchy, and [[Christoffer Gabel]] had difficulty to persuade the king to introduce it because the king feared that she would be displeased with the regulations concerning queen dowagers, and stalled introducing it by saying: \"Let me be able to keep the peace with the queen.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\nAfter the introduction of the ''Kongeloven'' in 1665, the queen's position was undermined by [[Christoffer Gabel]], who replaced her as the kings chief adviser. \nShe was notably no included as regent in the event of her son succeeding to the throne while still a minor.   The reason why her spouse no longer relied so much upon her advice in the latter part of his reign, was likely the instability in foreign policy caused by her indecisiveness as to whether her goals to reconquer the Southern Provinces from Sweden would benefit most from an alliance with France or with the Holy Roman Empire.   Another cause was her favoritism of her younger son, and her ambition to secure marriages of the highest status possible for her daughters regardless of political benefit for Denmark; one example of such was arranging for Ulrika Eleonora to marry Charles XI and become Queen of Sweden despite the fact that Sweden was Denmark's enemy.  \n\nAfter the introduction of absolutism, the queen increasingly attracted attention for her protection of favorites and her persecution of those she disliked.  It was said that \"The queen is not always good toward those, who devote themselves to the king, without being dependent upon others\"; that she wished to be  \"sought and honored\", and by handing out favors she gathered followers to a queen's party who owed their loyalty to her personally, and who eventually also gained influence over her.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     One of her protegees was Jakob Petersen, officially only a chamber servant of the king, who was given much favor by the queen and described as her \"most confidant tool\" until he was suddenly exiled by the king in 1664 for the unspecific accusation of being involved in \"many intrigues\"; after the king's death, Sophie Amalie had all accusations against him dropped.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  Her most favored lady-in-waiting was [[Abel Cathrine]].   Of the persecutions, the most known victims are Kai Lykke and Leonora Christine.   In 1662, the nobleman [[Kai Lykke]] was forced to flee and had his property in Denmark confiscated after he was discovered to have written in a private letter ti his mistress that the queen had sex with her lackeys; his was not allowed back to Denmark until after Sophie Amalie's death. <ref>Dansk Biografisk Leksikon </ref>   In 1663, she famously had [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]] imprisoned in the ''[[Bl\u00e5t\u00e5rn]]'', and refused to release her as long as she herself was still alive.  \n\nWhile her artistic taste was French, her political views where German-oriented and her influenced was feared, especially among the nobility.  A characteristic remark was made by nobleman Henrik Bjelke from the first Swedish war: \"The king is good, but God save us with honor from here! The queen is not good by any Dane, and she has the king in her power.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    Also the foreign ambassadors noted the queen's influence over the king and government.  Baron [[Ludvig Holberg]] said about her that she had \"the capacity of a statesman\" and \"the heart of a soldier\" but also that she was \"more admired than loved\" and that she went too far in her hatred toward [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]].<ref>Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon</ref>\n\n===Queen Dowager===\n\nIn 1670, Frederick III died and was succeeded by her eldest son Christian V.  Her son the king did what he could to curb her influence in state affairs, which was evidently not easy: in 1671, he wrote to Griffenfeld: \"God be praised, the queen dowager has left for Hirsholm today, so I need no longer hear: 'What do I hear now?'\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    \n\n[[File:Sophie Amalienborg (1740 painting).jpg|thumb|Sophie Amalienborg]]\n\nDespite her son's dislike over her interference, she remained a factor which was taken into consideration in Danish politics, and Griffenfeld was careful to keep in her good graces.   It is noted that Griffenfeld assisted her in her ambition to have her younger son Georg elected king of Poland.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    Griffenfeld and Sophie Amalie also worked in securing peace with Sweden during the Scanian War, as Sophie Amalie wished for peace with Sweden and its ally France because her favorite Catholic brother was Francophile and because she wished for her daughter Ulrika Eleonora to marry the Swedish king.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     The fall of Griffenfeld was therefore a great misfortune for Sophie Amalie and her political position, and it attracted great attention when the queen dowager demonstratively left the capital after the sudden arrest of Griffenfeld.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     His later pardon is credited with her influence.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    The Peace of 1680 was a great joy for her, as it resulted in the desired wedding between her daughter and the Swedish king.  She accompanied Ulrika Eleonora to Kronborg, but it was noted how she could not make herself to show her daughter the ceremony due to her future rank as queen.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\nHer relationship to her daughter-in-law Charlotte Amalie was not a good one.  Sophie Amalie was reportedly most unwilling to surrender her position as queen and her precedence as the first lady of the court to her daughter-in-law, and was only with great difficulty made to vacate the queen's apartment to her successor.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \nHer daughter-in-law was however not willing to give up her rank, and the precedence conflict between the queen and the queen dowager was prolonged for years: reportedly, the queen dowager demanded that the foreign ambassadors call to be introduced to her first rather than the queen, otherwise she would have them barred form her court, a situation which created such difficulty that the king sometimes solved the matter by leaving for another palace with his wife so that the queen and the queen dowager would not be present at the same time and thus the rank conflict avoided.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    \n\nSophie Amalie is known to have assured the continuing imprisonment of Leonora Christine also as a widow.  Upon the accession of Christian V, his wife Charlotte Amalie successfully asked him a promise to release Leonora Christine if the expected child was a son, and when she did give birth to a son in 1671, she called in the promise.  When Sophie Amalie was informed, however, she managed to have the king retract his promise by refusing to attend the christening of the crown prince.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    When Leonora Christine's daughter Ellen Kristine petitioned her for her mother's release, Sophie Amalie successfully asked her son the king to banish Ellen Kristine from the nation.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\nAs queen dowager, Sophie Amalie continued to host a grand court life with many festivities, as she had done as queen.  She lived in [[Sophie Amalienborg]] in Copenhagen in the winters and at Nyk\u00f8bing Slot or H\u00f8rsholm during the summers.  Sophie of Hanover visited her in 1680 and said of her: \"If I should praise this queen as she deserved, I would never be finished.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    She still hosted hunting trips and balls and was described as an avid hunter, and attended masquerade balls at court in costume until her death.  When the wedding of her daughter Ulrika Eleonora to the Swedish king was arranged, she welcomed the Swedish envoy [[Johan Gyllenstierna]], who was a known misogynist, with a great banquet, and reportedly, when he entered her palace, there was \"no man there, only women and the fairest you could imagine. As a wise man he soon realized that it was deliberately, as he was unmarried, and the rumour had it, that he could abide no female.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \n\nShe died in [[Copenhagen]] and was buried in the [[Roskilde Cathedral]].  After her death, [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]] was finally released, after twenty-two years of imprisonment.\n\n==Issue==\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=cccccc\n!width=\"20%\"|Name!! width=\"15%\"|Birth!! width=\"15%\"|Death!! width=\"45%\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[Christian V of Denmark|Christian]]||15 April 1646||25 August 1699||succeeded as King of Denmark<br>married, 1667, [[Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Cassel]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Princess Anna Sophie of Denmark|Anna Sophia]]||1 September 1647||1 July 1717||married, 1666, [[John George III, Elector of Saxony]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark|Frederika Amalia]]||11 April 1649||30 October 1704||married, 1667, [[Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Princess Wilhelmina Ernestine of Denmark|Wilhelmina Ernestina]]||21 June 1650||22 April 1706||married, 1671, [[Charles II, Elector Palatine]]; no issue\n|-\n|Frederick||11 October 1651||14 March 1652||died in infancy\n|-\n|[[Prince George of Denmark|George]]||2 April 1653||28 October 1708||married, 1683, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark|Ulrika Eleonora]]||11 September 1656||26 October 1693||married, 1680, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI, King of Sweden]]; had issue\n|-\n|Dorothea||16 November 1657||15 May 1658||died in infancy\n|}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* {{in lang|da}} [http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0171.html Article in the Dansk biografisk Lexikon]\n* {{in lang|da}} [http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1349/origin/170/ Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon]\n \n{{Commons category|Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg}}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

She is known for her political influence, as well as for her cultural impact: she acted as the adviser of Frederick III, and introduced ballet and opera to Denmark. <ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\">''[https://archive.org/stream/danskedronnigerf00jorg/danskedronnigerf00jorg_djvu.txt     Danske dronniger; fortaellinger og karakteristikker af Ellen Jorgensen og Johanne Skovgaard]'', Kobenhavn H. Hagerup, 1910</ref>   \n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life ===\n\nSophie Amalie was born at the [[Herzberg Castle]], in [[Herzberg am Harz]].  Her parents were [[George, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] and [[Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt]].  Nothing is known of her childhood. \n\nSophie Amalie married Prince Frederick in Castle [[Gl\u00fccksburg]] on 1 October 1643. The marriage was arranged in 1640, as it was considered suitable for the current situation of the groom: he was, at that point, archbishop of Bremen and not heir to the throne, and was not expected to succeed to the throne.   It is believed to be a political match, though the exact purpose of it is unknown.  They had 8 children, including King [[Christian V of Denmark]] and [[Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark]] who married King [[Charles XI of Sweden]]. \n\nThe couple settled in Bremen.  In 1646\u201347, they lived in humble circumstances in [[Flensborg]], after having been forced to flee Bremen during the war between Denmark and Sweden.   In 1647, Frederick was elected heir to the Danish throne, and the following year, she followed him to Denmark. \n\n===Queen ===\n[[File:Sophie amalieof brunswick queen of denmark.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Portrait of Sophie Amalie as queen by an unidentified artist, c. 17th century]]\n\nIn 1648, Frederick and Sophie Amalie became king and queen of Denmark and Norway. \n\nAs her husband was introverted, she became the centre of a sumptuous court life, with exclusive luxury items and grand parties, which shed glory on the royal power.    Queen Sophie Amalie made a pioneer cultural act in relation to the court parties by replacing the old medieval court entertainments with opera and ballet, which was thus introduced in Denmark by her at the court festivities.   She enjoyed fashion, parties and theatre, arranged [[Masquerade ball|masquerades]] and made the French taste fashionable in Denmark.     She remodeled the court after a French and German pattern.   In 1649, a large order of items arrived for the new court life she arranged, followed also by new staff and new positions.  She hired a German chapel master, Kaspar F\u00f6rster, a French violin orchestra, a French ballet master, D. de Pilloy, and a French court singer and dancer, [[Anne Chabanceau de La Barre]], and a French theatre company was engaged to perform French theater.   Sophie Amalie did not understand the Danish language, but spoke German and French, took lessons in singing and dancing by instructors from France and Italy, was dressed by French maids in French fashion, conversed with her children in French and had a French chaplain, and as the first queen of Denmark took a French motto: \u201eEn Dieu mon esp\u00e9rance\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    Ballet, masquerades and theatre performances were performed, and she and her children participated in ballets and amateur theatre with the nobility; in 1655, she performed five different parts in a ballet at the same occasion.  She was interested in literature and composed a library of French, German and Italian writers.   She was noted to have great disputes with her Catholic brother John Frederick, in which her husband was called to participate in the debate.\n\nSophie Amalie was described as a charming beauty with entertaining wit and artistic taste, also in private correspondence not intended for her to see.  A Swedish guest described her as \"a lovely young person\" and a Frenchman described her in 1649: \"This princess was tall, blonde, with a very attractive complexion, mild and very accommodating toward strangers; she had a great taste for France, and she had everything it could give her.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   [[Sophia of Hanover]] was impressed by her and said of her that \"her goodness and great accomplishments won over all hearts to her\", while the French envoy noted that the queen's considerable charm was in fact reserved for those \"which belongs to her party or are of use to her interests.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   The Spanish envoy [[Bernardino de Rebolledo]] dedicated sonnets to her in which he described her as a [[seraph]].  \n\n[[File:Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg by Wolfgang Heimbach.jpg|thumb|180px|Sophie Amalie dressed in theatrical garb, as part of the theatre of court by Heimbach]]\n\nSophie Amalie was described as playful and enjoyed to disguise herself.  When the abdicated queen [[Christina of Sweden]] was travelling through Denmark toward Germany incognito after her abdication, queen Sophie Amalie, who was at that time staying in [[Kolding]], disguised herself as a maid and traveled to the inn at [[Haderslev]] to observe Christina while dining with her retinue, and then left without having introduced herself;<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  on another occasion, she made a similar anonymous visit to [[Hamburg]] and back disguised as a maid, despite the fact that Denmark was at that time at war with Hamburg.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/> She enjoyed hunting, particularly at her ''[[Jagdschloss]]'' of [[H\u00f8rsholm]], would hunt in any weather, once killed thirty [[deer]] in one day, and was for her success as a huntress compared to the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].  \n\nQueen Sophie Amalie is known as the hostess and central figure of the many grand representational parties that dominated Danish court life during her husband's reign.  The Spanish envoy Rebolledo described her in this role at a party which was hosted in the honor of the queen's brother John Frederick at [[J\u00e6gersborg]] in 1655.   After a deer hunt, where the royal couple participated similarly dressed in red and where \"the queen conquered her skill to satisfy her generosity\" by, as a good hostess, allowing the guests to win over her, a ball followed in which \"the queen danced all night with such a smiling distance and such a majestic dignity, that she attracted the attention and appreciation of all\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     She participated in the amateur theater and ballet at court and, in one famous occasion, performed five roles in the same ballet: as [[Pheme|Fama]], a maid, the [[Muse]] of war - \"in which she danced while waving a banner to the music with such superior rhythm, that she seemed to exceed herself\" - a Spanish lady and an [[Amazons|Amazon]]; a performance during which the king asked the Spanish envoy Rebolledo of his opinion and was given the reply \"happy is a nation with such a king, and happy is the king with such a queen.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/> \n  \nThe grand court parties where a part of a representation of royal power deemed necessary to enhance the status of the crown and attract followers among the nobility in the royal couple's goal to strengthen royal power, particularly among the German nobility, which where inducted in to the Danish nobility by the protection of the queen despite Danish opposition.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    The parties where however criticized by the royal council as provocative during the depression of the 1650s, when Denmark suffered from bad finances, and it was pointed out that the king, in order to please the queen, had spent April 1654 to June 1655 in [[Flensborg Castle]], where party followed party \"in an unbroken chain\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \n\nSophie Amalie is credited with a great cultural impact in Denmark, breaking with the old Lutheran religious atmosphere and introducing a new court life influenced by a more general secular European art and pleasure culture, which as a role model also came to effect culture in the rest of Danish society.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>\n\n===Political Influence===\n\nQueen Sophie Amalie was described as ambitious and was well known to participate in state affairs, with the blessing of her husband, and influence policy as his adviser.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     Her great influence upon her husband was widely known already before he became king: before Frederick had succeeded to the throne, a satire circulated in which this was caricatured in the form of a mock question: \"Can a husband make any decisions whatever without the consent of his wife? Signed Duke Frederick.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \nHer influence is contributed to the fact that she attracted her husband as well as was in possession of a willpower and energy exceeding his, as well as to the fact that they had the same political goals: \"With her vivacious nature she understood how to attract her husband, with her greater decisiveness and more fiery temperament she energized his more careful nature to action, and above all she was given power, because she wanted it with all her flaming soul.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     \n\nThe three main political goals of Sophia Amalie and Frederick III where to defeat the power of the nobility, symbolized by the ''Svogerpartiet'' (Son-in-law's Party); to defeat the Swedes; and to expand royal power in to absolutism, to which the queen gathered followers through her court festivities and by creating a net of contacts by handing out favors.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/> \n\n[[File:Hera og Zeus p\u00e5 Olympen (Wuchters).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Sophie Amalie as the goddess [[Hera]].]]\n\nQueen Sophie Amalie was from the start of her husband's reign famously involved in the power struggle between the crown and the high nobility, symbolized by  the so called ''[[Svogerpartiet]]'' ('Son's-in-law Party'), composed by six noblemen married to daughters of her father-in-law from his second morganatic marriage with [[Kirsten Munk]], among which [[Corfitz Ulfeldt]], married to [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]], was the leading member.  Upon her husband's accession she became the first queen in over 30 years, and she could never stand the half sisters of her spouse, who had fulfilled the position of [[first lady]] during their father's reign.   This conflict begun already during the celebration dinner of the king's accession to the throne in Copenhagen Castle 6 July 1648 with an incident Sophie Amalie and Leonora Christine: the queen being unusually quite, Leonora Christine criticized her for her silence, after which the queen participated in conversation, but notably fell silent every time Leonora Christine joined in.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    By 1651, the ''Svogerpartiet'', was crushed, its members disperse, the Ulfeldt couple left for Sweden and their property was confiscated.     \n \nSophie Amalie is thought to have initiated the war against Sweden in 1657.   After the peace with Sweden in 1658, she presided over the celebration of the [[Peace of Roskilde]] when the Swedish king Charles X Gustav was received at [[Frederiksborg Palace]], during which she entertained with \u201eavec beaucoup d'\u00e9clat\" and conversed about the crossing of the B\u00e4lt by the Swedish army.   When the Swedish king pointed at [[Erik Dahlberg]] and stated that he had been the commander, Frederick III greeted Dahlberg by allowing him to kiss his hand, while the queen for a moment, according to Dahlberg, had an expression which stated her feelings toward him as \"not all which was good\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \nThe act for which queen Sophie Amalie is most famous was her behavior during the [[Siege of Copenhagen]] in 1658, during which \"Sophie Amalie was given the opportunity to show all the strength and decisiveness of her nature, now unleashed for a more noble purpose than a hunt or the most exiting adventure trip\".<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \nShe is believed to have exerted great influence upon the king, normally often passive and uncertain, in their mutual steadfastness never to surrender, and their act reportedly strengthened civilian morale considerably and earned them widespread popularity.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    During the Siege, the king showed himself on horse in the weak spots of the city both in night and day, accompanied by the queen, also on horseback, to strengthen public morale.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   The position of the queen was illustrated by the fact that military commands where known to give their messages to her when they could not find the king, and at one such incident, it was mentioned that she was positioned in the highest tower of [[Copenhagen Castle]], looking toward the Swedish troops.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    During the war with Sweden in 1658, she sent her own agent Lorents Tuxen to commit sabotage behind the Swedish lines.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\n[[File:Portr\u00e4tt, Frederik III och Sofia Amalia - Skoklosters slott - 85014.tif|thumb|280px|Frederik III and Sophie Amalie]]\n\nSophie Amalie probably took part in the decision to introduce the absolute monarchy by the [[1660 state of emergency in Denmark]].   This happened while the popularity of the royal couple was at its highest after the Swedish siege of [[Copenhagen]] in 1658\u201360.   She was very popular at that point for her moral support during the siege.   \nDuring the Assembly of the Estates and the [[1660 state of emergency in Denmark]], which eventually resulted in the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark, the queen was likely one of the most important participants as the adviser of the king, but it is difficult to determine her concrete actions.  \nIt was reportedly Sophie Amalie, who on 10 October 1660 convinced Frederick III to go through with the plans to introduce absolutism by force in a difficult moment when the estates had refused to agree to introduce it.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    \nThe queen was however not involved in the creation of the ''Kongeloven'' (Lex Regia), the \u201cconstitution\u201d of Danish absolute monarchy, and [[Christoffer Gabel]] had difficulty to persuade the king to introduce it because the king feared that she would be displeased with the regulations concerning queen dowagers, and stalled introducing it by saying: \"Let me be able to keep the peace with the queen.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\nAfter the introduction of the ''Kongeloven'' in 1665, the queen's position was undermined by [[Christoffer Gabel]], who replaced her as the kings chief adviser. \nShe was notably no included as regent in the event of her son succeeding to the throne while still a minor.   The reason why her spouse no longer relied so much upon her advice in the latter part of his reign, was likely the instability in foreign policy caused by her indecisiveness as to whether her goals to reconquer the Southern Provinces from Sweden would benefit most from an alliance with France or with the Holy Roman Empire.   Another cause was her favoritism of her younger son, and her ambition to secure marriages of the highest status possible for her daughters regardless of political benefit for Denmark; one example of such was arranging for Ulrika Eleonora to marry Charles XI and become Queen of Sweden despite the fact that Sweden was Denmark's enemy.  \n\nAfter the introduction of absolutism, the queen increasingly attracted attention for her protection of favorites and her persecution of those she disliked.  It was said that \"The queen is not always good toward those, who devote themselves to the king, without being dependent upon others\"; that she wished to be  \"sought and honored\", and by handing out favors she gathered followers to a queen's party who owed their loyalty to her personally, and who eventually also gained influence over her.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     One of her protegees was Jakob Petersen, officially only a chamber servant of the king, who was given much favor by the queen and described as her \"most confidant tool\" until he was suddenly exiled by the king in 1664 for the unspecific accusation of being involved in \"many intrigues\"; after the king's death, Sophie Amalie had all accusations against him dropped.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  Her most favored lady-in-waiting was [[Abel Cathrine]].   Of the persecutions, the most known victims are Kai Lykke and Leonora Christine.   In 1662, the nobleman [[Kai Lykke]] was forced to flee and had his property in Denmark confiscated after he was discovered to have written in a private letter ti his mistress that the queen had sex with her lackeys; his was not allowed back to Denmark until after Sophie Amalie's death. <ref>Dansk Biografisk Leksikon </ref>   In 1663, she famously had [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]] imprisoned in the ''[[Bl\u00e5t\u00e5rn]]'', and refused to release her as long as she herself was still alive.  \n\nWhile her artistic taste was French, her political views where German-oriented and her influenced was feared, especially among the nobility.  A characteristic remark was made by nobleman Henrik Bjelke from the first Swedish war: \"The king is good, but God save us with honor from here! The queen is not good by any Dane, and she has the king in her power.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    Also the foreign ambassadors noted the queen's influence over the king and government.  Baron [[Ludvig Holberg]] said about her that she had \"the capacity of a statesman\" and \"the heart of a soldier\" but also that she was \"more admired than loved\" and that she went too far in her hatred toward [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt|Leonora Christina]].<ref>Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon</ref>\n\n===Queen Dowager===\n\nIn 1670, Frederick III died and was succeeded by her eldest son Christian V.  Her son the king did what he could to curb her influence in state affairs, which was evidently not easy: in 1671, he wrote to Griffenfeld: \"God be praised, the queen dowager has left for Hirsholm today, so I need no longer hear: 'What do I hear now?'\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    \n\n[[File:Sophie Amalienborg (1740 painting).jpg|thumb|Sophie Amalienborg]]\n\nDespite her son's dislike over her interference, she remained a factor which was taken into consideration in Danish politics, and Griffenfeld was careful to keep in her good graces.   It is noted that Griffenfeld assisted her in her ambition to have her younger son Georg elected king of Poland.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    Griffenfeld and Sophie Amalie also worked in securing peace with Sweden during the Scanian War, as Sophie Amalie wished for peace with Sweden and its ally France because her favorite Catholic brother was Francophile and because she wished for her daughter Ulrika Eleonora to marry the Swedish king.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     The fall of Griffenfeld was therefore a great misfortune for Sophie Amalie and her political position, and it attracted great attention when the queen dowager demonstratively left the capital after the sudden arrest of Griffenfeld.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>     His later pardon is credited with her influence.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    The Peace of 1680 was a great joy for her, as it resulted in the desired wedding between her daughter and the Swedish king.  She accompanied Ulrika Eleonora to Kronborg, but it was noted how she could not make herself to show her daughter the ceremony due to her future rank as queen.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\nHer relationship to her daughter-in-law Charlotte Amalie was not a good one.  Sophie Amalie was reportedly most unwilling to surrender her position as queen and her precedence as the first lady of the court to her daughter-in-law, and was only with great difficulty made to vacate the queen's apartment to her successor.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \nHer daughter-in-law was however not willing to give up her rank, and the precedence conflict between the queen and the queen dowager was prolonged for years: reportedly, the queen dowager demanded that the foreign ambassadors call to be introduced to her first rather than the queen, otherwise she would have them barred form her court, a situation which created such difficulty that the king sometimes solved the matter by leaving for another palace with his wife so that the queen and the queen dowager would not be present at the same time and thus the rank conflict avoided.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    \n\nSophie Amalie is known to have assured the continuing imprisonment of Leonora Christine also as a widow.  Upon the accession of Christian V, his wife Charlotte Amalie successfully asked him a promise to release Leonora Christine if the expected child was a son, and when she did give birth to a son in 1671, she called in the promise.  When Sophie Amalie was informed, however, she managed to have the king retract his promise by refusing to attend the christening of the crown prince.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    When Leonora Christine's daughter Ellen Kristine petitioned her for her mother's release, Sophie Amalie successfully asked her son the king to banish Ellen Kristine from the nation.<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>   \n\nAs queen dowager, Sophie Amalie continued to host a grand court life with many festivities, as she had done as queen.  She lived in [[Sophie Amalienborg]] in Copenhagen in the winters and at Nyk\u00f8bing Slot or H\u00f8rsholm during the summers.  Sophie of Hanover visited her in 1680 and said of her: \"If I should praise this queen as she deserved, I would never be finished.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>    She still hosted hunting trips and balls and was described as an avid hunter, and attended masquerade balls at court in costume until her death.  When the wedding of her daughter Ulrika Eleonora to the Swedish king was arranged, she welcomed the Swedish envoy [[Johan Gyllenstierna]], who was a known misogynist, with a great banquet, and reportedly, when he entered her palace, there was \"no man there, only women and the fairest you could imagine. As a wise man he soon realized that it was deliberately, as he was unmarried, and the rumour had it, that he could abide no female.\"<ref name=\"Jorgensen, Ellen & Skovgaard, Johanne\"/>  \n\nShe died in [[Copenhagen]] and was buried in the [[Roskilde Cathedral]].  After her death, [[Leonora Christina Ulfeldt]] was finally released, after twenty-two years of imprisonment.\n\n==Issue==\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- bgcolor=cccccc\n!width=\"20%\"|Name!! width=\"15%\"|Birth!! width=\"15%\"|Death!! width=\"45%\"|Notes\n|-\n|[[Christian V of Denmark|Christian]]||15 April 1646||25 August 1699||succeeded as King of Denmark<br>married, 1667, [[Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Cassel]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Princess Anna Sophie of Denmark|Anna Sophia]]||1 September 1647||1 July 1717||married, 1666, [[John George III, Elector of Saxony]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Princess Frederica Amalia of Denmark|Frederika Amalia]]||11 April 1649||30 October 1704||married, 1667, [[Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Princess Wilhelmina Ernestine of Denmark|Wilhelmina Ernestina]]||21 June 1650||22 April 1706||married, 1671, [[Charles II, Elector Palatine]]; no issue\n|-\n|Frederick||11 October 1651||14 March 1652||died in infancy\n|-\n|[[Prince George of Denmark|George]]||2 April 1653||28 October 1708||married, 1683, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]]; had issue\n|-\n|[[Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark|Ulrika Eleonora]]||11 September 1656||26 October 1693||married, 1680, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI, King of Sweden]]; had issue\n|-\n|Dorothea||16 November 1657||15 May 1658||died in infancy\n|}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* {{in lang|da}} [http://runeberg.org/dbl/16/0171.html Article in the Dansk biografisk Lexikon]\n* {{in lang|da}} [http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/1349/origin/170/ Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon]\n \n{{Commons category|Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg}}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

On the death of her partner, a wife is referred to as a [[widow]], but not after she is divorced from her partner. kefe ufa means alot.\n\nThe rights and obligations of a wife in relation to her partner and her status in the community and in law vary between cultures and have varied over time.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Image:Wedding and Engagement Rings 2151px.jpg|thumbnail|A [[white gold]] [[wedding ring]] and a single-[[diamond]], [[gold]]-banded engagement ring. In many cultures, wives show their marital status through various symbols.]]\nThe word is of Germanic origin, from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''w\u012bbam'', \"woman\". In [[Middle English]] it had the form ''wif'', and in Old English ''w\u012bf'', \"[[woman]] or wife\". It is related to Modern [[German language|German]] ''Weib'' (woman, female),<ref>[http://gaer27.uni-trier.de/CLL/Frouwe/weib.html Etymology of \"Weib\"] (broken link to a uni personal account)</ref> and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''viv'' (wife, usually poetic) and may derive ultimately from the Indo-European root ''ghw\u012bbh-'' \"shame; pudenda\" (cf. [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] B ''kw\u012bpe'' and Tocharian A ''kip'', each meaning \"female pudenda\", with clear sexual overtones).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IHbQgz1nZYC&dq=american+heritage+indo-european+roots&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=kqRjTOfLCIbvcMyjxJYF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false Watkins, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', p. 32.]</ref> The original meaning of the phrase \"wife\" as simply \"woman\", unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife, is preserved in words such as \"[[midwife]]\" and \"[[fishmonger|fishwife]]\".\n\nIn many cultures, marriage is generally expected that a woman will take her husband's [[surname]], though that is not universal. A married woman may indicate her [[marital status]] in a number of ways: in [[Western culture]] a married woman would commonly wear a [[wedding ring]] but in other cultures other [[Visual markers of marital status|markers of marital status]] may be used. A married woman is commonly given the [[honorific]] title \"[[Mrs]]\", but some married women prefer to be referred to as \"[[Ms.|Ms]]\", a title which is also used when the marital status of a woman is unknown.\n\n==Related terminology==\n[[File:Bride at Nikah.jpg|thumb|A young bride at her [[Nikah]].]]\nA woman on her wedding day is usually described as a ''[[bride]]'', even after the ''[[wedding]] ceremony'', while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon. If she is marrying a man, her partner is known as the ''[[groom|bridegroom]]'' during the wedding, and within the marriage is called her ''[[husband]]''.\n\nIn the older custom, still followed, e. g., by Roman Catholic ritual<!-- and elsewhere !-->, the word ''bride'' actually means [[fianc\u00e9e]] and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent (the actual marriage act); from then on, even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing, the woman is a wife, and no longer a bride, and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple.\n\n\"Wife\" refers to the institutionalized relation ''to the other spouse'', unlike [[mother]], a term that puts a woman into the context of her children. In some societies, especially historically, a ''[[concubine]]'' was a woman who was in an ongoing, usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her, often because of a difference in social status.\n\nThe term ''wife'' is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law (including [[religious law]]), not to a woman in an informal [[cohabitation]] relationship, which may be known as a girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant other, [[concubine]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] etc. However, a woman in a so-called [[common law marriage]] may describe herself as a common law wife, de facto wife, or simply a wife. Those seeking to advance [[gender neutrality]] may refer to both marriage partners as \"spouses\", and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing \"wife\" and \"husband\" with \"spouse\". A former wife whose spouse is deceased is a ''[[widow]]''.\n\n==Termination of the status of a wife==\nThe status of a wife may be terminated by [[divorce]], [[annulment]], or the [[death]] of a spouse. In the case of divorce, terminology such as ''former-wife'' or ''ex-wife'' is often used. With regard to annulment, such terms are not, strictly speaking, correct, because annulment, unlike divorce, is usually [[ex post facto law|retroactive]], meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place. In the case of the death of the other spouse, the term used is [[widow]]. The social status of such women varies by culture, but in some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as [[widow inheritance]] or [[levirate marriage]]; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26356373|title=India's invisible widows, divorcees and single women|work=BBC News}}</ref> In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless, as in the case of those cultures that practiced [[Sati (practice)|sati]], a [[funeral]] ritual within some [[Asia]]n communities, in which a recently widowed woman [[Self-immolation|committed suicide by fire]], typically on the husband's [[funeral pyre]].\n\n==Legal rights of the wife==\n{{Further|Coverture|Marital power}}\nThe legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century, and still are, in many jurisdictions subject to debate. This subject was in particular addressed by [[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869). Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,<ref>In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254</ref> Greece,<ref>In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie.

The purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically. In some cultures, it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family; but during the marriage, the dowry was often made [[inalienable right|inalienable]] by the husband.<ref>Britannica 2005, ''dowry''</ref> Today, dowries continue to be expected in parts of [[South Asia]] such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as [[dowry deaths]] and [[bride burning]].\n\n==Changing of name upon marriage==\n{{Main|Maiden and married names}}\nIn some cultures, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[Western world|West]], wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married.

The Holy New Testament condemns divorce for both men and women (1 Cor 7:10\u201311), and assumes [[monogamy]] on the part of the husband: the wife is to have her \"own\" husband, and the husband is to have his \"own\" wife (1 Cor 7:2). In the medieval period, this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives. As a result, divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern West, particularly in the medieval and [[early modern period]], and husbands in the Roman, later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife.  \n\nIn pre-modern times, it was unusual to marry for love alone,<ref>William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650\u20131800 Athens (Georgia), 1993</ref> although it became an ideal in literature by the early modern period.<ref>Frances Burney, Evelina, Lowndes 1778, and Seeber, English Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, Weimar 1999</ref> In the 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.<ref>John Noonan, \"The Power to Choose\" '' Viator'' 4 (1973) 419\u201334.</ref> Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents' approval.<ref>J.

Most influential in the pre-modern West was the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], except in English-speaking countries where English [[common law]] emerged in the High Middle Ages. In addition, local customary law influenced wives' property rights; as a result wives' property rights in the pre-modern West varied widely from region to region. Because wives' property rights and daughters' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems, the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly. Under the English common law system, which dates to the later medieval period, daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced. Under English common law, there was a system where a wife with a living husband (\"feme couvert\") could own little property in her own name.<ref>Elizabeth M. Craik, Marriage and property, Aberdeen 1984</ref> Unable to easily support herself, marriage was very important to most women's economic status. This problem has been dealt with extensively in literature, where the most important reason for women's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females.<ref>In the 18th and 19th centuries, which contained much criticism of these facts, see also [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[A Vindication of the Rights of Women]], [[Boston]] 1792</ref> The situation was assessed by the English conservative moralist Sir [[William Blackstone]]: \"The husband and wife are one, and the husband is the one.\"<ref>William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England</ref> Married women's property rights in the English-speaking world improved with the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] and similar legal changes, which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names.

Decisions are ideally made in mutual consent. A wife usually takes care of anything inside her household, including the family's health, the children's education, a parent's needs.\n\nThe majority of Hindu marriages in rural and traditional India are arranged marriages. Once they find a suitable family (family of same caste, culture and financial status), the boy and the girl see and talk to each other to decide the final outcome. In recent times however the western culture has had significant influence and the new generations are more open to the idea of marrying for love.\n\nIndian law has recognized  rape, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse of a woman by her husband as crimes. \nIn [[Hinduism]], a wife is known as a ''Patni'' or ''Ardhangini'' (similar to \"the better half\") meaning a part of the husband or his family. In Hinduism, a woman or man can get married, but only have one husband or wife respectively.\n\nIn India, women may wear vermillion powder on their foreheads, an ornament called Mangalsutra ({{lang-hi|\u092e\u0902\u0917\u0932\u0938\u0942\u0924\u094d\u0930}}) which is a form of necklace, or rings on their toes (which are not worn by single women) to show their status as married women.\n\n====Buddhism and Chinese folk religions====\n[[China]]'s family laws were changed by the [[Communist]] revolution; and in 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]] enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.<ref>Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''</ref>\n\n====Japan====\nIn [[Japan]], before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''</ref> See [[Women in Japan]], [[Law of Japan]]\n==Wife in Abrahamic religions== \n\n===Wife in Christianity===\nChristian marriage is to be between one woman (adult female) and one man (adult male) and that God Himself joined them and that no human is to separate them, according to Christ (Matthew 19:4-6). The Holy New Testament states that an unmarried Christian woman is to celibate or is to become the Christian wife of one husband to avoid sexual immorality and for sexual passion (1 Cor 7:1-2 & 8-9). Holy New Testament permits divorce of a Christian wife by a Christian husband only if she has committed adultery (Matthew 5:32). The Holy New Testament allows a Christian widow to (re)marry a man she chooses (1 Cor 7:39) but forbids a divorced Christian woman to (re)marry a man because she would be committing adultery if she did (Matthew 5:32), she is to remain unmarried and celibate or be reconciled with her husband (1 Cor 7:1-2 & 8-9 and 1 Cor 7:10-11). A Christian wife can divorce a non-Christian husband if he wants a divorce (1 Cor 7:12-16). Christian husbands are to love their Christian wives as Christ loved the Church (Ephesians 5:25) and as he loves himself (Ephesian 5:33). The Christian wife is to respect her husband (Ephesians 5:33). Christian husbands are to not be harsh with their Christian wives (Colossians 3:19) and to treat them as a delicate vessel and with honor (1 Peter 3:7).\n\n===Wife in Islam===\n[[Women in Islam]] have a range of rights and obligations (see main article [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam]]). Marriage takes place on the basis of a [[Islamic marriage contract|marriage contract]]. The [[arranged marriage]] is relatively common in traditionalist families, whether in Muslim countries or as first or second generation immigrants elsewhere.\n\nWomen in general are supposed to wear specific clothes, as stated by the [[hadith]], like the [[hijab]], which may take different styles depending on the culture of the country, where traditions may seep in.{{Quran-usc|24|31}}{{Quran-usc|33|59}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|title=Clothes|accessdate=2 May 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085957/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> The husband must pay a ''[[mahr]]'' to the bride.<ref>[[Qur'an]] verse 4;4</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the wife in Islam is seen as a protected, chaste person that manages the household and the family.

In Islam, it is highly recommended that the wife remains at home although they are fully able to own property or work. The husband is obligated to spend on the wife for all of her needs while she is not obligated to spend even if she is wealthy. [[Muhammad]] is said to have commanded all Muslim men to treat their wives well.

A breach of this expectation of [[fidelity]] is commonly referred to as [[adultery]] or [[extramarital sex]]. Historically, adultery has been considered to be a serious [[offense (law)|offense]], sometimes a [[crime]], and a [[sin]]. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly as a ground for a [[divorce]]. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a [[property settlement]], it may affect the status of children, the [[custody of children]]; moreover, adultery can result in social [[ostracism]] in some parts of the world. \nIn addition, [[Affinity (canon law)|affinity]] rules of Catholicism, of Judaism and of Islam prohibit an ex-wife or widow from engaging in sexual relations with and from marrying a number of relatives of the former husband.\n\nIn parts of the world, adultery may result in violent acts, such as [[honor killings]] or [[stoning]].

In many cultures, wives show their marital status through various symbols.]]\nThe word is of Germanic origin, from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''w\u012bbam'', \"woman\". In [[Middle English]] it had the form ''wif'', and in Old English ''w\u012bf'', \"[[woman]] or wife\". It is related to Modern [[German language|German]] ''Weib'' (woman, female),<ref>[http://gaer27.uni-trier.de/CLL/Frouwe/weib.html Etymology of \"Weib\"] (broken link to a uni personal account)</ref> and [[Danish language|Danish]] ''viv'' (wife, usually poetic) and may derive ultimately from the Indo-European root ''ghw\u012bbh-'' \"shame; pudenda\" (cf. [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] B ''kw\u012bpe'' and Tocharian A ''kip'', each meaning \"female pudenda\", with clear sexual overtones).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4IHbQgz1nZYC&dq=american+heritage+indo-european+roots&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=kqRjTOfLCIbvcMyjxJYF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false Watkins, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', p. 32.]</ref> The original meaning of the phrase \"wife\" as simply \"woman\", unconnected with marriage or a husband/wife, is preserved in words such as \"[[midwife]]\" and \"[[fishmonger|fishwife]]\".\n\nIn many cultures, marriage is generally expected that a woman will take her husband's [[surname]], though that is not universal. A married woman may indicate her [[marital status]] in a number of ways: in [[Western culture]] a married woman would commonly wear a [[wedding ring]] but in other cultures other [[Visual markers of marital status|markers of marital status]] may be used. A married woman is commonly given the [[honorific]] title \"[[Mrs]]\", but some married women prefer to be referred to as \"[[Ms.|Ms]]\", a title which is also used when the marital status of a woman is unknown.\n\n==Related terminology==\n[[File:Bride at Nikah.jpg|thumb|A young bride at her [[Nikah]].]]\nA woman on her wedding day is usually described as a ''[[bride]]'', even after the ''[[wedding]] ceremony'', while being described as a wife is also appropriate after the wedding or after the honeymoon. If she is marrying a man, her partner is known as the ''[[groom|bridegroom]]'' during the wedding, and within the marriage is called her ''[[husband]]''.\n\nIn the older custom, still followed, e. g., by Roman Catholic ritual<!-- and elsewhere !-->, the word ''bride'' actually means [[fianc\u00e9e]] and applies up to the exchange of matrimonial consent (the actual marriage act); from then on, even while the rest of the very ceremony is ongoing, the woman is a wife, and no longer a bride, and the bridal couple is no longer referred to as such but as the newlywed couple.\n\n\"Wife\" refers to the institutionalized relation ''to the other spouse'', unlike [[mother]], a term that puts a woman into the context of her children. In some societies, especially historically, a ''[[concubine]]'' was a woman who was in an ongoing, usually matrimonially oriented relationship with a man who could not be married to her, often because of a difference in social status.\n\nThe term ''wife'' is most commonly applied to a woman in a union sanctioned by law (including [[religious law]]), not to a woman in an informal [[cohabitation]] relationship, which may be known as a girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant other, [[concubine]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] etc. However, a woman in a so-called [[common law marriage]] may describe herself as a common law wife, de facto wife, or simply a wife. Those seeking to advance [[gender neutrality]] may refer to both marriage partners as \"spouses\", and many countries and societies are rewording their statute law by replacing \"wife\" and \"husband\" with \"spouse\". A former wife whose spouse is deceased is a ''[[widow]]''.\n\n==Termination of the status of a wife==\nThe status of a wife may be terminated by [[divorce]], [[annulment]], or the [[death]] of a spouse. In the case of divorce, terminology such as ''former-wife'' or ''ex-wife'' is often used. With regard to annulment, such terms are not, strictly speaking, correct, because annulment, unlike divorce, is usually [[ex post facto law|retroactive]], meaning that an annulled marriage is considered to be invalid from the beginning almost as if it had never taken place. In the case of the death of the other spouse, the term used is [[widow]]. The social status of such women varies by culture, but in some places, they may be subject to potentially harmful practices, such as [[widow inheritance]] or [[levirate marriage]]; or divorced women may be socially stigmatized.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26356373|title=India's invisible widows, divorcees and single women|work=BBC News}}</ref> In some cultures, the termination of the status of wife made life itself meaningless, as in the case of those cultures that practiced [[Sati (practice)|sati]], a [[funeral]] ritual within some [[Asia]]n communities, in which a recently widowed woman [[Self-immolation|committed suicide by fire]], typically on the husband's [[funeral pyre]].\n\n==Legal rights of the wife==\n{{Further|Coverture|Marital power}}\nThe legal rights of a wife have been since the 19th century, and still are, in many jurisdictions subject to debate. This subject was in particular addressed by [[John Stuart Mill]], in ''[[The Subjection of Women]]'' (1869). Historically, many societies have given sets of rights and obligations to husbands that have been very different from the sets of rights and obligations given to wives. In particular, the control of marital property, inheritance rights, and the right to dictate the activities of children of the marriage, have typically been given to male marital partners. However, this practice was curtailed to a great deal in many countries in the twentieth century, and more modern statutes tend to define the rights and duties of a spouse without reference to gender.  Among the last European countries to establish full [[gender equality]] in marriage were Switzerland,<ref>In 1985, a referendum guaranteed women legal equality with men within marriage.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17988450][http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html] The new reforms came into force in January 1988.''Women's movements of the world: an international directory and reference guide, edited by Sally Shreir'', p. 254</ref> Greece,<ref>In 1983, legislation was passed guaranteeing equality between spouses, abolishing [[dowry]], and ending legal discrimination against illegitimate children [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/around-the-world-greece-approves-family-law-changes.html#]''Demos, Vasilikie.

The purpose of the dowry varies by culture and has varied historically. In some cultures, it was paid not only to support the establishment of a new family, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, the dowry had to be returned to the wife or her family; but during the marriage, the dowry was often made [[inalienable right|inalienable]] by the husband.<ref>Britannica 2005, ''dowry''</ref> Today, dowries continue to be expected in parts of [[South Asia]] such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, and conflicts related to their payment sometimes result in violence such as [[dowry deaths]] and [[bride burning]].\n\n==Changing of name upon marriage==\n{{Main|Maiden and married names}}\nIn some cultures, particularly in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] [[Western world|West]], wives often change their surnames to that of the husband upon getting married.

The Holy New Testament condemns divorce for both men and women (1 Cor 7:10\u201311), and assumes [[monogamy]] on the part of the husband: the wife is to have her \"own\" husband, and the husband is to have his \"own\" wife (1 Cor 7:2). In the medieval period, this was understood to mean that a wife should not share a husband with other wives. As a result, divorce was relatively uncommon in the pre-modern West, particularly in the medieval and [[early modern period]], and husbands in the Roman, later medieval and early modern period did not publicly take more than one wife.  \n\nIn pre-modern times, it was unusual to marry for love alone,<ref>William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650\u20131800 Athens (Georgia), 1993</ref> although it became an ideal in literature by the early modern period.<ref>Frances Burney, Evelina, Lowndes 1778, and Seeber, English Literary History of the Eighteenth Century, Weimar 1999</ref> In the 12th century, the Roman Catholic Church drastically changed legal standards for marital consent by allowing daughters over 12 and sons over 14 to marry without their parents' approval, even if their marriage was made clandestinely.<ref>John Noonan, \"The Power to Choose\" '' Viator'' 4 (1973) 419\u201334.</ref> Parish studies have confirmed that late medieval women did sometimes marry against their parents' approval.<ref>J. Sheehan, \"The formation and stability of marriage in fourteenth century England\" ''Medieval Studies'' 33 (1971) 228\u201363.</ref> The Roman Catholic Church's policy of considering clandestine marriages and marriages made without parental consent to be valid was controversial, and in the 16th century both the French monarchy and the Lutheran church sought to end these practices, with limited success.<ref>Beatrice Gottlieb, ''The family in the Western World from the Black Death to the Industrial Age'' Oxford, 1993, pp. 55\u201356.</ref> \n\nThe Holy New Testament made no pronouncements about wives' property rights, which in practice were influenced more by secular laws than religion. Most influential in the pre-modern West was the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], except in English-speaking countries where English [[common law]] emerged in the High Middle Ages. In addition, local customary law influenced wives' property rights; as a result wives' property rights in the pre-modern West varied widely from region to region. Because wives' property rights and daughters' inheritance rights varied widely from region to region due to differing legal systems, the amount of property a wife might own varied greatly. Under the English common law system, which dates to the later medieval period, daughters and younger sons were usually excluded from landed property if no will was produced. Under English common law, there was a system where a wife with a living husband (\"feme couvert\") could own little property in her own name.<ref>Elizabeth M. Craik, Marriage and property, Aberdeen 1984</ref> Unable to easily support herself, marriage was very important to most women's economic status. This problem has been dealt with extensively in literature, where the most important reason for women's limited power was the denial of equal education and equal property rights for females.<ref>In the 18th and 19th centuries, which contained much criticism of these facts, see also [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[A Vindication of the Rights of Women]], [[Boston]] 1792</ref> The situation was assessed by the English conservative moralist Sir [[William Blackstone]]: \"The husband and wife are one, and the husband is the one.\"<ref>William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England</ref> Married women's property rights in the English-speaking world improved with the [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] and similar legal changes, which allowed wives with living husbands to own property in their own names.

An unmarried woman, a [[feme sole]], had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name.  As first demonstrated quantitatively by John Hajnal, in the 19th and early 20th centuries the percentage of non-clerical Western women who never married was typically as high as 10\u201315%, a prevalence of female celibacy never yet documented for any other major traditional civilization.<ref>John Hajnal, \"European marriage patterns in perspective\" in D.E. Glass and D.E.C. Eversley eds. ''Population in History'' London, 1965.</ref> In addition, early modern Western women married at quite high ages (typically mid to late 20s) relative to other major traditional cultures.

Decisions are ideally made in mutual consent. A wife usually takes care of anything inside her household, including the family's health, the children's education, a parent's needs.\n\nThe majority of Hindu marriages in rural and traditional India are arranged marriages. Once they find a suitable family (family of same caste, culture and financial status), the boy and the girl see and talk to each other to decide the final outcome. In recent times however the western culture has had significant influence and the new generations are more open to the idea of marrying for love.\n\nIndian law has recognized  rape, sexual, emotional or verbal abuse of a woman by her husband as crimes. \nIn [[Hinduism]], a wife is known as a ''Patni'' or ''Ardhangini'' (similar to \"the better half\") meaning a part of the husband or his family. In Hinduism, a woman or man can get married, but only have one husband or wife respectively.\n\nIn India, women may wear vermillion powder on their foreheads, an ornament called Mangalsutra ({{lang-hi|\u092e\u0902\u0917\u0932\u0938\u0942\u0924\u094d\u0930}}) which is a form of necklace, or rings on their toes (which are not worn by single women) to show their status as married women.\n\n====Buddhism and Chinese folk religions====\n[[China]]'s family laws were changed by the [[Communist]] revolution; and in 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]] enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.<ref>Britannica 2004, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''</ref>\n\n====Japan====\nIn [[Japan]], before enactment of the [[Meiji Constitution|Meiji]] Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Britannica, ''Legal limitations on marriage (from family law)''</ref> See [[Women in Japan]], [[Law of Japan]]\n==Wife in Abrahamic religions== \n\n===Wife in Christianity===\nChristian marriage is to be between one woman (adult female) and one man (adult male) and that God Himself joined them and that no human is to separate them, according to Christ (Matthew 19:4-6). The Holy New Testament states that an unmarried Christian woman is to celibate or is to become the Christian wife of one husband to avoid sexual immorality and for sexual passion (1 Cor 7:1-2 & 8-9). Holy New Testament permits divorce of a Christian wife by a Christian husband only if she has committed adultery (Matthew 5:32). The Holy New Testament allows a Christian widow to (re)marry a man she chooses (1 Cor 7:39) but forbids a divorced Christian woman to (re)marry a man because she would be committing adultery if she did (Matthew 5:32), she is to remain unmarried and celibate or be reconciled with her husband (1 Cor 7:1-2 & 8-9 and 1 Cor 7:10-11). A Christian wife can divorce a non-Christian husband if he wants a divorce (1 Cor 7:12-16). Christian husbands are to love their Christian wives as Christ loved the Church (Ephesians 5:25) and as he loves himself (Ephesian 5:33). The Christian wife is to respect her husband (Ephesians 5:33). Christian husbands are to not be harsh with their Christian wives (Colossians 3:19) and to treat them as a delicate vessel and with honor (1 Peter 3:7).\n\n===Wife in Islam===\n[[Women in Islam]] have a range of rights and obligations (see main article [[Rights and obligations of spouses in Islam]]). Marriage takes place on the basis of a [[Islamic marriage contract|marriage contract]]. The [[arranged marriage]] is relatively common in traditionalist families, whether in Muslim countries or as first or second generation immigrants elsewhere.\n\nWomen in general are supposed to wear specific clothes, as stated by the [[hadith]], like the [[hijab]], which may take different styles depending on the culture of the country, where traditions may seep in.{{Quran-usc|24|31}}{{Quran-usc|33|59}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|title=Clothes|accessdate=2 May 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085957/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novq12y1.html|archivedate=24 September 2015}}</ref> The husband must pay a ''[[mahr]]'' to the bride.<ref>[[Qur'an]] verse 4;4</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the wife in Islam is seen as a protected, chaste person that manages the household and the family.

In Islam, it is highly recommended that the wife remains at home although they are fully able to own property or work. The husband is obligated to spend on the wife for all of her needs while she is not obligated to spend even if she is wealthy. [[Muhammad]] is said to have commanded all Muslim men to treat their wives well.

The SVT-40 saw widespread service during and after [[World War II]]. It was intended to be the Soviet Red Army's new [[service rifle]], but its production was disrupted by [[Operation Barbarossa|the German invasion in 1941]], resulting in a change back to the older [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] bolt-action rifle for the duration of World War II. After the war, the Soviet Union adopted new rifles, such as the [[SKS]] and the [[AK-47]].\n\n== SVT-38 ==\n[[File:SVT-38 - Ryssland - AM.045576.jpg|thumb|left|SVT-38]]\n[[Fedor Tokarev]] created the basic design for the SVT rifle in the early 1930s. Tokarev gave up his previous experiments with recoil-operated self-loading rifles and pursued a gas-operating mechanism instead. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] had a great interest in semi-automatic infantry rifles, and the army held trials of automatic rifle designs in 1935. The winning rifle was designed by [[Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov]], and was accepted into service the next year as the ''[[AVS-36]]''. However, problems with the AVS quickly became apparent, and both Tokarev and Simonov submitted improved designs to further trials. This time, Tokarev's rifle was accepted for production, under the designation ''SVT-38'' with hopes that it would become the new standard issue rifle of the Red Army. Ambitious production plans anticipated two million rifles per year by 1942. Production began at [[Tula Arms Plant|Tula Arsenal]] in July 1939 (production at [[Izhmash]] began in late 1939).<ref name=\"nuggets\">[http://www.mosinnagant.net/USSR/svt401.asp The Red Army's Self Loading Rifles: A Brief History Of The Tokarev Rifles Models of 1938 and 1940. By Vic Thomas Of Michigan Historical Collectables]</ref>\n\nThe SVT-38 is a [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operated]] rifle with a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston above the barrel and a [[tilting bolt]].<ref name=\"MF\"/> This configuration gained wider acceptance later. There is some dispute about who exactly first developed this operating principle, as the SVT's mechanism (as implemented in 1935 competition prototype) closely resembles [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]]'s design of 1937; Saive eventually designed both the [[FN-49]] and [[FN FAL]], which use similar operating principles.\n\nSoviet small arms were usually of simple and robust construction, designed for use by poorly educated and sometimes poorly equipped soldiers. The SVT-38, in contrast, had been designed with weight-saving in mind, including its wood stock, receiver, and action. It was a gas-operated action with a gas-cylinder cup that was not readily accessible. It was complex by Soviet standards, and was not suited to handle corrosively-primed ammunition without frequent cleaning.<ref name=\"MF\"/>\n\nThe SVT-38 was equipped with a [[bayonet]] and a 10-round detachable [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]. The receiver was open-top, which enabled reloading of the magazine using five-round Mosin\u2013Nagant [[stripper clip]]s. Fairly advanced features for the time were the adjustable gas system, [[muzzle brake]], and [[telescopic sight]] rails milled into the receiver. The sniper variant had an additional locking notch for a see-through scope mount and was equipped with a 3.5\u00d7 [[PU scope|PU telescopic sight]]. This instrument was slightly shorter than the otherwise-similar PU scope used on the Mosin\u2013Nagant M1891/30 sniper rifle.\n\n==SVT-40 and its derivatives==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-198-1394-18A, Russland, Soldat mit russischem Gewehr.jpg|thumb|A German soldier firing a captured SVT-40]]\n[[File:1940 Tula SVT40.jpg|thumb|SVT-40]]\nThe SVT-38 saw its combat debut in the 1939\u20131940 [[Winter War]] with Finland. The initial reaction of the troops to this new rifle was negative. Among the criticisms were the rifle being too long and cumbersome, difficult to maintain and the magazine tending to fall out. Production of the SVT-38 was terminated in April 1940 after some 150,000 examples had been manufactured. An improved design, the ''SVT-40'', entered production. It was a more refined, lighter design incorporating a modified, folding, magazine release. The hand guard was now of one-piece construction and the cleaning rod was housed under the barrel. Other changes were made to simplify manufacturing. Production of the improved version began in July 1940 at Tula and later at factories in Izhevsk and Podolsk. Production of the Mosin\u2013Nagant M1891/30 bolt-action rifle continued and it remained the standard-issue rifle to Red Army troops, with the SVT-40 more often issued to non-commissioned officers and elite units like the naval infantry. Since these factories already had experience manufacturing the SVT-38, output increased quickly and an estimated 70,000 SVT-40s were produced in 1940.\n\nBy the time of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the USSR in June 1941, the SVT-40 was already in widespread use by the Red Army. In a Soviet infantry division's [[table of organization and equipment]], one-third of rifles were supposed to be SVTs, though in practice they seldom achieved this ratio. The first months of the war were disastrous for the Soviet Union; they lost hundreds of thousands of SVT-40s. To make up for this, production of the Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles was reintroduced. In contrast, the SVT was more difficult to manufacture, and troops with only rudimentary training had difficulty maintaining it. [[Submachine gun]]s like the [[PPSh-41]] had proven their value as simple, cheap and effective weapons to supplement infantry firepower. This led to a gradual decline in SVT production. In 1941, over one million SVTs were produced but in 1942 Ishevsk arsenal was ordered to cease SVT production and switch back to the Mosin\u2013Nagant 91/30. Only 264,000 SVTs were manufactured in 1942 and production continued to diminish until the order to cease production was finally given in January 1945. Total production of the SVT-38/40 was around 1,600,000 rifles, of which 51,710 were the SVT-40 sniper variant.<ref name=\"MF\"/><ref name = \"kehaya\"/><ref name = \"ezell\"/>\n\n[[File:1941 Tula SVT-40 in Original Sniper Configuration.jpg|thumb|A 1941 Tula SVT-40 in original sniper configuration]]\n\nSVTs frequently suffered from vertical shot dispersion; the army reported that the rifles were of \"flimsy construction and there were difficulties experienced in their repair and maintenance\".<ref>Small Arms of the World by W. H. B. Smith 9th Edition Revised by Joseph E. Smith 1969 p.&nbsp;583</ref> The stock, made of Arctic Birch, was prone to cracking in the wrist from recoil. This was generally remedied by drilling and inserting one or two large industrial bolts horizontally into the stock just before the wrist meets the receiver.<ref>[https://www.milsurps.com/showthread.php?t=63516&p=422787&viewfull=1#post422787 SVT-40 stock crack/bubba questions? - Post #5]</ref><ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaguns/comments/a50wnt/svt40_stock_repair_and_reinforcing_screw/ Svt-40 stock repair and reinforcing screw]</ref> Many rifles were also poorly seated in their stocks, letting the receiver shift on firing. This led to a field modification that selectively [[Rifle bedding|shimmed the stock]] with birch chips, usually around the receiver and in between where the wood stock meets the lower metal handguard.<ref>[https://forums.gunboards.com/showthread.php?362417-How-were-SVT-s-quot-bedded-quot How were SVT's \"bedded\"?]</ref> For a sniper rifle, this was unacceptable and production of the specialized sniper variant of the SVT was terminated in 1942.<ref name=\"MF\"/> Milling scope rails in the receivers of standard SVT rifles was also discontinued. Other production changes included a new, simpler muzzle brake design with two vents per-side instead of the six on the original.\n\n=== AVT-40 automatic rifle ===\nTo supplement the Red Army's shortage of [[machine gun]]s, an SVT version capable of full-automatic fire (designated the ''AVT-40'') was ordered into production on 20 May 1942; the first batches reached the troops in July.<ref name=\"Bolotin1995_111\"/> It was externally similar to the SVT, but its modified safety also acted as a fire selector allowing for both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire modes. When fired automatically the rifle had a rate of fire of approximately 750 RPM, faster than even the [[DP machine gun]] which fired the same cartridge at 550 RPM. To better resist the stress of automatic fire, the AVT featured a slightly stouter stock made of hardwood usually distinguished with a large \u201cA\u201d engraved in it; surplus AVT stocks were later used on refurbished SVTs. In service, the AVT proved a disappointment: automatic fire was largely uncontrollable, and the rifles often suffered breakages under the increased strain.(Documents discovered after the war indicated that during testing, under continuous Full Auto fire, an AVT-40's barrel would be \"shot out\", meaning the rifling in the barrel would be completely worn down, in as little as 200-250 rounds.) The use of the AVT's automatic fire mode was subsequently prohibited, and production of the rifle was relatively brief; none were made after the summer of 1943.<ref name=\"Bolotin1995_111\">{{cite book|first=David Naumovich |last=Bolotin |others=trans.

No physical examples have been found however, leading to the common assumption that it was a failure (much like the AVS-36's 15-round mag). Quite a few pictures have been observed of non-Soviets (namely Germans and Finns) using SVT-38s and 40s with what appear to be [[Bren]] or [[Lahti-Saloranta M/26|LS/26]] magazines. Very little is known about usage with the unsupported magazines (including their reliability and max capacity).\n\n==SVTs outside of the Soviet Union==\nThe first country outside the Soviet Union to employ the SVT was Finland, which captured some 2,700 SVT-38s during the [[Winter War]], and over 15,000 SVTs during the [[Continuation War]]. The SVT saw extensive use in Finnish hands.<ref name=\"Finland\">{{cite book|title=Finland at War 1939\u201345|series=Elite 141|first1=Philip |last1=Jowett|first2= Brent|last2= Snodgrass|date= 5 Jul 2006|isbn=9781841769691|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=48}}</ref> The Finns even attempted to make their own clone of the SVT-38 designated ''Tapako'', though only a prototype was ever conceived.<ref name=\"Jaeger\"/> The Finns would continue to experiment with producing their own SVT based rifles until the late 50s with the introduction of the [[RK-62]]. Germany captured hundreds of thousands of SVTs from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. As the Germans were short of self-loading rifles themselves, SVT-38 and 40s, designated respectively as '''Selbstladegewehr 258(r)''' and '''Selbstladegewehr 259(r)''' by the [[Wehrmacht]], saw widespread use in German hands against their former owners.

In Soviet service, firearms like the [[SKS]] and the [[AK-47]] as well as the later [[Dragunov sniper rifle|SVD]] made the SVT obsolete, and the rifle was generally out of service by 1955.{{cn|date=February 2019}} Only a few SVTs were exported to Soviet allies and clients.

In Russia, limited examples for civilian use have been sold as the \u041e\u0421\u041a-88 (OSK 88) and [[Molot]] KO-SVT with some variations in stock, barrel length and optics. The rifle's popularity is due to a combination of the inexpensive nature of its [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] ammunition, favorable [[aesthetics]], historical significance, and pleasant shooting characteristics.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nDespite its relatively brief service career, the SVT was a prolific rifle on the Eastern Front during World War II, and it had considerable impact on European battle rifle designs during and immediately after the war. The German [[Gewehr 43|G-43]] was influenced by the SVT in its design, as was Simonov's experimental carbine during the closing stages of the war (which would later become the [[SKS]]). The [[FN FAL]] and its ancestor [[FN Model 1949|FN-49]] employ the same locking mechanism and operating principle as the SVT, although as mentioned above, this is most likely coincidental. As a service rifle, the SVT had its problems, but so did contemporary semi-automatic rifles made by other countries. The main reason for the gradual downfall of SVT usage in combat was not its technical disadvantages; rather, the reason was that, with the immense, continual demand for rifles in the front lines, Soviet factories could produce other, simpler designs in far greater quantities in the same length of time it took to produce the SVT. In 1944 the Soviet Union adopted the [[7.62x39]] round used in the RPD Light Machinegun, SKS, and AK-47 Rifles. In 1945 the [[SKS]] was adopted which replaced the SVT-40 as the main infantry rifle, which itself was replaced by the AK-47 in 1948.\n\n==Users==\n* {{flag|Independent State of Croatia|name=Croatia}}<ref>{{cite book|title=World War II Croation Legionaries: Croation Troops Under Axis Command 1941\u201445|author=Vladimir Brnardic|isbn=978-1-4728-1767-9|page=9|date=22 November 2016}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Czechoslovakia}}: [[1st Czechoslovak Army Corps in the USSR|1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade in the USSR]]<ref>{{cite web|title=1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade|url=https://www.czechpatriots.com/en/1st-czechoslovak-independent-brigade.php|website=czechpatriots.com|first=Michal|last= Gelbi\u010d|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Estonia}} [[Forest Brothers|Estonian partisans]] after World War 2<ref>{{cite book|title= Germany's Eastern Front Allies (2): Baltic Forces|series=Men-at-Arms 363|last1=Nigel|first1= Thomas|first2=Carlos |last2=Caballero Jurado|date= 25 Jan 2002|isbn=9781841761930|page=40|publisher=Osprey Publishing|ref=harv}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Finland}}: Captured from Soviet troops, AVT-40 version also used.<ref name=\"Jaeger\">{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Rifles, part 4 |date=15 January 2017 |url=https://www.jaegerplatoon.net/RIFLES4.htm}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|East Germany}} [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] after WWII, issued as the '''SWT'''<ref>[https://www.tankograd.com/cms/website.php?id=/en/Fahrzeuge-und-Waffen-der-Nationalen-Volksarmee-3.htm Military and Paramilitary Vehicles and Weapons of East Germany]</ref>\n* {{flag|Georgia}}<ref name ='SAS 1998 4'>{{cite book|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/B-Occasional-papers/SAS-OP06-Georgia.pdf|chapter-url=|chapter=|title=Politics From The Barrel of a Gun|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1998|author=Small Arms Survey|pages=40|isbn=|author-link=Small Arms Survey}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Lithuania}}: Lithuanian civil Police used captured SVT-40s during the [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|German occupation]].{{sfn|Nigel|Caballero Jurado|2002|p=46}}\n* {{flag|Nazi Germany}} (Captured from Soviet troops)<ref>{{cite book|title=Desperate Measures: The Last-Ditch Weapons of the Nazi Volkssturm|page=61|author=W.

The SVT-40 saw widespread service during and after [[World War II]]. It was intended to be the Soviet Red Army's new [[service rifle]], but its production was disrupted by [[Operation Barbarossa|the German invasion in 1941]], resulting in a change back to the older [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]] bolt-action rifle for the duration of World War II. After the war, the Soviet Union adopted new rifles, such as the [[SKS]] and the [[AK-47]].\n\n== SVT-38 ==\n[[File:SVT-38 - Ryssland - AM.045576.jpg|thumb|left|SVT-38]]\n[[Fedor Tokarev]] created the basic design for the SVT rifle in the early 1930s. Tokarev gave up his previous experiments with recoil-operated self-loading rifles and pursued a gas-operating mechanism instead. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] had a great interest in semi-automatic infantry rifles, and the army held trials of automatic rifle designs in 1935. The winning rifle was designed by [[Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov]], and was accepted into service the next year as the ''[[AVS-36]]''. However, problems with the AVS quickly became apparent, and both Tokarev and Simonov submitted improved designs to further trials. This time, Tokarev's rifle was accepted for production, under the designation ''SVT-38'' with hopes that it would become the new standard issue rifle of the Red Army. Ambitious production plans anticipated two million rifles per year by 1942. Production began at [[Tula Arms Plant|Tula Arsenal]] in July 1939 (production at [[Izhmash]] began in late 1939).<ref name=\"nuggets\">[http://www.mosinnagant.net/USSR/svt401.asp The Red Army's Self Loading Rifles: A Brief History Of The Tokarev Rifles Models of 1938 and 1940. By Vic Thomas Of Michigan Historical Collectables]</ref>\n\nThe SVT-38 is a [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-operated]] rifle with a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston above the barrel and a [[tilting bolt]].<ref name=\"MF\"/> This configuration gained wider acceptance later. There is some dispute about who exactly first developed this operating principle, as the SVT's mechanism (as implemented in 1935 competition prototype) closely resembles [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]]'s design of 1937; Saive eventually designed both the [[FN-49]] and [[FN FAL]], which use similar operating principles.\n\nSoviet small arms were usually of simple and robust construction, designed for use by poorly educated and sometimes poorly equipped soldiers. The SVT-38, in contrast, had been designed with weight-saving in mind, including its wood stock, receiver, and action. It was a gas-operated action with a gas-cylinder cup that was not readily accessible. It was complex by Soviet standards, and was not suited to handle corrosively-primed ammunition without frequent cleaning.<ref name=\"MF\"/>\n\nThe SVT-38 was equipped with a [[bayonet]] and a 10-round detachable [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]. The receiver was open-top, which enabled reloading of the magazine using five-round Mosin\u2013Nagant [[stripper clip]]s. Fairly advanced features for the time were the adjustable gas system, [[muzzle brake]], and [[telescopic sight]] rails milled into the receiver. The sniper variant had an additional locking notch for a see-through scope mount and was equipped with a 3.5\u00d7 [[PU scope|PU telescopic sight]]. This instrument was slightly shorter than the otherwise-similar PU scope used on the Mosin\u2013Nagant M1891/30 sniper rifle.\n\n==SVT-40 and its derivatives==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-198-1394-18A, Russland, Soldat mit russischem Gewehr.jpg|thumb|A German soldier firing a captured SVT-40]]\n[[File:1940 Tula SVT40.jpg|thumb|SVT-40]]\nThe SVT-38 saw its combat debut in the 1939\u20131940 [[Winter War]] with Finland. The initial reaction of the troops to this new rifle was negative. Among the criticisms were the rifle being too long and cumbersome, difficult to maintain and the magazine tending to fall out. Production of the SVT-38 was terminated in April 1940 after some 150,000 examples had been manufactured. An improved design, the ''SVT-40'', entered production. It was a more refined, lighter design incorporating a modified, folding, magazine release. The hand guard was now of one-piece construction and the cleaning rod was housed under the barrel. Other changes were made to simplify manufacturing. Production of the improved version began in July 1940 at Tula and later at factories in Izhevsk and Podolsk. Production of the Mosin\u2013Nagant M1891/30 bolt-action rifle continued and it remained the standard-issue rifle to Red Army troops, with the SVT-40 more often issued to non-commissioned officers and elite units like the naval infantry. Since these factories already had experience manufacturing the SVT-38, output increased quickly and an estimated 70,000 SVT-40s were produced in 1940.\n\nBy the time the [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the USSR in June 1941, the SVT-40 was already in widespread use by the Red Army. In a Soviet infantry division's [[table of organization and equipment]], one-third of rifles were supposed to be SVTs, though in practice they seldom achieved this ratio. The first months of the war were disastrous for the Soviet Union; they lost hundreds of thousands of SVT-40s. To make up for this, production of the Mosin\u2013Nagant rifles was reintroduced. In contrast, the SVT was more difficult to manufacture, and troops with only rudimentary training had difficulty maintaining it. [[Submachine gun]]s like the [[PPSh-41]] had proven their value as simple, cheap and effective weapons to supplement infantry firepower. This led to a gradual decline in SVT production. In 1941, over one million SVTs were produced but in 1942 Ishevsk arsenal was ordered to cease SVT production and switch back to the Mosin\u2013Nagant 91/30. Only 264,000 SVTs were manufactured in 1942 and production continued to diminish until the order to cease production was finally given in January 1945. Total production of the SVT-38/40 was around 1,600,000 rifles, of which 51,710 were the SVT-40 sniper variant.<ref name=\"MF\"/><ref name = \"kehaya\"/><ref name = \"ezell\"/>\n\n[[File:1941 Tula SVT-40 in Original Sniper Configuration.jpg|thumb|A 1941 Tula SVT-40 in original sniper configuration]]\n\nSVTs frequently suffered from vertical shot dispersion; the army reported that the rifles were of \"flimsy construction and there were difficulties experienced in their repair and maintenance\".<ref>Small Arms of the World by W. H. B. Smith 9th Edition Revised by Joseph E. Smith 1969 p.&nbsp;583</ref> The stock, made of Arctic Birch, was prone to cracking in the wrist from recoil. This was generally remedied by drilling and inserting one or two large industrial bolts horizontally into the stock just before the wrist meets the receiver.<ref>[https://www.milsurps.com/showthread.php?t=63516&p=422787&viewfull=1#post422787 SVT-40 stock crack/bubba questions? - Post #5]</ref><ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/canadaguns/comments/a50wnt/svt40_stock_repair_and_reinforcing_screw/ Svt-40 stock repair and reinforcing screw]</ref> Many rifles were also poorly seated in their stocks, letting the receiver shift on firing. This led to a field modification that selectively [[Rifle bedding|shimmed the stock]] with birch chips, usually around the receiver and in between where the wood stock meets the lower metal handguard.<ref>[https://forums.gunboards.com/showthread.php?362417-How-were-SVT-s-quot-bedded-quot How were SVT's \"bedded\"?]</ref> For a sniper rifle, this was unacceptable and production of the specialized sniper variant of the SVT was terminated in 1942.<ref name=\"MF\"/> Milling scope rails in the receivers of standard SVT rifles was also discontinued. Other production changes included a new, simpler muzzle brake design with two vents per-side instead of the six on the original.\n\n=== AVT-40 automatic rifle ===\nTo supplement the Red Army's shortage of [[machine gun]]s, an SVT version capable of full-automatic fire (designated the ''AVT-40'') was ordered into production on 20 May 1942; the first batches reached the troops in July.<ref name=\"Bolotin1995_111\"/> It was externally similar to the SVT, but its modified safety also acted as a fire selector allowing for both semi-automatic and fully automatic fire modes. When fired automatically the rifle had a rate of fire of approximately 750 RPM, faster than even the [[DP machine gun]] which fired the same cartridge at 550 RPM. To better resist the stress of automatic fire, the AVT featured a slightly stouter stock made of hardwood usually distinguished with a large \u201cA\u201d engraved in it; surplus AVT stocks were later used on refurbished SVTs. In service, the AVT proved a disappointment: automatic fire was largely uncontrollable, and the rifles often suffered breakages under the increased strain.(Documents discovered after the war indicated that during testing, under continuous Full Auto fire, an AVT-40's barrel would be \"shot out\", meaning the rifling in the barrel would be completely worn down, in as little as 200-250 rounds.)

No physical examples have been found however, leading to the common assumption that it was a failure (much like the AVS-36's 15-round mag). Quite a few pictures have been observed of non-Soviets (namely Germans and Finns) using SVT-38s and 40s with what appear to be [[Bren]] or [[Lahti-Saloranta M/26|LS/26]] magazines. Very little is known about usage with the unsupported magazines (including their reliability and max capacity).\n\n==SVTs outside of the Soviet Union==\nThe first country outside the Soviet Union to employ the SVT was Finland, which captured some 2,700 SVT-38s during the [[Winter War]], and over 15,000 SVTs during the [[Continuation War]].

As the Germans were short of self-loading rifles themselves, SVT-38 and 40s, designated respectively as '''Selbstladegewehr 258(r)''' and '''Selbstladegewehr 259(r)''' by the [[Wehrmacht]], saw widespread use in German hands against their former owners.

In Russia, limited examples for civilian use have been sold as the \u041e\u0421\u041a-88 (OSK 88) and [[Molot]] KO-SVT with some variations in stock, barrel length and optics. The rifle's popularity is due to a combination of the inexpensive nature of its [[7.62\u00d754mmR]] ammunition, favorable [[aesthetics]], historical significance, and pleasant shooting characteristics.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nDespite its relatively brief service career, the SVT was a prolific rifle on the Eastern Front during World War II, and it had considerable impact on European battle rifle designs during and immediately after the war. The German [[Gewehr 43|G-43]] was influenced by the SVT in its design, as was Simonov's experimental carbine during the closing stages of the war (which would later become the [[SKS]]). The [[FN FAL]] and its ancestor [[FN Model 1949|FN-49]] employ the same locking mechanism and operating principle as the SVT, although as mentioned above, this is most likely coincidental. As a service rifle, the SVT had its problems, but so did contemporary semi-automatic rifles made by other countries. The main reason for the gradual downfall of SVT usage in combat was not its technical disadvantages; rather, the reason was that, with the immense, continual demand for rifles in the front lines, Soviet factories could produce other, simpler designs in far greater quantities in the same length of time it took to produce the SVT. In 1944 the Soviet Union adopted the [[7.62x39]] round used in the RPD Light Machinegun, SKS, and AK-47 Rifles. In 1945 the [[SKS]] was adopted which replaced the SVT-40 as the main infantry rifle, which itself was replaced by the AK-47 in 1948.\n\n==Users==\n* {{flag|Independent State of Croatia|name=Croatia}}<ref>{{cite book|title=World War II Croation Legionaries: Croation Troops Under Axis Command 1941\u201445|author=Vladimir Brnardic|isbn=978-1-4728-1767-9|page=9|date=22 November 2016}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Czechoslovakia}}: [[1st Czechoslovak Army Corps in the USSR|1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade in the USSR]]<ref>{{cite web|title=1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade|url=https://www.czechpatriots.com/en/1st-czechoslovak-independent-brigade.php|website=czechpatriots.com|first=Michal|last= Gelbi\u010d|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Estonia}} [[Forest Brothers|Estonian partisans]] after World War 2<ref>{{cite book|title= Germany's Eastern Front Allies (2): Baltic Forces|series=Men-at-Arms 363|last1=Nigel|first1= Thomas|first2=Carlos |last2=Caballero Jurado|date= 25 Jan 2002|isbn=9781841761930|page=40|publisher=Osprey Publishing|ref=harv}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Finland}}: Captured from Soviet troops, AVT-40 version also used.<ref name=\"Jaeger\">{{cite web|first=|last=|title=Rifles, part 4 |date=15 January 2017 |url=https://www.jaegerplatoon.net/RIFLES4.htm}}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|East Germany}} [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] after WWII, issued as the '''SWT'''<ref>[https://www.tankograd.com/cms/website.php?id=/en/Fahrzeuge-und-Waffen-der-Nationalen-Volksarmee-3.htm Military and Paramilitary Vehicles and Weapons of East Germany]</ref>\n* {{flag|Georgia}}<ref name ='SAS 1998 4'>{{cite book|url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/B-Occasional-papers/SAS-OP06-Georgia.pdf|chapter-url=|chapter=|title=Politics From The Barrel of a Gun|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1998|author=Small Arms Survey|pages=40|isbn=|author-link=Small Arms Survey}}</ref>\n* {{flag|Lithuania}}: Lithuanian civil Police used captured SVT-40s during the [[German occupation of Lithuania during World War II|German occupation]].{{sfn|Nigel|Caballero Jurado|2002|p=46}}\n* {{flag|Nazi Germany}} (Captured from Soviet troops)<ref>{{cite book|title=Desperate Measures: The Last-Ditch Weapons of the Nazi Volkssturm|page=61|author=W.

The soft launch called for opening the league with fewer teams than planned and playing an abbreviated schedule. They hoped a functioning league would yield the UFL a superior position for attracting potential owners over competing leagues still under development (like the New USFL, which at the time was trumpeting a spring 2010 launch).\n\nThe markets chosen for the [[2009 UFL season|premiere season]] were New York City ([[Hartford Colonials|Sentinels]]), Las Vegas ([[Las Vegas Locomotives|Locomotives]]), Orlando ([[Florida Tuskers]]), and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[Sacramento Mountain Lions|California Redwoods]]).  The league's short schedule made the kind of expensive promotional efforts often employed with a new league cost prohibitive. Additionally, the league had a full schedule of three home games in the same stadium in only one of their selected cities, Las Vegas.\n\nDuring the week of August 10, 2009, the four team names and their uniform jerseys were revealed. Each of the uniforms (and the team logos and helmets that were unveiled on October 2)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/United-Football-League-prnews-3774862174.html?x=0&.v=1|title=United Football League Reveals Team Logos for 'Premiere' Season|work=[[Yahoo!

Each of the team jerseys had the same design template, complete with a horizontal arc across the top front that resembles the arc on the UFL's logo.\n\nOne of the Redwoods' games was moved to San Jose; the other two were played in San Francisco (the move to San Jose was a short-notice move due to poor attendance in San Francisco; however, the San Jose game ended up being even more poorly attended). The league was unable to secure a fiscally reasonable deal for a stadium within New York City, forcing the league to have the Sentinels play one home game each in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; on the campus of [[Hofstra University]] in [[Long Island]], and in [[New Jersey]]. In addition, one of the Tuskers' games was played at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], in part because the Tuskers shared ownership that year with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]; this was not reprised in 2010.\n\nThe Florida Tuskers finished 2009 with a 6&ndash;0 record. The Las Vegas Locomotives were next at 4&ndash;2, the California Redwoods were 2&ndash;4, and the Sentinels were last at 0&ndash;6.

This \"[[Tuck rule (football)|tuck rule]]\" had become one of the most controversial rules in the NFL;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |title=tuck Rule Hard to Grasp |accessdate=2007-08-06 |work=The Washington Post |first=Mark |last=Maske |date=2005-10-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914201115/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |archivedate=2010-09-14 }}</ref> in the UFL, however, an identical play was called a fumble. The tuck rule was eliminated by the NFL prior to the 2013 season.\n*'''[[Blitz (American football)|Blitzing]]/Rushing''' &ndash; On each play, the defense must use four [[Lineman (American football)|down linemen]] who must be in a [[three point stance|3-]] or 4-point stance at the snap. No more than six defenders could rush the passer. Penalty for violating this rule was ''illegal defense'' (signaled as unsportsmanlike conduct), with a 15-yard penalty and a first down. This rule was meant to both protect the quarterback and encourage more scoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616042037/http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-06-16|title=A break for QBs: Blitz restrictions favor UFL offenses|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|first=Steven|last=Pivovar|date=2010-09-30|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> A similar rule has been in effect for the NFL's [[Pro Bowl]] for several years.\n*'''Intentional grounding''' &ndash; A quarterback was allowed to intentionally ground the ball to avoid a sack, provided he gets the throw back to the line of scrimmage. He does not have to be outside the pocket to do so.\n*'''Fumbling out of the end zones''' &ndash; If the ball is fumbled forward into and out of the [[end zone]], it is placed back at the spot of the fumble, whereas in the NFL this play is ruled a [[touchback]] and possession goes over to the defending team.\n*'''Instant replay''' &ndash; As opposed to the NFL, where the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]] reviews disputed plays (other than turnovers, scoring plays, and plays inside the [[two-minute warning]]) through a video monitor on the sidelines, all UFL replay reviews were viewed upstairs by a replay official, who had 90 seconds to make a ruling.\n*'''[[Touchdown celebration]]s''' &ndash; Player celebrations (individual or group) were permitted only in the end zones or the bench areas.\n*'''[[Face mask (gridiron football)|Face masks]]''' &ndash; The UFL allowed the single-bar face mask, which the NFL had outlawed in 2007. Only one player, punter [[Scott Player]], used the single-bar mask.\n*'''Overtime''' &ndash; Starting in 2010 (for the playoffs) and 2012 (for all other games), the NFL has adopted a modified [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] overtime, where sudden death occurs only if the opening drive of overtime ends in a touchdown (before, any score would immediately end the extra session). The UFL has from its inception employed an overtime system that assures each team at least one possession. Therefore, if the first team scored on their opening drive (even if it is a touchdown), their opponent was then given the opportunity to equal that score on the next drive, or surpass it if the other team's first drive resulted in anything less than a touchdown and [[two-point conversion|2-point conversion]]. If both teams remain tied after each has had one possession, overtime then reverted to sudden death. If the score remains tied after 15 minutes, the game ends in a tie, except that post-season games will be played to a victorious conclusion. The actual application of the OT rules occurred during [[2009 UFL Championship Game|the first UFL championship game in 2009]] when Las Vegas won on a field goal after the first possession by Florida ended in an interception.\n\n===Other differences from NFL===\n*'''[[Official (American football)|Officials]]''' &ndash; The UFL's roster of on-field officials included two women, head linesman Terri Valenti (who joined the league in 2009) and line judge [[Sarah Thomas (American football official)|Sarah Thomas]] (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|title=United Football League Announces Officials And Explains Rules Differences For 2010 Season|work=United Football League|publisher=OurSportsCentral.com|date=2010-07-29|accessdate=2010-07-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174250/http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref> The officials wore unique attire during the 2009 inaugural season\u2014red polo shirts with black numbering, lettering, and piping, along with black pants and caps that were the same as in the NFL (white cap for the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]], black for the other officials); the combination set them apart from not only their NFL and college brethren but from the teams on the field, none of whom sported red jerseys in 2009. The officials changed to traditional black-and-white-striped uniforms with green accents starting in 2010.\n*'''[[Chain crew]] and markers''' &ndash; Instead of bright orange, the chain crews' equipment (including vests, yardage \"sticks\", down markers, and endzone pylons) were lime green, one of the UFL's signature colors.\n\n==The William Hambrecht Trophy==\nThe trophy given annually to the UFL champions was The [[William Hambrecht]] Trophy, named after the Las Vegas Locos owner and UFL founder. When the trophy was first awarded in 2009, the Hambrecht Trophy displayed similar qualities to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]]. It featured the star from the UFL logo with a streak coming off of one of the corners down onto the base. This design was scrapped after year one. For the 2010 season, the Hambrecht Trophy was redesigned. It now featured two bases in the shape of the UFL logo connected by four columns with a UFL football on a kicking tee placed on the top base. The previous design was then used as the Championship Game MVP trophy.\n\n==Game scheduling==\nFor the 2009 and 2010 seasons, the UFL scheduled its games on non-traditional evenings for pro football: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. Though these games conflicted with high school and college football events in some locations, the UFL's scheduling plan was different from that of the National Football League, which is prohibited under federal anti-trust exemption law ([[Title 15 of the United States Code|15 U.S.C.]] \u00a7 1291, i.e., the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]]) from broadcasting any professional game within seventy-five miles of any inter-collegiate or high school game on any Friday or Saturday, beginning with the second Friday in September and ending the second Saturday in December (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |title=First and very long for Bill Hambrecht |first=Megan |last=Barnett |date=2007-05-31 |work=News Blog |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126005856/http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |archivedate=2009-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the league originally intended to play its games primarily on the traditional Sunday afternoon time setting for professional football, but starting its season in August, a full month before the start of the NFL regular season. However, financial difficulties forced the league to return to its schedule from previous years.\n\nIn 2012 it was announced that games would begin in September and that the schedule would be played over eight weeks. When this announcement was made, it had been anticipated that the league would have expanded beyond four active members. Games were to be played on Wednesday and Friday nights with six weeks of regular season action and two weeks of playoffs, culminating with a championship game in early November. The eventual schedule announced in August 2012 varied somewhat from this, with the regular season extended to eight weeks but only one playoff game. A revision announced in early September moved the opening week back to the last week in September. The regular season was to be unbalanced, with each team playing two of the others three times and the third one only twice. The 2012 championship game had originally been rescheduled to be played on December 1; during one week in late October the games were to have been played on Tuesday and Thursday nights.\n\n==The 2009 soft launch and the league's financial structure==\nThe UFL's original pay structure plan included a player [[salary cap]] range of $12\u201320 million per team with a staff salary cap of $3 million per team.   The UFL hoped to be paying at least 10 players on each roster in excess of $1 million each per season.  These players would provide name value and legitimacy for the league and would fast track the development of local fanbases and a national TV audience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |title=Battling the NFL: Two Hail-Mary passes |first=Sean |last=Gregory |date=2007-10-09 |work=Business & Tech |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514065258/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |archivedate=2009-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe original plan was predicated on luring in very wealthy owners like billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban.  The UFL however ultimately proved unsuccessful in securing commitments from enough of the deep-pocketed owners their original plan required.\n\nBy time the initial season began, the league had totally dumped its original salary structure to suit the reality of the soft launch.  The league's original plan would have had the average UFL salary in the $240,000-$500,000 range, far in excess of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s average salary.  The short schedule gutted the league's ability to generate TV or gate revenue.  To make a soft launch financially tolerable, player salaries had to be dramatically scaled back&mdash;pro-rated to reflect the shortened season.\n\nAn agent representing two players with NFL experience, Jack Bechta, reported his clients were offered UFL contracts at a base salary of $35,000. He confirmed with other agents that $35,000 was the league mandated salary for skill players and $25,000 for punters, place kickers and long snappers, at least for the 2009 inaugural season. One of the players represented by the agent was a quarterback who received an offer of $35,000, although he stated that his negotiations revealed that teams are allowed to pay one quarterback more than the $35,000 salary. Bonuses were limited to $10,000 per player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|title=Will they play for 35k?|work=National Football Post|first=Jack|last=Betcha|date=2009-07-15|accessdate=2009-11-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216062618/http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|archivedate=2009-12-16}}</ref> In addition to the base salary, the league also paid for all housing expenses for its players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|title=Sit-down with UFL GM Rick Mueller|work=[[Pro Football Weekly]]|first=Dan|last=Winters|date=2009-11-11|accessdate=2009-11-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117175622/http://www.profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|archivedate=2009-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe league's initial salaries were roughly equal to the average per-game salaries in the Canadian Football League and, adjusted for inflation, equivalent to the old [[XFL (2001)|XFL]].

The soft launch called for opening the league with fewer teams than planned and playing an abbreviated schedule. They hoped a functioning league would yield the UFL a superior position for attracting potential owners over competing leagues still under development (like the New USFL, which at the time was trumpeting a spring 2010 launch).\n\nThe markets chosen for the [[2009 UFL season|premiere season]] were New York City ([[Hartford Colonials|Sentinels]]), Las Vegas ([[Las Vegas Locomotives|Locomotives]]), Orlando ([[Florida Tuskers]]), and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[Sacramento Mountain Lions|California Redwoods]]).  The league's short schedule made the kind of expensive promotional efforts often employed with a new league cost prohibitive. Additionally, the league had a full schedule of 3 home games in the same stadium in only one of their selected cities, Las Vegas.\n\nDuring the week of August 10, 2009, the four team names and their uniform jerseys were revealed. Each of the uniforms (and the team logos and helmets that were unveiled on October 2)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/United-Football-League-prnews-3774862174.html?x=0&.v=1|title=United Football League Reveals Team Logos for 'Premiere' Season|work=[[Yahoo!

Each of the team jerseys had the same design template, complete with a horizontal arc across the top front that resembles the arc on the UFL's logo.\n\nOne of the Redwoods' games was moved to San Jose; the other two were played in San Francisco (the move to San Jose was a short-notice move due to poor attendance in San Francisco; however, the San Jose game ended up being even more poorly attended). The league was unable to secure a fiscally reasonable deal for a stadium within New York City, forcing the league to have the Sentinels play one home game each in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; on the campus of [[Hofstra University]] in [[Long Island]], and in [[New Jersey]]. In addition, one of the Tuskers' games was played at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], in part because the Tuskers shared ownership that year with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]]; this was not reprised in 2010.\n\nThe Florida Tuskers finished 2009 with a 6&ndash;0 record. The Las Vegas Locomotives were next at 4&ndash;2, the California Redwoods were 2&ndash;4, and the Sentinels were last at 0&ndash;6.

This \"[[Tuck rule (football)|tuck rule]]\" had become one of the most controversial rules in the NFL;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |title=tuck Rule Hard to Grasp |accessdate=2007-08-06 |work=The Washington Post |first=Mark |last=Maske |date=2005-10-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100914201115/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/14/AR2005101401828.html |archivedate=2010-09-14 }}</ref> in the UFL, however, an identical play was called a fumble. The tuck rule was eliminated by the NFL prior to the 2013 season.\n*'''[[Blitz (American football)|Blitzing]]/Rushing''' &ndash; On each play, the defense must use four [[Lineman (American football)|down linemen]] who must be in a [[three point stance|3-]] or 4-point stance at the snap. No more than six defenders could rush the passer. Penalty for violating this rule was ''illegal defense'' (signaled as unsportsmanlike conduct), with a 15-yard penalty and a first down. This rule was meant to both protect the quarterback and encourage more scoring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616042037/http://www.omaha.com/article/20100930/SPORTS/709309722/-1#a-break-for-qbs-blitz-restrictions-favor-ufl-offenses|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-06-16|title=A break for QBs: Blitz restrictions favor UFL offenses|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|first=Steven|last=Pivovar|date=2010-09-30|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> A similar rule has been in effect for the NFL's [[Pro Bowl]] for several years.\n*'''Intentional grounding''' &ndash; A quarterback was allowed to intentionally ground the ball to avoid a sack, provided he gets the throw back to the line of scrimmage. He does not have to be outside the pocket to do so.\n*'''Fumbling out of the end zones''' &ndash; If the ball is fumbled forward into and out of the [[end zone]], it is placed back at the spot of the fumble, whereas in the NFL this play is ruled a [[touchback]] and possession goes over to the defending team.\n*'''Instant replay''' &ndash; As opposed to the NFL, where the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]] reviews disputed plays (other than turnovers, scoring plays, and plays inside the [[two-minute warning]]) through a video monitor on the sidelines, all UFL replay reviews were viewed upstairs by a replay official, who had 90 seconds to make a ruling.\n*'''[[Touchdown celebration]]s''' &ndash; Player celebrations (individual or group) were permitted only in the end zones or the bench areas.\n*'''[[Face mask (gridiron football)|Face masks]]''' &ndash; The UFL allowed the single-bar face mask, which the NFL had outlawed in 2007. Only one player, punter [[Scott Player]], used the single-bar mask.\n*'''Overtime''' &ndash; Starting in 2010 (for the playoffs) and 2012 (for all other games), the NFL has adopted a modified [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]] overtime, where sudden death occurs only if the opening drive of overtime ends in a touchdown (before, any score would immediately end the extra session). The UFL has from its inception employed an overtime system that assures each team at least one possession. Therefore, if the first team scored on their opening drive (even if it is a touchdown), their opponent was then given the opportunity to equal that score on the next drive, or surpass it if the other team's first drive resulted in anything less than a touchdown and [[two-point conversion|2-point conversion]]. If both teams remain tied after each has had one possession, overtime then reverted to sudden death. If the score remains tied after 15 minutes, the game ends in a tie, except that post-season games will be played to a victorious conclusion. The actual application of the OT rules occurred during [[2009 UFL Championship Game|the first UFL championship game in 2009]] when Las Vegas won on a field goal after the first possession by Florida ended in an interception.\n\n===Other differences from NFL===\n*'''[[Official (American football)|Officials]]''' &ndash; The UFL's roster of on-field officials included two women, head linesman Terri Valenti (who joined the league in 2009) and line judge [[Sarah Thomas (American football official)|Sarah Thomas]] (2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|title=United Football League Announces Officials And Explains Rules Differences For 2010 Season|work=United Football League|publisher=OurSportsCentral.com|date=2010-07-29|accessdate=2010-07-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174250/http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=4060016|archivedate=2011-06-29}}</ref> The officials wore unique attire during the 2009 inaugural season\u2014red polo shirts with black numbering, lettering, and piping, along with black pants and caps that were the same as in the NFL (white cap for the [[Official (American football)#Referee|referee]], black for the other officials); the combination set them apart from not only their NFL and college brethren but from the teams on the field, none of whom sported red jerseys in 2009. The officials changed to traditional black-and-white-striped uniforms with green accents starting in 2010.\n*'''[[Chain crew]] and markers''' &ndash; Instead of bright orange, the chain crews' equipment (including vests, yardage \"sticks\", down markers, and endzone pylons) were lime green, one of the UFL's signature colors.\n\n==The William Hambrecht Trophy==\nThe trophy given annually to the UFL champions was The [[William Hambrecht]] Trophy, named after the Las Vegas Locos owner and UFL founder. When the trophy was first awarded in 2009, the Hambrecht Trophy displayed similar qualities to the [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]]. It featured the star from the UFL logo with a streak coming off of one of the corners down onto the base. This design was scrapped after year one. For the 2010 season, the Hambrecht Trophy was redesigned. It now featured two bases in the shape of the UFL logo connected by four columns with a UFL football on a kicking tee placed on the top base. The previous design was then used as the Championship Game MVP trophy.\n\n==Game scheduling==\nFor the 2009 and 2010 seasons, the UFL scheduled its games on non-traditional evenings for pro football: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings. Though these games conflicted with high school and college football events in some locations, the UFL's scheduling plan was different from that of the National Football League, which is prohibited under federal anti-trust exemption law ([[Title 15 of the United States Code|15 U.S.C.]] \u00a7 1291, i.e., the [[Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961]]) from broadcasting any professional game within seventy-five miles of any inter-collegiate or high school game on any Friday or Saturday, beginning with the second Friday in September and ending the second Saturday in December (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |title=First and very long for Bill Hambrecht |first=Megan |last=Barnett |date=2007-05-31 |work=News Blog |publisher=Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio Magazine |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126005856/http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/daily-brief/2007/05/31/first-and-very-long-for-bill-hambrecht |archivedate=2009-01-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the league originally intended to play its games primarily on the traditional Sunday afternoon time setting for professional football, but starting its season in August, a full month before the start of the NFL regular season. However, financial difficulties forced the league to return to its schedule from previous years.\n\nIn 2012 it was announced that games would begin in September and that the schedule would be played over eight weeks. When this announcement was made, it had been anticipated that the league would have expanded beyond four active members. Games were to be played on Wednesday and Friday nights with six weeks of regular season action and two weeks of playoffs, culminating with a championship game in early November. The eventual schedule announced in August 2012 varied somewhat from this, with the regular season extended to eight weeks but only one playoff game. A revision announced in early September moved the opening week back to the last week in September. The regular season was to be unbalanced, with each team playing two of the others three times and the third one only twice. The 2012 championship game had originally been rescheduled to be played on December 1; during one week in late October the games were to have been played on Tuesday and Thursday nights.\n\n==The 2009 soft launch and the league's financial structure==\nThe UFL's original pay structure plan included a player [[salary cap]] range of $12\u201320 million per team with a staff salary cap of $3 million per team.   The UFL hoped to be paying at least 10 players on each roster in excess of $1 million each per season.  These players would provide name value and legitimacy for the league and would fast track the development of local fanbases and a national TV audience.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |title=Battling the NFL: Two Hail-Mary passes |first=Sean |last=Gregory |date=2007-10-09 |work=Business & Tech |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |accessdate=2009-02-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514065258/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1669649,00.html |archivedate=2009-05-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe original plan was predicated on luring in very wealthy owners like billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban.  The UFL however ultimately proved unsuccessful in securing commitments from enough of the deep-pocketed owners their original plan required.\n\nBy time the initial season began, the league had totally dumped its original salary structure to suit the reality of the soft launch.  The league's original plan would have had the average UFL salary in the $240,000-$500,000 range, far in excess of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s average salary.  The short schedule gutted the league's ability to generate TV or gate revenue.  To make a soft launch financially tolerable, player salaries had to be dramatically scaled back&mdash;pro-rated to reflect the shortened season.\n\nAn agent representing two players with NFL experience, Jack Bechta, reported his clients were offered UFL contracts at a base salary of $35,000. He confirmed with other agents that $35,000 was the league mandated salary for skill players and $25,000 for punters, place kickers and long snappers, at least for the 2009 inaugural season. One of the players represented by the agent was a quarterback who received an offer of $35,000, although he stated that his negotiations revealed that teams are allowed to pay one quarterback more than the $35,000 salary. Bonuses were limited to $10,000 per player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|title=Will they play for 35k?|work=National Football Post|first=Jack|last=Betcha|date=2009-07-15|accessdate=2009-11-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216062618/http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/Will-they-play-for-35k.html|archivedate=2009-12-16}}</ref> In addition to the base salary, the league also paid for all housing expenses for its players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|title=Sit-down with UFL GM Rick Mueller|work=[[Pro Football Weekly]]|first=Dan|last=Winters|date=2009-11-11|accessdate=2009-11-12|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117175622/http://www.profootballweekly.com/blogs/2009/11/11/sit-down-with-ufl-gm-rick-mueller|archivedate=2009-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe league's initial salaries were roughly equal to the average per-game salaries in the Canadian Football League and, adjusted for inflation, equivalent to the old [[XFL (2001)|XFL]].
