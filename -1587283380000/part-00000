Under the deal, Azteca restructured TVM and took control of ad sales and most programming duties, while Moreno Valle's CNI news service retained some primetime space.

However, the Mexican government stepped into the dispute and forced Azteca to relinquish control of XHTVM. In 2005, an employee strike that crippled CNI, Moreno Valle's mounting legal troubles, and a deal with the 5% owner of the concessionaire allowed Azteca to buy the remainder of the station and retake control of XHTVM, under the name Proyecto 40, in 2006.\n\nOn March 7, 2011, TV Azteca changed its name to ''Azteca'', reflecting its growth into a multimedia company.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tvazteca.com/capitulos/vengalaalegria/39479/azteca-se-renueva-para-ti |title= Azteca se renueva para ti (\"Azteca renews for you\") |author= TV Azteca |date= March 7, 2011 |language= spanish |accessdate= March 14, 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717114705/http://www.tvazteca.com/capitulos/vengalaalegria/39479/azteca-se-renueva-para-ti |archivedate= July 17, 2011 }}</ref> However, in July 2015, the TV Azteca name was restored.\n\nTV Azteca is the second largest mass media company in M\u00e9xico after Televisa.<ref name=\":0\"/> These two big organizations control the 97% of mass media in Mexico.<ref name=\":0\" /> TV Azteca was funded in 1993 by Ricardo Salinas Pliego.

Under the deal, Azteca restructured TVM and took control of ad sales and most programming duties, while Moreno Valle's CNI news service retained some primetime space. However, in 2000, Moreno Valle broke the contract with Azteca, alleging Azteca of filling up time allotted to CNI and not fulfilling the obligations in the contract. In December 2002, Azteca used private security guards to retake control of the XHTVM facilities on Cerro del Chiquihuite in Mexico City. However, the Mexican government stepped into the dispute and forced Azteca to relinquish control of XHTVM. In 2005, an employee strike that crippled CNI, Moreno Valle's mounting legal troubles, and a deal with the 5% owner of the concessionaire allowed Azteca to buy the remainder of the station and retake control of XHTVM, under the name Proyecto 40, in 2006.\n\nOn March 7, 2011, TV Azteca changed its name to ''Azteca'', reflecting its growth into a multimedia company.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tvazteca.com/capitulos/vengalaalegria/39479/azteca-se-renueva-para-ti |title= Azteca se renueva para ti (\"Azteca renews for you\") |author= TV Azteca |date= March 7, 2011 |language= spanish |accessdate= March 14, 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717114705/http://www.tvazteca.com/capitulos/vengalaalegria/39479/azteca-se-renueva-para-ti |archivedate= July 17, 2011 }}</ref> However, in July 2015, the TV Azteca name was restored.\n\nTV Azteca is the second largest mass media company in M\u00e9xico after Televisa.<ref name=\":0\"/> These two big organizations control the 97% of mass media in Mexico.<ref name=\":0\" /> TV Azteca was funded in 1993 by Ricardo Salinas Pliego.
