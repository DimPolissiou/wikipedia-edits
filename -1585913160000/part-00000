In 1561 it became part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and, subsequently, of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569 (see [[Duchy of Livonia]]). In 1621 Daugavpils became the capital of the newly formed [[Inflanty Voivodeship]], which existed until the [[First Partition of Poland]] (1772). In 1577 the Russian tsar [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] captured and destroyed D\u00fcnaburg castle. That same year, a new castle was built {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} downriver. In 1582 Daugavpils was granted [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg town rights]]. In the 17th century, during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1656\u20131658)|Russo\u2013Swedish War]] initiated by Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]], the Russians [[Siege of Dyneburg|captured]] Daugavpils, renamed the town ''Borisoglebsk'' and controlled the region for 11 years, between 1656 and 1667. Russia returned the area to Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth following the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]] (1667). It became part of the Russian Empire after [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772.

The newly independent Latvian state renamed it ''Daugavpils'' in 1920. Latvians, Poles and Soviet troops fought the [[Battle of Daugavpils]] in the area from 1919 to 1920. Daugavpils and the whole of Latvia was under the [[Soviet Union]] rule between 1940\u201341 and 1944\u20131991, while Germany occupied it between 1941 and 1944. The Nazis established the [[Daugavpils Ghetto]] where the town's Jews were forced to live. Most were murdered. During the [[Cold War]] the [[Lociki]] air-base operated {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Daugavpils itself. In the late Soviet era, there was a proposal to [[Daugavpils hydroelectric power station|build a hydroelectric power station]] on the Daugava river that was successfully opposed by the nascent environmental movement in Latvia.\n\nOn 16 April 2010 an assassin shot vice-mayor [[Grigorijs \u0145emcovs]] in the center of the city. He died almost immediately and the crime remains unsolved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/kriminalzinas/327287-nosauts_daugavpils_vicemers_grigorijs_nemcovs |title=No\u0161auts Daugavpils vicem\u0113rs Grigorijs \u0145emcovs |publisher=tvnet.lv |language=Latvian |date=2010-04-16 |access-date=2010-04-30}}</ref>\n\n==Jewish history==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}{{Original research section|date=October 2018}}\nPrior to [[the Holocaust]], Daugavpils, (called by its Jewish inhabitants Dvinsk), was home to the most prominent Jewish community in eastern Latvia. The city was already a Jewish center as early as the 1780s and by the time of the 1897 census, they numbered 32,400 (44% of the overall population of the city). By 1911 they had increased to 50,000. The Jews of the town were very prosperous and ran 32 factories and there were 4000 artisans among them.\n\nThe city not only boasted a large Jewish population but a rich religious culture including 40 synagogues. The city was home to two of the most prominent rabbis of their time: Joseph Rosen (1858-1936), known as the Rogatchover Gaon (genius from [[Rahachow]]), was famed for his commentaries on the works of [[Maimonides]] and on the Talmud. Famed for his acidic wit and penetrating genius, he led the towns [[Hasidic Jews]]. His 'competitor', the leader of the local [[Misnagdim]] (non-Hasidic Jews) was the Rabbi [[Meir Simcha of Dvinsk]] (1843-1926). Rabbi Meir Simcha was also renowned for his work on Maimonides ([[Or Somayach]]) as well as Bible commentary Meshech Chochma. In one famous comment he predicted that since some Jews had assimilated and viewed [[Berlin]] as their '[[Jerusalem]]' they would suffer persecution originating in Berlin.\n\nAnother famous Jewish resident was the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Mark Rothko]]. Born in Daugavpils in 1903 he immigrated at the age of 10 to the [[United States]] where he painted over 800 paintings in his unique style.\n\nJewish Daugavpils came to an end following the Nazi German invasion on June 26, 1941. Falsely claiming that the Jews had conspired to set fire to the town and that they were assisting the Soviet army, the Germans and their Latvian collaborators carried out large executions on June 28\u201329. During July the Jews were enslaved and forced to cut down timber. On July 7\u201311 Einsatzkommando 1b under [[Erich Ehrlinger]] executed many of the remaining Jews. Later in July the 14,000 remaining Jews were forced into a Ghetto along with those from nearby towns. By the end of August an additional 7000 Jews had died at the hands of the Nazis and the Latvian populace. The largest execution took place in November 1941 and was followed by plagues that decimated the few survivors. Only about 1500 Jews remained in the city. These were murdered (again with the aid of the Latvians) on May 1, 1942. When the town was liberated in 1944 only 100 survivors remained of a community of 16,000.

There are 22 primary and secondary schools, four vocational schools, and the Saules [[Art school|College of Art]]. More than 1,000 teachers and engineers graduate from the [[University of Daugavpils]] (formerly Daugavpils Pedagogical University) and the local branch of [[Riga Technical University]] annually.\nThere is also a Polish [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] on Var\u0161avas iela (Warsaw Street).\n\nIn 2007 the [[Daugavpils Theatre]] was restored. There is also one cinema as well as other [[cultural institutions]]. The city exhibition center offers many cultural activities.\n\nThere are also several architectural, historical, and cultural monuments in Daugavpils. The most prominent is the [[Daugavpils fortress]] dating mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries. In April 2013 the [[Mark Rothko Art centre]] was opened in the fortress.\n\n===Historical centre===\nThe historical centre of Daugavpils city is an architectural heritage of national importance (the construction work was carried out in the 19th century according to the project endorsed in St Petersburg in 1826).\nThe historical centre is the greatest attraction of the city and one of the most successful examples of balancing the aspects of ancient and modern times. Daugavpils is one of the few cities in Latvia which can pride itself on a unified ensemble of both classic and eclectic styles. The cultural heritage of architectural, artistic, industrial, and historical monuments combined with the picturesque surroundings create the essence of Daugavpils\u2019 image and endow it with a special charm.\n\nIn 2020 the municipality allocated 70,000 euros for the restoration of eight historical buildings, including [[Art Nouveau]] and red brick buildings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/history/daugavpils-to-spend-70000-on-historical-restorations.a349237/ |title=Daugavpils to spend 70,000 on historical restorations |date=21 February 2020 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Red brick buildings===\n[[File:GimnazjumPolskieDyneburg.JPG|thumb|right|Polish language gymnasium.]]\nDaugavpils is exceptionally rich in red brick buildings. This style was developed by many outstanding architects. In Daugavpils, this variety of eclecticism is most widely represented in the buildings designed by [[Wilhelm Neumann]], an architect of German origin who was the chief architect of the city from 1878 to 1895. Bright examples of brick architecture are the buildings at 1/3 Saules Street and at 8 Muzeja Street. The shape-forming techniques typical of eclecticism that were applied in the fa\u00e7ades of these buildings even many decades later make one appreciate and admire the striking accuracy of detail.\n\n==Transport==\n{{See also|Daugavpils Satiksme}}\n[[File:Dzelzce\u013ca tilts Daugavpil\u012b.jpg|thumb|right|Daugavpils rail bridge.]]\n''Daugavpils satiksme AS'' oversees the city's autobus and tram networks.\n\nThe [[Daugavpils Station|city's railway station]] is the terminus of the [[Riga\u2013Daugavpils Railway]]. There is a train connection to Vilnius during the weekends.\n\n[[Daugavpils International Airport]] is located {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Daugavpils, near the village of [[Lociki]].\nThe airport was denationalized in 1993 and since 2005 there exists an ongoing project to redevelop the former military facility to allow both international and domestic passenger traffic, as well as international and domestic cargo transport and [[Charter airline|charter flights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daugavpils.lv/index.php?load=780&set_lang=en |title=Daugavpils &#124; |publisher=Daugavpils.lv |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daugavpils.lv/?load=1&newsId=7858 |title=Daugavpils &#124; |publisher=Daugavpils.lv |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Daugavpils City Council}}\n[[File:Daugavpils city hall.jpg|thumb|Daugavpils City Hall]]\nThe head of the city government is the mayor of Daugavpils or, literally, 'Council Chairman' (''domes priek\u0161s\u0113d\u0113t\u0101js''). The incumbent since January 2019 is [[Andrejs Elksni\u0146\u0161]] from [[Social Democratic Party \"Harmony\"|Harmony]], albeit coalition talks are still ongoing. It is his second term in office, after his initial term was ended after the coalition broke apart in September 2017 less than a month following the 2017 municipal elections and he was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Rihards Eigims|lv|3=Rihards Eigims}} of the [[Latvian Green Party]] (elected on the \"Our Party\" electoral list). \"Our Party\" governed in coalition with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Latgale Party|lv|3=Latgales partija}} of the previous mayor [[J\u0101nis L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis]]. Eigims was previously mayor from 2001\u20132003 as leader of the [[Light of Latgale]] party and briefly in 2009 as a member of the [[Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]].\n\nThe Council consists of 15 members who are elected every four years. The [[2017 Latvian municipal elections|most recent election]] was in 2017.\n\n==Economy==\nDuring the Soviet time, the city was well industrialised with a number of prominent large manufacturing units. However, nowadays only a few of those have remained still working. The city council is trying to attract new investments and thus created a number of free industrial zones around the whole city that might be interesting due to the strategically efficient geographical position of the city close to the Russian, Belarusian and Lithuanian borders.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Daugavpils Multifunctional Sports Complex.jpg|right|thumb|Daugavpils Olympic Centre]]\n{{See also|Speedway Grand Prix of Latvia}}\nThe [[Association football|football]] clubs [[FC Daugava]] and [[BFC Daugavpils]] play at [[Celtnieks Stadium]] in Daugavpils. Both teams plays in the [[Latvian Higher League]]. There is also a [[Ice hockey|hockey]] team called [[DHK Latgale]], which currently plays in the [[Latvian Hockey League]].\n\nThe [[Speedway Grand Prix of Latvia]] is currently held at the [[Latvijas Sp\u012bdveja Centrs]] with America's triple [[Speedway World Championship|World Champion]] [[Greg Hancock]] being the most successful rider in Latvia winning the GP in 2009, [[2009 Speedway Grand Prix of Latvia|2009]] and 2013.

In the 17th century, during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1656\u20131658)|Russo\u2013Swedish War]] initiated by Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]], the Russians [[Siege of Dyneburg|captured]] Daugavpils, renamed the town ''Borisoglebsk'' and controlled the region for 11 years, between 1656 and 1667. Russia returned the area to Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth following the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]] (1667). It became part of the Russian Empire after [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772. It was an [[uyezd]] center firstly in [[Pskov Governorate]] between 1772 and 1776, Polotsk one between 1776 and 1796, Belarus one between 1796 and 1802 and finally Vitebsk between 1802 and 1917 as '''Dinaburg''' firstly, as '''Dvinsk''' later during Russian rule.\n\nFrom 1784 onwards the city had a large and active Jewish population<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/latvia/DvinskFamilies.htm |title=Jewish families of Dvinsk |publisher=jewishgen.org |accessdate=2008-07-12}}\n</ref> among them a number of prominent figures. According to the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census of 1897]], out of a total population of 69,700, Jews numbered 32,400 (ca. 44% percent).<ref>Joshua D.

The newly independent Latvian state renamed it ''Daugavpils'' in 1920. Latvians, Poles and Soviet troops fought the [[Battle of Daugavpils]] in the area from 1919 to 1920. Daugavpils and the whole of Latvia was under the [[Soviet Union]] rule between 1940\u201341 and 1944\u20131991, while Germany occupied it between 1941 and 1944. The Nazis established the [[Daugavpils Ghetto]] where the town's Jews were forced to live. Most were murdered. During the [[Cold War]] the [[Lociki]] air-base operated {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Daugavpils itself. In the late Soviet era, there was a proposal to [[Daugavpils hydroelectric power station|build a hydroelectric power station]] on the Daugava river that was successfully opposed by the nascent environmental movement in Latvia.\n\nOn 16 April 2010 an assassin shot vice-mayor [[Grigorijs \u0145emcovs]] in the center of the city. He died almost immediately and the crime remains unsolved.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/kriminalzinas/327287-nosauts_daugavpils_vicemers_grigorijs_nemcovs |title=No\u0161auts Daugavpils vicem\u0113rs Grigorijs \u0145emcovs |publisher=tvnet.lv |language=Latvian |date=2010-04-16 |access-date=2010-04-30}}</ref>\n\n==Jewish history==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}{{Original research section|date=October 2018}}\nPrior to [[the Holocaust]], Daugavpils, (called by its Jewish inhabitants Dvinsk), was home to the most prominent Jewish community in eastern Latvia. The city was already a Jewish center as early as the 1780s and by the time of the 1897 census, they numbered 32,400 (44% of the overall population of the city). By 1911 they had increased to 50,000. The Jews of the town were very prosperous and ran 32 factories and there were 4000 artisans among them.\n\nThe city not only boasted a large Jewish population but a rich religious culture including 40 synagogues. The city was home to two of the most prominent rabbis of their time: Joseph Rosen (1858-1936), known as the Rogatchover Gaon (genius from [[Rahachow]]), was famed for his commentaries on the works of [[Maimonides]] and on the Talmud. Famed for his acidic wit and penetrating genius, he led the towns [[Hasidic Jews]]. His 'competitor', the leader of the local [[Misnagdim]] (non-Hasidic Jews) was the Rabbi [[Meir Simcha of Dvinsk]] (1843-1926). Rabbi Meir Simcha was also renowned for his work on Maimonides ([[Or Somayach]]) as well as Bible commentary Meshech Chochma. In one famous comment he predicted that since some Jews had assimilated and viewed [[Berlin]] as their '[[Jerusalem]]' they would suffer persecution originating in Berlin.\n\nAnother famous Jewish resident was the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Mark Rothko]]. Born in Daugavpils in 1903 he immigrated at the age of 10 to the [[United States]] where he painted over 800 paintings in his unique style.\n\nJewish Daugavpils came to an end following the Nazi German invasion on June 26, 1941. Falsely claiming that the Jews had conspired to set fire to the town and that they were assisting the Soviet army, the Germans and their Latvian collaborators carried out large executions on June 28\u201329. During July the Jews were enslaved and forced to cut down timber. On July 7\u201311 Einsatzkommando 1b under [[Erich Ehrlinger]] executed many of the remaining Jews. Later in July the 14,000 remaining Jews were forced into a Ghetto along with those from nearby towns. By the end of August an additional 7000 Jews had died at the hands of the Nazis and the Latvian populace. The largest execution took place in November 1941 and was followed by plagues that decimated the few survivors. Only about 1500 Jews remained in the city. These were murdered (again with the aid of the Latvians) on May 1, 1942. When the town was liberated in 1944 only 100 survivors remained of a community of 16,000.

There are 22 primary and secondary schools, four vocational schools, and the Saules [[Art school|College of Art]]. More than 1,000 teachers and engineers graduate from the [[University of Daugavpils]] (formerly Daugavpils Pedagogical University) and the local branch of [[Riga Technical University]] annually.\nThere is also a Polish [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] on Var\u0161avas iela (Warsaw Street).\n\nIn 2007 the [[Daugavpils Theatre]] was restored. There is also one cinema as well as other [[cultural institutions]]. The city exhibition center offers many cultural activities.\n\nThere are also several architectural, historical, and cultural monuments in Daugavpils. The most prominent is the [[Daugavpils fortress]] dating mostly from the 18th and 19th centuries. In April 2013 the [[Mark Rothko Art centre]] was opened in the fortress.\n\n===Historical centre===\nThe historical centre of Daugavpils city is an architectural heritage of national importance (the construction work was carried out in the 19th century according to the project endorsed in St Petersburg in 1826).\nThe historical centre is the greatest attraction of the city and one of the most successful examples of balancing the aspects of ancient and modern times. Daugavpils is one of the few cities in Latvia which can pride itself on a unified ensemble of both classic and eclectic styles. The cultural heritage of architectural, artistic, industrial, and historical monuments combined with the picturesque surroundings create the essence of Daugavpils\u2019 image and endow it with a special charm.\n\nIn 2020 the municipality allocated 70,000 euros for the restoration of eight historical buildings, including [[Art Nouveau]] and red brick buildings.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/culture/history/daugavpils-to-spend-70000-on-historical-restorations.a349237/ |title=Daugavpils to spend 70,000 on historical restorations |date=21 February 2020 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]] |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Red brick buildings===\n[[File:GimnazjumPolskieDyneburg.JPG|thumb|right|Polish language gymnasium.]]\nDaugavpils is exceptionally rich in red brick buildings. This style was developed by many outstanding architects. In Daugavpils, this variety of eclecticism is most widely represented in the buildings designed by [[Wilhelm Neumann]], an architect of German origin who was the chief architect of the city from 1878 to 1895. Bright examples of brick architecture are the buildings at 1/3 Saules Street and at 8 Muzeja Street. The shape-forming techniques typical of eclecticism that were applied in the fa\u00e7ades of these buildings even many decades later make one appreciate and admire the striking accuracy of detail.\n\n==Transport==\n{{See also|Daugavpils Satiksme}}\n[[File:Dzelzce\u013ca tilts Daugavpil\u012b.jpg|thumb|right|Daugavpils rail bridge.]]\n''Daugavpils satiksme AS'' oversees the city's autobus and tram networks.\n\nThe [[Daugavpils Station|city's railway station]] is the terminus of the [[Riga\u2013Daugavpils Railway]]. There is a train connection to Vilnius during the weekends.\n\n[[Daugavpils International Airport]] is located {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of Daugavpils, near the village of [[Lociki]].\nThe airport was denationalized in 1993 and since 2005 there exists an ongoing project to redevelop the former military facility to allow both international and domestic passenger traffic, as well as international and domestic cargo transport and [[Charter airline|charter flights]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daugavpils.lv/index.php?load=780&set_lang=en |title=Daugavpils &#124; |publisher=Daugavpils.lv |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daugavpils.lv/?load=1&newsId=7858 |title=Daugavpils &#124; |publisher=Daugavpils.lv |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Daugavpils City Council}}\n[[File:Daugavpils city hall.jpg|thumb|Daugavpils City Hall]]\nThe head of the city government is the mayor of Daugavpils or, literally, 'Council Chairman' (''domes priek\u0161s\u0113d\u0113t\u0101js''). The incumbent since January 2019 is [[Andrejs Elksni\u0146\u0161]] from [[Social Democratic Party \"Harmony\"|Harmony]], albeit coalition talks are still ongoing. It is his second term in office, after his initial term was ended after the coalition broke apart in September 2017 less than a month following the 2017 municipal elections and he was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Rihards Eigims|lv|3=Rihards Eigims}} of the [[Latvian Green Party]] (elected on the \"Our Party\" electoral list). \"Our Party\" governed in coalition with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Latgale Party|lv|3=Latgales partija}} of the previous mayor [[J\u0101nis L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis]]. Eigims was previously mayor from 2001\u20132003 as leader of the [[Light of Latgale]] party and briefly in 2009 as a member of the [[Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party]].\n\nThe Council consists of 15 members who are elected every four years. The [[2017 Latvian municipal elections|most recent election]] was in 2017.\n\n==Economy==\nDuring the Soviet time, the city was well industrialised with a number of prominent large manufacturing units. However, nowadays only a few of those have remained still working. The city council is trying to attract new investments and thus created a number of free industrial zones around the whole city that might be interesting due to the strategically efficient geographical position of the city close to the Russian, Belarusian and Lithuanian borders.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Daugavpils Multifunctional Sports Complex.jpg|right|thumb|Daugavpils Olympic Centre]]\n{{See also|Speedway Grand Prix of Latvia}}\nThe [[Association football|football]] clubs [[FC Daugava]] and [[BFC Daugavpils]] play at [[Celtnieks Stadium]] in Daugavpils.

It is defined by an [[intelligence quotient|IQ]] [[IQ classification#Classification of low-IQ individuals|under 70]], in addition to deficits in two or more [[adaptive behavior]]s that affect everyday, general living.\n\nOnce focused almost entirely on [[cognition]], the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to an individual's functional skills in their daily environment. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may still not be considered to have intellectual disability.\n\nIntellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral [[signs and symptoms]] are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. [[Down syndrome]] and [[fragile X syndrome]] are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.\n\n<!-- Epidemiology -->\nIntellectual disability affects about 2\u20133% of the general population.<ref name=AFP /> Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability.<ref name=AFP /> Non-syndromic, or [[idiopathic]] cases account for 30\u201350% of these cases.<ref name=AFP /> About a quarter of cases are caused by a [[genetic disorder]],<ref name=AFP>{{cite journal |vauthors=Daily DK, Ardinger HH, Holmes GE |title=Identification and evaluation of mental retardation |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1059\u201367, 1070 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10706158 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000215/1059.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204003921/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000215/1059.html |archivedate=2010-12-04 }}</ref> and about 5% of cases are [[hereditary|inherited from a person's parents]].<ref name=gale/> Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people {{as of|2013|lc=y}}.<ref name=GBD2015>{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990\u20132013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=5 June 2015|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743\u2013800}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n\nIntellectual disability (ID) becomes apparent during childhood and involves deficits in mental abilities, social skills, and core [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs) when compared to same-aged peers.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{citation|title=Intellectual disability|website=MedlinePlus|first=Neil K.|last=Kaneshiro|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001523.htm|accessdate=October 27, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028153231/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001523.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2016}}</ref> There often are no physical signs of mild forms of ID, although there may be characteristic physical traits when it is associated with a genetic disorder (e.g., Down syndrome).<ref name=\"DSM-5\"/>\n\nThe level of impairment ranges in severity for each person.

People with mild ID are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve. They can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system. As individuals with intellectual disability reach adulthood, many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment.<ref name=AFP />\n\nModerate ID (IQ 35\u201349) is nearly always apparent within the first years of life. [[Speech delay]]s are particularly common signs of moderate ID. People with moderate intellectual disability need considerable supports in school, at home, and in the community in order to fully participate. While their academic potential is limited, they can learn simple health and safety skills and to participate in simple activities. As adults, they may live with their parents, in a supportive [[group home]], or even semi-independently with significant supportive services to help them, for example, manage their finances. As adults, they may work in a [[sheltered workshop]].<ref name=AFP />\n\nPeople with Severe (IQ 20\u201334) or Profound ID (IQ 19 or below) need more intensive support and supervision for their entire lives. They may learn some ADLs, but an intellectual disability is considered severe or profound when individuals are unable to independently care for themselves without ongoing significant assistance from a caregiver throughout adulthood.<ref name=AFP /> Individuals with profound ID are completely dependent on others for all ADLs and to maintain their physical health and safety.

Likewise, those with ID that are mistaken to have ASD may be treated for symptoms of a disorder they do not have. Differentiating between these two disorders will allow clinicians to deliver or prescribe the appropriate treatments. Comorbidity between ID and ASD is very common; roughly 40% of those with ID also have ASD and roughly 70% of those with ASD also have ID.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 0.1016/j.ridd.2009.06.003}}</ref> Both ASD and ID require shortfalls in communication and social awareness as defining criteria.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10578-016-0681-0 | volume=48 | title=DSM Criteria that Best Differentiate Intellectual Disability from Autism Spectrum Disorder | year=2017 | journal=Child Psychiatry & Human Development | pages=537\u2013545 | author=Pedersen Anita L., Pettygrove Sydney, Lu Zhenqiang, Andrews Jennifer, Meaney F.

In addition to those three levels, ID has a fourth classification known as profound.\n\n===== Defining differences =====\nIn a study conducted in 2016 surveying 2816 cases, it was found that the top subsets that help differentiate between those with ID and ASD are, \"...impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity, [...] restricted interests, strict adherence to routines, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, and preoccupation with parts of objects\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Those with ASD tend to show more deficits in non-verbal social behavior such as body language and understanding social cues. In a study done in 2008 of 336 individuals with varying levels of ID, it was found that those with ID display fewer instances of repetitive or ritualistic behaviors. It also recognized that those with ASD, when compared to those with ID, were more likely to isolate themselves and make less eye contact.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10882-007-9086-0 | volume=20 | title=Stereotypy in Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders: Relationship and Diagnostic Fidelity | year=2008 | journal=Journal of Developmental and Physical Disabilities | pages=155\u2013165 | author=Matson Johnny L., Dempsey Timothy}}</ref> When it comes to classification ID and ASD have very different guidelines. ID has a standardized assessment called the Supports Intensity Scale (SIS), this measures severity on a system built around how much support an individual will need. While ASD also classifies severity by support needed there is no standard assessment, clinicians are free to diagnose severity at their own judgment.<ref>Boat TF, Wu JT. (2015).

In general, people with intellectual disability have an IQ below 70, but clinical discretion may be necessary for individuals who have a somewhat higher IQ but severe impairment in adaptive functioning.<ref name=\"DSM-5\" />\n\nIt is formally diagnosed by an assessment of IQ and adaptive behavior. A third condition requiring onset during the developmental period is used to distinguish intellectual disability from other conditions, such as [[traumatic brain injuries]] and [[dementia]]s (including [[Alzheimer's disease]]).\n\n===Intelligence quotient===\nThe first English-language [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] test, the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]], was adapted from a test battery designed for school placement by [[Alfred Binet]] in France. [[Lewis Terman]] adapted Binet's test and promoted it as a test measuring \"general intelligence.\" Terman's test was the first widely used mental test to report scores in \"intelligence quotient\" form (\"mental age\" divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100). Current tests are scored in \"deviation IQ\" form, with a performance level by a test-taker two standard deviations below the median score for the test-taker's age group defined as IQ 70. Until the most recent revision of diagnostic standards, an IQ of 70 or below was a primary factor for intellectual disability diagnosis, and IQ scores were used to categorize degrees of intellectual disability.\n\nSince current diagnosis of intellectual disability is not based on IQ scores alone, but must also take into consideration a person's adaptive functioning, the diagnosis is not made rigidly. It encompasses intellectual scores, adaptive functioning scores from an adaptive behavior rating scale based on descriptions of known abilities provided by someone familiar with the person, and also the observations of the assessment examiner who is able to find out directly from the person what he or she can understand, communicate, and such like. IQ assessment must be based on a current test. This enables diagnosis to avoid the pitfall of the [[Flynn effect]], which is a consequence of changes in population IQ test performance changing IQ test norms over time.\n\n===Distinction from other disabilities===\n[[Clinical psychology|Clinically]], intellectual disability is a subtype of [[cognitive deficit]] or [[disabilities affecting intellectual abilities]], which is a broader concept and includes intellectual deficits that are too mild to properly qualify as intellectual disability, or too specific (as in [[specific learning disability]]), or acquired later in life through [[acquired brain injuries]] or [[neurodegenerative diseases]] like [[dementia]]. Cognitive deficits  may appear at any age. [[Developmental disability]] is any disability that is due to problems with [[human development (biology)|growth and development]]. This term encompasses many [[congenital medical condition]]s that have no mental or intellectual components, although it, too, is sometimes used as a euphemism for intellectual disability.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lawyer |first=Liz |date=2010-11-26 |url=http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20101126/NEWS01/11260346/Rosa+s+Law+to+remove+stigmatized+language+from+law+books |title=Rosa's Law to remove stigmatized language from law books |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=The Ithaca Journal |accessdate=2010-12-04 |quote=The resolution ... urges a change from the old term to \"developmental disability\" }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Limitations in more than one area===\nAdaptive behavior, or adaptive functioning, refers to the skills needed to live independently (or at the minimally acceptable level for age). To assess adaptive behavior, professionals compare the functional abilities of a child to those of other children of similar age. To measure adaptive behavior, professionals use structured interviews, with which they systematically elicit information about persons' functioning in the community from people who know them well. There are many adaptive behavior scales, and accurate assessment of the quality of someone's adaptive behavior requires clinical judgment as well. Certain skills are important to adaptive behavior, such as:\n\n* [[Daily living skills]], such as getting dressed, using the bathroom, and feeding oneself\n* [[Communication]] skills, such as understanding what is said and being able to answer\n* [[Social skills]] with peers, [[family]] members, spouses, adults, and others\n\nOther specific skills can be critical to an individual's inclusion in the community and to developing appropriate social behaviours, as for example being aware of the different social expectations linked to the principal lifespan stages (i.e., childhood, adulthood, old age). The results of a Swiss study suggest that the performance of adults with ID in recognizing different lifespan stages is related to specific cognitive abilities and to the type of material used to test this performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Straccia|first=Claudio|last2=Tessari Veyre|first2=Aline|last3=Bernasconi|first3=Francois|last4=Petitpierre|first4=Genevi\u00e8ve|date=2019-04-11|title=Examining lifespan stage recognition abilities among adults with intellectual disability|journal=Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability|language=en|pages=1\u20139|doi=10.3109/13668250.2019.1580116|issn=1366-8250|volume=45}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nBy most definitions, intellectual disability is more accurately considered a ''disability'' rather than a ''disease''. Intellectual disability can be distinguished in many ways from [[mental illness]], such as [[schizophrenia]] or [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Currently, there is no \"cure\" for an established disability, though with appropriate support and teaching, most individuals can learn to do many things. Causes, such as congenital hypothyroidism, if detected early may be treated to prevent development of an intellectual disability.<ref name=Rey2015/>\n\nThere are thousands of agencies around the world that provide assistance for people with developmental disabilities. They include state-run, for-profit, and non-profit, privately run agencies. Within one agency there could be departments that include fully staffed residential homes, day rehabilitation programs that approximate schools, workshops wherein people with disabilities can obtain jobs, programs that assist people with developmental disabilities in obtaining jobs in the community, programs that provide support for people with developmental disabilities who have their own apartments, programs that assist them with raising their children, and many more. There are also many agencies and programs for parents of children with developmental disabilities.\n\nBeyond that, there are specific programs that people with developmental disabilities can take part in wherein they learn basic life skills. These \"goals\" may take a much longer amount of time for them to accomplish, but the ultimate goal is independence. This may be anything from independence in tooth brushing to an independent residence. People with developmental disabilities learn throughout their lives and can obtain many new skills even late in life with the help of their families, caregivers, clinicians and the people who coordinate the efforts of all of these people.\n\nThere are four broad areas of intervention that allow for active participation from caregivers, community members, clinicians, and of course, the individual(s) with an intellectual disability. These include psychosocial treatments, behavioral treatments, cognitive-behavioral treatments, and family-oriented strategies.<ref>Mash, E., & Wolfe, D. (2013). Abnormal child psychology.

The [[Mongolian People's Republic]] requested that the medical community cease use of the term as a referent to intellectual disability. Their request was granted in the 1960s, when the World Health Organization agreed that the term should cease being used within the medical community.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman| year=1979|title=On the diagnostic term \"Down's disease\" |journal=Medical History |volume=23 |issue=1|pages=102\u201304 |pmid=153994|pmc=1082401 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300051048}}</ref>\n* In the field of [[special education]], '''educable''' (or \"educable intellectual disability\") refers to ID students with IQs of approximately 50\u201375 who can progress academically to a late elementary level. '''Trainable''' (or \"trainable intellectual disability\") refers to students whose IQs fall below 50 but who are still capable of learning [[Hygiene|personal hygiene]] and other living skills in a sheltered setting, such as a group home. In many areas, these terms have been replaced by use of \"moderate\" and \"severe\" intellectual disability. While the names change, the meaning stays roughly the same in practice.\n* '''[[Retard (pejorative)|Retarded]]''' comes from the Latin ''retardare'', \"to make slow, delay, keep back, or hinder,\" so ''mental retardation'' meant the same as ''mentally delayed''. The term was recorded in 1426 as a \"fact or action of making slower in movement or time\". The first record of retarded in relation to being mentally slow was in 1895. The term ''mentally retarded'' was used to replace terms like ''idiot'', ''moron'', and ''imbecile'' because ''retarded'' was not then a derogatory term. By the 1960s, however, the term had taken on a partially derogatory meaning as well. The noun ''retard'' is particularly seen as pejorative; a [[BBC]] survey in 2003 ranked it as the most offensive disability-related word, ahead of terms such as ''[[spastic]]'' (or its abbreviation ''spaz'') and [[Mongoloid race#Criticism|mong]].<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Worst Word Vote  | work = Ouch  | publisher = BBC  | year = 2003  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/yourspace/worstwords/  | accessdate = 2007-08-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070320214418/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/yourspace/worstwords/<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-20}}</ref> The terms ''mentally retarded'' and ''mental retardation'' are still fairly common, but currently the [[Special Olympics]], [[Best Buddies]], and over 100 other organizations are striving to eliminate their use by referring to the word ''retard'' and its variants as the \"r-word\", in an effort to equate it to the word ''nigger'' and the associated euphemism \"[[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|n-word]]\", in everyday conversation. These efforts have resulted in federal legislation, sometimes known as \"Rosa's Law\", to replace the term ''mentally retarded'' with the term ''intellectual disability'' in some federal statutes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/coalition.aspx |title=SpecialOlympics.org |publisher=SpecialOlympics.org |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730053646/http://www.specialolympics.org/coalition.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-30 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://r-word.org/ |title=R-Word.org |publisher=R-Word.org |date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629101917/http://www.r-word.org/ |archivedate=2010-06-29 }}</ref><br>The term ''mental retardation'' was a diagnostic term denoting the group of disconnected categories of mental functioning such as ''[[idiot]]'', ''[[imbecile]]'', and ''[[moron (psychology)|moron]]'' derived from early IQ tests, which acquired [[pejorative]] connotations in popular discourse. It acquired negative and shameful connotations over the last few decades due to the use of the words ''retarded'' and ''retard'' as insults. This may have contributed to its replacement with euphemisms such as ''mentally challenged'' or ''intellectually disabled''. While ''[[developmental disability]]'' includes many other disorders, ''developmental disability'' and ''developmental delay'' (for people under the age of 18) are generally considered more polite terms than ''mental retardation''.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:President Trump Meets with Members of Team USA for the 2019 Special Olympics World Games (48317653106).jpg|thumb|[[Special Olympics]] USA team in July 2019]] \n* In [[North America]], intellectual disability is subsumed into the broader term ''[[developmental disability]]'', which also includes [[epilepsy in children|epilepsy]], [[autism spectrum|autism]], [[cerebral palsy]], and other disorders that develop during the developmental period (birth to age 18). Because service provision is tied to the designation \"developmental disability\", it is used by many parents, direct support professionals, and physicians. In the United States, however, in school-based settings, the more specific term ''mental retardation'' or, more recently (and preferably), ''intellectual disability'', is still typically used, and is one of 13 categories of disability under which children may be identified for special education services under Public Law 108-446.\n* The phrase ''intellectual disability'' is increasingly being used as a synonym for people with significantly below-average cognitive ability. These terms are sometimes used as a means of separating general intellectual limitations from specific, limited deficits as well as indicating that it is not an emotional or psychological disability. It is not specific to congenital disorders such as [[Down syndrome]].\n\nThe American Association on Mental Retardation changed its name to the [[American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities]] (AAIDD) in 2007, and soon thereafter changed the names of its scholarly journals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aaidd.org/publications/journals|title=Journals|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140821135338/http://aaidd.org/publications/journals|archivedate=2014-08-21}}</ref> to reflect the term \"intellectual disability\".

The [[self-advocacy movement]] promotes the right of self-determination and [[self-direction]] by people with intellectually disabilities, which means allowing them to make decisions about their own lives.\n\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, people with intellectual disabilities were routinely excluded from public education, or educated away from other typically developing children.

[[Down syndrome]] and [[fragile X syndrome]] are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.\n\n<!-- Epidemiology -->\nIntellectual disability affects about 2\u20133% of the general population.<ref name=AFP /> Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability.<ref name=AFP /> Non-syndromic, or [[idiopathic]] cases account for 30\u201350% of these cases.<ref name=AFP /> About a quarter of cases are caused by a [[genetic disorder]],<ref name=AFP>{{cite journal |vauthors=Daily DK, Ardinger HH, Holmes GE |title=Identification and evaluation of mental retardation |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=61 |issue=4 |pages=1059\u201367, 1070 |date=February 2000 |pmid=10706158 |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000215/1059.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204003921/http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000215/1059.html |archivedate=2010-12-04 }}</ref> and about 5% of cases are [[hereditary|inherited from a person's parents]].<ref name=gale/> Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people {{as of|2013|lc=y}}.<ref name=GBD2015>{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990\u20132013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=5 June 2015|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743\u2013800}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n\nIntellectual disability (ID) becomes apparent during childhood and involves deficits in mental abilities, social skills, and core [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs) when compared to same-aged peers.<ref name=MedlinePlus>{{citation|title=Intellectual disability|website=MedlinePlus|first=Neil K.|last=Kaneshiro|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001523.htm|accessdate=October 27, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028153231/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001523.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2016}}</ref> There often are no physical signs of mild forms of ID, although there may be characteristic physical traits when it is associated with a genetic disorder (e.g., Down syndrome).<ref name=\"DSM-5\"/>\n\nThe level of impairment ranges in severity for each person.

People with mild ID are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve. They can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system. As individuals with intellectual disability reach adulthood, many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment.<ref name=AFP />\n\nModerate ID (IQ 35\u201349) is nearly always apparent within the first years of life. [[Speech delay]]s are particularly common signs of moderate ID. People with moderate intellectual disability need considerable supports in school, at home, and in the community in order to fully participate. While their academic potential is limited, they can learn simple health and safety skills and to participate in simple activities. As adults, they may live with their parents, in a supportive [[group home]], or even semi-independently with significant supportive services to help them, for example, manage their finances. As adults, they may work in a [[sheltered workshop]].<ref name=AFP />\n\nPeople with Severe (IQ 20\u201334) or Profound ID (IQ 19 or below) need more intensive support and supervision for their entire lives. They may learn some ADLs, but an intellectual disability is considered severe or profound when individuals are unable to independently care for themselves without ongoing significant assistance from a caregiver throughout adulthood.<ref name=AFP /> Individuals with profound ID are completely dependent on others for all ADLs and to maintain their physical health and safety. They may be able to learn to participate in some of these activities to limited degree.<ref name=\"DSM-5\"/>\n=== Co-morbidity===\n\n==== Autism and intellectual disability ====\nIntellectual disability and [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD) share clinical characteristics which can result in confusion while diagnosing.<ref>Pedersen, A.L., Pettygrove, S., Lu, Z. et al. (2017) DSM Criteria that Best Differentiate Intellectual Disability from Autism Spectrum Disorder, Springer Science+Business Media, 48: 537-545. doi:10.1007/s10578-016-0681-0</ref> Overlapping these two disorders, while common, can be detrimental to a person's well being. Those with ASD that hold symptoms of ID may be grouped into a co-diagnosis in which they are receiving treatment for a disorder they do not have. Likewise, those with ID that are mistaken to have ASD may be treated for symptoms of a disorder they do not have. Differentiating between these two disorders will allow clinicians to deliver or prescribe the appropriate treatments. Comorbidity between ID and ASD is very common; roughly 40% of those with ID also have ASD and roughly 70% of those with ASD also have ID.<ref>Matson, J. L., & Shoemaker, M. (2009, July 14) Intellectual disability and its relationship to autism spectrum disorders, Elsevier Ltd, 1107-1114. doi:10.1016/j.ridd.2009.06.003</ref> Both ASD and ID require shortfalls in communication and social awareness as defining criteria.<ref>Pedersen, A.L., Pettygrove, S., Lu, Z. et al.

In addition to those three levels, ID has a fourth classification known as profound.\n\n===== Defining differences =====\nIn a study conducted in 2016 surveying 2816 cases, it was found that the top subsets that help differentiate between those with ID and ASD are, \"...impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity, [...] restricted interests, strict adherence to routines, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, and preoccupation with parts of objects\".<ref> Pedersen, A.L., Pettygrove, S., Lu, Z. et al. (2017) DSM Criteria that Best Differentiate Intellectual Disability from Autism Spectrum Disorder, Springer Science+Business Media, 48: 537-545. doi:10.1007/s10578-016-0681-0</ref> Those with ASD tend to show more deficits in non-verbal social behavior such as body language and understanding social cues. In a study done in 2008 of 336 individuals with varying levels of ID, it was found that those with ID display fewer instances of repetitive or ritualistic behaviors. It also recognized that those with ASD, when compared to those with ID, were more likely to isolate themselves and make less eye contact.<ref> Matson, J. L., & Dempsey T.

ID has a standardized assessment called the Supports Intensity Scale (SIS), this measures severity on a system built around how much support an individual will need. While ASD also classifies severity by support needed there is no standard assessment, clinicians are free to diagnose severity at their own judgment.<ref>Boat TF, Wu JT. (2015).

In general, people with intellectual disability have an IQ below 70, but clinical discretion may be necessary for individuals who have a somewhat higher IQ but severe impairment in adaptive functioning.<ref name=\"DSM-5\" />\n\nIt is formally diagnosed by an assessment of IQ and adaptive behavior. A third condition requiring onset during the developmental period is used to distinguish intellectual disability from other conditions, such as [[traumatic brain injuries]] and [[dementia|dementias]] (including [[Alzheimer's disease]]).\n\n===Intelligence quotient===\nThe first English-language [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] test, the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]], was adapted from a test battery designed for school placement by [[Alfred Binet]] in France. [[Lewis Terman]] adapted Binet's test and promoted it as a test measuring \"general intelligence.\" Terman's test was the first widely used mental test to report scores in \"intelligence quotient\" form (\"mental age\" divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100). Current tests are scored in \"deviation IQ\" form, with a performance level by a test-taker two standard deviations below the median score for the test-taker's age group defined as IQ 70. Until the most recent revision of diagnostic standards, an IQ of 70 or below was a primary factor for intellectual disability diagnosis, and IQ scores were used to categorize degrees of intellectual disability.\n\nSince current diagnosis of intellectual disability is not based on IQ scores alone, but must also take into consideration a person's adaptive functioning, the diagnosis is not made rigidly. It encompasses intellectual scores, adaptive functioning scores from an adaptive behavior rating scale based on descriptions of known abilities provided by someone familiar with the person, and also the observations of the assessment examiner who is able to find out directly from the person what he or she can understand, communicate, and such like. IQ assessment must be based on a current test. This enables diagnosis to avoid the pitfall of the [[Flynn effect]], which is a consequence of changes in population IQ test performance changing IQ test norms over time.\n\n===Distinction from other disabilities===\n[[Clinical psychology|Clinically]], intellectual disability is a subtype of [[cognitive deficit]] or [[disabilities affecting intellectual abilities]], which is a broader concept and includes intellectual deficits that are too mild to properly qualify as intellectual disability, or too specific (as in [[specific learning disability]]), or acquired later in life through [[acquired brain injuries]] or [[neurodegenerative diseases]] like [[dementia]]. Cognitive deficits  may appear at any age. [[Developmental disability]] is any disability that is due to problems with [[human development (biology)|growth and development]]. This term encompasses many [[congenital medical condition]]s that have no mental or intellectual components, although it, too, is sometimes used as a euphemism for intellectual disability.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lawyer |first=Liz |date=2010-11-26 |url=http://www.theithacajournal.com/article/20101126/NEWS01/11260346/Rosa+s+Law+to+remove+stigmatized+language+from+law+books |title=Rosa's Law to remove stigmatized language from law books |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=The Ithaca Journal |accessdate=2010-12-04 |quote=The resolution ... urges a change from the old term to \"developmental disability\" }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Limitations in more than one area===\nAdaptive behavior, or adaptive functioning, refers to the skills needed to live independently (or at the minimally acceptable level for age). To assess adaptive behavior, professionals compare the functional abilities of a child to those of other children of similar age. To measure adaptive behavior, professionals use structured interviews, with which they systematically elicit information about persons' functioning in the community from people who know them well. There are many adaptive behavior scales, and accurate assessment of the quality of someone's adaptive behavior requires clinical judgment as well. Certain skills are important to adaptive behavior, such as:\n\n* [[Daily living skills]], such as getting dressed, using the bathroom, and feeding oneself\n* [[Communication]] skills, such as understanding what is said and being able to answer\n* [[Social skills]] with peers, [[family]] members, spouses, adults, and others\n\nOther specific skills can be critical to an individual's inclusion in the community and to developing appropriate social behaviours, as for example being aware of the different social expectations linked to the principal lifespan stages (i.e., childhood, adulthood, old age). The results of a Swiss study suggest that the performance of adults with ID in recognizing different lifespan stages is related to specific cognitive abilities and to the type of material used to test this performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Straccia|first=Claudio|last2=Tessari Veyre|first2=Aline|last3=Bernasconi|first3=Francois|last4=Petitpierre|first4=Genevi\u00e8ve|date=2019-04-11|title=Examining lifespan stage recognition abilities among adults with intellectual disability|journal=Journal of Intellectual & Developmental Disability|language=en|pages=1\u20139|doi=10.3109/13668250.2019.1580116|issn=1366-8250}}</ref>\n\n==Management==\nBy most definitions, intellectual disability is more accurately considered a ''disability'' rather than a ''disease''. Intellectual disability can be distinguished in many ways from [[mental illness]], such as [[schizophrenia]] or [[Clinical depression|depression]]. Currently, there is no \"cure\" for an established disability, though with appropriate support and teaching, most individuals can learn to do many things. Causes, such as congenital hypothyroidism, if detected early may be treated to prevent development of an intellectual disability.<ref name=Rey2015/>\n\nThere are thousands of agencies around the world that provide assistance for people with developmental disabilities. They include state-run, for-profit, and non-profit, privately run agencies. Within one agency there could be departments that include fully staffed residential homes, day rehabilitation programs that approximate schools, workshops wherein people with disabilities can obtain jobs, programs that assist people with developmental disabilities in obtaining jobs in the community, programs that provide support for people with developmental disabilities who have their own apartments, programs that assist them with raising their children, and many more. There are also many agencies and programs for parents of children with developmental disabilities.\n\nBeyond that, there are specific programs that people with developmental disabilities can take part in wherein they learn basic life skills. These \"goals\" may take a much longer amount of time for them to accomplish, but the ultimate goal is independence. This may be anything from independence in tooth brushing to an independent residence. People with developmental disabilities learn throughout their lives and can obtain many new skills even late in life with the help of their families, caregivers, clinicians and the people who coordinate the efforts of all of these people.\n\nThere are four broad areas of intervention that allow for active participation from caregivers, community members, clinicians, and of course, the individual(s) with an intellectual disability. These include psychosocial treatments, behavioral treatments, cognitive-behavioral treatments, and family-oriented strategies.<ref>Mash, E., & Wolfe, D. (2013). Abnormal child psychology.

The [[Mongolian People's Republic]] requested that the medical community cease use of the term as a referent to intellectual disability. Their request was granted in the 1960s, when the World Health Organization agreed that the term should cease being used within the medical community.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Howard-Jones |first=Norman| year=1979|title=On the diagnostic term \"Down's disease\" |journal=Medical History |volume=23 |issue=1|pages=102\u201304 |pmid=153994|pmc=1082401 |doi=10.1017/s0025727300051048}}</ref>\n* In the field of [[special education]], '''educable''' (or \"educable intellectual disability\") refers to ID students with IQs of approximately 50\u201375 who can progress academically to a late elementary level. '''Trainable''' (or \"trainable intellectual disability\") refers to students whose IQs fall below 50 but who are still capable of learning [[Hygiene|personal hygiene]] and other living skills in a sheltered setting, such as a group home. In many areas, these terms have been replaced by use of \"moderate\" and \"severe\" intellectual disability. While the names change, the meaning stays roughly the same in practice.\n* '''[[Retard (pejorative)|Retarded]]''' comes from the Latin ''retardare'', \"to make slow, delay, keep back, or hinder,\" so ''mental retardation'' meant the same as ''mentally delayed''. The term was recorded in 1426 as a \"fact or action of making slower in movement or time\". The first record of retarded in relation to being mentally slow was in 1895. The term ''mentally retarded'' was used to replace terms like ''idiot'', ''moron'', and ''imbecile'' because ''retarded'' was not then a derogatory term. By the 1960s, however, the term had taken on a partially derogatory meaning as well. The noun ''retard'' is particularly seen as pejorative; a [[BBC]] survey in 2003 ranked it as the most offensive disability-related word, ahead of terms such as ''[[spastic]]'' (or its abbreviation ''spaz'') and [[Mongoloid race#Criticism|mong]].<ref>{{Cite web  | title = Worst Word Vote  | work = Ouch  | publisher = BBC  | year = 2003  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/yourspace/worstwords/  | accessdate = 2007-08-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070320214418/http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/yourspace/worstwords/<!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-03-20}}</ref> The terms ''mentally retarded'' and ''mental retardation'' are still fairly common, but currently the [[Special Olympics]], [[Best Buddies]], and over 100 other organizations are striving to eliminate their use by referring to the word ''retard'' and its variants as the \"r-word\", in an effort to equate it to the word ''nigger'' and the associated euphemism \"[[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|n-word]]\", in everyday conversation. These efforts have resulted in federal legislation, sometimes known as \"Rosa's Law\", to replace the term ''mentally retarded'' with the term ''intellectual disability'' in some federal statutes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.specialolympics.org/coalition.aspx |title=SpecialOlympics.org |publisher=SpecialOlympics.org |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730053646/http://www.specialolympics.org/coalition.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-30 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://r-word.org/ |title=R-Word.org |publisher=R-Word.org |date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2010-06-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629101917/http://www.r-word.org/ |archivedate=2010-06-29 }}</ref><br>The term ''mental retardation'' was a diagnostic term denoting the group of disconnected categories of mental functioning such as ''[[idiot]]'', ''[[imbecile]]'', and ''[[moron (psychology)|moron]]'' derived from early IQ tests, which acquired [[pejorative]] connotations in popular discourse. It acquired negative and shameful connotations over the last few decades due to the use of the words ''retarded'' and ''retard'' as insults. This may have contributed to its replacement with euphemisms such as ''mentally challenged'' or ''intellectually disabled''. While ''[[developmental disability]]'' includes many other disorders, ''developmental disability'' and ''developmental delay'' (for people under the age of 18) are generally considered more polite terms than ''mental retardation''.\n\n====United States====\n[[File:President Trump Meets with Members of Team USA for the 2019 Special Olympics World Games (48317653106).jpg|thumb|[[Special Olympics]] USA team in July 2019]] \n* In [[North America]], intellectual disability is subsumed into the broader term ''[[developmental disability]]'', which also includes [[epilepsy in children|epilepsy]], [[autism spectrum|autism]], [[cerebral palsy]], and other disorders that develop during the developmental period (birth to age 18). Because service provision is tied to the designation \"developmental disability\", it is used by many parents, direct support professionals, and physicians. In the United States, however, in school-based settings, the more specific term ''mental retardation'' or, more recently (and preferably), ''intellectual disability'', is still typically used, and is one of 13 categories of disability under which children may be identified for special education services under Public Law 108-446.\n* The phrase ''intellectual disability'' is increasingly being used as a synonym for people with significantly below-average cognitive ability. These terms are sometimes used as a means of separating general intellectual limitations from specific, limited deficits as well as indicating that it is not an emotional or psychological disability. It is not specific to congenital disorders such as [[Down syndrome]].\n\nThe American Association on Mental Retardation changed its name to the [[American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities]] (AAIDD) in 2007, and soon thereafter changed the names of its scholarly journals<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aaidd.org/publications/journals|title=Journals|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140821135338/http://aaidd.org/publications/journals|archivedate=2014-08-21}}</ref> to reflect the term \"intellectual disability\".

Sivachandra Chakravarty and Monomohini Devi were his father and mother respectively. As a young medical student in Calcutta, Anukulchandra started serving and treating the slum dwellers in 1911. After six years of study, he came back to Himaitpur and began to practice medicine.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dpublication.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iachss-121-231.pdf|title=Diamond Scientific Publication|website=dpublication.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Anukulchandra was spiritually initiated by his mother. After his initiation, he along with his friends and companions started doing intense [[kirtan]]. During kirtan, he often went into a state of trance, fell on the ground unconsciously and uttered messages in that condition. His going into trance during kirtan, delivering holy messages during trance and the devotion of those around him started attracting many more people. As a number of people came to his village to visit him began to settle permanently, gradually his village home was converted into an ashram.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThakur Anukulchandra's service to the people as a doctor, his speaking in tongues in a state of trance as well as his advice and guidance to his followers helped him secure a position as a religious leader. The personality, life and teachings of Thakur Anukulchandra mediates between science and spirituality, personal affirmation and self-transformation, individualism and social commitment has put him in the class of [[prophet]]s or [[avatar]]s of the Indian religious tradition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> His devotees address him as ''Yuga Purushottam'' or the '''Prophet of the modern age'''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Philosophy and teachings===\nThakur Anukulchandra's [[Philosophy and Teachings of Thakur Anukulchandra|teachings and philosophy]] is based on the Being and Becoming of every living creature.

He says, ''the stay of all existence is dharma''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/> His philosophy teaches individuals how to approach the life's problems in a balanced, dynamic, rationalistic and scientific way. According to him, the formula of spiritual enlightenment is to lead and practice a simple but meaningful Ideal centric life, i.e. making a realized living ideal as the guide or center of one's life.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> According to him, ''\"Ideal means- who enrich the past, enliven the present and enlighten the future.\"''<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHe opined that, everything that humans do both individually and collectively must be beneficial to the human existence in their entirety.

Several volumes of the discourses have been published by the in-house publication house of Satsang. About the answers to the questions asked to him, Thakur Anukulchandra clarified as below:<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\"I have answered to thy quest\nwhat I see, what I think and what I know\nto be beneficial to our life and growth\nwith every blazing outspoken reply\nas far as I conceive.\"</poem>}}'' \n\n[[File:Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur Bungalow.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur bungalow, Satsang Ashram]]\n[[File:Main Gate of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Badlapur.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Badlapur, Mumbai, Maharashtra]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Delhi]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha]]\n[[File:Hyderabad Satsang Vihar.jpg|thumb|Hyderabad Satsang Vihar, Telangana]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bengaluru]]\n[[File:Satsang Centre at West Hartford, Connecticut, USA .jpg|thumb|Satsang Centre, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Chennai.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Chennai]]\n\n==The motto and the principles==\nSatsang was established solely on the principles and ideals of Thakur Anukulchandra. It is a non-sectarian organization as revealed by the Guru himself in his hand written book '''Satyanusaran''' originally in Bengali and later translated in to many languages including English as 'The pursuit of Truth'.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.satsang.org.in/index.php?p=satyanusaran|title=Satyanusaran|website=satsang.org.in}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this book, he writes, ''\"Oh Mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to the past prophets. Be attached to your living Master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past Prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present\"''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He again writes, ''\"Dharma never becomes many. It is always one. There is no variety of it. Views may be many- even as many as there are people. In my opinion, to speak of Hindu Dharma, Christian Dharma, Mohammedan Dharma, Buddhist Dharma etc. is wrong; rather they are so many views\"''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAs a result, people from all faiths including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims came to Thakur Anukulchandra and accepted him as their realized guide, Guru and living ideal, without diluting their identities. He always preached and guided people of different faiths who came to him to become a true Muslim, true Christian or a true Hindu according to their own faiths and practices.

Sivachandra Chakravarty and Monomohini Devi were his father and mother respectively. As a young medical student in Calcutta, Anukulchandra started serving and treating the slum dwellers in 1911. After six years of study, he came back to Himaitpur and began to practice medicine.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dpublication.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/iachss-121-231.pdf|title=Diamond Scientific Publication|website=dpublication.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Anukulchandra was spiritually initiated by his mother. After his initiation, he along with his friends and companions started doing intense [[kirtan]]. During kirtan, he often went into a state of trance, fell on the ground unconsciously and uttered messages in that condition. His going into trance during kirtan, delivering holy messages during trance and the devotion of those around him started attracting many more people. As a number of people came to his village to visit him began to settle permanently, gradually his village home was converted into an ashram.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThakur Anukulchandra's service to the people as a doctor, his speaking in tongues in a state of trance as well as his advice and guidance to his followers helped him secure a position as a religious leader. The personality, life and teachings of Thakur Anukulchandra mediates between science and spirituality, personal affirmation and self-transformation, individualism and social commitment has put him in the class of [[prophet]]s or [[avatar]]s of the Indian religious tradition.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> His devotees address him as ''Yuga Purushottam'' or the '''Prophet of the modern age'''.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n===Philosophy and teachings===\nThakur Anukulchandra's philosophy is based on the Being and Becoming of every living creature. According to him, science and [[Dharma]] are not opposed to each other. He says, ''the stay of all existence is dharma''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto4\"/> His philosophy teaches individuals how to approach the life's problems in a balanced, dynamic, rationalistic and scientific way. According to him, the formula of spiritual enlightenment is to lead and practice a simple but meaningful Ideal centric life, i.e. making a realized living ideal as the guide or center of one's life.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> According to him, ''\"Ideal means- who enrich the past, enliven the present and enlighten the future.\"''<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nHe opined that, everything that humans do both individually and collectively must be beneficial to the human existence in their entirety. According to him-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oldhistoricity.lbp.world/Administrator/UploadedArticle/382.pdf|title=Ideas of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra on Individual and Society|website=Historicity research journal}}</ref>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\u201cThe source of all 'isms' is existentialism \u2013 no existence, no 'ism'.\"</poem>}}''\n\nThakur Anukulchandra has put forward his views and solutions on almost every aspect of life, be it individual, conjugal, family, social and universal. Most of his messages were dictations revealed primarily in [[Bengali Language|Bengali]] and [[English Language|English]] in the form of passages, simple rhymes and poetry and extensive discourses with his disciples and visitors. His messages cover the topics of dharma, religion, spiritualism, ideal, love, service and activity, society, education, philosophy, science, psychology, health and hygine, economics, industry, commerce, politics, law and administration, varnashram, culture and tradition, eugenics, genetics, heredity, marriage, woman, conjugal life, Universal laws and others.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{Cite web|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/282247|title=Educational philosophy of Sri Sri Thakur Anukulchandra and its relevance to modern Indian education, PhD Thesis|website=Shodhganga: A reservoir of Indian theses}}</ref>\n\nHis discourses with people were primarily compilations of him answering to the questions of individuals and groups during his meetings on a daily basis. Several volumes of the discourses have been published by the in-house publication house of Satsang. About the answers to the questions asked to him, Thakur Anukulchandra clarified as below:<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''{{quote|<poem>\"I have answered to thy quest\nwhat I see, what I think and what I know\nto be beneficial to our life and growth\nwith every blazing outspoken reply\nas far as I conceive.\"</poem>}}'' \n\n[[File:Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur Bungalow.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sree Sree Thakur in Thakur bungalow, Satsang Ashram]]\n[[File:Main Gate of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar.jpg|thumb|Entrance of Satsang Ashram, Deoghar]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Badlapur.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Badlapur, Mumbai, Maharashtra]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Delhi.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Delhi]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bhubaneswar, Odisha]]\n[[File:Hyderabad Satsang Vihar.jpg|thumb|Hyderabad Satsang Vihar, Telangana]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Bengaluru]]\n[[File:Satsang Centre at West Hartford, Connecticut, USA .jpg|thumb|Satsang Centre, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA]]\n[[File:Satsang Vihar Chennai.jpg|thumb|Satsang Vihar Chennai]]\n\n==The motto and the principles==\nSatsang was established solely on the principles and ideals of Thakur Anukulchandra. It is a non-sectarian organization as revealed by the Guru himself in his hand written book '''Satyanusaran''' originally in Bengali and later translated in to many languages including English as 'The pursuit of Truth'.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web |url=https://www.satsang.org.in/index.php?p=satyanusaran|title=Satyanusaran|website=satsang.org.in}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> In this book, he writes, ''\"Oh Mankind! If you desire to invoke your good, forget sectarian conflict. Be regardful to the past prophets. Be attached to your living Master or God and take only those who love Him as your own. Because all the past Prophets are consummated in the divine man of the present\"''.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> He again writes, ''\"Dharma never becomes many. It is always one. There is no variety of it. Views may be many- even as many as there are people. In my opinion, to speak of Hindu Dharma, Christian Dharma, Mohammedan Dharma, Buddhist Dharma etc. is wrong; rather they are so many views\"''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nAs a result, people from all faiths including Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims came to Thakur Anukulchandra and accepted him as their realized guide, Guru and living ideal, without diluting their identities. He always preached and guided people of different faiths who came to him to become a true Muslim, true Christian or a true Hindu according to their own faiths and practices. Satsang at present is one of the fastest growing spiritual lineage in the world with more than 80 million members across the globe. It accepts members from all walks of life without discrimination and distinction.

As the adopted son of the exiled [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] [[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao II]], Nana Saheb believed that he was entitled to a pension from the [[East India Company]], but the underlying contractual issues are rather murky. The Company's refusal to continue the pension after his father's death, as well as what he perceived as high-handed policies, compelled him to revolt and seek independence from company rule in India. He forced the British garrison in Cawnpore to surrender, then executed the survivors, gaining control of Cawnpore for a few days. He later disappeared, after his forces were defeated by a British force that recaptured Cawnpore. He went to the Nepal Hills in 1859, where he is thought to have died.\n\n==Early life==\nNana  was born on 19 May 1824 as Nana Govind Dhondu Pant, to Narayan Bhat and Ganga Bai.<ref name=wolpert>Wolert, Stanley. ''A New History of India'' (3rd ed., 1989), pp. 226\u201328. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] defeat in the [[Third Maratha War]], the [[East India Company]] had exiled [[Peshwa]] Baji Rao II to [[Bithoor]] near Cawnpore (now [[Kanpur]]), where he maintained a large establishment paid for in part out of a British pension. Nana's father, a well-educated Deccani Brahmin, had travelled with his family from the [[Western Ghats]] to become a court official of the former Peshwa at Bithoor. Lacking sons, Baji Rao adopted Nana Saheb and his younger brother in 1827. The mother of both children was a sister of one of the Peshwa's wives.<ref name=David>David, Saul. ''The Indian Mutiny'' (published 2003), pp.45\u201346. Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-141-00554-8}}.</ref> Nana Saheb's childhood associates included [[Tantya Tope|Tatya Tope]], [[Azimullah Khan]] and Manikarnika Tambe who later became famous as [[Rani Lakshmibai]]. Tatya Tope was the son of Pandurang Rao Tope, an important noble at the court of the Peshwa Baji Rao II. After Baji Rao II was exiled to Bithoor, Pandurang Rao and his family also shifted there. Tatya Tope was the fencing master to Nana Saheb. Azimullah Khan joined the court of Nana Saheb as Secretary, after the death of [[Baji Rao II]] in 1851. He later became the [[dewan]] in Nana Saheb's court.\n\n==Inheritance==\nThe [[Doctrine of lapse]] was an annexation policy devised by [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], who was the British [[Governor-General of India]] between 1848 and 1856. According to the Doctrine, any princely state or territory under the direct influence (paramountcy) of the British East India Company (the dominant imperial power in the subcontinent), as a vassal state under the British Subsidiary System, would automatically be annexed if the ruler was either \"manifestly incompetent or died without a direct heir\".<ref name=\"keay\">[[John Keay|Keay, John]]. ''India: a history''. New York: Grove Press Books, distributed by Publishers Group West. 2000 {{ISBN|0-8021-3797-0}}, p. 433.</ref> The latter supplanted the long-established legal right of an Indian sovereign without an heir to choose a successor. In addition, the British were to decide whether potential rulers were competent enough. The doctrine and its application were widely regarded by Indians as illegitimate. At that time, the Company had absolute, imperial administrative jurisdiction over many regions spread over the subcontinent. The company took over the princely states of [[Satara (city)|Satara]] (1848), [[Jaipur]] and [[Sambalpur]] (1849), Baghat (1850), [[Nagpur]] (1853), and [[Jhansi]] (1854) using this doctrine. The British took over [[Awadh]] (Oudh) (1856) claiming that the local ruler was not ruling properly. The Company added about four million pounds sterling to its annual revenue by the use of this doctrine.<ref name=\"wolpert\"/> With the increasing power of the East India Company, discontent simmered amongst sections of Indian society and the largely indigenous armed [[Jhansi]] forces; these joined with members of the deposed dynasties during the Indian rebellion of 1857.\n\nUnder the Peshwa's will Nana Saheb was, through his adoption, heir-presumptive to the Maratha's throne, and eligible for his adoptive father's continuing annual pension of \u00a380,000 from the East India Company. However, after the death of Baji Rao II, the Company stopped the pension on the grounds that the Nana was not a natural born heir and that the kingdom no longer existed. The Nana, while still wealthy, was greatly offended by both the termination of the pension and by the suspension of various titles and grants that had been retained by Baji Rao in exile. Accordingly, Nana Saheb sent an envoy ([[Azimullah Khan]]) to England in 1853 to plead his case with the British Government. However, Azimullah Khan was unable to convince the British to resume the pension, and he returned to India in 1855.\n\n==Role in the 1857 uprising ==\n{{main|Siege of Cawnpore}}\n[[File:Nana Sahib Memorial.JPG|thumb|Nana Saheb memorial at Bithoor, which previously had their fort]]\nNana Saheb won the confidence of Charles Hillersdon, the Collector of Kanpur.<ref name=\"britishempire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/mutiny/cawnpore.htm |title=British Empire: Forces: Campaigns: Indian Mutiny, 1857 - 58: The Siege of Cawnpore |publisher=britishempire.co.uk|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It was planned that Nana Saheb would assemble a force of 1,500 soldiers to support the British, in case the rebellion spread to Cawnpore.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brock\n | first = William\n | title = A Biographical Sketch of Sir Henry Havelock, K.

Amid the prevailing chaos in Cawnpore, Nana and his forces entered  the British [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]] situated in the northern part of the town. The soldiers of the 53rd Native Infantry, who were guarding the magazine, thought that Nana had come to guard the magazine on behalf of the Company. However, once he entered the magazine, Nana Saheb announced that he was a participant in the rebellion against the Company, and intended to be a [[vassal]] of [[Bahadur Shah II]].<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/mutiny/cawnpore.htm\n|title=The Indian Mutiny: The Siege of Cawnpore\n|accessdate=11 July 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking possession of the Company treasury, Nana advanced up the [[Grand Trunk Road]] stating that he wanted to restore the [[Maratha confederacy]] under the [[Peshwa]] tradition, and decided to capture Kanpur. On his way, Nana met the rebel Company soldiers at [[Kalianpur|Kalyanpur]]. The soldiers were on their way to Delhi, to meet [[Bahadur Shah II]]. Nana wanted them to go back to Cawnpore, and help him defeat the British. The soldiers were reluctant at first, but decided to join Nana when he promised to double their pay and reward them with gold, if they were to destroy the British entrenchment.\n\n===Attack on Wheeler's entrenchment===\n[[Image:Nana Sahib with his escort.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Nana Saheb with his escort'''. Steel engraved print of 1860, published in ''History of the Indian Mutiny'']]\nOn 5 June 1857, Nana Saheb sent a letter to General Wheeler informing him to expect an attack next morning at 10&nbsp;am. On 6 June, his forces (including the rebel soldiers) attacked the Company entrenchment at 10:30&nbsp;am The Company forces were not adequately prepared for the attack but managed to defend themselves as the attacking forces were reluctant to enter the entrenchment. The Indian forces had been led to believe that the entrenchment had [[gunpowder]]-filled trenches that would explode if they got closer.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/> The Company side held out in their makeshift fort for three weeks with little water and food supplies, and lost many lives due to sunstroke and lack of water.\n\nAs the news of advances over the British garrison spread, more rebel sepoys joined Nana Saheb. By 10 June, he was believed to be leading around twelve thousand to fifteen thousand Indian soldiers.<ref name=\"caleb_wright_historic\">{{cite book | last =  Wright | first = Caleb| title = Historic Incidents and Life in India | url = https://archive.org/details/historicinciden00braigoog | publisher = J.

The defending Captain John Moore retaliated and launched night-time [[sortie]]s. Nana Saheb then withdrew his headquarters to Savada House (or Savada ''Kothi''), which was situated around two miles away. In response to Moore's sorties, Nana Saheb decided to attempt a direct assault on the British entrenchment, but the rebel soldiers displayed a lack of enthusiasm.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/>\n\nThe [[sniper]] fire and the [[bombardment]] continued until 23 June 1857, the 100th anniversary of the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The Battle of Plassey, which took place on 23 June 1757, was one of the pivotal battles leading to the expansion of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] rule in India. One of the driving forces of the rebellion by sepoys, was a prophecy that predicted the downfall of East India Company rule exactly one hundred years after this battle.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mukherjee |first=Rudrangshu |author-link=Rudrangshu Mukherjee |date=August 1990 |title='Satan Let Loose upon Earth': The Kanpur Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857 |journal=Past & Present |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=128 |pages=92\u2013116 |doi=10.1093/past/128.1.92 |jstor=651010}}</ref> This prompted the rebel soldiers under Nana Saheb to launch a major attack on the entrenchment on 23 June 1857. However, they were unable to gain an entry into the entrenchment by the end of the day.\n\nThe entrenchment had been steadily losing its soldiers and civilians to successive [[bombardment]]s, sniper fire, and assaults from the attackers. It was also suffering from disease and low supplies of food, water and medicine. General Wheeler's personal morale had been low, after his son Lieutenant Gordon Wheeler was decapitated in an assault on the barracks.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/>\n\nNana Saheb and his advisers came up with a plan to end the deadlock. On 24 June, he sent a female European prisoner, Rose Greenway, to the entrenchment to convey their message. In return for a surrender, he promised the safe passage of the Europeans to the Satichaura Ghat, a dock on the Ganges from which they could depart for [[Allahabad]].<ref name=\"caleb_wright_historic\"/> General Wheeler rejected the offer, because it had not been signed, and there was no guarantee that the offer was made by Nana Saheb himself.\n\nNext day, on 25 June, Nana Saheb sent a second note, signed by himself, through another female prisoner, Mrs.Jacobi. The entrenchment divided into two groups with different opinions\u2014one group was in favour of continuing the defence, while the second group was willing to accept the offer. During the next day, there was no bombardment from Nana Saheb's forces. Finally, Wheeler decided to surrender, in return for a safe passage to Allahabad. After a day of preparation and burying their dead, the Europeans decided to leave for Allahabad on the morning of 27 June 1857.\n\n===Satichaura Ghat massacre===\n[[File:Massacre in the boats off Cawnpore - The history of the Indian Mutiny (1858-1859), opposite 336 - BL.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A contemporary image of the massacre at the Satichaura Ghat]]\n[[File:On 27 June 1857, Europeans who had been promised safe passage from Wheeler's entrenchment arrived at the Sati Chaura Ghat (jetty) to take the boat out when Nana Sahib's army ambushed them and killed many.jpg|thumb|Sati Chaura Ghat (jetty)]]\nOn the morning of the 27 June, a large column led by Wheeler emerged from the entrenchment. Nana sent a number of carts, [[palanquin|dolis]] and elephants to enable the women, the children and the sick to proceed to the river banks. The Company officers and military men were allowed to take their arms and ammunition with them, and were escorted by nearly the whole of the rebel army.<ref name=\"caleb_wright_historic\"/> They reached the [[Satichaura Ghat]] by 8&nbsp;am.

Along the flight of steps going down to the river and  also on the high banks on either side of the ghat was filled with people who had assembled in large numbers to see their erstwhile masters leaving. Standing with the throng of people along the banks were also sepoys of 6th Native Infantry from Allahabad and 37th from [[Benares]]. Both these battalions had been driven away from their stations by [[James George Smith Neill]] column. They were assembled on parade and ordered to lay down their arms and after doing so, were fired upon mercilessly by British troops. Those who were lucky to escape returned to their villages only to hear the brutality of  Neills column in sacking entire villages that lay in the path of his march. These soldiers, who had come to Cawnpore to vent their anger with high hopes of participating in the assault on Entrenchment  were also watching the proceedings at the Satichaura ghat. Wheeler and his party were the first aboard and the first to manage to set their boat adrift. At this point a shot was fired possibly from the high banks and the Indian boatmen jumped overboard and started swimming toward the banks. During their jump, some of the cooking fires were knocked off, setting some of the boats ablaze. Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened next at the Satichaura Ghat,<ref name=\"caleb_wright_historic\"/> and it is unknown who fired the first shot,<ref name=\"financialexpress_echoes\"/> the departing European were attacked by the rebel sepoys, and most either killed or captured.\n\nSome of the Company officers later claimed that Nana had placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, on purpose to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the Europeans. Although the East India Company later accused Nana of betrayal and murder of innocent people, no definitive evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana had pre-planned or ordered the massacre.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Hibbert\n | first = Christopher\n | title = The Great Mutiny: India, 1857\n | year = 1978\n | publisher = Viking Press\n | isbn = 0-670-34983-6\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/greatmutinyindia00hibb/page/194 194]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/greatmutinyindia00hibb/page/194\n }}</ref> Some historians believe that the Satichaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion, and not of any plan implemented by Nana and his associates.<ref name=\"pramod_nayar_uprising\">{{cite book\n | last = Nayar\n | first = Pramod K.\n | title = The Great Uprising\n | year = 2007\n | publisher = Penguin Books, India\n | isbn = 978-0-14-310238-0\n}}</ref> Nevertheless, the fact that sniper fire from cannons pre-positioned along the riverbank was reported on the scene might suggest pre-planning.\n\nWhatever the case, amid the prevailing confusion at the Satichaura Ghat, Nana's general [[Tantya Tope|Tatya Tope]] allegedly ordered the 2nd Bengal Cavalry unit and some artillery units to open fire on the Europeans.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/> The rebel cavalry [[sowar]]s moved into the water to kill the remaining Company soldiers with swords and pistols.

Havelock decided to launch a [[flanking maneuver|flank attack]] on this army, but the rebel soldiers spotted the flanking manoeuvre and opened fire. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, but cleared the road to Cawnpore for the Company forces.\n\nBy this time, it became clear that the Company forces were approaching Cawnpore, and Nana's bargaining attempts had failed.

When they were threatened with execution for dereliction of duty some of them agreed to remove the women and children from the courtyard. Nana left the building because he did not want to be a witness to the unfolding massacre. The women and children were ordered to come out of the assembly rooms, but they refused to do so.

After the first round of firing, the soldiers were disturbed by the cries of the captives, and adamantly refused to fire at the women and children.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/>\n\nAn angry Begum Hussaini Khanum termed the sepoys' act as cowardice, and asked her lover Sarvur Khan to finish the job of killing the captives.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/> Sarvur Khan hired some butchers, who murdered the surviving women and children with [[cleaver (knife)|cleavers]]. The butchers left, when it seemed that all the captives had been killed. However, a few women and children had managed to survive by hiding under the other dead bodies.

General Havelock was informed that Saheb had taken up a position at the Ahirwa village. His forces launched an attack on Nana's forces, and emerged victorious. Nana then blew up the Cawnpore magazine, abandoned the place, and retreated to [[Bithoor]].

The British troops seized guns, elephants and camels, and set fire to Nana's palace. Very few relics of Nana Saheb are known but a silver mounted sword seems to be one of the more interesting. Many British search parties tried to capture Nana Saheb but all failed to prevent his escape. A detachment of the 7th Bengal Infantry came very near to capturing him but he managed to escape just in time. In his hurry he left this sword on the table where he had been dining.  Major Templer (later Major General) of the 7th Bengal Infantry brought home the sword.  In the 1920s the family loaned it to the Exeter Museum, until 1992 when it was sold at auction.  The present whereabouts of this sword are unknown.\n\n== Disappearance ==\nNana disappeared after the Company's recapture of Cawnpore. His general, [[Tantia Tope|Tatya Tope]], tried to recapture Cawnpore in November 1857, after gathering a large army, mainly consisting of the rebel soldiers from the Gwalior contingent. He managed to take control of all the routes west and north-west of Cawnpore, but was later defeated in the [[Second Battle of Cawnpore]].\n\nIn September 1857, Nana was reported to have fallen to malarious fever; however, this is doubtful.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1203098\n|title=The South Australian Advertiser, Monday 12 March 1860\n|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref> Rani Laxmibai, Tatya  Tope and Rao Saheb (Nana Saheb's close confidante){{dubious|reason=see article [[Rai Sahib]] which is eventually spelled Rao Saheb. i.e. no such person.

Kalyanji had raised Shridhar, son of Nana Saheb changing his name to Giridhar, as his own son and got him married in Sihori Brahmin family. His diary also records death of Nana Saheb in 1903 in Dave Sheri, Kalyanji's house in Sihor. The place still displays some articles of him.

As the adopted son of the exiled [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] [[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao II]], Nana Saheb believed that he was entitled to a pension from the [[East India Company]], but the underlying contractual issues are rather murky. The Company's refusal to continue the pension after his father's death, as well as what he perceived as high-handed policies, compelled him to revolt and seek independence from company rule in India. He forced the British garrison in Cawnpore to surrender, then executed the survivors, gaining control of Cawnpore for a few days. He later disappeared, after his forces were defeated by a British force that recaptured Cawnpore. He went to the Nepal Hills in 1859, where he is thought to have died.\n\n==Early life==\nNana  was born on 19 May 1824 as Nana Govind Dhondu Pant, to Narayan Bhat and Ganga Bai.<ref name=wolpert>Wolert, Stanley.

Nana's father, a well-educated Deccani Brahmin, had travelled with his family from the [[Western Ghats]] to become a court official of the former Peshwa at Bithoor. Lacking sons, Baji Rao adopted Nana Saheb and his younger brother in 1827. The mother of both children was a sister of one of the Peshwa's wives.<ref name=David>David, Saul. ''The Indian Mutiny'' (published 2003), pp.45\u201346. Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0-141-00554-8}}.</ref> Nana Saheb's childhood associates included [[Tantya Tope|Tatya Tope]], [[Azimullah Khan]] and Manikarnika Tambe who later became famous as [[Rani Lakshmibai]]. Tatya Tope was the son of Pandurang Rao Tope, an important noble at the court of the Peshwa Baji Rao II. After Baji Rao II was exiled to Bithoor, Pandurang Rao and his family also shifted there. Tatya Tope was the fencing master to Nana Saheb. Azimullah Khan joined the court of Nana Saheb as Secretary, after the death of [[Baji Rao II]] in 1851. He later became the [[dewan]] in Nana Saheb's court.\n\n==Inheritance==\nThe [[Doctrine of lapse]] was an annexation policy devised by [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]], who was the British [[Governor-General of India]] between 1848 and 1856. According to the Doctrine, any princely state or territory under the direct influence (paramountcy) of the British East India Company (the dominant imperial power in the subcontinent), as a vassal state under the British Subsidiary System, would automatically be annexed if the ruler was either \"manifestly incompetent or died without a direct heir\".<ref name=\"keay\">[[John Keay|Keay, John]]. ''India: a history''. New York: Grove Press Books, distributed by Publishers Group West. 2000 {{ISBN|0-8021-3797-0}}, p. 433.</ref> The latter supplanted the long-established legal right of an Indian sovereign without an heir to choose a successor. In addition, the British were to decide whether potential rulers were competent enough. The doctrine and its application were widely regarded by Indians as illegitimate. At that time, the Company had absolute, imperial administrative jurisdiction over many regions spread over the subcontinent. The company took over the princely states of [[Satara (city)|Satara]] (1848), [[Jaipur]] and [[Sambalpur]] (1849), Baghat (1850), [[Nagpur]] (1853), and [[Jhansi]] (1854) using this doctrine. The British took over [[Awadh]] (Oudh) (1856) claiming that the local ruler was not ruling properly. The Company added about four million pounds sterling to its annual revenue by the use of this doctrine.<ref name=\"wolpert\"/> With the increasing power of the East India Company, discontent simmered amongst sections of Indian society and the largely indigenous armed [[Jhansi]] forces; these joined with members of the deposed dynasties during the Indian rebellion of 1857.\n\nUnder the Peshwa's will Nana Saheb was, through his adoption, heir-presumptive to the Maratha's throne, and eligible for his adoptive father's continuing annual pension of \u00a380,000 from the East India Company. However, after the death of Baji Rao II, the Company stopped the pension on the grounds that the Nana was not a natural born heir and that the kingdom no longer existed. The Nana, while still wealthy, was greatly offended by both the termination of the pension and by the suspension of various titles and grants that had been retained by Baji Rao in exile. Accordingly, Nana Saheb sent an envoy ([[Azimullah Khan]]) to England in 1853 to plead his case with the British Government. However, Azimullah Khan was unable to convince the British to resume the pension, and he returned to India in 1855.\n\n==Role in the 1857 uprising ==\n{{main|Siege of Cawnpore}}\n[[File:Nana Sahib Memorial.JPG|thumb|Nana Saheb memorial at Bithoor, which previously had their fort]]\nNana Saheb won the confidence of Charles Hillersdon, the Collector of Kanpur.<ref name=\"britishempire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/mutiny/cawnpore.htm |title=British Empire: Forces: Campaigns: Indian Mutiny, 1857 - 58: The Siege of Cawnpore |publisher=britishempire.co.uk|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It was planned that Nana Saheb would assemble a force of 1,500 soldiers to support the British, in case the rebellion spread to Cawnpore.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Brock\n | first = William\n | title = A Biographical Sketch of Sir Henry Havelock, K.

The soldiers of the 53rd Native Infantry, who were guarding the magazine, thought that Nana had come to guard the magazine on behalf of the Company. However, once he entered the magazine, Nana Saheb announced that he was a participant in the rebellion against the Company, and intended to be a [[vassal]] of [[Bahadur Shah II]].<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/mutiny/cawnpore.htm\n|title=The Indian Mutiny: The Siege of Cawnpore\n|accessdate=11 July 2007\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter taking possession of the Company treasury, Nana advanced up the [[Grand Trunk Road]] stating that he wanted to restore the [[Maratha confederacy]] under the [[Peshwa]] tradition, and decided to capture Kanpur.

Nana wanted them to go back to Cawnpore, and help him defeat the British. The soldiers were reluctant at first, but decided to join Nana when he promised to double their pay and reward them with gold, if they were to destroy the British entrenchment.\n\n===Attack on Wheeler's entrenchment===\n[[Image:Nana Sahib with his escort.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Nana Saheb with his escort'''.

On 6 June, his forces (including the rebel soldiers) attacked the Company entrenchment at 10:30&nbsp;am The Company forces were not adequately prepared for the attack but managed to defend themselves as the attacking forces were reluctant to enter the entrenchment. The Indian forces had been led to believe that the entrenchment had [[gunpowder]]-filled trenches that would explode if they got closer.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/> The Company side held out in their makeshift fort for three weeks with little water and food supplies, and lost many lives due to sunstroke and lack of water.\n\nAs the news of advances over the British garrison spread, more rebel sepoys joined Nana Saheb.

The Battle of Plassey, which took place on 23 June 1757, was one of the pivotal battles leading to the expansion of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] rule in India.

However, they were unable to gain an entry into the entrenchment by the end of the day.\n\nThe entrenchment had been steadily losing its soldiers and civilians to successive [[bombardment]]s, sniper fire, and assaults from the attackers. It was also suffering from disease and low supplies of food, water and medicine. General Wheeler's personal morale had been low, after his son Lieutenant Gordon Wheeler was decapitated in an assault on the barracks.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/>\n\nNana Saheb and his advisers came up with a plan to end the deadlock. On 24 June, he sent a female European prisoner, Rose Greenway, to the entrenchment to convey their message.

The entrenchment divided into two groups with different opinions\u2014one group was in favour of continuing the defence, while the second group was willing to accept the offer. During the next day, there was no bombardment from Nana Saheb's forces. Finally, Wheeler decided to surrender, in return for a safe passage to Allahabad.

Nana sent a number of carts, [[palanquin|dolis]] and elephants to enable the women, the children and the sick to proceed to the river banks.

Along the flight of steps going down to the river and  also on the high banks on either side of the ghat was filled with people who had assembled in large numbers to see their erstwhile masters leaving. Standing with the throng of people along the banks were also sepoys of 6th Native Infantry from Allahabad and 37th from [[Benares]]. Both these battalions had been driven away from their stations by [[James George Smith Neill]] column. They were assembled on parade and ordered to lay down their arms and after doing so, were fired upon mercilessly by British troops. Those who were lucky to escape returned to their villages only to hear the brutality of  Neills column in sacking entire villages that lay in the path of his march. These soldiers, who had come to Cawnpore to vent their anger with high hopes of participating in the assault on Entrenchment  were also watching the proceedings at the Satichaura ghat. Wheeler and his party were the first aboard and the first to manage to set their boat adrift. At this point a shot was fired possibly from the high banks and the Indian boatmen jumped overboard and started swimming toward the banks. During their jump, some of the cooking fires were knocked off, setting some of the boats ablaze. Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened next at the Satichaura Ghat,<ref name=\"caleb_wright_historic\"/> and it is unknown who fired the first shot,<ref name=\"financialexpress_echoes\"/> the departing European were attacked by the rebel sepoys, and most either killed or captured.\n\nSome of the Company officers later claimed that Nana had placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, on purpose to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the Europeans. Although the East India Company later accused Nana of betrayal and murder of innocent people, no definitive evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana had pre-planned or ordered the massacre.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Hibbert\n | first = Christopher\n | title = The Great Mutiny: India, 1857\n | year = 1978\n | publisher = Viking Press\n | isbn = 0-670-34983-6\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/greatmutinyindia00hibb/page/194 194]\n | url = https://archive.org/details/greatmutinyindia00hibb/page/194\n }}</ref> Some historians believe that the Satichaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion, and not of any plan implemented by Nana and his associates.<ref name=\"pramod_nayar_uprising\">{{cite book\n | last = Nayar\n | first = Pramod K.\n | title = The Great Uprising\n | year = 2007\n | publisher = Penguin Books, India\n | isbn = 978-0-14-310238-0\n}}</ref> Nevertheless, the fact that sniper fire from cannons pre-positioned along the riverbank was reported on the scene might suggest pre-planning.\n\nWhatever the case, amid the prevailing confusion at the Satichaura Ghat, Nana's general [[Tantya Tope|Tatya Tope]] allegedly ordered the 2nd Bengal Cavalry unit and some artillery units to open fire on the Europeans.<ref name=\"britishempire_cawnpore\"/> The rebel cavalry [[sowar]]s moved into the water to kill the remaining Company soldiers with swords and pistols.

Havelock decided to launch a [[flanking maneuver|flank attack]] on this army, but the rebel soldiers spotted the flanking manoeuvre and opened fire. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, but cleared the road to Cawnpore for the Company forces.\n\nBy this time, it became clear that the Company forces were approaching Cawnpore, and Nana's bargaining attempts had failed.

The next morning, when the rebels arrived to dispose of the bodies, they found that three women and three children aged between four and seven years old were still alive.<ref name=\"chilit_vs_saxena\"/> The surviving women were cast into the well by the sweepers who had also been told to strip the bodies of the murder victims.

The British troops seized guns, elephants and camels, and set fire to Nana's palace. Very few relics of Nana Saheb are known but a silver mounted sword seems to be one of the more interesting. Many British search parties tried to capture Nana Saheb but all failed to prevent his escape. A detachment of the 7th Bengal Infantry came very near to capturing him but he managed to escape just in time. In his hurry he left this sword on the table where he had been dining.  Major Templer (later Major General) of the 7th Bengal Infantry brought home the sword.  In the 1920s the family loaned it to the Exeter Museum, until 1992 when it was sold at auction.  The present whereabouts of this sword are unknown.\n\n== Disappearance ==\nNana disappeared after the Company's recapture of Cawnpore. His general, [[Tantia Tope|Tatya Tope]], tried to recapture Cawnpore in November 1857, after gathering a large army, mainly consisting of the rebel soldiers from the Gwalior contingent.
