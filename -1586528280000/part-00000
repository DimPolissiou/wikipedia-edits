The Philips CDI 910 is the American version of the CDI 205, the most basic model in the series and the first Philips CD-i model, released in December 1991. Originally priced about $799, within a year's time the price dropped to $599.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18 | title=New York Magazine| date=October 12, 1992}}</ref>\n*The '''CD-i player 300 series''', which includes the 310, 350, 360, and 370 models. The 300 series consists of portable players designed for the professional market and not marketed to home consumers. A popular use was multimedia sales presentations such as those used by pharmaceutical companies to provide product information to physicians, as the devices could be easily transported by sales representatives.<ref name=\"gamefaqs.gamespot.com\"/>\n*The '''CD-i player 400 series''', which includes the 450, 470, 490 models. The 400 models are slimmed-down units aimed at console and educational markets. The CDI 450 player, for instance, is a budget model designed to compete with game consoles. In this version, an infrared remote controller is not standard but optional, as this model is more gaming-oriented. This series was introduced at CES [[Chicago]] in June 1994 and the 450 player retailed at [[Dutch guilders|\u0192]] 799 in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"CDiMagazine\" />\n*The '''CD-i player 500 series''', which includes the 550 model, which was essentially the same as the 450 with an installed digital video cartridge. It was introduced at CES Chicago in June 1994.<ref name=\"CDiMagazine\" />\n*The '''CD-i player 600 series''', which includes the 601, 602, 604, 605, 615, 660, and 670 models. The 600 series is designed for professional applications and software development. Units in this line generally include support for [[floppy disk]] drives, [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] and other computer peripherals. Some models can also be connected to an emulator and have software testing and debugging features.\n*The '''CD-I player 700 series''', which consists of the 740 model, the most advanced player and featuring an [[RS-232]] port. It was only released in limited quantities.\n\nThere also exist a number of hard-to-categorize models, such as the FW380i, an integrated mini-stereo and CD-i player; the 21TCDi30, a television with a built-in CD-i device; the CD-i/PC 2.0, a CD-i module with an [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] interface for IBM-compatible 486 PCs.<ref>{{cite book |author=Staff writer |year=1994 |title=21TCDI30 Handbook |publisher=Philips |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref>http://www.icdia.co.uk/brochures/prof_players/cdipc20_a.jpg</ref>\n\n;Gallery\n<gallery>\nPhilips-CDi-220-wController-FL.jpg|The Philips CDI 220\nPhilips-CDi-400-Console-Set.jpg|Magnavox CDI 550 (NTSC) with its paddle controller.

develop TeleCD-i <ref>Physica Verlag, The Information Superhighway and Private Households, p.162-172</ref> (also TeleCD). In this concept, the CD-i player is connected to a network such as [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] or Internet, enabling data-communication and rich media presentation. Dutch grocery chain [[Albert Heijn]] and mail-order company [[:de:Neckermann (Versandhandel)|Neckermann]] were early adopters and introduced award-winning TeleCD-i applications for their home-shopping and home-delivery services. CDMATICS also developed the special Philips TeleCD-i Assistant and a set of software tools to help the worldwide multimedia industry to develop and implement TeleCD-i. TeleCD-i is the world's first networked multimedia application at the time of its introduction. In 1996, Philips acquired source code rights from CDMATICS.\n\n==CD-Online==\n[[File:EmailCDOnline.jpg|thumb|left|E-mail screen of CD-Online UK]]\nInternet services on the CD-i devices were facilitated by the use of an additional hardware modem and \"CD-Online\" disc (renamed Web-i in the US<ref>[https://adage.com/print/78169] {{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>), which Philips initially released in Britain in 1995 for $150 US.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&dat=19960215&id=4YpOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ox8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5675,2427974 | title=Philips puts Internet on TV sets | work=[[New Straits Times]] | date=1996-02-15 | accessdate=12 August 2019 | location=[[Malaysia]] | pages=43}}</ref><ref name=\"ParkerStarrett1996\">{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Dana|last2=Starrett|first2=Bob|title=CD-ROM Professional's CD-recordable Handbook: The Complete Guide to Practical Desktop CD|url=https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pemberton Press|isbn=978-0-910965-18-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park/page/202 202]}}</ref> This service provided the CD-i with full internet access (with a 14.4k [[modem]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdinteractive.co.uk/download/mags/0304%2004-1996.pdf|title=Cd-i Magazine|date=August 1996|website=cDinteractive.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2019}}</ref>), including online shopping, email, and support for networked multiplayer gaming on select CD-i games.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cardilini |first=Les |title=CDI, a low-tech Net option? |date=26 October 1995 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16909256/cdi_a_lowtech_net_option_by_les/ |work=[[The Age]] |location=[[Melbourne]], Australia |volume=142 |issue=43808 |at=Green Guide, p.16}}</ref> The service required a CD-i player with DV cartridge, and an \"Internet Starter Kit\" which initially retailed for  \u00a399.99.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24002397/cdonline_ad_by_philips/ |date=December 2, 1995 |title=Let's Make Things Better |author=Philips |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |volume= |issue= |page=6 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> It was advertized as bringing \"full Internet access to the living room on TV screens\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19961031125504/http://www.cd-online.co.uk/wider.html</ref> Andy Stout, a writer for the official CD-i magazine, explained CD-Online: {{quote|It is very much Internet-lite.

In 1990, [[Peugeot]] used CD-i for its [[point of sale]] application promoting its then-new [[Peugeot 605|605]] automobile, and it was also at the time used by fellow car manufacturer [[Renault]] for staff training programmes, and in Japan by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for an exhibition there. A Philips executive, Gaston Bastiaens, quoted in 1990 \"CD-I will be 'the medium' for entertainment, education and information in the 90's.\".<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACE_Issue_33_1990-06_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n29</ref> Sony introduced its three portable CD-i players in June 1990, pitching them as \"picture books with sound\".<ref name=\"New Computer Express 086\"/>\n\nThe ambitious CD-i format had initially created much interest after its 1986 announcement, both in the west and in Japan, buoyed by the success of the [[CD]]. However, after repeated delays (hardware were first intended to be ready and shipped by Christmas 1987) interest was slowly lost. [[Electronic Arts]] for instance was enthusiastic about CD-i and formed a division for the development of video game titles on the format, but it was eventually halted with the intention of resuming when CD-i players would reach the market. The company eventually never resumed CD-i software development when it was released.<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue31Apr90/page/n19</ref> The delay also gave more attention to the hyped [[Digital Video Interactive]] (DVI) in 1987, which demonstrated full screen, [[full motion video]] (FMV) using a compression chip on an [[IBM PC/AT]] computer.<ref name=\"filfre.net\">https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/a-slow-motion-revolution/</ref> Amid the attention around its potential rival DVI,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZXvAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR39&lpg=PR39 | title=U-M Computing News| year=1989}}</ref> Philips and Sony decided to find a way to add full screen FMV abilities to the CD-i standard, causing further delay.<ref name=\"filfre.net\"/> Meanwhile, the [[Microsoft]]-backed CD-ROM standard was improving and solved certain video playback issues that were present on the CD-i \u2013 CD-ROM format products were already on the market by 1987.<ref name=\"dvorak.org\"/> At the end, CD-ROM standard benefited from the CD-i and DVI mishaps,<ref name=\"filfre.net\"/> and by the time CD-i players for consumers were released in 1991, CD-ROM had already become known and established.<ref name=\"dvorak.org\"/> [[Ron Gilbert]] commented in early 1990 \"The CD-I specifications look great, but where are the machines? If they'd come out four years ago, they'd have been hot, but now they're behind the times.\"<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue31Apr90/page/n37</ref> Another reason that led to fading interest pre-launch was the fact CD-i players would not launch with FMV but instead receive it later through a purchasable add-on cartridge (it was originally expected to come built-in) \u2013 as well as the obsolete [[Motorola]] processor, [[OS-9]] software, and a launch price considered high.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/DM-V1N02/DM-V1N02_djvu.txt |title = Digital Media: Volume 1, Number 2, July 1991|publisher = Seybold Publications|date = July 1991}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Philips had aggressively promoted their CD-i products in the U.S., by August 1993 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' reported that \"skepticism persists about its long-term prospects\" compared to other platforms like [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[Apple Macintosh]], and [[Sega Genesis]].<ref name=\"cgw199308\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=109 | title=Part II of CGW's Computer Game Developers Conference Coverage | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1993 | accessdate=July 12, 2014 | pages=38}}</ref> The magazine stated in January 1994 that despite Philips' new emphasis on games \"CD-i is still not the answer for hardcore gamers\", but the console \"may yet surprise us all in the future\".

The magazine noted that while Philips had not yet officially discontinued the CD-i, it was dead for all intents and purposes, citing as evidence the fact that though Philips had a large booth at the 1995 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], there was no CD-i hardware or software on display.

Plans for a second generation CD-i system were certainly present and [[Argonaut Software]] was even designated to design chip sets for the successor to the CD-i. However, the then president [[Cor Boonstra]] saw no interest in the media area for Philips and so Philips sold everything, including the media subsidiary [[Polygram]]. The Dutch half of Philips Media was sold to [[LBi|Softmachine]], which released ''[[The Lost Ride]]'' on the CD-i as the last product for the CD-i.

develop TeleCD-i <ref>Physica Verlag, The Information Superhighway and Private Households, p.162-172</ref> (also TeleCD). In this concept, the CD-i player is connected to a network such as [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] or Internet, enabling data-communication and rich media presentation. Dutch grocery chain [[Albert Heijn]] and mail-order company [[:de:Neckermann (Versandhandel)|Neckermann]] were early adopters and introduced award-winning TeleCD-i applications for their home-shopping and home-delivery services. CDMATICS also developed the special Philips TeleCD-i Assistant and a set of software tools to help the worldwide multimedia industry to develop and implement TeleCD-i. TeleCD-i is the world's first networked multimedia application at the time of its introduction. In 1996, Philips acquired source code rights from CDMATICS.\n\n==CD-Online==\n[[File:EmailCDOnline.jpg|thumb|left|E-mail screen of CD-Online UK]]\nInternet services on the CD-i devices were facilitated by the use of an additional hardware modem and \"CD-Online\" disc (renamed Web-i in the US<ref>[https://adage.com/print/78169] {{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>), which Philips initially released in Britain in 1995 for $150 US.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&dat=19960215&id=4YpOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ox8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5675,2427974 | title=Philips puts Internet on TV sets | work=[[New Straits Times]] | date=1996-02-15 | accessdate=12 August 2019 | location=[[Malaysia]] | pages=43}}</ref><ref name=\"ParkerStarrett1996\">{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Dana|last2=Starrett|first2=Bob|title=CD-ROM Professional's CD-recordable Handbook: The Complete Guide to Practical Desktop CD|url=https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pemberton Press|isbn=978-0-910965-18-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park/page/202 202]}}</ref> This service provided the CD-i with full internet access (with a 14.4k [[modem]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdinteractive.co.uk/download/mags/0304%2004-1996.pdf|title=Cd-i Magazine|date=August 1996|website=cDinteractive.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2019}}</ref>), including online shopping, email, and support for networked multiplayer gaming on select CD-i games.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cardilini |first=Les |title=CDI, a low-tech Net option? |date=26 October 1995 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16909256/cdi_a_lowtech_net_option_by_les/ |work=[[The Age]] |location=[[Melbourne]], Australia |volume=142 |issue=43808 |at=Green Guide, p.16}}</ref> The service required a CD-i player with DV cartridge, and an \"Internet Starter Kit\" which initially retailed for  \u00a399.99.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24002397/cdonline_ad_by_philips/ |date=December 2, 1995 |title=Let's Make Things Better |author=Philips |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |volume= |issue= |page=6 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> It was advertized as bringing \"full Internet access to the living room on TV screens\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19961031125504/http://www.cd-online.co.uk/wider.html</ref> Andy Stout, a writer for the official CD-i magazine, explained CD-Online: {{quote|It is very much Internet-lite.

In 1990, [[Peugeot]] used CD-i for its [[point of sale]] application promoting its then-new [[Peugeot 605|605]] automobile, and it was also at the time used by fellow car manufacturer [[Renault]] for staff training programmes, and in Japan by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for an exhibition there. A Philips executive, Gaston Bastiaens, quoted in 1990 \"CD-I will be 'the medium' for entertainment, education and information in the 90's.\".<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACE_Issue_33_1990-06_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n29</ref> Sony introduced its three portable CD-i players in June 1990, pitching them as \"picture books with sound\".<ref name=\"New Computer Express 086\"/>\n\nThe ambitious CD-i format had initially created much interest after its 1986 announcement, both in the west and in Japan, buoyed by the success of the [[CD]]. However, after repeated delays (hardware were first intended to be ready and shipped by Christmas 1987) interest was slowly lost. [[Electronic Arts]] for instance was enthusiastic about CD-i and formed a division for the development of video game titles on the format, but it was eventually halted with the intention of resuming when CD-i players would reach the market.

{"title_page": "Derek McCormack (writer)", "text_new": "'''Derek McCormack''' (born June 20, 1969) is a Canadian [[novelist]] and [[short story]] writer whose work is characterized by its extreme brevity and its humorous, often distinctly queer forms of sexual darkness. Born and raised in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], he currently lives in [[Toronto]].\n\nMcCormack's first book, 1996's ''Dark Rides'', was published by Gutter Press, a small Canadian press founded by Sam Hiyate as part of a mid-1990s boomlet in alternative publishing in Toronto.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC828182 The Canadian Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> That first book was edited by Ken Sparling, who left his aggressively minimalist imprint on it and McCormack's emerging style.
