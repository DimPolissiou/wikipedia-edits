It is fully intact and in the Irish Governmental records it is registered as a National Monument and \"Listed/Protected\" structure, intended to protect its historic, architectural and aesthetic significance.\n\n==History==\nThe castle of Ballyhannon, also known in later times as Castlefergus, most likely from its proximity to the [[River Fergus]], is a towerhouse of atypical internal design within the context of the Co. Clare group of towerhouses. The castle stands in the townland of Castlefergus close to Latoon Creek, which itself feeds into the River Fergus. Ballyhannon townlands (both north and south) lie to the north east of the castle. The older spelling, Ballyhannan, is retained in these townland names. The townland name can be translated as O'Hannan's<ref>{{harvp|Frost|1878|p=664}}</ref> or O'Hannon's home. Although there are many substantial families of Hannon in [[Munster]] and [[Connacht|Connaught]], the name seldom appears in the annals of medieval Ireland.<ref name=\"History Ballyhannon\">Martin Breen, [http://www.ballyhannon-castle.com/history.htm Ballyhannon / Castlefergus \u2013 History], Ballyhannon Castle website.

Although Ballyhannon Castle was the home of the [[MacNamara]]s for many centuries, there are some references to the [[O'Briens]], on whose lands it stood, in relation to its history. For example in the year 1560, a grant was made by [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (7 September 1533 \u2013 24 March 1603) to Conor O'Brien (c.1534 - 1581), [[Earl of Thomond]], of Ballyhannon Castle, and several other castles, previously held by Donnell O'Brien; \"To hold in tail male, by service of one knight's fee\",<ref>The Irish Fiants of the Tudor Sovereigns (Elizabeth).

This was one of the earliest dated fireplaces in the county, though it cannot now be located within the castle. In 1586 Queen Elizabeth I issued a pardon to Hugh, son of Covea MacNamara, of Ballyhannon Castle for being in rebellion. He had to provide sureties for his future good behaviour and answer at the local courts as requested.<ref>The Irish Fiants of the Tudor Sovereigns (Elizabeth). (De B\u00farca, Dublin 1994), Elizabeth, no. 4860</ref> In the 1626 rental of the 5th Earl of Thomond, [[Henry O'Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond|Henry O'Brien]] (c.1588 - 1639), Ballyhannon Castle was listed as being rented to one Robert Hawksworth, with one quarter of land for the sum of \u00a34.00.<ref>Petworth House Archives. MSS C27/A39. 1626 Rental of Thomond Property.</ref> It is likely that Hawksworth was one of the many English Protestant settlers brought into the county by the O'Briens and settled on the O'Brien properties in Thomond during this period. The settling of English Protestants on lands of the native Irish Catholics precipitated the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 rebellion]] and many records exist of the Irish despoiling the settlers and turning them out of their newly acquired lands and properties. The MacNamaras of Ballyhannon acted no differently from the other displaced Irish. John Smith of Latoon complained of his losses which, \"amounted to \u00a31,354, including his lease for life of Lattoon, and his outlay upon buildings and sea embankments.\" He complained that Oliver Delahoyde of Fomerla Castle in Tulla, \"with fifty men came, on the night of 15 January 1642, and stripped him of part of his goods. The work of spoliation was subsequently completed by the MacNamaras of Ballyhannon\" among others.<ref>{{harvp|Frost|1878|p=370}}</ref> Most of the Irish landowners who took part in this rebellion were later stripped of their possessions. Among those noted as having forfeited their property after the rebellion was Mahone MacNamara of Ballyhannon. His property was disposed of to Pierce Creagh (a Protestant settler) and to the Earl of Thomond, [[Barnabas O'Brien, 6th Earl of Thomond|Barnabas O'Brien]] (c.1590 - 1657), 6th Earl.<ref>{{harvp|Frost|1878|p=425}}</ref><ref>Creagh also received property at Dangan in Quin.</ref> After the rebellion, the Cromwellian campaign attempted to complete the subjugation of the native Irish, and many of their castles were dismantled by the Commonwealth forces to render them defenceless. Ballyhannon appears to have escaped this destruction and a sketch of the castle in 1675, which survives in the \"Edenvale Survey\", shows it to have been roofed and in good condition. The castle appears to be surrounded by a bawn wall with a gate and loophole windows at this time.<ref>Munster Antiquarian Journal, Vol. 45, 2005. The Edenvale Castle Survey of Co. Clare 1671-79.

Ballyhannon Castle was one of the castles noted by [[3rd Viscount Clare|Sir Daniel O'Brien, Viscount Clare]], as being suitable for the imprisonment of Protestant settlers who were now being dispossessed. A letter written in 1689 describing the events of the time is worth recording. \"Take every one of them that are young (Seir or Mr.), and let the common sort lie in the prison, and the rest strictly guarded, or rather put into some strong castle that has a geate to be locked on the outside like Ballyhannon\".<ref>Philip Dwyer, The Diocese of Killaloe, (Dublin 1878), p389.</ref><ref>See also John Ainsworth.

The castle is also mentioned in 1690 when Thomas Hickman, who seemed to be living in fear during another upsurge in the conflict, asked Sir Donough O'Brien to collect some of his belongings from Ballyhannon Castle and to keep other possessions of his in a safe place, as he expected the castle was soon to be garrisoned.<ref>John Ainsworth. The Inchiquin Manuscripts (Dublin 1961), no. 78</ref>\n\nThe castle appears on Henry Pelham's \"Grand Jury\" map of 1787 under the names Ballyhannon and Castlefergus, which is the first time Castlefergus appears as the name of the castle.

The very perfect tower, measuring {{cvt|33+1/2|x|24|ft}}, is in excellent preservation, having been inhabited in the last century. The pointed south door is defended by a shot-hole on the left and a murder hole above. The stair mounts round the s.w. angle, and at the 14th step a long corridor with 2 lights in the w. wall is reached. At the n. end a spiral staircase of 72 steps leads to the top. At the 12th step from the corridor another passage through the n. wall is reached. 5 curved steps at the s. end of the w. corridor lead to a similar passage along the s. wall over the porch and lodge. There is a handsome trefoil headed window of 2 lights in the s.w. angle and a garderobe to the s.e. angle. Mounting the spiral stair still higher other corridors, over the lower ones, in the w. and s. sides, are reached. There are 4 main stories under the stone vault forming the roof. The basement story has very deep recesses under the corridor and the 2 on the n. side have a narrow chamfered screen between them.

Most Touhou characters reside in a fictional realm called Gensokyo, where [[human]]s and ''[[y\u014dkai]]'' coexist. Though the y\u014dkai do often prey on the humans while the humans try to exorcise them, no racial animosity actually exists between the two. The characters also have unique abilities. Since the [[NEC PC-9801|PC-98]] games (from ''Highly Responsive to Prayers'' to ''Mystic Square'') are relatively obscure, the characters in and after ''The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil'' are more widely recognized and popular.\n\nAll characters except the two main protagonists (Reimu and Marisa) are listed by the first game of their appearance.\n\n==Protagonists==\n===Reimu Hakurei===\n[[File:Reimu UFO.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Reimu in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'']]\n<span id=\"Reimu Hakurei\"></span>\n*Species: [[Human]]\n*Ability: Ability of flight, using [[yin-yang]] orbs, and godly powers.

When she confronted Watatsuki no Yorihime in ''Silent Sinner in Blue'', she did not cooperate with her allies Marisa, Remilia Scarlet, and Sakuya Izayoi.\n\nShe serves the role of the [[miko]] of the Hakurei Shrine located at the boundary between Gensokyo and the outside world, called the \"[[Miko]] of Hakurei.\" The job of the miko of the Hakurei shrine is to exterminate yokai and resolve incidents, and Reimu herself possesses strong power, but since she habitually lives a life of drinking tea and having naps, she does not have enough training. The plentiful livelihood of Gensokyo is sustained by the maintenance of the indispensable relationship of yokai attacking humans and humans exterminating yokai, and the Miko of Hakurei plays a part in that. Since the Miko of Hakurei also in an indispensable position of maintaining Gensokyo, it has become forbidden for the Miko of Hakurei to exterminate yokai and for yokai to attack the miko, not to mention humans coming to the Hakurei Shrine grounds to meddle. However, since the relation of yokai attacking humans has thus been lost, yokai have been in decline, so Reimu approved of a request she received from yokai to establish battle rules for bouts with yokai and kill time, thus preserving the relation between yokai and humans in a mock style, allowing strong and weak ones to have equal fights without bad aftertastes, called the \"spell card rules\" in the \"Spell Naming Law.\"<ref name=\"gumon\">\u300e\u6c42\u805e\u53f2\u7d00\u300fpp.112-116\u3002</ref><ref group=\"*\">\u30b9\u30da\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u53c2\u7167</ref> The customs related to the job have been preserved from time immemorial without fail, and as she follows the custom, she takes an attitude of not worrying about the results.\n\nHer main abilities are flying in the sky, good intuition, and getting along with everyone; even those who were once her enemies. In the games, she is characterized by her homing [[amulet]]s and [[yin-yang]] orbs. In addition to being in all of the Touhou games (save Touhou [[Shoot the Bullet|9.5]] and [[Fairy Wars|12.8]]), she is featured in ''[[Graffiti Kingdom]]'' as \"Flying Maiden\", in which ZUN is involved. Due to the way she is often dressed, Reimu's exposed armpits are often used as targets for Internet jokes and memes.\n\n===Marisa Kirisame===\n[[File:Marisa UFO.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Marisa in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'']]\n<span id=\"Marisa Kirisame\"></span>\n*Species: [[Human]]\n*Ability: Ability to use magic\n*Residence: Forest of Magic\n{{Nihongo|Marisa Kirisame|\u9727\u96e8 \u9b54\u7406\u6c99|Kirisame Marisa}} is a human magician who lives in a cluttered house in the Forest of Magic. She is friends with Reimu and visits her often, but is otherwise solitary and spends most of her time researching magic. She is an avid collector, bordering on having a [[hoarding disorder]], often \"borrowing\" things without permission from various other characters. She talks in a very brash, direct, and often rude way, highlighting her tomboyish nature and otherwise devil-may-care attitude. While she is prone to violence, selfishness, and other disagreeable behaviors, she is also honest and a hard worker, usually on the front lines of defending Gensokyo whenever an incident occurs. She is contrasted with Reimu, the naturally-talented protagonist, as Marisa's powers derive entirely from hard work and determination rather than any abilities she was born with. In the games, her attacks are characterized by five-point star motifs and lasers, and other high-level destructive magic. Consistent to her \"borrowing\" habit, many of her spells are inspired by other characters, such as her signature move \"Master Spark\" which was originally [[#Yuuka|Yuka Kazami's]], or her \"Nondirectional Laser\" attack, which was originally [[#Patchouli Knowledge|Patchouli's]] attack.

It seems their relationship is not simply boss/subordinate. Although she looks too young to be an assistant professor, it's because she earned her [[Ph.D.]] (in comparative physics) at the age of 15.

This skillfulness is among the finest in Gensokyo.<ref name=\"th075_txt\"/> She is able to make her dolls move pretty much any way humans can, and other than that she can make multiple dolls perform different actions, sometimes making them cooperate and sometimes making them move completely asynchronously, such that to onlookers around her, it might not seem like she is manipulating them. The dolls are also able to manipulate dolls, but it seems like she does it all by herself only when it comes to the task of creating the dolls.<ref name=\"g\"/>\n\n:She has a residence in the Forest of Magic. According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', maybe since she was originally a human, even as a yokai, she has high understanding and friendship level to humans and presents a low danger level, and if someone gets lost in the forest, she also gladly gives shelter upon arriving at her house. However, Alice's house is covered all over with dolls, and since she is not very eager for conversation, it seems like she immediately flees when there is something eerie.<ref name=\"th075_txt\"/><ref name=\"g\"/> In chapters 5-6 of ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'', the Three Fairies of Light accidentally arrived at her house, and Alice was hospitable to them.\n\n:According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', she does not perform the usual act of attacking humans, but unexpectedly likes fights and upon receiving a challenge to do battle, gladly accepts. As she manipulates a great number of combat dolls, the challenger is likely to be highly outnumbered, making a difficult battle inevitable, but since she has her hands full with manipulating the dolls, that is her weakness.\n\n:Since she does not find it enjoyable to win battles with overwhelming power, she usually fights with power that is a little more than that of the opponent. Also, since it would be the end of the ropes if she was defeated while putting forth her true power, she does not give it her all in fights, which is similar in personality to Reimu Hakurei.\n\n:In the character settings text for ''Imperishbable Night'', it was written that she was an indoors type who was often alone, but in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', the range of her place of activities is set to \"any kind of place\" in Gensokyo, and she also appeared in front of people in times of festivals to exhibit her skill with dolls. In each ending of ''Imperishable Night'' and ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', she participated in banquets at the Hakurei Shrine.

There, she was amazed to find that Kaguya was also a fugitive. The two still detest each other, killing one another and reincarnating in a daily ritual.

Before the events of Subterranean Animism, she was told by a voice (presumably [[#Kanako Yasaka|Kanako Yasaka]]'s) that she could swallow the god, [[Three-legged bird|yatagarasu]], that was hidden in the flames to gain a power that would fulfill the wishes of both the worlds below and above the surface. This power was nuclear fusion. Utsuho went mad with the abilities she had gained, and decided that, using these powers, she would take over Gensokyo. Her friend, Rin Kaenbyou, became worried about Utsuho, and drove evil spirits to the surface to cause an incident among the strong y\u014dkai above ground, in hope that they would come down to do something about it and, when they got there, defeat Utsuho and bring her back to her former self. What came, however, was not a strong y\u014dkai, but a strong human.\n\n:She is sometimes called \u2465 (an inverted \u2468) because she seems to have a simple and boastful personality, and is called a birdbrain by Orin. Also, she is often considered an idiot by fans. ZUN also indirectly calls her an idiot in her theme song's description. This leads to comparisons (or pairings) with Cirno.\n\n<span id=\"Koishi Komeiji\"></span>\n;{{Nihongo|Koishi Komeiji|\u53e4\u660e\u5730 \u3053\u3044\u3057|Komeiji Koishi}}\n*Species: [[Satori (folklore)|Satori]]\n*Ability: About enough power to manipulate the unconscious\n*Residence: Moriya Shrine\n:Extra Stage boss. Like her elder sister Satori, she was born with the power to read other people's minds. However, Koishi knew this power of hers would make people feel uneasy around her, so she deliberately closed off this power (which dulled Satori's power as well). She sealed away her own mind to others in doing so, and even her sister would not be able to read her mind. Satori took pity on her, and gave some pets to Koishi, hoping that the animals would open Koishi's heart to others. The plan worked, and Koishi started to care for her pets, and would one day set out to seek the god who gave Utsuho that power so that her own pets could use it too.\n\n===[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]===\n<span id=\"Nazrin\"></span>\n;{{Nihongo|Nazrin|\u30ca\u30ba\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3|Naz\u016brin|alternate spelling '''Nazlin'''}}\n*Species: [[Mouse]] [[y\u014dkai]]\n*Ability: About enough power to find sought-for objects\n*Residence: The Road of Lingering Snow (Stage 1), Makai (Stage 5)\n:Stage 1 boss and stage 5 mid-boss.

The journey from the village to the forest is of a preferable kind than other journeys. Starting with Muenzuka, Rinnosuke collected things from the outside world and the Netherworld, and handles all kinds of tools regardless of whether they are for human or y\u014dkai use, which was indicated as a unique kind of shop, called by Rinnosuke himself as a \"shop that sells found things.\" It also handles things from the outside world, like personal computers, digital cameras, and kitchen stoves, but all products displayed have no price attached to them making price negotiations necessary, and there are also many goods that are not up for sale from the start. It also handles miscellaneous daily items like teacups, and thus Remilia Scarlet and Sakuya Izayoi are frequent customers.\n\n:He is the main character of Curiosities of Lotus Asia, and the only active humanoid male character in the Touhou series. He is also one of the few characters who seem to have no fighting ability. Despite his ability, he does not know how to use the unknown gadgets. Hence, he makes many false theories of his own about the foreign objects from the outside world. For example, he called a [[Game Boy]] a device that allows the user to control humans and possibly destroy the whole world. Later, Yukari corrects him that it is a device that allows the user to control imaginary humans and possibly destroy the whole imaginary world in any place. With few customers, other than some persistent loiterers like Reimu and Marisa, Rinnosuke spends most of his time pursuing his hobby of researching the world beyond Gensokyo.

The plentiful livelihood of Gensokyo is sustained by the maintenance of the indispensable relationship of yokai attacking humans and humans exterminating yokai, and the Miko of Hakurei plays a part in that. Since the Miko of Hakurei also in an indispensable position of maintaining Gensokyo, it has become forbidden for the Miko of Hakurei to exterminate yokai and for yokai to attack the miko, not to mention humans coming to the Hakurei Shrine grounds to meddle. However, since the relation of yokai attacking humans has thus been lost, yokai have been in decline, so Reimu approved of a request she received from yokai to establish battle rules for bouts with yokai and kill time, thus preserving the relation between yokai and humans in a mock style, allowing strong and weak ones to have equal fights without bad aftertastes, called the \"spell card rules\" in the \"Spell Naming Law.\"<ref name=\"gumon\">\u300e\u6c42\u805e\u53f2\u7d00\u300fpp.112-116\u3002</ref><ref group=\"*\">\u30b9\u30da\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u3082\u53c2\u7167</ref> The customs related to the job have been preserved from time immemorial without fail, and as she follows the custom, she takes an attitude of not worrying about the results.\n\nHer main abilities are flying in the sky, good intuition, and getting along with everyone; even those who were once her enemies. In the games, she is characterized by her homing [[amulet]]s and [[yin-yang]] orbs. In addition to being in all of the Touhou games (save Touhou [[Shoot the Bullet|9.5]] and [[Fairy Wars|12.8]]), she is featured in ''[[Graffiti Kingdom]]'' as \"Flying Maiden\", in which ZUN is involved. Due to the way she is often dressed, Reimu's exposed armpits are often used as targets for Internet jokes and memes.\n\n===Marisa Kirisame===\n[[File:Marisa UFO.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Marisa in ''[[Undefined Fantastic Object]]'']]\n<span id=\"Marisa Kirisame\"></span>\n*Species: [[Human]]\n*Ability: Ability to use magic\n*Residence: Forest of Magic\n{{Nihongo|Marisa Kirisame|\u9727\u96e8 \u9b54\u7406\u6c99|Kirisame Marisa}} is a human magician who lives in a cluttered house in the Forest of Magic. She is friends with Reimu and visits her often, but is otherwise solitary and spends most of her time researching magic. She is an avid collector, bordering on having a [[hoarding disorder]], often \"borrowing\" things without permission from various other characters. She talks in a very brash, direct, and often rude way, highlighting her tomboyish nature and otherwise devil-may-care attitude. While she is prone to violence, selfishness, and other disagreeable behaviors, she is also honest and a hard worker, usually on the front lines of defending Gensokyo whenever an incident occurs. She is contrasted with Reimu, the naturally-talented protagonist, as Marisa's powers derive entirely from hard work and determination rather than any abilities she was born with.

Remilia is the vampiric mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion who claims to be descended from [[Vlad III Dracula]] although she is not. She is known as the Scarlet Devil as when she feeds, the blood of her victims stains her dress red. Apart from her unpleasant needs, she is hardly malicious enough to deserve such a title; merely childish, even though she is over five hundred years old. Although being a vampire is normally a lonely life, she has a good relationship with her many employees (including Sakuya and Meiling). Reimu is one of the few humans who tolerates her, and Remilia seems quite fond of her in turn. Marisa also gets along with her in exchange for access to her library. Her power is the control of fate (which has never been overtly demonstrated in the games). She prefers melee fighting to danmaku, but when she does resort to the latter, she is fond of red round bullets and knives.

Remilia's little sister, she is not allowed to leave the mansion's basement. Despite this, she likes her sister and doesn't usually try to escape. Most vampires hold back somewhat when fighting humans, as they plan to keep them alive and feed from them later, but Flandre was always fed prepared dishes and does not know her food comes from humans. Thus, when fighting them, she does not hesitate and incinerates them without a second thought.

This skillfulness is among the finest in Gensokyo.<ref name=\"th075_txt\"/> She is able to make her dolls move pretty much any way humans can, and other than that she can make multiple dolls perform different actions, sometimes making them cooperate and sometimes making them move completely asynchronously, such that to onlookers around her, it might not seem like she is manipulating them. The dolls are also able to manipulate dolls, but it seems like she does it all by herself only when it comes to the task of creating the dolls.<ref name=\"g\"/>\n\n:She has a residence in the Forest of Magic. According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', maybe since she was originally a human, even as a yokai, she has high understanding and friendship level to humans and presents a low danger level, and if someone gets lost in the forest, she also gladly gives shelter upon arriving at her house. However, Alice's house is covered all over with dolls, and since she is not very eager for conversation, it seems like she immediately flees when there is something eerie.<ref name=\"th075_txt\"/><ref name=\"g\"/> In chapters 5-6 of ''Strange and Bright Nature Deity'', the Three Fairies of Light accidentally arrived at her house, and Alice was hospitable to them.\n\n:According to ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', she does not perform the usual act of attacking humans, but unexpectedly likes fights and upon receiving a challenge to do battle, gladly accepts. As she manipulates a great number of combat dolls, the challenger is likely to be highly outnumbered, making a difficult battle inevitable, but since she has her hands full with manipulating the dolls, that is her weakness.\n\n:Since she does not find it enjoyable to win battles with overwhelming power, she usually fights with power that is a little more than that of the opponent. Also, since it would be the end of the ropes if she was defeated while putting forth her true power, she does not give it her all in fights, which is similar in personality to Reimu Hakurei.\n\n:In the character settings text for ''Imperishbable Night'', it was written that she was an indoors type who was often alone, but in ''Perfect Memento in Strict Sense'', the range of her place of activities is set to \"any kind of place\" in Gensokyo, and she also appeared in front of people in times of festivals to exhibit her skill with dolls. In each ending of ''Imperishable Night'' and ''Immaterial and Missing Power'', she participated in banquets at the Hakurei Shrine.

Yuyuko is the princess of the netherworld pagoda, Hakugyokur\u014d. She is a ghost, but unlike most of her kind, looks entirely human. She was a human, cursed with the power to bring death to others; this ability caused her to eventually commit suicide using her life to seal away an ancient evil residing in a y\u014dkai cherry blossom tree. Living in the netherworld, she doesn't socialize much with the rest of Gensokyo. Her only friend from outside is Yukari. Her family name Saigyouji suggests relations with the famed poet [[Saigyo]]. Yuyuko, at first appearance, is a ditz; her mental processes seem to be dedicated mainly to teasing her gardener and servant, Youmu, and anticipating her next meal. However, her usual manner conceals a sharp mind and an almost prenatural depth of insight. For instance, she was the only one to perceive what sort of being Fujiwara no Mokou was at first sight. Yuyuko has the power to invoke death in any mortal; however, she uses it rarely and with discretion. Her danmaku are characterized by butterfly-shaped bullets.

She is the self-appointed stewardess of the seal between Gensokyo and the outside world, but doesn't do a particularly good job of it. Most of the time, she is asleep, leaving all the work to her [[shikigami]] Ran and Ran's shikigami Chen. When she isn't, she tends to amuse herself by pulling in unprepared humans from the outside world and stranding them in Gensokyo. A very irresponsible y\u014dkai. Her calculation and mathematical skills far exceeds that of Ran, being Ran's master. Her ability is the manipulation of boundaries, and this is in terms of the physical and metaphorical. And such boundaries distinguish her spell cards. Often, though, she just summons her shikigami and various others to create her danmaku for her.

Despite her power over insanity, Reisen is portrayed as one of the most level-headed and serious characters in the series.\n\n:According to a series of [[yonkoma]] comics approved by ZUN entitled ''Inaba of The Moon and Inaba of The Earth'', despite the care she generally got, Reisen is often abused by her mistress Kaguya and teacher Eirin, mostly by knocking her out for a long time or subjecting her through 'punishment times'.

Some time later, the moon court pardoned Kaguya's sins and summoned her back. Eirin and a handful of emissaries were sent to retrieve her, but Eirin found out that Kaguya didn't want to return to the moon. Acting out of her past guilt, Eirin betrayed and murdered all the other emissaries under the eyes of the earthlings who had fostered Kaguya.

There, she was amazed to find that Kaguya was also a fugitive. The two still detest each other, killing one another and reincarnating in a daily ritual. However, Mokou is ecstatic that her eternal enemy is a fugitive like her, and that one who can never die is not such an unspeakable abomination in Gensokyo (though she still leads a solitary life.)

This power was nuclear fusion. Utsuho went mad with the abilities she had gained, and decided that, using these powers, she would take over Gensokyo. Her friend, Rin Kaenbyou, became worried about Utsuho, and drove evil spirits to the surface to cause an incident among the strong y\u014dkai above ground, in hope that they would come down to do something about it and, when they got there, defeat Utsuho and bring her back to her former self.

She sealed away her own mind to others in doing so, and even her sister would not be able to read her mind. Satori took pity on her, and gave some pets to Koishi, hoping that the animals would open Koishi's heart to others.

The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)...

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

The anti-Bulgariansim (or Bulgarophobia) increased almost to the level of state ideology during the ideological monopoly of the League of Communists of Macedonia, and still continues to do so today, although with less ferocity... However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations.

It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw.

The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia.

The suffering during the wars, the endless struggle of the Balkan monarchies for dominance over the population increased the Macedonians' sentiment that the institutionalization of an independent Macedonian nation would put an end to their suffering.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The Balkan communist parties supported the national consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian people and created Macedonian sections within the parties, headed by prominent IMRO (United) members. The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)...

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations.

They have a special reserved seat in the nations parliament. In 2002, they numbered 731.

(See also ''[[Macedonians in Slovenia]]''.)\n\nOther significant ethnic Macedonian communities can also be found in the other Western European countries such as Austria, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the whole European Union. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Also in Uruguay, with a significant population in [[Montevideo]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe culture of the people is characterized with both traditionalist and modernist attributes. It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw. Pantelejmona (02).jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the well-known monasteries \u2013 [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|St. Panteleimon]] in Ohrid.]]\n\nMost Macedonians are members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\". The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries.<ref>Matkovski, Aleksandar, ''Grbovite na Makedonija'', Skopje, 1970.</ref><ref>\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 (1990) \u0413\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u041c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430, Skopje, Macedonia&nbsp;\u2014 {{ISBN|86-15-00160-X}}<br></ref> Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] arose, which modeled itself after the earlier [[Internal Revolutionary Organization|Bulgarian revolutionary traditions]] and adopted their symbols as the [[Bulgarian lion|lion]], etc.<ref>Duncan M.

However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] is somewhat similar.\n* '''''[[Vergina Flag (North Macedonia)|Vergina Sun]]:''''' (official flag, 1992\u20131995) The [[Vergina Sun]] is used unofficially by various  associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.
