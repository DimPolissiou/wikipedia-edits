She is named in honor of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the 26th [[President of the United States]]. She is the [[USS\u00a0Roosevelt|fourth ship named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt]], three bearing his full name and a fourth with just his [[SS Roosevelt (1905)|last name]]. Another three U.S. Navy ships have \"Roosevelt\" in their names in honor of members of the [[Roosevelt family]]. This carrier's radio [[call sign]] is \"Rough Rider\", the nickname of President Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders|volunteer cavalry unit]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. She was launched in 1984, and saw her first action during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n==Background==\nInitially, President [[Gerald Ford]] cancelled the order for CVN-71 in 1976 and substituted two [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV-type medium-sized, conventional-powered carrier]]s that were expected to operate [[V/STOL]] aircraft. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, serving as a replacement for the aging {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft. This capability to operate conventional aircraft proved important as the [[Rockwell XFV-12|hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters]] did not come to fruition at the time. In any case, construction of the proposed CVV medium-sized carrier never took place.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History |last=Friedman |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Friedman |year=1983 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn=978-0-87021-739-5 |pages=323\u2013324; 329\u2013333 |url=http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022162107/http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |archive-date=22 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=NANcvvJUL79>{{cite web |title=CVV |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |work=Naval Aviations News |publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]] |location=[[Washington Navy Yard]] |page=8 |format=PDF |date=July 1979 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816080321/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuthorization for CVN-71 was further delayed when President [[Jimmy Carter]] [[Veto#United States|vetoed]] the 1979 Fiscal Year Department of Defense authorization bill because of the inclusion of this ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarrier in the Navy's shipbuilding program.<ref name=NANcvvJUL79/><ref name=Polmar>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events, Volume 2 |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |location=[[Dulles, Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-57488-663-4 |page=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331175731/https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |archive-date=31 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] which required the increased deployment of U.S. aircraft [[carrier battle group]]s to the [[Indian Ocean]], President Carter reversed his stand on ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarriers, and CVN-71 was subsequently authorized under the 1980 Fiscal Year authorization bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.<ref name=Polmar/>\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Theodore Roosevelt'' was the first aircraft carrier to be assembled using modular construction, wherein large modules are independently constructed in \"lay-down\" areas, prior to being hoisted into place and welded together.

in the [[United States Navy]]. She is named in honor of [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the 26th [[President of the United States]]. She is the [[USS\u00a0Roosevelt|fourth ship named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt]], three bearing his full name and a fourth with just his [[SS Roosevelt (1905)|last name]]. Another three U.S. Navy ships have \"Roosevelt\" in their names in honor of members of the [[Roosevelt family]]. This carrier's radio [[call sign]] is \"Rough Rider\", the nickname of President Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders|volunteer cavalry unit]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. She was launched in 1984, and saw her first action during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n==Background==\nInitially, President [[Gerald Ford]] cancelled the order for CVN-71 in 1976 and substituted two [[Aircraft Carrier (Medium)|CVV-type medium-sized, conventional-powered carrier]]s that were expected to operate [[V/STOL]] aircraft. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, serving as a replacement for the aging {{sclass-|Midway|aircraft carrier|0}} carriers, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft. This capability to operate conventional aircraft proved important as the [[Rockwell XFV-12|hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters]] did not come to fruition at the time. In any case, construction of the proposed CVV medium-sized carrier never took place.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History |last=Friedman |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Friedman |year=1983 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |isbn=978-0-87021-739-5 |pages=323\u2013324; 329\u2013333 |url=http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022162107/http://www.usni.org/store/books/aircraft-carriers/us-aircraft-carriers |archive-date=22 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=NANcvvJUL79>{{cite web |title=CVV |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |work=Naval Aviations News |publisher=[[Naval History & Heritage Command]] |location=[[Washington Navy Yard]] |page=8 |format=PDF |date=July 1979 |accessdate=18 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816080321/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1970s/1979/jul79.pdf |archivedate=16 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuthorization for CVN-71 was further delayed when President [[Jimmy Carter]] [[Veto#United States|vetoed]] the 1979 Fiscal Year Department of Defense authorization bill because of the inclusion of this ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarrier in the Navy's shipbuilding program.<ref name=NANcvvJUL79/><ref name=Polmar>{{cite book |title=Aircraft Carriers: A History of Carrier Aviation and Its Influence on World Events, Volume 2 |last=Polmar |first=Norman |year=2006 |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |location=[[Dulles, Virginia]] |isbn=978-1-57488-663-4 |page=364 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |accessdate=17 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331175731/https://books.google.com/books?id=BNAXHkfMs5wC&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=carter+veto+cvn-71&source=bl&ots=qHXzOChxFM&sig=CgSoi5y2rU6niQRye_XGKOMdf-g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MjjoUaTvFIaa9QSWw4C4AQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=carter%20veto%20cvn-71&f=false |archive-date=31 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> As a result of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] which required the increased deployment of U.S. aircraft [[carrier battle group]]s to the [[Indian Ocean]], President Carter reversed his stand on ''Nimitz''-class nuclear supercarriers, and CVN-71 was subsequently authorized under the 1980 Fiscal Year authorization bill for the U.S. Department of Defense.<ref name=Polmar/>\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Theodore Roosevelt'' was the first aircraft carrier to be assembled using modular construction, wherein large modules are independently constructed in \"lay-down\" areas, prior to being hoisted into place and welded together.

The Journal of Ecology, 1984: p. 1-23.</ref> They have yellowish-pink petals arranged radially.<ref name=Salazar/> The heads are about to 3.4&nbsp;cm in length and have a diameter of 4.5 to 4.9&nbsp;cm.<ref name=HopkinsFloral /> Each pseudanthium contains ~1300 small flowers densely packed around a spherical [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]].<ref name=PiechowskiPollination /> The flowers themselves hang off of thin, woody stems known as [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]] approximately one meter below the crown of the tree.<ref name=PiechowskiReproductive /><ref name=PiechowskiPollination /> Flowers typically bloom from December to January in Costa Rica, and from January to August in Venezuela.<ref name=Salazar/>\n\nFertile flowers have a [[gamosepalous]] calyx beneath their corolla<ref name=Salazar/> and display five distinctive lobes.<ref name=HopkinsFloral /> Each fertile flower has ten androgynous stamen evenly joined at their base, with a single style and several minuscule stigma.<ref name=Salazar/><ref name=HopkinsFloral /> Though typically hermaphroditic and containing a single ovary, some flowers are functionally male and lack both ovaries and styles.<ref name=PiechowskiPollination /><ref name=HopkinsFloral />\n\nSome flowers can produce [[nectar]] in large quantities that adheres to the styles. Nectariferous flowers open less fully, despite having a larger diameter than fertile flowers.<ref name=HopkinsFloral /> Nectar is typically produced at dusk after blooming and contains sugar (mainly [[fructose]]) concentrations of 20%.<ref name=PiechowskiPollination /> The nectar produced contains 14 amino acids, though by quantity [[proline]] constitutes 85%,.<ref name=PiechowskiPollination />\n\n=== Fruit ===\nThe fruit/seed pods of ''Parkia pendula'' are considered [[legume]]s. They are 8 to 30&nbsp;cm long and 1.9 to 3.2&nbsp;cm wide.<ref name=Salazar/> Only a few flowers ever fertilize and develop into seed pods.<ref name=PiechowskiFruitDevelopment>Piechowski, D. and G. Gottsberger, Flower and fruit development of Parkia pendula (Fabaceae, Mimosoideae). Acta Botanica Brasilica, 2009. 23(4): p. 1162-1166.</ref>\n\nSeed pods have a variety of exteriors, whether they are shiny, smooth, dull, hairy, sticky, or some combination of those.<ref name=HopkinsLeguminosae /> The fruit pods are also colorful, ranging from olive or deep greens to reddish brown hues.<ref name=PiechowskiFruitDevelopment />\n\n''Parkia pendula'' typically fruits in February and July in Costa Rica, from January to November in Venezuela, and in May in Bolivia. Locals are known to harvest the fruits, typically picking them from trees throughout March and April. The collected fruit pods are left outside until they burst and the seeds can be scooped out.<ref name=Salazar/> \n[[File:Parkia pendula, visgueiro - Flickr - Tarciso Le\u00e3o.jpg|alt=Seeds.|thumb|184x184px|The seeds of ''Parkia pendula''.]]\n\n=== Seeds ===\nThe pods of ''Parkia pendula'' contain anywhere from 15 to 34 seeds.<ref name=HopkinsLeguminosae /> They have an elliptical shape and are 0.9 to 1&nbsp;cm in length and 0.4 to 0.5&nbsp;cm in width.<ref name=Salazar/> Seeds weigh between 0.06 and 0.11 grams and there are said to be 9848 to 10100 seeds per kilogram of fruit pods.<ref name=HopkinsLeguminosae /><ref name=Salazar/>\n\nThe seed pod gum of ''Parkia pendula'' is extremely sticky due to a high concentration of sugars such as galactose and arabinose.<ref name=PiechowskiSeedpod>Piechowski, D. and G. Gottsberger, The seedpod gum of Parkia pendula (Fabaceae) as a deadly trap for vertebrates. 2009.</ref> In fact, there are recorded instances of small vertebrates getting caught in the gum and being fatally trapped due to their exposure to the elements and potential predators.<ref name=PiechowskiSeedpod />\n\nSeeds typically germinate 6 to 19 days after sowing, and anywhere from 36% to 58.5% of seeds actually germinate. Experiments conducted in Brazil showed that by cutting opposite the [[radicle]] emergence, scarring the seeds with an abrasive stone, or immersing in sulfuric acid for less than 30 minutes, germination rates would increase.<ref name=Salazar/>\n\n== Reproduction ==\nThe ''Parkia pendula'' tree exhibits mass flowering, typically with 150 to 200 capitula blooming in one night.<ref name=HopkinsFloral /> The flowers open sequentially from the base to the tip. The capitula appear bright red due to the color of the anthers and filaments, then become yellow-red at dusk when nectar and pollen are produced. When the styles elongate, the plant takes on a purple-red hue, finishing the dramatic color shift all within one night. Flowers are usually shed afterwards within a span of 3 to 4 days.<ref name=PiechowskiFruitDevelopment />\n\n=== Pollination ===\nLike other members of the [[Mimosoideae]] subfamily, ''Parkia pendula'' exhibits pollen aggregation, specifically polyads. It further differentiates itself from other members of Mimosoideae by having globose polyads rather than flattened polyads from pollen grain layering. ''Parkia pendula'' polyads are about 100&nbsp;mm in diameter and composed of 32 pollen grains, with an outer [[exine]] that is grooved. The stigma for each fertile flower only contains a cavity for one polyad, but since the number of pollen grains matches the number of ovules, one polyad can fertilize all the ovules of a flower.<ref name=Capucho>Capucho, L.C. and S.P. Teixeira, Morphology of the unusual polyad in Amazonian Parkia legume trees. Trees, 2014. 28(5): p. 1507-1514.</ref> \n[[File:Phyllostomus discolor b.jpg|alt=Image of Phyllostomus discolor.|thumb|191x191px|''Phyllostomus discolor'', a common pollinator of ''Parkia pendula''.]]\n''Parkia pendula'' is [[Pollination by bats|chiropterophilous]], meaning it is largely pollinated by bats.<ref name=HopkinsFloral /> While a dozen different species have been observed pollinating ''Parkia pendula'', the most common is ''[[Phyllostomus discolor|Phyllastomus discolor]]''.<ref name=PiechowskiReproductive /><ref name=PiechowskiPollination /><ref name=PiechowskiFruitDevelopment /> Bats are attracted to the large quantity of nectar produced by nectariferous flowers. When bats land upside-down on the flowers, large quantities of pollen accumulate on the underside of their feet and spread to other flowers.<ref name=HopkinsFloral /> However, some species, like ''[[Glossophaga soricina]]'', do not land on the flower and do not facilitate pollination.<ref name=PiechowskiPollination />\n\nThe corolla is a key part of pollination, as its round shape and exposed arrangement allows it to be found by bats via echolocation.<ref name=Marinho>Marinho, C., et al., Scent glands in legume flowers. Plant Biology, 2014. 16(1): p. 215-226.</ref> Typically bat-pollinated plants emit a sulfur scent, but ''Parkia pendula'' has no sulfur compounds in its flowers, further substantiating that bats find it by echolocation<ref name=PiechowskiReproductive />\n\n\nOther pollinators include opossums, [[kinkajou]]s, [[Brazilian porcupine|porcupines]], [[South American coati|ring-tailed coati]], certain primates, and occasionally bees.<ref name=PiechowskiReproductive /><ref name=HopkinsFloral />\n\n=== Seed dispersal ===\n''Parkia pendula'' has a unique seed dispersal mechanism. The seed pods secrete an amber-colored gum, and after bursting, the seeds within get stuck on the gum. It then dries and washes away during precipitation.<ref name=PiechowskiFruitDevelopment />\n\nBesides [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]], ''Parkia pendula'' also disperses seeds utilizing animals.

Experiments conducted in Brazil showed that by cutting opposite the [[radicle]] emergence, scarring the seeds with an abrasive stone, or immersing in sulfuric acid for less than 30 minutes, germination rates would increase.<ref name=Salazar/>\n\n== Reproduction ==\nThe ''Parkia pendula'' tree exhibits mass flowering, typically with 150 to 200 capitula blooming in one night.<ref name=HopkinsFloral /> The flowers open sequentially from the base to the tip. The capitula appear bright red due to the color of the anthers and filaments, then become yellow-red at dusk when nectar and pollen are produced. When the styles elongate, the plant takes on a purple-red hue, finishing the dramatic color shift all within one night. Flowers are usually shed afterwards within a span of 3 to 4 days.<ref name=PiechowskiFruitDevelopment />\n\n=== Pollination ===\nLike other members of the [[Mimosoideae]] subfamily, ''Parkia pendula'' exhibits pollen aggregation, specifically polyads. It further differentiates itself from other members of Mimosoideae by having globose polyads rather than flattened polyads from pollen grain layering. ''Parkia pendula'' polyads are about 100&nbsp;mm in diameter and composed of 32 pollen grains, with an outer [[exine]] that is grooved. The stigma for each fertile flower only contains a cavity for one polyad, but since the number of pollen grains matches the number of ovules, one polyad can fertilize all the ovules of a flower.<ref name=Capucho>Capucho, L.C. and S.P.

Plant Biology, 2014. 16(1): p. 215-226.</ref> Typically bat-pollinated plants emit a sulfur scent, but ''Parkia pendula'' has no sulfur compounds in its flowers, further substantiating that bats find it by echolocation<ref name=PiechowskiReproductive />\n\n\nOther pollinators include opossums, [[kinkajou]]s, [[Brazilian porcupine|porcupines]], [[South American coati|ring-tailed coati]], certain primates, and occasionally bees.<ref name=PiechowskiReproductive /><ref name=HopkinsFloral />\n\n=== Seed dispersal ===\n''Parkia pendula'' has a unique seed dispersal mechanism. The seed pods secrete an amber-colored gum, and after bursting, the seeds within get stuck on the gum. It then dries and washes away during precipitation.<ref name=PiechowskiFruitDevelopment />\n\nBesides [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]], ''Parkia pendula'' also disperses seeds utilizing animals. Many primates and parrots feed on the gum due to the high concentration of proteins, carbohydrates, and magnesium.
