He is pressured by his parents to take up driving, but refuses because he does not think it is necessary and because his father, Jack, will not stop panicking when he drives. Duncan suddenly takes up an interest in driving to impress his friend and secret crush, Mia. While his mother, Annie, is happy at first, she becomes concerned when she realizes it is for a girl and bans him from going to an electronic music festival when his friends invite him. He sneaks out and they have the time of their lives. However, when driving home, Duncan accidentally knocks down Ol' Oakie, the city's [[List of oldest trees|oldest tree]].

The settlement's first dwelling was built in 1804 of logs. The first houses were built along the main thoroughfare, today's Broad Street east of the junction between Berwick St. (the continuation of the turnpike and Rt-93 to Hazelton) and Main St. westwards to Junedale, [[Tresckow, Pennsylvania|Tresckow]], and [[Tamaqua, PA|Tamaqua]].\n\nNathan Beach discovered coal in 1812, and opened a 'quarry' (pit mine) in 1813,<ref name=BM/> shipping his coal initially west by wagon to Berwick and Bloomsburg over the Berwick-Nescopeck Toll Bridge. With road improvements, he was able to ship his coal to [[Lausanne Landing]] where [[ark (river boat)|ark]]s were being built by the [[Lehigh Coal Mine Company]] and coal could be transported to Philadelphia. In 1817, stymied by the slow movements of the [[Schuylkill Canal]] [[board of directors]], White and Hazard began the improvements making the one-way [[Lehigh River|Lehigh]] [[Navigations]] in 1818, and travel Lehigh River downstream grew steadily safer. By the end of 1820 the new [[Lehigh Canal]], as yet rough and unfinished, nonetheless enabled a record 365 long-tons to be shipped to Philadelphia. By 1823 steady shipments allowed self-funding and the canal was being re-engineered and a gradual conversion begun into a system with two-way locks; its success in providing the affordable fuel to meet the young nation's energy demands, the Erie Canal opening, followed by the news of railroad events in Britain in 1825 began whole chains of events spurring industrial production and railroads.<ref>See for example, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] with ambitions to link Philadelphia by canal to Pittsburgh and Lake Erie.</ref>\n\nIn 1826 Colonel William H. Wilson moved to the town and built a tavern. In 1831 James Lamison became citizen No. 3 and also opened a tavern.<ref name=BM/> By that time the [[Beaver Meadow Railroad and Coal Company]] had been formed and was subscribing stock. It was chartered on April 13, 1830, and the industrial revolution was about to begin using Beaver Meadows as a center. The company laid tracks down the valleys from Beaver and Black Creeks, the tributaries dumped into the Lehigh below and near Penn Haven Junction where the railroad expected to ship to the Lehigh Canal. At the time, the [[Room Run Railroad]] was occupying space assumed free by the Beaver Meadows planners assumptions, for in 1830 operating managers [[Josiah White]] & [[Erskine Hazard]] of the [[Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company]] (LC&N Co.) were opening new mines (freed now of immediate  or further improvement needs of the Lehigh Canal or the [[Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad]]) in the area of what is now [[Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania|Nesquehoning]] and building a two-mile [[funicular railway]] called the Room Run or Rhume Run Railroad to increase volume shipped by the company. Hence the two railroads were to contend for the same space.  At one point both companies put armed men into the field, but an amicable settlement was reached but for a rate dispute to break out. This resulted in  a resolve to build the railroad all the way to Easton, but a deal was reached after the railroad reached past Mauch Chunk to [[Parryville, Pennsylvania]], where auxiliary barge loading facilities were built.\n\n{{quote|The earliest settlement in Banks township [of 1886] was made in that portion which was in 1897 set off to form the borough of Beaver Meadow.

VanCleve and Co. opening their own mines. By 1833 they began local operations and construction of the railway along the surveyed right of way.  Getting strong-armed by LC&N Co., the company got a change in charter and continued downstream along the Lehigh until LC&N Co. blinked and granted acceptable shipping rate terms.<ref name=BR/> In 1835 they contracted for the first wood-burning steam locomotives to operate in Northampton and Carbon counties, which began operations in 1836. They also demonstrated that a railroad could be built over 30 miles through mountainous country. The Beaver Meadow Railroad became an operational success, and an inspiration. In 1846 investors began ''the \u201cDelaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad Company\u201d'' to link New York Harbor at Jersey City via New Jersey to the Susquehanna and then the great lakes via a line across the Delaware and up the Lehigh. They were successful; this was the start of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], whose oldest parts were the Beaver Meadows Railroad, it absorbed in 1866.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1880= 502\n|1900= 1378\n|1910= 1530\n|1920= 1709\n|1930= 1890\n|1940= 2030\n|1950= 1723\n|1960= 1392\n|1970= 1274\n|1980= 1078\n|1990= 985\n|2000= 968\n|2010= 869\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=841\n|estref=<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=31 January 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2000 census===\nAs of the [[2000 United States Census]], there were 968 people, 404 households, and 258 families in the borough.

The settlement's first dwelling was built in 1804 of logs. The first houses were built along the main thoroughfare, today's Broad Street east of the junction between Berwick St. (the continuation of the turnpike and Rt-93 to Hazelton) and Main St. westwards to Junedale, [[Tresckow, Pennsylvania|Tresckow]], and [[Tamaqua, PA|Tamaqua]].\n\nNathan Beach discovered coal in 1812, and opened a 'quarry' (pit mine) in 1813,<ref name=BM/> shipping his coal initially west by wagon to Berwick and Bloomsburg over the Berwick-Nescopeck Toll Bridge. With road improvements, he was able to ship his coal to [[Lausanne Landing]] where [[ark (river boat)|ark]]s were being built by the [[Lehigh Coal Mine Company]] and coal could be transported to Philadelphia. In 1817, stymied by the slow movements of the [[Schuylkill Canal]] [[board of directors]], White and Hazard began the improvements making the one-way [[Lehigh River|Lehigh]] [[Navigations]] in 1818, and travel Lehigh River downstream grew steadily safer. By the end of 1820 the new [[Lehigh Canal]], as yet rough and unfinished, nonetheless enabled a record 365 long-tons to be shipped to Philadelphia. By 1823 steady shipments allowed self-funding and the canal was being re-engineered and a gradual conversion begun into a system with two-way locks; its success in providing the affordable fuel to meet the young nation's energy demands, the Erie Canal opening, followed by the news of railroad events in Britain in 1825 began whole chains of events spurring industrial production and railroads.<ref>See for example, the [[Main Line of Public Works]] with ambitions to link Philadelphia by canal to Pittsburgh and Lake Erie.</ref>\n\nIn 1826 Colonel William H. Wilson moved to the town and built a tavern. In 1831 James Lamison became citizen No. 3 and also opened a tavern.<ref name=BM/> By that time the [[Beaver Meadow Railroad and Coal Company]] had been formed and was subscribing stock. It was chartered on April 13, 1830, and the industrial revolution was about to begin using Beaver Meadows as a center. The company laid tracks down the valleys from Beaver and Black Creeks, the tributaries dumped into the Lehigh below and near Penn Haven Junction where the railroad expected to ship to the Lehigh Canal. At the time, the [[Room Run Railroad]] was occupying space assumed free by the Beaver Meadows planners assumptions, for in 1830 operating managers [[Josiah White]] & [[Erskine Hazard]] of the [[Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company]] (LC&N Co.) were opening new mines (freed now of immediate  or further improvement needs of the Lehigh Canal or the [[Summit Hill and Mauch Chunk Railroad]]) in the area of what is now [[Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania|Nesquehoning]] and building a two-mile [[funicular railway]] called the Room Run or Rhume Run Railroad to increase volume shipped by the company. Hence the two railroads were to contend for the same space.  At one point both companies put armed men into the field, but an amicable settlement was reached but for a rate dispute to break out. This resulted in  a resolve to build the railroad all the way to Easton, but a deal was reached after the railroad reached past Mauch Chunk to [[Parryville, Pennsylvania]], where auxiliary barge loading facilities were built.\n\n{{quote|The earliest settlement in Banks township [of 1886] was made in that portion which was in 1897 set off to form the borough of Beaver Meadow.

VanCleve and Co. opening their own mines. By 1833 they began local operations and construction of the railway along the surveyed right of way.  Getting strong-armed by LC&N Co., the company got a change in charter and continued downstream along the Lehigh until LC&N Co. blinked and granted acceptable shipping rate terms.<ref name=BR/> In 1835 they contracted for the first wood-burning steam locomotives to operate in Northampton and Carbon counties, which began operations in 1836. They also demonstrated that a railroad could be built over 30 miles through mountainous country. The Beaver Meadow Railroad became an operational success, and an inspiration. In 1846 investors began ''the \u201cDelaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad Company\u201d'' to link New York Harbor at Jersey City via New Jersey to the Susquehanna and then the great lakes via a line across the Delaware and up the Lehigh. They were successful; this was the start of the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], whose oldest parts were the Beaver Meadows Railroad, it absorbed in 1866.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1880= 502\n|1900= 1378\n|1910= 1530\n|1920= 1709\n|1930= 1890\n|1940= 2030\n|1950= 1723\n|1960= 1392\n|1970= 1274\n|1980= 1078\n|1990= 985\n|2000= 968\n|2010= 869\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=841\n|estref=<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref>{{cite web|title=Census of Population and Housing|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=31 January 2008|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Resident Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|work=Population Estimates|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=11 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archivedate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n===2000 census===\nAs of the [[2000 United States Census]], there were 968 people, 404 households, and 258 families in the borough.
