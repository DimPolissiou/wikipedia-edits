[[Romanian Orthodox]] (14.99%), [[Reformed Church in Romania|Hungarian Reformed]] (7.41%), and [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian]] (2.05%) adherents represent the most significant other religious groups.\n\n== History ==\nThe remains of three Dacian fortifications were found in the Jigodin neighbourhood of Miercurea Ciuc; they belong to the Dacian culture of the 1st century. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was the capital of ''Cs\u00edksz\u00e9k'' (Csik seat). Between 1876 and 1918, Cs\u00edkszereda was the seat of [[Cs\u00edk County]] of the historical [[Szeklerland]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, it became part of [[Kingdom of Romania]], and was seat of the [[Ciuc County]] between 1927 and 1938.\n\nMiercurea Ciuc became part of Hungary again between 1940 and 1944 as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]]. In 1944, the Soviet Red Army captured the town. It was returned to Romania in 1945, a move confirmed by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] of 1947. Between 1952-1960, the town was part of the [[Magyar Autonomous Region]], later named the Mure\u0219-Magyar Autonomous Region between 1960-1968. In 1968, Miercurea Ciuc became the county seat of [[Harghita County|Harghita]].\n\nIn the post-World War II period, the town was industrialized; among other projects, a tractor factory, a textile factory and, in the 1960s, a beer factory were built here. The factory is now owned by [[Heineken]]. The Ciuc Beer products have gained an increasing popularity in Romania.\n\n== Climate ==\nMiercurea Ciuc has a cool continental climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: Dfb - without a dry season, although summer is wetter than winter and with a cold summer).\nAt an average temperature of {{cvt|16.3|\u00b0C}}, July is the hottest month of the year. January has the lowest average temperature of the year: {{cvt|-7.7|\u00b0C}}. Between the driest and wettest months, the difference in precipitation is {{convert|64.5|mm}}.\n\nMiercurea Ciuc is one of the coldest cities in Romania, with temperatures plummeting towards {{cvt|-20|\u00b0C}} much more often than anywhere in the country, sometimes as early as November. Snow falls as early as October and as late as April.\n\n{{Weather box\n| width = auto\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes \n| location = Miercurea Ciuc, Romania  \n\n| Jan record high F  =   |

During the summer, the street is a popular destination for afternoon and evening recreational activities.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nMiercurea-Ciuc is home to the Baroque church at [[\u0218umuleu Ciuc]] and, in the city center, the [[Mik\u00f3 Castle]], built in a late [[Renaissance]] style. The original more decorative castle was raised in the 17th century on the orders of Ferenc Mik\u00f3 H\u00eddv\u00e9gi, the personal advisor of [[Gabriel Bethlen]], then prince of Transylvania. Much of the castle was destroyed in 1661 during the [[Tatar]] raids, but it was rebuilt at the beginning of the 18th century and was mainly used as a barracks; today it houses the Cs\u00edk Sz\u00e9kely Museum. Behind the castle is a small ''Skanzen'' (museum village), consisting of a few traditional Cs\u00edki houses and wooden gates. Across the road from the castle is the city hall built in 1886, originally the county hall of the old Hungarian [[Cs\u00edk County]]. Beside the castle is the 1904 Courthouse. The latest significant addition to the architectural landscape is the controversial 2001 Millennium Church, designed by Hungarian architect [[Imre Makovecz]] and located next to the Baroque Church of the Holy Cross. There is a large Romanian Orthodox church (1929-1939) in the city center. The Orthodox Church has Neo-Byzantine characteristics. It was built in the former administrative center of Miercurea Ciuc, the Castle Square.\n<gallery>\nFile:Cs\u00edkszeredai sz\u00ednh\u00e1z 2014.JPG|Theater\nFile:Magyar konzul\u00e1tus.JPG|Consulate of Hungary\nFile:Millenium templom 2014.JPG|Roman Catholic church (designed by [[Imre Makovecz]])\nFile:RO HR Miercurea Ciuc Orthodox cathedral.jpg|Orthodox cathedral\nFile:Igazs\u00e1g\u0171gyi palota 2014.JPG|Court House\nFile:Megyei k\u00f6nyvt\u00e1r 2014.JPG|Library\nFile:A megyeh\u00e1za.JPG|County Hall\nFile:Pet\u0151fi Street, Cs\u00edkszereda.jpg|Pet\u0151fi Street\n</gallery>\n\n==\u0218umuleu/Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3 Pentecost Pilgrimage ==\n[[File:Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3i templom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Franciscan church in Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3/\u0218umuleu]]\nA few kilometres to the east of the city centre is the Franciscan monastery of \u0218umuleu Ciuc, known in Hungarian as ''Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3''. A wooden-sculpture figure of the Virgin Mary, known as the Weeping Mary, can be found in the monastery church, which is the destination of a traditional pilgrimage of [[Roman Catholic]] Sz\u00e9kely held since 1567, called the \"Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3 Pilgrimage\" (Romanian: ''Pelerinajul de la Sumuleu''; Hungarian: ''Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3i B\u00facs\u00fa''). The event,  held on the Saturday before [[Pentecost]], attracts several hundred thousand people every year. The mass for the pilgrims is held on a meadow near the church. This traditional gathering is not only attended by [[Sz\u00e9kely]] and [[Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3]] Hungarians living in the region, but also by a great number of mostly Hungarian [[Catholics]] from other parts of Transylvania region, Hungary and all over the world.

[[Romanian Orthodox]] (14.99%), [[Reformed Church in Romania|Hungarian Reformed]] (7.41%), and [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarian]] (2.05%) adherents represent the most significant other religious groups.\n\n== History ==\nThe remains of three Dacian fortifications were found in the Jigodin neighbourhood of Miercurea Ciuc; they belong to the Dacian culture of the 1st century. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was the capital of ''Cs\u00edksz\u00e9k'' (Csik seat). Between 1876 and 1918, Cs\u00edkszereda was the seat of [[Cs\u00edk County]] of the historical [[Szeklerland]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1920, it became part of [[Kingdom of Romania]], and was seat of the [[Ciuc County]] between 1927 and 1938.\n\nMiercurea Ciuc became part of Hungary again between 1940 and 1944 as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]]. In 1944, the Soviet Red Army captured the town. It was returned to Romania in 1945, a move confirmed by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] of 1947. Between 1952-1960, the town was part of the [[Magyar Autonomous Region]], later named the Mure\u0219-Magyar Autonomous Region between 1960-1968. In 1968, Miercurea Ciuc became the county seat of [[Harghita County|Harghita]].\n\nIn the post-World War II period, the town was industrialized; among other projects, a tractor factory, a textile factory and, in the 1960s, a beer factory were built here. The factory is now owned by [[Heineken]]. The Ciuc Beer products have gained an increasing popularity in Romania.\n\n== Climate ==\nMiercurea Ciuc has a cool continental climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: Dfb - without a dry season, although summer is wetter than winter and with a cold summer).\nAt an average temperature of {{cvt|16.3|\u00b0C}}, July is the hottest month of the year. January has the lowest average temperature of the year: {{cvt|-7.7|\u00b0C}}. Between the driest and wettest months, the difference in precipitation is {{convert|64.5|mm}}.\n\nMiercurea Ciuc is one of the coldest cities in Romania, with temperatures plummeting towards {{cvt|-20|\u00b0C}} much more often than anywhere in the country, sometimes as early as November. Snow falls as early as October and as late as April.\n\n{{Weather box\n| width = auto\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes \n| location = Miercurea Ciuc, Romania  \n\n| Jan record high F  =   |

During the summer, the street is a popular destination for afternoon and evening recreational activities.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nMiercurea-Ciuc is home to the Baroque church at [[\u0218umuleu Ciuc]] and, in the city center, the [[Mik\u00f3 Castle]], built in a late [[Renaissance]] style. The original more decorative castle was raised in the 17th century on the orders of Ferenc Mik\u00f3 H\u00eddv\u00e9gi, the personal advisor of [[Gabriel Bethlen]], then prince of Transylvania. Much of the castle was destroyed in 1661 during the [[Tatar]] raids, but it was rebuilt at the beginning of the 18th century and was mainly used as a barracks; today it houses the Cs\u00edk Sz\u00e9kely Museum. Behind the castle is a small ''Skanzen'' (museum village), consisting of a few traditional Cs\u00edki houses and wooden gates. Across the road from the castle is the city hall built in 1886, originally the county hall of the old Hungarian [[Cs\u00edk County]]. Beside the castle is the 1904 Courthouse. The latest significant addition to the architectural landscape is the controversial 2001 Millennium Church, designed by Hungarian architect [[Imre Makovecz]] and located next to the Baroque Church of the Holy Cross. There is a large Romanian Orthodox church (1929-1939) in the city center. The Orthodox Church has Neo-Byzantine characteristics. It was built in the former administrative center of Miercurea Ciuc, the Castle Square.\n<gallery>\nFile:Cs\u00edkszeredai sz\u00ednh\u00e1z 2014.JPG|Theater\nFile:Magyar konzul\u00e1tus.JPG|Consulate of Hungary\nFile:Millenium templom 2014.JPG|Roman Catholic church (designed by [[Imre Makovecz]])\nFile:RO HR Miercurea Ciuc Orthodox cathedral.jpg|Orthodox cathedral\nFile:Igazs\u00e1g\u0171gyi palota 2014.JPG|Court House\nFile:Megyei k\u00f6nyvt\u00e1r 2014.JPG|Library\nFile:A megyeh\u00e1za.JPG|County Hall\nFile:Pet\u0151fi Street, Cs\u00edkszereda.jpg|Pet\u0151fi Street\n</gallery>\n\n==\u0218umuleu/Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3 Pentecost Pilgrimage ==\n[[File:Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3i templom.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Franciscan church in Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3/\u0218umuleu]]\nA few kilometres to the east of the city centre is the Franciscan monastery of \u0218umuleu Ciuc, known in Hungarian as ''Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3''. A wooden-sculpture figure of the Virgin Mary, known as the Weeping Mary, can be found in the monastery church, which is the destination of a traditional pilgrimage of [[Roman Catholic]] Sz\u00e9kely held since 1567, called the \"Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3 Pilgrimage\" (Romanian: ''Pelerinajul de la Sumuleu''; Hungarian: ''Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3i B\u00facs\u00fa''). The event,  held on the Saturday before [[Pentecost]], attracts several hundred thousand people every year. The mass for the pilgrims is held on a meadow near the church. This traditional gathering is not only attended by [[Sz\u00e9kely]] and [[Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3]] Hungarians living in the region, but also by a great number of mostly Hungarian [[Catholics]] from other parts of Transylvania region, Hungary and all over the world. Beside its religious importance, the pilgrimage has also become a demonstration of the awareness and solidarity of Catholic Hungarian people living in and outside the historical region of [[Transylvania]].<ref>[http://historicaltextarchive.com/hungary/csksom.html Cs\u00edksomly\u00f3 Pilgrimage]\n</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe City Council has 19 members:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!

He works as a janitor at Kronish Laboratories, which is run by Elias Kronish. After being publicly shamed by Dr. Stu Camillo, he talks to Elias Kronish about his plan to eradicate herpes, due to him contracting it the night of the moon landing. Later, after eating dinner with his parents, he tries to beat the last level of \"Biotic Wars\", unequipping all of his gear as a new strategy. He succeeds, and beats the game, being labeled as an in-game savior. While masturbating to a character in the game known as \"Tiger\", both Tiger and another character \"Wolf\" land in his room after time traveling. They explain to Josh that Biotic Wars was used to recruit their potential savior, and after a period of disbelief, they travel back in time to 1969, where he encounters younger versions of his family. They soon engage in a fight with a group of bikers, then stealing their clothes to blend in to their surroundings. They enter a diner, where a gun set off by Josh causes them to flee, right before Wolf throws down a mine, killing one of two cops, one being referred to as Santiago and the other Skarsgaard.\n

Later, after eating dinner with his parents, he tries to beat the last level of \"Biotic Wars\", unequipping all of his gear as a new strategy. He succeeds, and beats the game, being labeled as an in-game savior. While masturbating to a character in the game known as \"Tiger\", both Tiger and another character \"Wolf\" land in his room after time traveling. They explain to Josh that Biotic Wars was used to recruit their potential savior, and after a period of disbelief, they travel back in time to 1969, where he encounters younger versions of his family. They soon engage in a fight with a group of bikers, then stealing their clothes to blend in to their surroundings. They enter a diner, where a gun set off by Josh causes them to flee, right before Wolf throws down a mine, killing one of two cops, one being referred to as Santiago and the other Skarsgaard.\n

The county capital [[T\u00e2rgu Jiu]] is located about 35&nbsp;km northeast. The city administers eight villages: Dealu Pomilor, Hor\u0103\u0219ti, \u00censur\u0103\u021bei, Leurda, Lupoi\u021ba, Plo\u0219tina, Ro\u0219iu\u021ba and R\u00e2pa.\n\n== History ==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1977 |15998\n|1992 |26626\n|2002 |25860\n|2011 |18142\n}}\n\nMotru was created by an administrative decision on the day of 24 May 1966 on the territory of the former Plo\u0219tina commune, which, together with seven other villages, became part of the new city. The reason behind the decision to create a city was the development of several coal deposits.\n\nThe region is at least since the time of the [[Roman Empire]] inhabited, in Leurda in 1964, some silver coins from the era of [[Emperor Septimius Severus]] (193-211) were found. The oldest documented settlement in the territory of present-day town Plo\u0219tina (1385 is mentioned).\n\nThe [[Dacia]]n town [[Amutria]] is mentioned in ancient sources like [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia]] (c. 150 AD) and [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] (2nd century AD), and potentially placed here.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctte|1917|p=96}} The name is homonymous with the ancient name of Motru river.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctte|1917|p=96}}\nAfter the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of [[Dacia]], Amutria was part of an important road network, between [[Drubetis]] and [[Pelendava]].\n\nIn 1981, Motru was the site of riots from miners who were working in the mines of the city. The riots, which took place between 17 and 19 October of that year, were triggered by poor work conditions, tight control of legislative organizations and the general exhaustion of the miners, further exacerbated by a decree that limited consumption of bread only to the dwellers of the city. During the riots, [[Emil Bobu]] visited the city, where he was attacked by angry crowds with potatoes; when he returned to Bucharest, he ordered the army to intervene in the city after 2 days of protests from the local populace. At the time, the inexpensive Motru bread attracted many workers and farmers into the city, who carried the bread loafs in sacks and arrived in the town by local trains known as \"trains of hunger\".

The county capital [[T\u00e2rgu Jiu]] is located about 35&nbsp;km northeast. The city administers eight villages: Dealu Pomilor, Hor\u0103\u0219ti, \u00censur\u0103\u021bei, Leurda, Lupoi\u021ba, Plo\u0219tina, Ro\u0219iu\u021ba and R\u00e2pa.\n\n== History ==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1977 |15998\n|1992 |26626\n|2002 |25860\n|2011 |18142\n}}\n\nMotru was created by an administrative decision on the day of 24 May 1966 on the territory of the former Plo\u0219tina commune, which, together with seven other villages, became part of the new city. The reason behind the decision to create a city was the development of several coal deposits.\n\nThe region is at least since the time of the [[Roman Empire]] inhabited, in Leurda in 1964, some silver coins from the era of [[Emperor Septimius Severus]] (193-211) were found. The oldest documented settlement in the territory of present-day town Plo\u0219tina (1385 is mentioned).\n\nThe [[Dacia]]n town [[Amutria]] is mentioned in ancient sources like [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia]] (c. 150 AD) and [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] (2nd century AD), and potentially placed here.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctte|1917|p=96}} The name is homonymous with the ancient name of Motru river.{{sfn|Sch\u00fctte|1917|p=96}}\nAfter the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest of [[Dacia]], Amutria was part of an important road network, between [[Drubetis]] and [[Pelendava]].\n\nIn 1981, Motru was the site of riots from miners who were working in the mines of the city. The riots, which took place between 17 and 19 October of that year, were triggered by poor work conditions, tight control of legislative organizations and the general exhaustion of the miners, further exacerbated by a decree that limited consumption of bread only to the dwellers of the city. During the riots, [[Emil Bobu]] visited the city, where he was attacked by angry crowds with potatoes; when he returned to Bucharest, he ordered the army to intervene in the city after 2 days of protests from the local populace. At the time, the inexpensive Motru bread attracted many workers and farmers into the city, who carried the bread loafs in sacks and arrived in the town by local trains known as \"trains of hunger\". Nowadays the bread factory is in ruins.<ref>https://adevarul.ro/locale/targu-jiu/care-fost-adevaratul-tren-foamei-provine-porecla-primita-1_59c3d99f5ab6550cb865665b/index.html</ref>\n\n== Present ==\n\nIn today's incorporated villages were partially free farmers, others were in the monastery [[Tismana]] submissive.\n\nMotru was declared a [[municipiu]] in 2000.\n\nMining is the city's main industry; agriculture and livestock are also important, especially in its attached villages.\n\nAt the 2011 census, the population was 18,142, including 17,988 [[Romanians]], 38 Hungarians, 83 Roma and 3 Germans.\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nMotru has a rail connection on a route leading from [[Strehaia]], which was put into operation in 1962.
