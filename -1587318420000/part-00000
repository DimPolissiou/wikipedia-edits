With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials.

With more than 200 faculty in 15 departments, 4 colleges, and 2 Department of Defense research laboratories, MRI was designed to break down the academic walls that traditionally divide disciplines and thereby enable faculty to collaborate across departmental and even college boundaries. MRI has become a model for this interdisciplinary approach to research, both within and outside the university. Dr. Richard E. Tressler was an international leader in the development of high-temperature materials. He pioneered high-temperature fiber testing and use, advanced instrumentation and test methodologies for thermostructural materials, and design and performance verification of ceramics and composites in high-temperature aerospace, industrial and energy applications. He was founding director of the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) which supported many faculty and students from the College of Earth and Mineral Science, the Eberly College of Science, the College of Engineering, the Materials Research Laboratory and the Applied Research Laboratories at Penn State on high-temperature materials.

Recording sessions took place during 2005 to 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also features [[Guest appearance#Contemporary music|guest appearances]] from recording artists such as [[Dwele]], [[T-Pain]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]]. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist [[Takashi Murakami]], who would also design the cover art for West's collaborative album with [[Kid Cudi]], eponymously titled ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'' (2018).\n\nInspired by [[Stadium rock|stadium]] [[Concert tour|tours]], [[House music|house-music]] and [[indie rock]], ''Graduation'' marked a departure from the ornate, [[soul music|soul]]-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered [[synthesizer]]s and dabbled with [[electronic music|electronics]] while [[Sample (music)|sampling]] from various [[music genre]]s and altering his approach to [[rapping]]. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. ''Graduation'' concludes the education theme of West's first two albums ''[[The College Dropout]]'' (2004) and ''[[Late Registration]]'' (2005). \n\n''Graduation'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States and been certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits \"[[Stronger (Kanye West song)|Stronger]]\", \"[[Good Life (Kanye West song)|Good Life]]\" and \"[[Homecoming (Kanye West song)|Homecoming]]\", the former of which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album received widely positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]], as well as his third nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It was named as one the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'', while also listed among numerous decade-end lists.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between ''Graduation'' and rapper [[50 Cent]]'s ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of [[gangsta rap]] in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\n== Background ==\n''Graduation'' is the third installment of West's planned [[tetralogy]] of education-themed studio albums, which West subsequently later deviated from due to the events surrounding the conception of his fourth studio album, ''[[808s & Heartbreak]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"Patel\">{{cite web | last=Patel | first=Joseph | title=Producer Kanye West's Debut LP Features Jay-Z, ODB, Mos Def | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472302/20030604/index.jhtml?headlines=true | date=2003-06-05 | publisher=[[MTV]] [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] | accessdate=2009-04-21 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504171249/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472302/20030604/index.jhtml?headlines=true | archivedate=2009-05-04 }}</ref> The album demonstrates yet another distinctive progression in West's musical style and approach to [[Record production|production]].

The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother [[Donda West]] less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fianc\u00e9e Alexis Phifer, the trace

[[Kanye West]], released on September 11, 2007, through [[Def Jam Recordings]] and [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. Recording sessions took place during 2005 to 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also features [[Guest appearance#Contemporary music|guest appearances]] from recording artists such as [[Dwele]], [[T-Pain]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]]. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist [[Takashi Murakami]], who would also design the cover art for West's collaborative album with [[Kid Cudi]], eponymously titled ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'' (2018).\n\nInspired by [[Stadium rock|stadium]] [[Concert tour|tours]], [[House music|house-music]] and [[indie rock]], ''Graduation'' marked a departure from the ornate, [[soul music|soul]]-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered [[synthesizer]]s and dabbled with [[electronic music|electronics]] while [[Sample (music)|sampling]] from various [[music genre]]s and altering his approach to [[rapping]]. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. ''Graduation'' concludes the education theme of West's first two albums ''[[The College Dropout]]'' (2004) and ''[[Late Registration]]'' (2005). \n\n''Graduation'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States and been certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits \"[[Stronger (Kanye West song)|Stronger]]\", \"[[Good Life (Kanye West song)|Good Life]]\" and \"[[Homecoming (Kanye West song)|Homecoming]]\", the former of which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album received widely positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]], as well as his third nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It was named as one the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'', while also listed among numerous decade-end lists.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between ''Graduation'' and rapper [[50 Cent]]'s ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of [[gangsta rap]] in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\n== Background ==\n''Graduation'' is the third installment of West's planned [[tetralogy]] of education-themed studio albums, which West subsequently later deviated from due to the events surrounding the conception of his fourth studio album, ''[[808s & Heartbreak]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"Patel\">{{cite web | last=Patel | first=Joseph | title=Producer Kanye West's Debut LP Features Jay-Z, ODB, Mos Def | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472302/20030604/index.jhtml?headlines=true | date=2003-06-05 | publisher=[[MTV]] [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] | accessdate=2009-04-21 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504171249/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472302/20030604/index.jhtml?headlines=true | archivedate=2009-05-04 }}</ref> The album demonstrates yet another distinctive progression in West's musical style and approach to [[Record production|production]].

The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother [[Donda West]] less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fianc\u00e9e Alexis Phifer, the trace
