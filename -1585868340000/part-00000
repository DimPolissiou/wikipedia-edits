It also saw the ousting of the incumbent [[coalition government]] of [[Pakatan Harapan]] after having ruled for 22 months following their victory in the [[2018 Malaysian general election]].\n\nThe crisis started when several political parties joined forces and tried to form a new government by claiming majority seats in the [[Dewan Rakyat]], the lower chamber of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]], without going through an election. It was accomplished through the withdrawal of the [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party]] (Bersatu) from the Pakatan Harapan coalition and through the support of several MPs from the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR) who left the party. The prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, resigned as a result.\n\nThe [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], [[Abdullah of Pahang]], then met with all MPs and political party leaders to gauge their support for a new prime minister. He ultimately appointed the president of Bersatu, Muhyiddin Yassin, as the prime minister. Muhyiddin announced that his coalition government will be called [[Perikatan Nasional]].\n\nThree states, [[Johor]], [[Malacca]], and [[Perak]] also experienced changes in the respective state governments as Perikatan Nasional gained majorities in the [[State legislative assemblies of Malaysia|state legislative assemblies]].\n\n==Background and key people==\n{{multiple image\n | border = infobox\n | caption_align = center\n |align = center \n | total_width = 600\n | footer =\n | image1 = Mahathir 2019 (cropped).jpg\n | caption1 = [[Mahathir Mohamad]], the 7th [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]\n | image2 = Anwar Ibrahim, May 2013.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Anwar Ibrahim]], the president of [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat|PKR]]\n | image3 = Azmin Ali 2019 (cropped).jpg\n | caption3 = [[Azmin Ali]], former deputy president of PKR\n | image4 = TSMY Menteri Dalam Negeri.jpg\n | caption4 = [[Muhyiddin Yassin]], the 8th Prime Minister\n }}\n\n[[Pakatan Harapan]] ({{Lit|Coalition of Hope}}), a coalition of four political parties, [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR), [[Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia]] (Bersatu), [[Parti Amanah Negara]] (Amanah), and [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), won the [[2018 Malaysian general election]] against the then-incumbent [[Barisan Nasional]], which had held power in the [[Federal government of Malaysia|federal government]] for 60 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-s-opposition-band-together-under-new-pakatan-harapan-al-8240190|title=Malaysia's opposition band together under new Pakatan Harapan alliance|author=Melissa Goh|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 September 2015|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/malaysia-opposition-pulls-shocking-election-win-180509184811723.html|title=Malaysia's opposition pulls off shocking election win|last=|first=|date=10 May 2018|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref> [[Mahathir Mohamad]], the chairman of Bersatu and president of Pakatan Harapan, was elected as the seventh [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], making him the oldest prime minister in the world at age 92.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44063675|title=Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad sworn in after shock comeback victory|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2018|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> He had previously served as the fourth prime minister from 1981 until 2003 under the banner of [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), a component party of Barisan Nasional.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/1445602/Mahathir-bows-out-with-parting-shot-at-the-Jews.html|title=Mahathir bows out with parting shot at the Jews|last=Spillius|first=Alex|date=31 October 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|accessdate=5 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104212437/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/1445602/Mahathir-bows-out-with-parting-shot-at-the-Jews.html|archive-date=4 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> He left the party in 2016 and founded Bersatu to oppose the regime of the sixth prime minister, [[Najib Razak]], whom he had repeatedly urged to resign after the [[1MDB scandal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/mahathir-quits-umno-calling-it-najibs-party |title=Mahathir quits Umno, calling it 'Najib's party' |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nMahathir reconciled with his former political rival [[Anwar Ibrahim]] who was the leader of PKR, in order to win the election.

It also saw the ousting of the incumbent [[coalition government]] of [[Pakatan Harapan]] after having ruled for 22 months following their victory in the [[2018 Malaysian general election]].\n\nThe crisis started when several political parties joined forces and tried to form a new government by claiming majority seats in the [[Dewan Rakyat]], the lower chamber of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]], without going through an election. It was accomplished through the withdrawal of the [[Malaysian United Indigenous Party]] (Bersatu) from the Pakatan Harapan coalition and through the support of several MPs from the [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party]] (PKR) who left the party. The prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, resigned as a result.\n\nThe [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], [[Abdullah of Pahang]], then met with all MPs and political party leaders to gauge their support for a new prime minister. He ultimately appointed the president of Bersatu, Muhyiddin Yassin, as the prime minister. Muhyiddin announced that his coalition government will be called [[Perikatan Nasional]].\n\nThree states, [[Johor]], [[Malacca]], and [[Perak]] also experienced changes in the respective state governments as Perikatan Nasional gained majorities in the [[State legislative assemblies of Malaysia|state legislative assemblies]].\n\n==Background and key people==\n{{multiple image\n | border = infobox\n | caption_align = center\n |align = center \n | total_width = 600\n | footer =\n | image1 = Mahathir 2019 (cropped).jpg\n | caption1 = [[Mahathir Mohamad]], the 7th [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]]\n | image2 = Anwar Ibrahim, May 2013.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Anwar Ibrahim]], the president of [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat|PKR]]\n | image3 = Azmin Ali 2019 (cropped).jpg\n | caption3 = [[Azmin Ali]], former deputy president of PKR\n | image4 = TSMY Menteri Dalam Negeri.jpg\n | caption4 = [[Muhyiddin Yassin]], the 8th Prime Minister\n }}\n\n[[Pakatan Harapan]] ({{Lit|Coalition of Hope}}), a coalition of four political parties, [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR), [[Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia]] (Bersatu), [[Parti Amanah Negara]] (Amanah), and [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP), won the [[2018 Malaysian general election]] against the then-incumbent [[Barisan Nasional]], which had held power in the [[Federal government of Malaysia|federal government]] for 60 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/malaysia-s-opposition-band-together-under-new-pakatan-harapan-al-8240190|title=Malaysia's opposition band together under new Pakatan Harapan alliance|author=Melissa Goh|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|date=22 September 2015|accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/malaysia-opposition-pulls-shocking-election-win-180509184811723.html|title=Malaysia's opposition pulls off shocking election win|last=|first=|date=10 May 2018|work=[[Al Jazeera]]|access-date=11 August 2018}}</ref> [[Mahathir Mohamad]], the chairman of Bersatu and president of Pakatan Harapan, was elected as the seventh [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], making him the oldest prime minister in the world at age 92.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44063675|title=Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad sworn in after shock comeback victory|publisher=BBC News|date=10 May 2018|accessdate=12 June 2018}}</ref> He had previously served as the fourth prime minister from 1981 until 2003 under the banner of [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), a component party of Barisan Nasional.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/1445602/Mahathir-bows-out-with-parting-shot-at-the-Jews.html|title=Mahathir bows out with parting shot at the Jews|last=Spillius|first=Alex|date=31 October 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=UK|accessdate=5 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104212437/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/malaysia/1445602/Mahathir-bows-out-with-parting-shot-at-the-Jews.html|archive-date=4 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> He left the party in 2016 and founded Bersatu to oppose the regime of the sixth prime minister, [[Najib Razak]], whom he had repeatedly urged to resign after the [[1MDB scandal]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/mahathir-quits-umno-calling-it-najibs-party |title=Mahathir quits Umno, calling it 'Najib's party' |date=1 March 2016 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nMahathir reconciled with his former political rival [[Anwar Ibrahim]] who was the leader of PKR, in order to win the election.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 2 April, there have been 97 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 2 April, there have been 97 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, including the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), fears of supply shortages resulting in [[panic buying]] of essential items, and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.
