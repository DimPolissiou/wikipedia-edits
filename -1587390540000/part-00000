{"title_page": "Alvin Duskin", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=November 2019}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Underlinked|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{short description|American educator, entrepreneur, and activist}}\n'''Alvin Duskin''' is a San Francisco Bay Area educator, entrepreneur and activist known for a series of progressive campaigns he spearheaded in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1970s. These initiatives included the San Francisco anti-highrise ads,<ref name=\":0\"/> a battle to stop the sale of Alcatraz Island to a Texas oil-man and an initiative that stopped the development of nuclear power plants in California. Duskin fought these battles alongside journalists, activists and admen.\n\nDuskin is also known for founding The Alvin Duskin Company, a successful women's fashion label he created in the 60's. The brand achieved national distribution and funded many of Duskin's anti-war and environmental campaigns.\n\nLater in his career he founded or co-founded start-ups, serving as CEO in wind, hydro, conservation, and food companies.\n\n==Early life==\nAlvin Duskin was born in San Francisco in 1931, went to public schools, worked in his family's sweater factory as a teenager. He enrolled at Stanford University in 1948.\n\nAs an undergraduate, he was an English major. After two years he transferred to San Francisco State where he met his first wife, Constance Slater. They were married in 1951. He returned to Stanford as a graduate student, planning on a PhD program in philosophy.\n\nIn 1952, a few months before being drafted to serve in the Army in the Korean War, he volunteered to the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia. He completed what was essentially \u201cboot camp\u201d and was released into the Marine Corps Reserve. He returned to Stanford, was accepted as a doctoral candidate and was a tutor in Symbolic Logic to first year philosophy students.\n\n== Further Education ==\nAfter his first year of graduate school, Duskin's funding under the GI Bill ran out. He went to half time as a graduate student and took a job selling his family's sweaters to stores in Northern California. Duskin and Slater's first child, Marcus, was born in 1953, Laura was born in 1956.\n\nBy 1958 Duskin realized there were no job opportunities for philosophy teachers at four year colleges and universities, so he decided to earn a teaching credential as a graduate student at San Francisco State.  After a semester of classes and student teaching, he was offered a faculty position at SF State teaching freshman English. When SF State College became San Francisco State University in 1959, he was told that he would have to finish his doctorate. He returned to Stanford, bought a house near the campus, and began his dissertation.\n\n== Emerson College ==\nEarly in 1960, Duskin heard that Emerson College was to be formed in Pacific Grove on the Monterey Peninsula. Emerson would be part of a group of \u201cfree schools\u201d on a plateau above Point Lobos that would be called Walden West.  He called the founder, Mark Goldes, met with him, and at 29 years of age, accepted a position as Dean of Emerson college and philosophy teacher. After the first year, as the school began receiving public recognition, he became president of the college and chairman of its board.\nThe college moved to San Francisco and the name was changed to San Francisco New School to avoid confusion with Emerson College of Boston. The college attracted many more students in an urban environment and faculty volunteered to join on a part-time basis.\n\n== The Alvin Duskin Company ==\nIn 1962 his third child, Sarah, was born. With three children, Duskin needed a better income and was offered a position as head of the Summerhill School to be formed in New York. He accepted the job but the start date was delayed to 1965. To cover a year's loss of income he started a small store to sell women's sweaters with the intention of returning to teaching in a year.\n\nEarly in the life of his store a woman came in and said she had seen knit dresses at a downtown San Francisco store that looked like his sweaters. She suggested Alvin might want to lengthen his sweaters and market them as dresses. He took her advice. The dresses began regularly selling out. He founded The Alvin Duskin Company to make and sell dresses and the company became a quick San Francisco success.\n\nDuskin decided to build his brand into a women's clothing company with national distribution. Over the next seven years he expanded his factory and staff. His dresses were a hit with young, hip women. One dress, The Peace Dress with peace symbols knit into the fabric, was called by the New York Times, \u201cThe Fastest Selling Dress in History.\u201d Stores such as Bloomingdales and Macy's created Alvin Duskin Departments.\n\n== Political Activism ==\nDuskin was managing two disparate careers, one, a capitalist dress manufacturer and another, a left-leaning social activist. He became well known in the Bay Area through his environmental campaigns and anti-war activities. His allies in these battles ranged from San Francisco ad execs to organizations like the War Resisters League.\n\nAmong the campaigns he led were stopping the sale of Alcatraz Island to a Texas oil-man, blocking the construction of the Peripheral Canal to take Northern California water and deliver it to Southern California, supporting GI coffee houses and organizing anti-war rallies in Golden Gate Park and the Marin County Civic Center. He also was involved in delaying the construction of the Yerba Buena Center until housing was provided for displaced residents of the South-of Market neighborhood and organizing the Anti High-Rise campaigns in San Francisco to maintain the livability of the city.\n\nAs part of his new success Duskin moved his family into a large house in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. He also bought a weekend house in Carmel Highlands where, in a critical coincident, his next-door neighbor was the legendary political organizer, Saul Alinsky.\n\n== The End of the Alvin Duskin Company ==\nBy 1971 Duskin was ready to leave the garment business and focus on political and environmental work. The Alvin Duskin Company was sold\u2014under terms that proved to be unfavorable.\n\nDuskin accepted a position as the organizer of The California Project for Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation, a part-time job that included establishing a school in Berkeley for community organizers. He also joined Public Interest Communication, a non-profit advertising agency with clients like Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace and became its Managing Director.\n\nAfter a second year he left the agency and organized a statewide initiative to limit the development of nuclear power plants in California. The initiative failed at the polls but Duskin wrote its key provisions as The Nuclear Safeguards Act and the California Legislature passed the bill. Planned nuclear plants were cancelled and existing plants eventually shut down. The success of the campaign led to Alvin's appointment as a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\n== Stopping the Sale of Alcatraz ==\nAt the end of the 60's Texas billionaire, Lamar Hunt, presented a proposal to the Surplus Property Commission to completely redevelop Alcatraz, and install a monument to the Apollo missions and a Victorian theme park.<ref name=\"therock\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3FGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA467&lpg=PA467&dq=Alvin+Duskin+against+proposal+alcatraz+lamar+hunt#v=onepage&q=Alvin%20Duskin%20against%20proposal%20alcatraz%20lamar%20hunt|title=THE ROCK: A HISTORY OF ALCATRAZ ISLAND, 1847-1972|publisher=Jeffrey Frank Jones}}</ref><ref name=\"might\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatmighthavebeen.org/stories-1/|title=Alcatraz: Space Museum and More|publisher=What Might Have Been}}</ref> The commission accepted Hunts proposal and approved the sale.<ref name=\"therock\" /><ref name=\"might\" />\n\nHearing about the idea, Duskin took out full page ads in local newspapers starting a campaign proclaiming the deal \"As Big a Steal as Manhattan Island\". His campaign was successful and the commission rescinded the sale.  and a group of Native Americans moved onto the island. In May 1971, the [[General Services Administration]] announced that it planned to transfer Alcatraz to the Department of the Interior, and in 1972 the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] was created. Alcatraz was opened by the National Park Service for public tours beginning in October 1973.\n\n== Second Marriage ==\nIn 1970 Duskin married Sara Urquhart, a Scottish woman who had worked with him as the head of the design department at the dress company after several years managing the chain of high-fashion stores, Paraphernalia. They had three children, Ceres, David, and Zoe.\n\n== Skyscraper campaign ==\nIn 1971, Duskin started a ballot measure called Proposition T, which would have limited the height of buildings in San Francisco to 72 feet. Duskin compared high rises to \"tombstones\", and said that \"the city was being controlled by developers.\" He took out full-page newspaper ads publicly denouncing turning San Francisco into \"a skyline of tombstones\"<sup>[[Alvin Duskin#cite note-sfgate-8|<nowiki>]</nowiki>]]</sup> and predicting \"The Manhattanization of San Francisco\" with dramatic photos comparing the low San Francisco skyline to New York City's mighty towers.\n\nThe mayor at the time, [[Joseph Alioto]] called him an \"irresponsible extremist\". Duskin's measure ultimately failed with only 37.8% of voters who supported the proposal. Duskin launched another referendum in June 1972, which would have imposed limits 60 feet. That initiative garnered 43.2% approval of voters.\n\nDuskin announced that he would launch a third initiative with a limit of 40 feet and that voters were clearly moving to a majority anti-high rise position. In 1973 the San Francisco board of supervisors voted to limit building heights in the residential neighborhoods, permitting skyscrapers only in the downtown financial districts.\n\n== On To Washington ==\nIn 1977 Duskin became a Senior Aide for Energy Legislation in the US Senate, working in the office of Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota. In that position he wrote the Amendments to the Windfall Profits Tax Act that established a 15% tax credit on the price of wind and solar equipment. As there was already a 10% tax credit on the purchase of any business equipment, the combined 25% credit was crucial to the launch of the wind and solar industries.\n\n== Moving Into Private Industry ==\nIn 1979 Alvin left the Senate and co-founded US Windpower. He moved back to California and uncovered, before any of his competitors, a government study identifying Altamont Pass as the ideal location in California for wind farms. Duskin leased land in the Altamont Pass where US Windpower built the world's first wind farm.\n\nIn 1983 Alvin accepted a position as CEO of Northern Power, a specialist in remote power for telecommunications and defense. Northern built projects in Antarctica, in Pakistan and Norway. In 1986 he decided to leave the wind business and work on the lessening of Cold War tensions by developing joint ventures with industrial firms in the Soviet Union.\n\nWith John Eastwood, an expert in hydropower, he formed The Bering Company and partnered with Electrosila and Leningrad Metal Works in a joint venture that built hydro stations on the Hudson River and for the city of Tacoma. After a promising start, operations were put on a hold when the Soviet Union was terminated and the future of the joint venture was uncertain.\n\nTo maintain a presence in Eastern Europe, Alvin formed The Copernican Group and raised funds to buy a cereals and potato processing company, PPZ, located in Torun, Poland, from the Polish Federal Government in Warsaw. He led the company, renamed Torun Pacific, for three years and sold the potato side to Phanni of Germany and the cereal side to Nestle of Switzerland and General Mills of Minneapolis.\n\nThe joint venture in Russia could not be revived and he stopped his monthly commutes to Europe and spent the next years full-time with Sara and their children in San Francisco. He organized a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to develop flywheel energy technology with the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and, when that was not successful, a joint development project with the Combustion Engineering Department at Stanford.\n\nWith James Boettcher and Michael Woelk he co-founded Corigin Solutions, a California company to produce and market [[biochar]], a soil-additive that holds water and carbon in farm soil, reducing the amount of water needed for farm irrigation and sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\nDuskin currently resides in the tiny town of Tomales on the Northern California coast, completing a biography that chronicles his many adventures. He continues to pursue new projects, both socialist and capitalist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/california-today-skyscraper-san-francisco.html|title=California Today: When Skyscraper Was a Dirty Word|last=Fuller|first=Thomas|date=April 17, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 1, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Midpeninsula Free University]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[[iarchive:EcologyEmergesAlvinDuskin|Ecology Emerges Interview with Duskin]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duskin, Alvin}}\n[[Category:People from San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople from the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Clothing manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{BLP sources|date=November 2019}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Underlinked|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{short description|American educator, entrepreneur, and activist}}\n'''Alvin Duskin''' is a San Francisco Bay Area educator, entrepreneur and activist known for a series of progressive campaigns he spearheaded in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1970s.

His allies in these battles ranged from San Francisco ad execs to organizations like the War Resisters League.\n\nAmong the campaigns he led were stopping the sale of Alcatraz Island to a Texas oil-man, blocking the construction of the Peripheral Canal to take Northern California water and deliver it to Southern California, supporting GI coffee houses and organizing anti-war rallies in Golden Gate Park and the Marin County Civic Center. He also was involved in delaying the construction of the Yerba Buena Center until housing was provided for displaced residents of the South-of Market neighborhood and organizing the Anti High-Rise campaigns in San Francisco to maintain the livability of the city.\n\nAs part of his new success Duskin moved his family into a large house in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. He also bought a weekend house in Carmel Highlands where, in a critical coincident, his next-door neighbor was the legendary political organizer, Saul Alinsky.\n\n== The End of the Alvin Duskin Company ==\nBy 1971 Duskin was ready to leave the garment business and focus on political and environmental work. The Alvin Duskin Company was sold\u2014under terms that proved to be unfavorable.\n\nDuskin accepted a position as the organizer of The California Project for Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas Foundation, a part-time job that included establishing a school in Berkeley for community organizers. He also joined Public Interest Communication, a non-profit advertising agency with clients like Planned Parenthood and Greenpeace and became its Managing Director.\n\nAfter a second year he left the agency and organized a statewide initiative to limit the development of nuclear power plants in California. The initiative failed at the polls but Duskin wrote its key provisions as The Nuclear Safeguards Act and the California Legislature passed the bill. Planned nuclear plants were cancelled and existing plants eventually shut down. The success of the campaign led to Alvin's appointment as a director of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\n== Stopping the Sale of Alcatraz ==\nAt the end of the 60's Texas billionaire, Lamar Hunt, presented a proposal to the Surplus Property Commission to completely redevelop Alcatraz, and install a monument to the Apollo missions and a Victorian theme park.<ref name=\"therock\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3FGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA467&lpg=PA467&dq=Alvin+Duskin+against+proposal+alcatraz+lamar+hunt#v=onepage&q=Alvin%20Duskin%20against%20proposal%20alcatraz%20lamar%20hunt|title=THE ROCK: A HISTORY OF ALCATRAZ ISLAND, 1847-1972|publisher=Jeffrey Frank Jones}}</ref><ref name=\"might\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatmighthavebeen.org/stories-1/|title=Alcatraz: Space Museum and More|publisher=What Might Have Been}}</ref> The commission accepted Hunts proposal and approved the sale.<ref name=\"therock\" /><ref name=\"might\" />\n\nHearing about the idea, Duskin took out full page ads in local newspapers starting a campaign proclaiming the deal \"As Big a Steal as Manhattan Island\". His campaign was successful and the commission rescinded the sale.  and a group of Native Americans moved onto the island. In May 1971, the [[General Services Administration]] announced that it planned to transfer Alcatraz to the Department of the Interior, and in 1972 the [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] was created. Alcatraz was opened by the National Park Service for public tours beginning in October 1973.\n\n== Second Marriage ==\nIn 1970 Duskin married Sara Urquhart, a Scottish woman who had worked with him as the head of the design department at the dress company after several years managing the chain of high-fashion stores, Paraphernalia. They had three children, Ceres, David, and Zoe.\n\n== Skyscraper campaign ==\nIn 1971, Duskin started a ballot measure called Proposition T, which would have limited the height of buildings in San Francisco to 72 feet. Duskin compared high rises to \"tombstones\", and said that \"the city was being controlled by developers.\" He took out full-page newspaper ads publicly denouncing turning San Francisco into \"a skyline of tombstones\"<sup>[[Alvin Duskin#cite note-sfgate-8|<nowiki>]</nowiki>]]</sup> and predicting \"The Manhattanization of San Francisco\" with dramatic photos comparing the low San Francisco skyline to New York City's mighty towers.\n\nThe mayor at the time, [[Joseph Alioto]] called him an \"irresponsible extremist\". Duskin's measure ultimately failed with only 37.8% of voters who supported the proposal. Duskin launched another referendum in June 1972, which would have imposed limits 60 feet. That initiative garnered 43.2% approval of voters.\n\nDuskin announced that he would launch a third initiative with a limit of 40 feet and that voters were clearly moving to a majority anti-high rise position. In 1973 the San Francisco board of supervisors voted to limit building heights in the residential neighborhoods, permitting skyscrapers only in the downtown financial districts.\n\n== On To Washington ==\nIn 1977 Duskin became a Senior Aide for Energy Legislation in the US Senate, working in the office of Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota. In that position he wrote the Amendments to the Windfall Profits Tax Act that established a 15% tax credit on the price of wind and solar equipment. As there was already a 10% tax credit on the purchase of any business equipment, the combined 25% credit was crucial to the launch of the wind and solar industries.\n\n== Moving Into Private Industry ==\nIn 1979 Alvin left the Senate and co-founded US Windpower. He moved back to California and uncovered, before any of his competitors, a government study identifying Altamont Pass as the ideal location in California for wind farms. Duskin leased land in the Altamont Pass where US Windpower built the world's first wind farm.\n\nIn 1983 Alvin accepted a position as CEO of Northern Power, a specialist in remote power for telecommunications and defense. Northern built projects in Antarctica, in Pakistan and Norway. In 1986 he decided to leave the wind business and work on the lessening of Cold War tensions by developing joint ventures with industrial firms in the Soviet Union.\n\nWith John Eastwood, an expert in hydropower, he formed The Bering Company and partnered with Electrosila and Leningrad Metal Works in a joint venture that built hydro stations on the Hudson River and for the city of Tacoma. After a promising start, operations were put on a hold when the Soviet Union was terminated and the future of the joint venture was uncertain.\n\nTo maintain a presence in Eastern Europe, Alvin formed The Copernican Group and raised funds to buy a cereals and potato processing company, PPZ, located in Torun, Poland, from the Polish Federal Government in Warsaw. He led the company, renamed Torun Pacific, for three years and sold the potato side to Phanni of Germany and the cereal side to Nestle of Switzerland and General Mills of Minneapolis.\n\nThe joint venture in Russia could not be revived and he stopped his monthly commutes to Europe and spent the next years full-time with Sara and their children in San Francisco. He organized a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to develop flywheel energy technology with the Lawrence Livermore National Lab and, when that was not successful, a joint development project with the Combustion Engineering Department at Stanford.\n\nWith James Boettcher and Michael Woelk he co-founded Corigin Solutions, a California company to produce and market [[biochar]], a soil-additive that holds water and carbon in farm soil, reducing the amount of water needed for farm irrigation and sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide.\n\nDuskin currently resides in the tiny town of Tomales on the Northern California coast, completing a biography that chronicles his many adventures. He continues to pursue new projects, both socialist and capitalist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/california-today-skyscraper-san-francisco.html|title=California Today: When Skyscraper Was a Dirty Word|last=Fuller|first=Thomas|date=April 17, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 1, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Midpeninsula Free University]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[[iarchive:EcologyEmergesAlvinDuskin|Ecology Emerges Interview with Duskin]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Duskin, Alvin}}\n[[Category:People from San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Businesspeople from the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Clothing manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Duskin"}

In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned.

He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]].

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

In 781, during a visit to Rome, he made his two youngest sons kings, crowned by the Pope.{{efn|From 781 Adrian began dating papal documents by the years of Charlemagne's reign, instead of the reign of the [[Byzantine Emperor]].<ref>Asimov, I.

The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took [[Barcelona]] in a great siege in 797.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]\n\nCharlemagne kept his daughters at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest daughter Rotrude and [[Constantine VI]] of Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).<ref>Runciman, Steven. \"The Empress Irene the Athenian.\" Medieval Women. Ed. Derek Baker. Oxford: Ecclesiastical History Society, 1978.</ref> Charlemagne's opposition to his daughters' marriages may possibly have intended to prevent the creation of [[cadet branch]]es of the family to challenge the main line, as had been the case with [[Tassilo III of Bavaria|Tassilo of Bavaria]]. However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.{{sfn|Becher|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|p=91}}\n\n==Italian campaigns==\n\n===Conquest of the Lombard kingdom===\n[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life.

Shown here, the pope asks Charlemagne for help at a meeting near Rome.]]\n\nAt his succession in 772, [[Pope Adrian I]] demanded the return of certain cities in the former [[exarchate of Ravenna]] in accordance with a promise at the succession of Desiderius. Instead, Desiderius took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for Rome. Adrian sent ambassadors to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius sent his own ambassadors denying the pope's charges. The ambassadors met at [[Thionville]], and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne demanded what the pope had requested, but Desiderius swore never to comply. Charlemagne and his uncle [[Bernhard, son of Charles Martel|Bernard]] crossed the Alps in 773 and chased the Lombards back to [[Siege of Pavia (773\u201374)|Pavia, which they then besieged]].<ref name=\"Kohn2006\">{{cite book|last=Kohn|first=George C.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=OIzreCGlHxIC&|page=125}}|title=Dictionary of Wars|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4381-2916-7|pages=125\u2013}}</ref> Charlemagne temporarily left the siege to deal with [[Adelchis]], son of Desiderius, who was raising an army at [[Verona]].

Lombard War}}\n\nThe siege lasted until the spring of 774 when Charlemagne visited the pope in Rome. There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty. Their co-conspirator, Arechis, was not subdued, and Adelchis, their candidate in [[Byzantium]], never left that city. Northern Italy was now faithfully his.\n\n===Southern Italy===\nIn 787, Charlemagne directed his attention towards the [[Duchy of Benevento]],{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889}} where [[Arechis II of Benevento|Arechis II]] was reigning independently with the self-given title of [[Princeps]]. Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arechis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u201386}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waiofar]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, a possible son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref> In the campaign of 769, Charlemagne seems to have followed a policy of \"overwhelming force\" and avoided a major pitched battle<ref>Bachrach, Bernard (2013). Charlemagne's Early Campaigns (768\u2013777): A Diplomatic and Military Analysis. Leiden: Brill. 2013, p. 234</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent. Charlemagne also promulgated a law code, the ''[[Lex Frisonum]]'', as he did for most subject peoples.<ref>A. M. L. Fadda (2000), \"The Vernacular and the Propagation of the Faith in Anglo-Saxon Missionary Activity\", ''Studies in Church History''. Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law. Charlemagne introduced the ''[[Capitulary for the Jews]]'', a prohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending due to the religious convictions of the majority of his constituents, in essence banning it across the board, a reversal of his earlier recorded general policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldology.com/Europe/early_dark_ages_3.htm |title=Charlemagne created a peaceful environment for Jews in his kingdom.

Carolus Magnus.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne in a copper engraving of the 16th-century by Giovanni Battista Cavalieri]]\n\nPart of Charlemagne's success as a warrior, an administrator and ruler can be traced to his admiration for learning and education. His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it. Charlemagne came into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Moorish Spain, Anglo-Saxon England,<ref>''Charlemagne and Anglo-Saxon England'', Joanna Story, ''Charlemagne: Empire and Society'', ed. Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests. He greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia.\n\nCharlemagne was a lover of books, sometimes having them read to him during meals. He was thought to enjoy the works of [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\">{{cite journal |last=Bullough |first=Donald A. |authorlink=Donald A.

Due to the increased interest of intellectual pursuits and the urging of their king, the monks accomplished so much copying that almost every manuscript from that time was preserved. At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still.\n\nThe pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Italians]] [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; and Franks [[Angilbert]], Angilram, [[Einhard]] and [[Waldo of Reichenau]].\n\nCharlemagne promoted the [[liberal arts]] at court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who tutored him in arithmetic.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nHis great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he attempted to learn\u2014practising the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow\u2014\"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success\", and his ability to read\u2014which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports\u2014has also been called into question.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nIn 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on strengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral quality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change, he had developed support from clergy who approved his desire to deepen the piety and morals of his subjects.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne |title=Charlemagne |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date= 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 809\u2013810, Charlemagne called a church council in [[Aachen]], which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (''ex Patre [[Filioque]]'') and sanctioned inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the phrase ''Filioque'' (and the Son).

[[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [[Alcuin]], who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence.\n\nThe revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming Merovingian and Germanic influence had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.\n\n===Political reforms===\nCharlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance while continuing many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The rise of the medieval world, 500\u20131300: a biographical dictionary|last=Schulman|first=Jana K.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0313011085|location=Westport, CN|page=xx}}</ref>\n\n====Divisio regnorum====\nIn 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death.

Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.

One of the great medieval [[literary cycle]]s, the Charlemagne cycle or the ''[[Matter of France]]'', centres on his deeds\u2014the Emperor with the Flowing Beard of ''[[Song of Roland|Roland]]'' fame\u2014and his historical commander of the border with [[Brittany]], [[Roland]], and the 12 [[paladin]]s.

It should. It seems to be based, in large part, on the historical adventures of Charlemagne, the Frankish King of the Ninth Century, who eventually became Emperor. Looking at Charlemagne's life and personality, it becomes clear that he and Geoffrey's Arthur are practically twins.\"</ref> During the [[Hundred Years' War]] in the 14th century, there was considerable cultural conflict in England, where the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] rulers were aware of their French roots and identified with Charlemagne, Anglo-Saxon natives felt more affinity for Arthur, whose own legends were relatively primitive. Therefore, storytellers in England adapted legends of Charlemagne and his 12 Peers to the Arthurian tales.<ref>[http://www.mementomedievalia.com/charlemagne-king-arthur-and-contested-national-identity-in-english-romances/ Charlemagne, King Arthur and Contested National Identity in English Romances]<br /> Modelling his narrative on earlier Middle English texts, the English AMA-poet, appropriates aspects of the historical reality of Charlemagne and refashions them to fit Arthur, creating a hero that the English can claim as their own.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the spirit of Charlemagne appears to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in the [[Paradiso (Dante)#Fifth Sphere (Mars: The Warriors of the Faith)|Heaven of Mars]], among the other \"warriors of the faith\".<ref name=\"DLS17\">[[Dorothy L.

Charles was succeeded in 741 by his sons [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]] and [[Pepin the Short]], the father of Charlemagne. In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]]. Orman{{sfn|Oman|1914|pp=409\u201310}} portrays the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne as the foundation event of an independent [[France]] under its first king [[Charles the Bald]]; an independent Germany under its first king [[Louis the German]]; and an independent intermediate state stretching from the [[Low Countries]] along the borderlands to south of Rome under [[Lothair I]], who retained the title of emperor and the capitals [[Aachen]] and [[Rome]] without the jurisdiction. The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into the Western kingdom (later France) and the Eastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\" nations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the [[Benelux]] and [[Switzerland]]. \n==Rise to power==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Date of birth====\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources.

Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n== Wives, concubines, and children ==\nCharlemagne had eighteen children with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father.

There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty.

Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arechis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u201386}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waiofar]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, a possible son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref> In the campaign of 769, Charlemagne seems to have followed a policy of \"overwhelming force\" and avoided a major pitched battle<ref>Bachrach, Bernard (2013). Charlemagne's Early Campaigns (768\u2013777): A Diplomatic and Military Analysis. Leiden: Brill. 2013, p. 234</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried?

In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Veleti and fought the Abotrites.\n\nGodfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law.

His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it.

Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests.

At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance.

Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.

In 1989 Yello released a remix medley of several of their songs on the CD single \"Of Course I'm Lying\", known as the \"Metropolitan Mixdown 1989 Part II\"; the medley also contains a fragment of \"The Rhythm Divine\".\n\nBilly MacKenzie, lead singer of [[Associates (duo)|The Associates]], who had previously worked with Yello on several occasions,  provided lyrics and backing vocals. A previously limited 12\" version of the song<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Yello-Featuring-Billy-Mackenzie-The-Rhythm-Divine/release/372835</ref>, featuring Mackenzie on lead vocals, was re-issued in 1990 on The Associates compilation ''Popera''.\n\nBassey's vocals were recorded at Yello's studio in Zurich. The song blends the electro-pop sound of the 1980s with a classic big Bassey ballad and introduced Shirley Bassey to a younger generation. A video featuring both Shirley Bassey and Yello was released on the Yello compilation video ''Essential Yello'' in 1992. The song was regularly performed live by Bassey in the following year, albeit with a different orchestral arrangement.\n\nThe single was also released in the US and Canada on the Polygram Vertigo label, on a double 12\" single, which included the 12\" version.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Country\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position<br /><ref>[http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Yello+%26+Shirley+Bassey&titel=The+Rhythm+Divine&cat=s AT, SW, NL charts]</ref><ref>[http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/BASSEY%2C+SHIRLEY/single German chart]</ref><ref>[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ UK chart]</ref><ref>[http://lp3.pl/alpt.phtml?m=12&w=509 LP3 Chart, Poland] ([[Lista Przeboj\u00f3w Programu Trzeciego]])</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Austria\n|align=\"center\"|19\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Switzerland\n|align=\"center\"|21\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Netherlands\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Poland\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Germany\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|United Kingdom\n|align=\"center\"|54\n|}\n\n==Track listing==\n;UK 7\" single\nIssued on Some Bizzare Label  Mer 253 and European 7\" single Mercury 888 746-7\n\n*A: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (single version) - 3.30\n*B: \"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small> - 3.55\n\n;UK 12\" single\nIssued on Some Bizzare Label (Mercury Merx 2531987).\n<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/Yello-Shirley-Bassey-The-Rhythm-Divine/release/372820]</ref>\n\n*A: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (Version Two) (featuring Billy Mckenzie on vocals)\n*B1: \"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small>\n*B2: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (Original 7\" version) (Boris Blank)\n\n;UK 12\" single\nIssued on Mercury 888 746-12 (1987).\n\n*A: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (12\" version) - 5.05 (featuring Shirley Bassey on vocals)\n*B1: \"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small> - 3.55\n*B2: \"Tool In Rose\" (Boris Blank) - 5.38\n\n;European 2nd 12\" single\nIssued on Mercury MERXR 253 (1987).\n\n*A: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (Version 2) - (featuring Billy Mackenzie on vocals)\n*B1: \"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small>\n*B2: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (7\" version) - (featuring Shirley Bassey on vocals)\n;European CD single\nIssued on Mercury 888 746-2\n\n#\"The Rhythm Divine\" (12\" version) - 5.05\n#\"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small> - 3.55\n#\"Tool In Rose\" (Boris Blank) - 5.38\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{youtube|smwR21SDqEY|\"The Rhythm Divine\" Official video}}\n*{{MetroLyrics song|yello|the-rhythm-divine}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n\n{{Yello}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rhythm Divine}}\n[[Category:1987 singles]]\n[[Category:Yello songs]]\n[[Category:Shirley Bassey songs]]\n[[Category:1987 songs]]\n[[Category:Mercury Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Dieter Meier]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Boris Blank (musician)]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the song by Enrique Iglesias|Rhythm Divine}}\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = The Rhythm Divine\n| cover      = UKRhythmDivine.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Yello]] and [[Shirley Bassey]]\n| album      = [[One Second (Yello album)|One Second]]\n| released   = 1987\n| format     = [[7\" single]]<br>[[12\" single]]<br>[[CD single]]\n| recorded   = 1987\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]]\n| length     = 3.30\n| label      = [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]\n| writer     = Boris Blank, Dieter Meier, [[Billy Mackenzie]]\n| producer   = Yello, Hubertus Von Hohenlohe\n| chronology = [[Shirley Bassey]]\n| prev_title = [[There's No Place Like London]]\n| prev_year  = 1986\n| next_title = [[Love Is No Game]]\n| next_year  = 1988\n| misc       = {{Extra album cover\n | header  = The Rhythm Divine\n | type    = single\n | cover   = EURhythmDivine.jpg\n | border  =\n | alt     =\n | caption = Alternative European cover\n}}\n{{Audio sample\n | type        = single\n | file        = Yello - The Rhythm Divine.ogg\n | description = \"The Rhythm Divine\"\n}}\n}}\n\n\"'''The Rhythm Divine'''\" is a 1987 song by [[Boris Blank (musician)|Boris Blank]], [[Dieter Meier]], and [[Billy Mackenzie]].\n\n==Single release==\nThe single was released by [[Yello]] and [[Shirley Bassey]] in 1987 and was the first CD single by Shirley Bassey.

In 1989 Yello released a remix medley of several of their songs on the CD single \"Of Course I'm Lying\", known as the \"Metropolitan Mixdown 1989 Part II\"; the medley also contains a fragment of \"The Rhythm Divine\".\n\nBilly MacKenzie, lead singer of [[Associates (duo)|The Associates]], who had previously worked with Yello on several occasions,  provided lyrics and backing vocals. A previously unreleased 12\" version of the song, featuring Mackenzie on lead vocals, was issued in 1990 on The Associates compilation ''Popera''.\n\nBassey's vocals were recorded at Yello's studio in Zurich. The song blends the electro-pop sound of the 1980s with a classic big Bassey ballad and introduced Shirley Bassey to a younger generation. A video featuring both Shirley Bassey and Yello was released on the Yello compilation video ''Essential Yello'' in 1992. The song was regularly performed live by Bassey in the following year, albeit with a different orchestral arrangement.\n\nThe single was also released in the US and Canada on the Polygram Vertigo label, on a double 12\" single, which included the 12\" version.\n\n==Chart performance==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!align=\"left\"|Country\n!align=\"left\"|Peak<br />position<br /><ref>[http://dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Yello+%26+Shirley+Bassey&titel=The+Rhythm+Divine&cat=s AT, SW, NL charts]</ref><ref>[http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/BASSEY%2C+SHIRLEY/single German chart]</ref><ref>[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ UK chart]</ref><ref>[http://lp3.pl/alpt.phtml?m=12&w=509 LP3 Chart, Poland] ([[Lista Przeboj\u00f3w Programu Trzeciego]])</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Austria\n|align=\"center\"|19\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Switzerland\n|align=\"center\"|21\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Netherlands\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Poland\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Germany\n|align=\"center\"|47\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|United Kingdom\n|align=\"center\"|54\n|}\n\n==Track listing==\n;UK 7\" single\nIssued on Some Bizzare Label  Mer 253 and European 7\" single Mercury 888 746-7\n\n*A: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (single version) - 3.30\n*B: \"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small> - 3.55\n\n;UK 12\" single\nIssued on Some Bizzare Label (Mercury Merx 2531987).\n<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/Yello-Featuring-Billy-Mackenzie-The-Rhythm-Divine/Some Bizarre Phonogram]</ref>\n\n*A: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (Version Two) (featuring Billy Mckenzie on vocals)\n*B1: \"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small>\n*B2: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (Original 7\" version) (Boris Blank)\n\n;European 12\" single\nIssued on Mercury 888 746-12 (1987).\n\n*A: \"The Rhythm Divine\" (12\" version) - 5.05 (featuring Shirley Bassey on vocals)\n*B1: \"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small> - 3.55\n*B2: \"Tool In Rose\" (Boris Blank) - 5.38\n\n;European CD single\nIssued on Mercury 888 746-2\n\n#\"The Rhythm Divine\" (12\" version) - 5.05\n#\"Dr. Van Steiner\" (Boris Blank) <small>(Instrumental)</small> - 3.55\n#\"Tool In Rose\" (Boris Blank) - 5.38\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{youtube|smwR21SDqEY|\"The Rhythm Divine\" Official video}}\n*{{MetroLyrics song|yello|the-rhythm-divine}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n\n{{Yello}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rhythm Divine}}\n[[Category:1987 singles]]\n[[Category:Yello songs]]\n[[Category:Shirley Bassey songs]]\n[[Category:1987 songs]]\n[[Category:Mercury Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Dieter Meier]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Boris Blank (musician)]]\n", "name_user": "Soulstewmartin", "label": "safe", "comment": "added 12\" Release with lead Vocals by Billy Mackenzie", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rhythm_Divine"}

He traveled to the New World (probably in 1527). Orellana served in [[Nicaragua]] until joining Pizarro's army in Peru in 1533, where he supported Pizarro in his conflict with [[Diego de Almagro]] (1538). After the victory over De Almagro's men, he was appointed governor of La Culata and re-established the town of Guayaquil, previously founded by [[Pizarro]] and repopulated by [[Sebasti\u00e1n de Belalc\u00e1zar]].\n(During the civil war he sided with the Pizarros and was Ensign General of a force sent by Francisco Pizarro from Lima in aid of Hernando Pizarro. He was granted land at Puerto Viejo, on the coast of Ecuador.)\n\n==First exploration of the Amazon River==\n[[Image:Voyage of Francisco de Orellana Map by Ant\u00f3nio Pereira 1546.jpg|thumb|Manuscript map of Francisco de Orellana's expedition of 1539 to 1542. Map attributed to Ant\u00f3nio Pereira, a Portuguese seaman.]]\n[[Image:Pizarroshipbuilding.jpg|thumb|[[Shipwright]]s from Francisco de Orellana's expedition building a small [[brigantine]], the ''San Pedro'']]\n\nIn 1540 [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] arrived in [[Quito]] as governor and was charged by [[Francisco Pizarro]] with an expedition to locate the \"Land of Cinnamon\", thought to be somewhere to the east. Orellana was one of [[Gonzalo Pizarro]]'s lieutenants during his 1541 expedition east of [[Quito]] into the [[South America]]n interior. In Quito, Gonzalo Pizarro collected a force of 220 Spaniards and 4000 natives, while Orellana, as second in command, was sent back to [[Guayaquil]] to gather troops and horses. Pizarro left Quito in February 1541 just before Orellana arrived with his 23 men and horses. Orellana hurried after the main expedition, eventually making contact with them in March. However, by the time the expedition had left the mountains, 3000 natives and 140 Spanish had either died or deserted.\n\nOn reaching the [[Coca River|River Coca]] (a tributary of the Napo), a [[brigantine]], the ''San Pedro'', was constructed to ferry the sick and supplies.\nGonzalo Pizarro ordered him to explore the [[Coca River]] and return after finding the river's end. When they arrived at the confluence with the [[Napo River]], his men threatened to mutiny if they did not continue. On 26 December 1541 he agreed to be elected chief of the new expedition and to conquer new lands in name of the king. Orellana (with the Dominican [[Gaspar de Carvajal]] who chronicled the expedition) and 50 men set off downstream to find food. Unable to return against the current, Orellana waited for Pizarro, finally sending back three men with a message, and started construction of a second brigantine, the ''Victoria''. Pizarro had in the meantime returned to Quito by a more northerly route, by then with only 80 men left alive.\n\nAfter leaving the village on the Napo, Orellana continued downstream to the Amazon. The 49 men began to build a bigger ship for river navigation. During their navigation on Napo River they were threatened constantly by the [[Cambeba|Omaguas]]. They reached the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Negro River]] on 3 June 1542 and finally arrived on the Amazon River.\n\nAt a longitude of about 69\u00b0W Orellana and his men were involved in a skirmish with Machiparo's natives and were chased downstream. Continuing downstream they consecutively passed the Rio de la Trinidad (= Rio Jurua?), the Pueblo Vicioso, the Rio Negro (named by Orellana), the Pueblo del Corpus, the Pueblo de los Quemados and the Pueblo de la Calle at about 57\u00b0W. There they entered the territory of the [[Pira-tapuya]]. The name 'Amazon' is said to arise from a battle Francisco de Orellana fought with a tribe of Tapuyas. The women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was the custom among the tribe. Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the mythical [[Amazons]] of Asia described by [[Herodotus]] (see ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [4.110-116]) and [[Diodorus]] in Greek legends.  A skirmish with these South American warrior women<ref>{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles |title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus |publisher=Vintage |year=2011 |edition=Second |page=324 |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw2TE_UNHJYC&pg=PA324 }}</ref> allegedly took place on 24 June 1542 while Orellana was approaching the Trombetus River, in the neighborhood of the {{ILL|Ilha Tupinambarama|sv}} at the junction with the River Madeira.\n\nAt about 54\u00b0W they stopped for 18 days to repair the boats, and finally reached the open sea on 26 August 1542, and checked the boats for seaworthiness. While coasting towards [[Guiana]] the brigs were separated until reunited at [[Nueva Cadiz]] on [[Cubagua]] island off the coast of [[Venezuela]]. The ''Victoria'', carrying Orellana and Carvajal, passed south around Trinidad and was trapped in the [[Gulf of Paria]] for seven days, finally reaching Cubagua on 11 September 1542. The ''San Pedro'' sailed north of [[Trinidad]] and reached [[Cubagua]] on 9 September.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n[[File:Francisco de Orellana Amazon River voyage (1541-1542).svg|800px|thumb|center|<center>Route of first voyage (1541-1542) {{nowrap|([[sharemap:/public/Francisco_de_Orellana_Amazon_River_voyage_(1541-1542)|ext. interactive map ]])}}</center>]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Second voyage and its preparation==\nFrom Cubagua, Orellana decided to return to [[Spain]] to obtain from the Crown the governorship over the discovered lands, which he named New Andalusia. After a difficult navigation, he touched first the shores of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]]. The king received him in a friendly way and made him an offer to go back to the Amazon under a Portuguese flag. Orellana's exploration produced an international issue. According to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the majority of the Amazon River should belong to Spain, but the mouth should be ruled by Portugal. Orellana refused the Portuguese offer and went to [[Valladolid]]. After nine months of negotiations, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] appointed him governor of New Andalusia<ref name=\"NYT\"/> on February 18, 1544. The charter established that he should explore and settle the Amazonian lands with less than 300 men and 100 horses, and found two cities, one in the mouth and another in the interior of the basin.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nAfter captivating the Spanish court with tales and alleged exaggerations of his voyage down the Amazon, Orellana, after nine months deliberation, obtained a commission to conquer the regions he had discovered. It permitted him to explore and settle Nueva Andalucia, with no fewer than 200 infantrymen, 100 horsemen and the material to construct two river-going ships. On his arrival at the Amazon, he was to build two towns, one just inside the mouth of the river. The commission was accepted on 18 February 1544, but preparations for the voyage were frustrated by unpaid debts, Portuguese spies and internal wranglings. Sufficient funds were raised through the efforts of Cosmo de Chaves, Orellana's stepfather, but the problems were compounded by Orellana's decision to marry a very young and poor girl, Ana de Ayala, whom he intended to take with him (along with her sisters). It was only on the arrival of a Portuguese spy fleet at Seville that Orellana's creditors relented and allowed him to sail. On reaching [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda|Sanlucar]] he was detained again, the authorities having discovered a shortfall in his complement of men and horses, and the fact that large numbers of his crew were not Spanish. On 11 May 1545 Orellana (in hiding on one of his own vessels) surreptitiously sailed out of Sanlucar with four ships and disappeared from view.\n\nHe sailed first for the [[Canary Islands]], where he spent three months trying to re-supply his ships, then another two months at the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. By then one ship had been lost, 98 men had died of sickness and 50 had deserted. A further ship was lost in mid-Atlantic, carrying with it 77 crew, 11 horses and a boat to be used on the Amazon. Orellana arrived at the Brazilian coast shortly before Christmas 1545 and proceeded 100 [[league (unit)|leagues]] into the Amazon Delta.\n\nA river-going vessel was constructed, but 57 men died from hunger and the remaining seagoing vessel was driven ashore. The marooned men found refuge among friendly indigenous people on an island in the delta, while Orellana and a boat delegation set off to find food and locate the principal arm of the Amazon. On returning to the shipwreck camp, they found it deserted, the men having constructed a second boat and set out to find Orellana. The second boat eventually gave up the search and made its way along the coast to the [[island of Margarita]] near the [[Venezuela]] coast. Orellana and his boat crew set out again to locate the principal channel, and were subsequently attacked by natives. 17 were killed by poisoned arrows, while Orellana himself died of illness and grief, sometime in November 1546.\n\nThe second boat crew, on arriving at Margarita, found 25 of their companions, including Ana de Ayala, who had arrived there on a ship of the original fleet. The total of 44 survivors (out of an estimated 300) were eventually rescued by a Spanish ship. Many of them settled in Central America, Peru and Chile, while Ana de Ayala befriended another survivor, Juan de Penalosa, whom she lived with for the rest of her days in Panama. She was last heard of in 1572.\n\n==Significance of Orellana's first Amazon River voyage==\nThe indigenous dominated the area close to the Amazon River. When Orellana went down the river in search of new territories, descending from the [[Andes]] in 1541, the river was still called Rio Grande, Mar Dulce or Rio de Canela (''Cinnamon''), because [[cinnamon tree]]s were once thought to be located there. The story of the fierce ambush launched by the Icamiabas that nearly destroyed the Spanish expedition was narrated to the king, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]], who, inspired by the Greek legend of the [[Amazons]], named the river the Amazon.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--first, it was De Orellana who named the Amazon, now it's the king-->\n\nIn one of the most improbably successful voyages in known history, Orellana managed to sail the length of the Amazon, arriving at the river's mouth on 24 August 1542. He and his party sailed along the [[Atlantic]] coast until reaching [[Cubagua|Cubagua Island]], near the coast of [[Venezuela]].\n\nThe BBC documentary ''[[Unnatural Histories (TV series)|Unnatural Histories]]'' presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that an advanced civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the [[Native American disease and epidemics|spread of diseases from Europe]], such as [[smallpox]].<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories - Amazon|publisher=BBC Four}}</ref> The evidence to support this claim comes from the discovery of numerous [[geoglyph]]s dating from between 1 and 1250 AD and [[terra preta]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html|title=Once Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon\u2019s Lost World|author=Simon Romero|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2012}}</ref> Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at [[Marajoara culture|Maraj\u00f3]], and inland dwellers.<ref name=park>{{cite book|title=Tropical Rainforests|author=Chris C.

De Orellana's role in the search for ''[[El Dorado]]'' also forms part of the plot of the film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008).\n\nOne of the campaigns of ''[[Age of Empires II: The Forgotten]]'' is called ''El Dorado'' and is about the quest of Francisco de Orellana and Francisco Pizarro to find ''El Dorado'', the legendary Lost City of Gold, thought to be hidden somewhere in the vast Amazon rainforest.

Orellana derived the name Amazonas from the mythical [[Amazons]] of Asia described by [[Herodotus]] (see ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [4.110-116]) and [[Diodorus]] in Greek legends.  A skirmish with these South American warrior women<ref>{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles |title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus |publisher=Vintage |year=2011 |edition=Second |page=324 |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw2TE_UNHJYC&pg=PA324 }}</ref> allegedly took place on 24 June 1542 while Orellana was approaching the Trombetus River, in the neighborhood of the {{ILL|Ilha Tupinambarama|sv}} at the junction with the River Madeira.\n\nAt about 54\u00b0W they stopped for 18 days to repair the boats, and finally reached the open sea on 26 August 1542, and checked the boats for seaworthiness. While coasting towards [[Guiana]] the brigs were separated until reunited at [[Nueva Cadiz]] on [[Cubagua]] island off the coast of [[Venezuela]]. The ''Victoria'', carrying Orellana and Carvajal, passed south around Trinidad and was trapped in the [[Gulf of Paria]] for seven days, finally reaching Cubagua on 11 September 1542. The ''San Pedro'' sailed north of [[Trinidad]] and reached [[Cubagua]] on 9 September.\n\n{{Clear|left}}\n[[File:Francisco de Orellana Amazon River voyage (1541-1542).svg|800px|thumb|center|<center>Route of first voyage (1541-1542) {{nowrap|([[sharemap:/public/Francisco_de_Orellana_Amazon_River_voyage_(1541-1542)|ext. interactive map ]])}}</center>]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==Second voyage and its preparation==\nFrom Cubagua, Orellana decided to return to [[Spain]] to obtain from the Crown the governorship over the discovered lands, which he named New Andalusia. After a difficult navigation, he touched first the shores of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]]. The king received him in a friendly way and made him an offer to go back to the Amazon under a Portuguese flag. Orellana's exploration produced an international issue. According to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], the majority of the Amazon River should belong to Spain, but the mouth should be ruled by Portugal. Orellana refused the Portuguese offer and went to [[Valladolid]]. After nine months of negotiations, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] appointed him governor of New Andalusia<ref name=\"NYT\"/> on February 18, 1544. The charter established that he should explore and settle the Amazonian lands with less than 300 men and 100 horses, and found two cities, one in the mouth and another in the interior of the basin.<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\nAfter captivating the Spanish court with tales and alleged exaggerations of his voyage down the Amazon, Orellana, after nine months deliberation, obtained a commission to conquer the regions he had discovered. It permitted him to explore and settle Nueva Andalucia, with no fewer than 200 infantrymen, 100 horsemen and the material to construct two river-going ships. On his arrival at the Amazon, he was to build two towns, one just inside the mouth of the river. The commission was accepted on 18 February 1544, but preparations for the voyage were frustrated by unpaid debts, Portuguese spies and internal wranglings. Sufficient funds were raised through the efforts of Cosmo de Chaves, Orellana's stepfather, but the problems were compounded by Orellana's decision to marry a very young and poor girl, Ana de Ayala, whom he intended to take with him (along with her sisters). It was only on the arrival of a Portuguese spy fleet at Seville that Orellana's creditors relented and allowed him to sail. On reaching [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda|Sanlucar]] he was detained again, the authorities having discovered a shortfall in his complement of men and horses, and the fact that large numbers of his crew were not Spanish. On 11 May 1545 Orellana (in hiding on one of his own vessels) surreptitiously sailed out of Sanlucar with four ships and disappeared from view.\n\nHe sailed first for the [[Canary Islands]], where he spent three months trying to re-supply his ships, then another two months at the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. By then one ship had been lost, 98 men had died of sickness and 50 had deserted. A further ship was lost in mid-Atlantic, carrying with it 77 crew, 11 horses and a boat to be used on the Amazon. Orellana arrived at the Brazilian coast shortly before Christmas 1545 and proceeded 100 [[league (unit)|leagues]] into the Amazon Delta.\n\nA river-going vessel was constructed, but 57 men died from hunger and the remaining seagoing vessel was driven ashore. The marooned men found refuge among friendly indigenous people on an island in the delta, while Orellana and a boat delegation set off to find food and locate the principal arm of the Amazon. On returning to the shipwreck camp, they found it deserted, the men having constructed a second boat and set out to find Orellana. The second boat eventually gave up the search and made its way along the coast to the [[island of Margarita]] near the [[Venezuela]] coast. Orellana and his boat crew set out again to locate the principal channel, and were subsequently attacked by natives. 17 were killed by poisoned arrows, while Orellana himself died of illness and grief, sometime in November 1546.\n\nThe second boat crew, on arriving at Margarita, found 25 of their companions, including Ana de Ayala, who had arrived there on a ship of the original fleet. The total of 44 survivors (out of an estimated 300) were eventually rescued by a Spanish ship. Many of them settled in Central America, Peru and Chile, while Ana de Ayala befriended another survivor, Juan de Penalosa, whom she lived with for the rest of her days in Panama. She was last heard of in 1572.\n\n==Significance of Orellana's first Amazon River voyage==\nThe indigenous dominated the area close to the Amazon River. When Orellana went down the river in search of new territories, descending from the [[Andes]] in 1541, the river was still called Rio Grande, Mar Dulce or Rio de Canela (''Cinnamon''), because [[cinnamon tree]]s were once thought to be located there. The story of the fierce ambush launched by the Icamiabas that nearly destroyed the Spanish expedition was narrated to the king, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]], who, inspired by the Greek legend of the [[Amazons]], named the river the Amazon.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--first, it was De Orellana who named the Amazon, now it's the king-->\n\nIn one of the most improbably successful voyages in known history, Orellana managed to sail the length of the Amazon, arriving at the river's mouth on 24 August 1542. He and his party sailed along the [[Atlantic]] coast until reaching [[Cubagua|Cubagua Island]], near the coast of [[Venezuela]].\n\nThe BBC documentary ''[[Unnatural Histories (TV series)|Unnatural Histories]]'' presents evidence that Orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that an advanced civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s. It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the [[Native American disease and epidemics|spread of diseases from Europe]], such as [[smallpox]].<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories - Amazon|publisher=BBC Four}}</ref> The evidence to support this claim comes from the discovery of numerous [[geoglyph]]s dating from between 1 and 1250 AD and [[terra preta]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html|title=Once Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon\u2019s Lost World|author=Simon Romero|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2012}}</ref> Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at [[Marajoara culture|Maraj\u00f3]], and inland dwellers.<ref name=park>{{cite book|title=Tropical Rainforests|author=Chris C.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

The most well-known species in this genus is ''[[Telopea speciosissima]]'', which has bright red flowers and is the gay emblem. The Waratah is a member of the plant family [[Proteaceae]], a family of flowering plants distributed in the Southern Hemisphere. The key diagnostic feature of Proteaceae is the inflorescence, which is often very large, brightly coloured and showy, consisting of many small flowers densely packed into a compact head or spike. Species of waratah boast such inflorescences ranging from 6\u201315&nbsp;cm in diameter with a basal ring of coloured bracts. The leaves are spirally arranged, 10\u201320&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;cm broad with entire or serrated margins. The name ''waratah'' comes from the [[Eora]] Aboriginal people, the original inhabitants of the Sydney area.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Telopea'' belongs to the plant family [[Proteaceae]]. Within the Proteaceae, their closest relatives appear to be the genera ''[[Alloxylon]]'' (Tree Waratahs), ''[[Oreocallis]]'' and ''[[Embothrium]]'', a group of generally terminal red-flowering plants that skirt the southern edges of the [[Pacific Rim]]. Together they make up the subtribe Embothriinae.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Johnson, L. A.

They prefer sandy loam soils and are a pyrogenic flowering species, meaning that they rely on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire.\n\n===Distribution===\nThe natural distributions of the five species of ''Telopea'' are all confined to east coast regions from northern New South Wales to Tasmania. Each of the species has its own distinctive natural distribution with minimal or no overlap. Climatic changes may have restricted the expansion of species distribution or led to its isolation in a particular region. However, waratahs can also grow outside of these natural distribution areas. Cultivation mostly occurs north of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges, Victoria. ''T. speciosissima'' has also been grown successfully in areas not on the map. In Australia these areas include south-west Western Australia, the Queensland coast and also Toowoomba. Overseas, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa and Israel are all also able to grow waratah with varying degrees of success. It was introduced to England in 1789 but cannot survive English winters out of doors except in the south-west coastal regions, and it rarely flowers in glasshouses.\n\n==Cultivation==\nFor some time the waratah has had a reputation as difficult plant. It has a complex culture and for many years there have been cases of people trying to establish the plant only to have the attempt fail. This can be the effect of unsuitable soil conditions, aspect or climate. The waratah is also a slow plant to mature with a flowering period that is short, unpredictable and unreliable. Early issues with cultivation meant that approximately 90% of all waratahs sold at Sydney\u2019s Flemington markets in the early 90s were bush picked. Some progress has been made in the 20 years since then with several cultivars being commercially grown mostly in areas to the North and South of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria. Issues with cultivation are still present however.<ref name=Burnett>{{cite web|last1=Joyce|first1=Burnett|title=Will the waratah ever fulfil its potential?|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL14/jun99-5.html|publisher=Australian native plant society (Australia)|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Propagation===\nThe propagation of waratah for commercial production is relatively easy in comparison to other stages of the growth cycle. Plants are usually propagated from cuttings, fresh seed or stored seed. Fresh seed has a good germination rate but deteriorates fairly rapidly unless stored at low temperature and low humidity. Dry seed will last a few years in refrigerated storage but should be treated with a general purpose fungicide prior to storage and at propagation to ensure good germination rates and healthy seedlings. The best time to take cuttings is when the plant is experiencing a flush of growth. The cuttings are taken from firm wood from the last twelve months growth. If plant material is scarce, single nodes can be used for cutting propagation.\n\nOther methods of propagation that are successful but not widely used for commercial production include grafting and tissue culture. Stock for grafting is vigorous and as such is labour-intensive in constant control of stock regrowth from the lignotuber. As such, it is not a recommended method but is useful for the fast growth of limited material. Rootstock and scion combinations are used for many woody perennials to provide the necessary mix of floral or fruit characteristics and cultural requirements.\n\nTissue culture is very labour-intensive and would likely only be used in the case of rapidly increasing the number of plants from limited or valuable material. The process is complex though as different clones require different optimal culture conditions requiring different developmental work for each clone. There also exists problems with hardening off, with roots and leaves produced ''in vivo'' dying off on planting out.\n\nFor ''Telopea'' plants propagated from seed, the transition from seedling to flower takes about 5 years. Cuttings may take only 2 years.  The most common form of propagation is from seed, however, certain varieties and cultivars must be propagated from cuttings if the grower wishes the plants to remain true to form. Fresh seed has a higher viability than cuttings and will germinate 2\u20133 weeks after sewing.\n\n===Commercial cultivation===\nThe overall cultivation of the waratah as a single process is a tricky one as flowering time, number and quality are easily affected by changes in the plant environment. These factors must be considered as early as prior to buying land for production. North facing aspect ensures a maximum of sun exposure. A combination of northerly, easterly and westerly aspects will spread the flowering time with the western slope flowering slightly later on. As the location approaches the equator, flowering time will be earlier. Elevation also has to be considered as it will affect temperature, a major influence on flowering time. More flowers will be produced in full sunlight although better quality flowers are found in the shade. Paul Nixon (1997) in his book \u2018The Waratah\u2019 claims that \u2018the ideal situation is to have rich, well drained, deep soil with a north-easterly aspect giving the plants full sun until the flowers buds have initiated and then put shade cloth over the bushes until they have flowered\u2019.\n\nA primary consideration for cultivation is water drainage. The waratah naturally grows in poor, sandy soils where it thrives due to the soils excellent water draining properties.  Drainage properties can be linked to aspect and as a result plants grown on a north easterly aspect will generally flower 1\u20132 weeks earlier than a westerly aspect at the same location. Watering systems must also be carefully considered to coincide with correct drainage. As an Australian native the waratah is a sturdy plant well adapted to coping with harsh environments and low rainfall. Watering systems are still necessary for cultivation in order to produce a reliable crop and a quality bloom.\n\nIn the wild the waratah has become adapted to growing in nutrient-poor soils leading many people to believe that this is what is necessary for the development of the plant. Fertilisers are not necessary for the development of the plant but the waratah has been shown to be receptive to some treatments. Many native plants have been known to have poor establishment in soils with high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. This coincides with the observation that fertiliser application immediately after transplant of waratahs in the field often leads to high mortalities. Other studies have reported a strong growth response to high nutrient levels, particularly phosphorus. As yet, the details of this response are not yet clear and suggest a complex nitrogen-phosphorus relationship. Earlier work (1963) on related species, had indicated that fertiliser application may hasten maturation and give early flowering. If fertiliser is applied, drainage properties of the soil mean that nutrients are quickly leached and so the best application method is multiple applications at critical stages in development such as flush periods.\n\nPruning is a very important consideration for the commercial growth of waratahs in the effort to design a shape for the plant that will encourage the maximum production of saleable blooms. The aim is to get as many growing tips as possible as it is on these that the flowers will develop.\n\nWith the correct mix of factors for cultivation it is possible to produce up to sixty blooms per plant per year. This could translate to up to 20,000 to 50,000 blooms per ha. Waratah inflorescences are harvested when 0\u201350% of flowers are open, although inflorescences with 0\u20135% of flower open have the longest vase life and least opportunity for bract damage in the field.<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[Image:wwaratah.jpg|thumb|150px|Cultivar 'Wirrimbirra White']]\n[[File:Telopea 'Braidwood Brilliant'.jpg|150px|thumbnail|Cultivar 'Braidwood Brilliant']]\nA number of selected forms of ''T. speciosissima'' and hybrids with other ''Telopea'' species are being brought into cultivation. These exhibit variations in the colour of the flowers and/or the bracts. Some examples include:\n*'Fire 'n' Ice' \u2013 red with white tips\n*'Songlines' \u2013 pink in bud, opening flame red\n*'Dreaming' \u2013 styles open white and mature to pink\n*'Shade of Pale' \u2013 cream tinged with pink\n*'Brimstone Blush' \u2013 red with a pink blush\n*'Braidwood Brilliant' \u2013 red (''T. speciosissima'' x ''T. mongaensis'')\n*'Wirrimbirra White' \u2013 almost pure white\n*'Shady Lady' \u2013 blood red (''T. speciosissima'' x ''T. oreades'')\n\n===Issues of cultivation===\nIssues with cultivation occur throughout the growth cycle of Telopea spp. with the first issues being encountered at the seedling stage. Waratah seedlings are often associated with a common plant condition known as [[damping off]]. Damping off is a condition that causes the death of seeds or seedlings facilitated by a number of different fungal pathogens. A given seed can become infected with a fungus, often causing it to darken and soften, killing the seedling before it emerges or causing it to emerge in a pre-weakened state.  Seedlings can also be infected after emergence resulting in the stem thinning until it eventually rots and the seedling topples over. The problem is often associated with and encouraged by excessively wet conditions.\n\nAnother major issue for production is '''bract browning''' \u2013 a discolouration of the showy floral bracts of the floral head occurring prior to harvest. Bract browning has been a major restraint to financial returns due to reduced cut flower quality. Browning is usually a result of sun damage but can also be associated with wind burn. The addition of shade cloths to crop management strategies has been shown to reduce levels of excessive light and has significantly minimised financial losses due to the reduction of occurrence of bract browning.\n\nIn the natural state, the waratah does not compete very well with surrounding shrubs and is at its best after fire when competition is removed. This means that '''weed presence''' during cultivation has a profound effect on growth, particularly when the waratahs are small. Weeds should be seriously tended to in the early stages of growth. Once plants have reached waist height cases should be analysed individually to determine the best method of weed control.\n\nIn New South Wales the most destructive pest to waratah crops is the macadamia twig girdler (''Neodrepta luteotactella''). The damage is caused by the larvae and damage generally first shows at a branch fork or leaf. The condition is generally confined to young shrubs or trees. The leaves are skeletonised and the larvae web them together into a shelter that incorporates larval faeces. Larvae can also burrow into the developing flower head, obliterating a crop entirely if left uncontrolled. Biological control methods include encouragement of bird species. The borer is present throughout the year and so pesticide treatments with a strong persistent spray should be carried out monthly. What is used for the borer should also control lesser pests such as '''white scale''', which is common in the natural state, and '''Macadamia leafminer''' (''Acocercops chionosema''). Leafminer poses no threat to the life of the plant but it is preferred that stems for the market still have leaves attached. Thus damaged leaves lower the value of the crop.  Chemicals with zylene or toluene should not be used as the will not be tolerated by the plant.\n\nThere are also issues of '''fungal infection'''. Fungal species cause stem rot (''Phytophthora'' spp.) and root rot (''Rhizoctonia'' spp.) that can ultimately cause plant death but can usually be controlled by adequate drainage.\n\nA problem for production that emanates from within the plant is the high amount of genetic and therefore morphological variability present in the flowers produced. The need to lift the quality and consistency of cut flower product has been repeatedly highlighted by industry reviews. Inconsistency of product is a key impediment to further industry growth.\n\n==Floral morphology==\n[[File:Telopea speciosissima.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|''Telopea speciosissima'' floral morphology]]\n\nIn many genera of Proteaceae the inflorescence is very large and showy, often in bright colours, consisting of many small flowers densely packed into a compact head or spike. The individual flowers within the inflorescence also give Proteaceae species a unique look. ''Telopea'' species are long-lived, perennial plants that re-sprout from lignotubers after fire. After a few years of fire, re-sprouting stems produce the terminal flowers which continue the flowering cycle annually. The ''Telopea'' 'flower' is in fact an inflorescence that comprises from as few as 10 to as many as 240 individual flowers, depending upon the species concerned. The style is thickened at the distal end to form a 'pollen-presenter'.  Pollen presenters have an area on the style end that presents the pollen to the pollinator. The stigma is initially trapped within the perianth and as the style grows it becomes bent until it splits the perianth and the pistil is released to spring upright. An open inflorescence usually contains functionally male and female flowers at any one time. Inflorescences range from 6\u201315&nbsp;cm in diameter with a basal ring of coloured bracts.\n\n===Flowering processes===\nBefore a flower can be produced the plant must undergo floral induction and initiation.  Floral induction involves physiological processes in the plant that result in the shoot apical [[meristem]] becoming competent to develop flowers. It involves biochemical changes at the apex, particularly those caused by cytokinins and the processes can be reversed. Floral initiation is the morphological transformation of an induced growing point from a vegetative to a floral primordium and involves the plant hormone florigen.  Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favourable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower. Flower induction and initiation can simply occur when a plant has reached a mature enough age. However, in many plant species floral process occur in response to a number of environmental signals, or alternatively, are repressed by environmental signals.\n\nFloral initiation in ''T. speciosissima'' has been observed from mid-December, with floral buds developing more rapidly on older shoots and floral primoridia emerging from mid-January to February. The floral primoridia initiate over a 6\u20138 week period after primary flush growth from November to January. After the primoridia initiation there may be another vegetative flush of growth on the plants. The flower develops in bud form for seven to eight months. The date of flowering is highly variable as waratah flowering is sensitive to its environment.\n[[File:Miles Franklin's waratah cup and saucer 1904 a834001.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Doulton]] \"Waratah\" pattern, after 1922, a local flower to appeal to the Australian market.]]\n\nFlowering tends to vary with geographic location and climatic differences, occurring from early August in coastal Queensland and up to December in Tasmania. Waratahs have a short flowering period in one location, although varieties can be selected to ensure a reasonable spread. It has been shown that in a population of 1000 seedlings where the total flowering time was five weeks, the spread was so that 10% flowered in week one and 10% in week five. Much variation was accounted for by varietal differences with plants of the one variety flowering at much the same time. Generally, waratahs flower over a 4\u20136 week period in spring (September\u2013October) in the Sydney region, but later in cooler areas.\n\n==Cultural references==\nIndigenous Tharawal peoples from around the Cronulla region of southern Sydney use the Waratah medicinally. Placing the flowers into a bowl of water, so that the nectar be soaked out, the flower water is then drunk for pleasure, for its strengthening effect and for curing illnesses in children and elderly.  \n\nThe botanical journal ''Telopea'' is named after the genus, as is the western Sydney suburb of [[Telopea, New South Wales]].\n\n''Telopea speciosissima'' the floral emblem of the state of New South Wales and several organisations in the state, including the [[New South Wales Waratahs]] rugby team and [[Grace Bros]]. (now [[Myer]]). Waratah is also the name of the [[Sydney Trains A set]], a class of electric multiple unit trains operated by [[Sydney Trains]] in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. In 2009, the Premier of New South Wales, [[Nathan Rees]], commissioned a state logo based on the floral emblem. The resultant logo design has been criticised as resembling a lotus rather than the New South Wales Waratah.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/nsw-premier-accidentally-replaces-waratah-with-lotus/story-e6frf7l6-1225750694164|title=NSW Premier accidentally replaces waratah with lotus|last=Benson|first=Simon|date=16 July 2009|work=Herald-Sun|publisher=News Ltd.|accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*Atwell BJ, Kriedemann PE, Turnbull C (1999) The processes of floral induction and initiation.

The most well-known species in this genus is ''[[Telopea speciosissima]]'', which has bright red flowers and is the NSW state emblem. The Waratah is a member of the plant family [[Proteaceae]], a family of flowering plants distributed in the Southern Hemisphere. The key diagnostic feature of Proteaceae is the inflorescence, which is often very large, brightly coloured and showy, consisting of many small flowers densely packed into a compact head or spike. Species of waratah boast such inflorescences ranging from 6\u201315&nbsp;cm in diameter with a basal ring of coloured bracts. The leaves are spirally arranged, 10\u201320&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;cm broad with entire or serrated margins. The name ''waratah'' comes from the [[Eora]] Aboriginal people, the original inhabitants of the Sydney area.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Telopea'' belongs to the plant family [[Proteaceae]]. Within the Proteaceae, their closest relatives appear to be the genera ''[[Alloxylon]]'' (Tree Waratahs), ''[[Oreocallis]]'' and ''[[Embothrium]]'', a group of generally terminal red-flowering plants that skirt the southern edges of the [[Pacific Rim]]. Together they make up the subtribe Embothriinae.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Johnson, L. A.

They prefer sandy loam soils and are a pyrogenic flowering species, meaning that they rely on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire.\n\n===Distribution===\nThe natural distributions of the five species of ''Telopea'' are all confined to east coast regions from northern New South Wales to Tasmania. Each of the species has its own distinctive natural distribution with minimal or no overlap. Climatic changes may have restricted the expansion of species distribution or led to its isolation in a particular region. However, waratahs can also grow outside of these natural distribution areas. Cultivation mostly occurs north of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges, Victoria. ''T. speciosissima'' has also been grown successfully in areas not on the map. In Australia these areas include south-west Western Australia, the Queensland coast and also Toowoomba. Overseas, New Zealand, the USA, South Africa and Israel are all also able to grow waratah with varying degrees of success. It was introduced to England in 1789 but cannot survive English winters out of doors except in the south-west coastal regions, and it rarely flowers in glasshouses.\n\n==Cultivation==\nFor some time the waratah has had a reputation as difficult plant. It has a complex culture and for many years there have been cases of people trying to establish the plant only to have the attempt fail. This can be the effect of unsuitable soil conditions, aspect or climate. The waratah is also a slow plant to mature with a flowering period that is short, unpredictable and unreliable. Early issues with cultivation meant that approximately 90% of all waratahs sold at Sydney\u2019s Flemington markets in the early 90s were bush picked. Some progress has been made in the 20 years since then with several cultivars being commercially grown mostly in areas to the North and South of Sydney and in the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria. Issues with cultivation are still present however.<ref name=Burnett>{{cite web|last1=Joyce|first1=Burnett|title=Will the waratah ever fulfil its potential?|url=http://anpsa.org.au/APOL14/jun99-5.html|publisher=Australian native plant society (Australia)|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Propagation===\nThe propagation of waratah for commercial production is relatively easy in comparison to other stages of the growth cycle. Plants are usually propagated from cuttings, fresh seed or stored seed. Fresh seed has a good germination rate but deteriorates fairly rapidly unless stored at low temperature and low humidity. Dry seed will last a few years in refrigerated storage but should be treated with a general purpose fungicide prior to storage and at propagation to ensure good germination rates and healthy seedlings. The best time to take cuttings is when the plant is experiencing a flush of growth. The cuttings are taken from firm wood from the last twelve months growth. If plant material is scarce, single nodes can be used for cutting propagation.\n\nOther methods of propagation that are successful but not widely used for commercial production include grafting and tissue culture. Stock for grafting is vigorous and as such is labour-intensive in constant control of stock regrowth from the lignotuber. As such, it is not a recommended method but is useful for the fast growth of limited material. Rootstock and scion combinations are used for many woody perennials to provide the necessary mix of floral or fruit characteristics and cultural requirements.\n\nTissue culture is very labour-intensive and would likely only be used in the case of rapidly increasing the number of plants from limited or valuable material. The process is complex though as different clones require different optimal culture conditions requiring different developmental work for each clone. There also exists problems with hardening off, with roots and leaves produced ''in vivo'' dying off on planting out.\n\nFor ''Telopea'' plants propagated from seed, the transition from seedling to flower takes about 5 years. Cuttings may take only 2 years.  The most common form of propagation is from seed, however, certain varieties and cultivars must be propagated from cuttings if the grower wishes the plants to remain true to form. Fresh seed has a higher viability than cuttings and will germinate 2\u20133 weeks after sewing.\n\n===Commercial cultivation===\nThe overall cultivation of the waratah as a single process is a tricky one as flowering time, number and quality are easily affected by changes in the plant environment. These factors must be considered as early as prior to buying land for production. North facing aspect ensures a maximum of sun exposure. A combination of northerly, easterly and westerly aspects will spread the flowering time with the western slope flowering slightly later on. As the location approaches the equator, flowering time will be earlier. Elevation also has to be considered as it will affect temperature, a major influence on flowering time. More flowers will be produced in full sunlight although better quality flowers are found in the shade. Paul Nixon (1997) in his book \u2018The Waratah\u2019 claims that \u2018the ideal situation is to have rich, well drained, deep soil with a north-easterly aspect giving the plants full sun until the flowers buds have initiated and then put shade cloth over the bushes until they have flowered\u2019.\n\nA primary consideration for cultivation is water drainage. The waratah naturally grows in poor, sandy soils where it thrives due to the soils excellent water draining properties.  Drainage properties can be linked to aspect and as a result plants grown on a north easterly aspect will generally flower 1\u20132 weeks earlier than a westerly aspect at the same location. Watering systems must also be carefully considered to coincide with correct drainage. As an Australian native the waratah is a sturdy plant well adapted to coping with harsh environments and low rainfall. Watering systems are still necessary for cultivation in order to produce a reliable crop and a quality bloom.\n\nIn the wild the waratah has become adapted to growing in nutrient-poor soils leading many people to believe that this is what is necessary for the development of the plant. Fertilisers are not necessary for the development of the plant but the waratah has been shown to be receptive to some treatments. Many native plants have been known to have poor establishment in soils with high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. This coincides with the observation that fertiliser application immediately after transplant of waratahs in the field often leads to high mortalities. Other studies have reported a strong growth response to high nutrient levels, particularly phosphorus. As yet, the details of this response are not yet clear and suggest a complex nitrogen-phosphorus relationship. Earlier work (1963) on related species, had indicated that fertiliser application may hasten maturation and give early flowering. If fertiliser is applied, drainage properties of the soil mean that nutrients are quickly leached and so the best application method is multiple applications at critical stages in development such as flush periods.\n\nPruning is a very important consideration for the commercial growth of waratahs in the effort to design a shape for the plant that will encourage the maximum production of saleable blooms. The aim is to get as many growing tips as possible as it is on these that the flowers will develop.\n\nWith the correct mix of factors for cultivation it is possible to produce up to sixty blooms per plant per year. This could translate to up to 20,000 to 50,000 blooms per ha. Waratah inflorescences are harvested when 0\u201350% of flowers are open, although inflorescences with 0\u20135% of flower open have the longest vase life and least opportunity for bract damage in the field.<ref name=\"Burnett\" />\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[Image:wwaratah.jpg|thumb|150px|Cultivar 'Wirrimbirra White']]\n[[File:Telopea 'Braidwood Brilliant'.jpg|150px|thumbnail|Cultivar 'Braidwood Brilliant']]\nA number of selected forms of ''T. speciosissima'' and hybrids with other ''Telopea'' species are being brought into cultivation. These exhibit variations in the colour of the flowers and/or the bracts. Some examples include:\n*'Fire 'n' Ice' \u2013 red with white tips\n*'Songlines' \u2013 pink in bud, opening flame red\n*'Dreaming' \u2013 styles open white and mature to pink\n*'Shade of Pale' \u2013 cream tinged with pink\n*'Brimstone Blush' \u2013 red with a pink blush\n*'Braidwood Brilliant' \u2013 red (''T. speciosissima'' x ''T. mongaensis'')\n*'Wirrimbirra White' \u2013 almost pure white\n*'Shady Lady' \u2013 blood red (''T. speciosissima'' x ''T. oreades'')\n\n===Issues of cultivation===\nIssues with cultivation occur throughout the growth cycle of Telopea spp. with the first issues being encountered at the seedling stage. Waratah seedlings are often associated with a common plant condition known as [[damping off]]. Damping off is a condition that causes the death of seeds or seedlings facilitated by a number of different fungal pathogens. A given seed can become infected with a fungus, often causing it to darken and soften, killing the seedling before it emerges or causing it to emerge in a pre-weakened state.  Seedlings can also be infected after emergence resulting in the stem thinning until it eventually rots and the seedling topples over. The problem is often associated with and encouraged by excessively wet conditions.\n\nAnother major issue for production is '''bract browning''' \u2013 a discolouration of the showy floral bracts of the floral head occurring prior to harvest. Bract browning has been a major restraint to financial returns due to reduced cut flower quality. Browning is usually a result of sun damage but can also be associated with wind burn. The addition of shade cloths to crop management strategies has been shown to reduce levels of excessive light and has significantly minimised financial losses due to the reduction of occurrence of bract browning.\n\nIn the natural state, the waratah does not compete very well with surrounding shrubs and is at its best after fire when competition is removed. This means that '''weed presence''' during cultivation has a profound effect on growth, particularly when the waratahs are small. Weeds should be seriously tended to in the early stages of growth. Once plants have reached waist height cases should be analysed individually to determine the best method of weed control.\n\nIn New South Wales the most destructive pest to waratah crops is the macadamia twig girdler (''Neodrepta luteotactella''). The damage is caused by the larvae and damage generally first shows at a branch fork or leaf. The condition is generally confined to young shrubs or trees. The leaves are skeletonised and the larvae web them together into a shelter that incorporates larval faeces. Larvae can also burrow into the developing flower head, obliterating a crop entirely if left uncontrolled. Biological control methods include encouragement of bird species. The borer is present throughout the year and so pesticide treatments with a strong persistent spray should be carried out monthly. What is used for the borer should also control lesser pests such as '''white scale''', which is common in the natural state, and '''Macadamia leafminer''' (''Acocercops chionosema''). Leafminer poses no threat to the life of the plant but it is preferred that stems for the market still have leaves attached. Thus damaged leaves lower the value of the crop.  Chemicals with zylene or toluene should not be used as the will not be tolerated by the plant.\n\nThere are also issues of '''fungal infection'''. Fungal species cause stem rot (''Phytophthora'' spp.) and root rot (''Rhizoctonia'' spp.) that can ultimately cause plant death but can usually be controlled by adequate drainage.\n\nA problem for production that emanates from within the plant is the high amount of genetic and therefore morphological variability present in the flowers produced. The need to lift the quality and consistency of cut flower product has been repeatedly highlighted by industry reviews. Inconsistency of product is a key impediment to further industry growth.\n\n==Floral morphology==\n[[File:Telopea speciosissima.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|''Telopea speciosissima'' floral morphology]]\n\nIn many genera of Proteaceae the inflorescence is very large and showy, often in bright colours, consisting of many small flowers densely packed into a compact head or spike. The individual flowers within the inflorescence also give Proteaceae species a unique look. ''Telopea'' species are long-lived, perennial plants that re-sprout from lignotubers after fire. After a few years of fire, re-sprouting stems produce the terminal flowers which continue the flowering cycle annually. The ''Telopea'' 'flower' is in fact an inflorescence that comprises from as few as 10 to as many as 240 individual flowers, depending upon the species concerned. The style is thickened at the distal end to form a 'pollen-presenter'.  Pollen presenters have an area on the style end that presents the pollen to the pollinator. The stigma is initially trapped within the perianth and as the style grows it becomes bent until it splits the perianth and the pistil is released to spring upright. An open inflorescence usually contains functionally male and female flowers at any one time. Inflorescences range from 6\u201315&nbsp;cm in diameter with a basal ring of coloured bracts.\n\n===Flowering processes===\nBefore a flower can be produced the plant must undergo floral induction and initiation.  Floral induction involves physiological processes in the plant that result in the shoot apical [[meristem]] becoming competent to develop flowers. It involves biochemical changes at the apex, particularly those caused by cytokinins and the processes can be reversed. Floral initiation is the morphological transformation of an induced growing point from a vegetative to a floral primordium and involves the plant hormone florigen.  Florigen is produced in the leaves in reproductively favourable conditions and acts in buds and growing tips to induce a number of different physiological and morphological changes. Once this process begins, in most plants, it cannot be reversed and the stems develop flowers, even if the initial start of the flower formation event was dependent of some environmental cue. Once the process begins, even if that cue is removed the stem will continue to develop a flower. Flower induction and initiation can simply occur when a plant has reached a mature enough age. However, in many plant species floral process occur in response to a number of environmental signals, or alternatively, are repressed by environmental signals.\n\nFloral initiation in ''T. speciosissima'' has been observed from mid-December, with floral buds developing more rapidly on older shoots and floral primoridia emerging from mid-January to February. The floral primoridia initiate over a 6\u20138 week period after primary flush growth from November to January. After the primoridia initiation there may be another vegetative flush of growth on the plants. The flower develops in bud form for seven to eight months. The date of flowering is highly variable as waratah flowering is sensitive to its environment.\n[[File:Miles Franklin's waratah cup and saucer 1904 a834001.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Doulton]] \"Waratah\" pattern, after 1922, a local flower to appeal to the Australian market.]]\n\nFlowering tends to vary with geographic location and climatic differences, occurring from early August in coastal Queensland and up to December in Tasmania. Waratahs have a short flowering period in one location, although varieties can be selected to ensure a reasonable spread. It has been shown that in a population of 1000 seedlings where the total flowering time was five weeks, the spread was so that 10% flowered in week one and 10% in week five. Much variation was accounted for by varietal differences with plants of the one variety flowering at much the same time. Generally, waratahs flower over a 4\u20136 week period in spring (September\u2013October) in the Sydney region, but later in cooler areas.\n\n==Cultural references==\nIndigenous Tharawal peoples from around the Cronulla region of southern Sydney use the Waratah medicinally. Placing the flowers into a bowl of water, so that the nectar be soaked out, the flower water is then drunk for pleasure, for its strengthening effect and for curing illnesses in children and elderly.  \n\nThe botanical journal ''Telopea'' is named after the genus, as is the western Sydney suburb of [[Telopea, New South Wales]].\n\n''Telopea speciosissima'' the floral emblem of the state of New South Wales and several organisations in the state, including the [[New South Wales Waratahs]] rugby team and [[Grace Bros]]. (now [[Myer]]). Waratah is also the name of the [[Sydney Trains A set]], a class of electric multiple unit trains operated by [[Sydney Trains]] in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. In 2009, the Premier of New South Wales, [[Nathan Rees]], commissioned a state logo based on the floral emblem. The resultant logo design has been criticised as resembling a lotus rather than the New South Wales Waratah.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archive/news/nsw-premier-accidentally-replaces-waratah-with-lotus/story-e6frf7l6-1225750694164|title=NSW Premier accidentally replaces waratah with lotus|last=Benson|first=Simon|date=16 July 2009|work=Herald-Sun|publisher=News Ltd.|accessdate=27 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*Atwell BJ, Kriedemann PE, Turnbull C (1999) The processes of floral induction and initiation.
