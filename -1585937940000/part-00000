The film stars [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Kyle Gallner]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[Kellan Lutz]]. It is a [[remake]] of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|1984 film of the same name]]. Produced by [[Michael Bay]] and [[Platinum Dunes]], the film was designed to reboot the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]] and is the ninth installment in the series. The film is set in a [[Fictional location|fictitious town]] of Ohio and centers around a group of teenagers living on one street who are stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named [[Freddy Krueger]]. The teenagers discover that they all share a common link from their childhood that makes them targets for Krueger.\n\n''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was originally to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline but tried to create a scarier film. To that end, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring back his darker nature. The writers developed the character to be a child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead. Freddy's physical appearance was changed with the use of computer-generated imagery to be closer to that of a burn victim. Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes' producers had in the area, ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was filmed primarily in Illinois. Craven expressed his displeasure when he was not consulted on the project. [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy.\n\n''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' had its world premiere at Hollywood on April 27, 2010, and was theatrically released in North America on April 30, 2010, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the teenage characters and story while offering some praise for Bayer's direction and Haley's performance. Despite this, it was box-office success, earned over $63 million at the domestic box office and over $115 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise and the highest-grossing slasher film in unadjusted dollars.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--STOP. Wikipedia is not a substitute for watching a movie, and plot summaries should not contain every minor detail. They are here to SUMMARIZE the basic events.

Thank you. !-->\n[[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Kris Fowles|Kris Fowles]] meets her friend, Dean Russell, at the Springwood Diner. Dean falls asleep at the table and dreams that he meets a severely burned man in seared clothes who has a bladed gardener's glove on his right hand. The man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but it appears to Kris and their classmate, waitress [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Nancy Holbrook|Nancy Holbrook]], that Dean cuts himself. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man, then refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die like Dean. Jesse Braun, Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in Kris's blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having nightmares about the same man\u2014[[Freddy Krueger|Freddy]]. Jesse tells Nancy that they need to stop Freddy and warns her not to fall asleep, then runs off.\n\nJesse is arrested by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris. He tries not to fall asleep in his jail cell but fails, and is killed by Freddy. As her friends die, Nancy questions everyone's connection to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them attended Badham Preschool. Nancy's mother, Gwen, reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a groundskeeper at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who was accused of [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] the children. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and that she came home one day and told her mother about the things Krueger did to her in a secret room. Gwen alerted the other parents, including Quentin's father Alan, and Kris's mother Nora, but she tells the teenagers that Krueger escaped before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. She discovers that all of the other kids have been killed, most of them in their sleep, and after Jesse's death, only she and Quentin are left.\n\nQuentin tries to accept that his nightmares are nothing more than repressed memories, but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger\u2014the parents tracked him down and burned him alive. Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger, now a [[vengeful ghost]], wants revenge on them for lying as children. As a result of their [[insomnia]], they have sporadic [[microsleep]] episodes and become [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]]. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool to learn what they can. On the way, Nancy is attacked by Krueger after a microsleep episode, but she pulls a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dream world into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital where he steals [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] to help them stay awake. Finally at the preschool, they uncover Krueger's hidden room and the evidence that proves he did indeed abuse all of the children; they then realize that Kreuger wants revenge on them for telling the truth.\n\nNancy decides to pull Krueger out of the dream world and kill him in the real world. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she grabs Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy and explains that he deliberately left her for last so she would stay awake long enough to become comatose. Quentin awakens and uses the adrenaline to wake Nancy, who then pulls Krueger into reality. They fight and Nancy uses a broken paper cutter blade to kill him before she torches the secret room with Krueger's body inside. Nancy and Quentin escape. However, Krueger's remains are not found by the fire fighters who put out the fire. After Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital, Krueger suddenly appears.  While Nancy screams, Krueger kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror and then disappearing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as [[Freddy Krueger|Fred \"Freddy\" Krueger]]\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Quentin Smith\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Nancy Holbrook|Nancy Holbrook]]\n**Kyra Krumins as young Nancy\n* [[Katie Cassidy]] as [[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Kris Fowles|Kris Fowles]]\n**Julianna Damm as young Kris\n* [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] as Jesse Braun\n**Bayden Coyer as young Jesse\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as Dean Russell\n**Max Holt as young Dean\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Alan Smith \n* [[Connie Britton]] as Dr. Gwen Holbrook\n* Lia Mortensen as Nora Fowles\n* [[Kurt Naebig]] as Mr. Russell\n* Jennifer Robers as Mrs. Russell\n* [[Christian Stolte]] as Mr. Braun\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Marcus Yeon (uncredited) \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn January 29, 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Michael Bay]] and his [[Platinum Dunes]] production company would reboot the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise with a remake of [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|the original 1984 film]].<ref name=\"NightAnno\">{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=New Line sets up new 'Nightmare'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120529175832/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807?refCatId=13|archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Producer Brad Fuller explained that they would follow the same tactic from their [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|''Friday the 13th'' remake<!--STOP.

Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films and that the character of Freddy Krueger affected the lives of a generation of people. For Bayer, remaking ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was about bringing that feeling to a new generation with a new spin on the character and story.<ref name=\"Bayerint\"/>\n\nFuller and Form likened the new film to their [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|2003 remake of ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'']] but instead of a remake, they saw it as more of a reimagining.<ref name=\"setpreview\">{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|title=Set Visit Preview: A Nightmare on Elm Street|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723081206/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|archive-date=July 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The pair also explained that ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' would have a different tone than their ''Friday the 13th'' remake.

It's why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture.\"<ref name=\"LAint\"/> Overall, Bayer wanted to create a film in \"a darker world\" that made the audience ask, \"What makes a monster?\"\u2014is it a monster because of its physical appearance, someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove, or is it a monster because of something deeper within the man himself.<ref name=\"Rotint\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nWesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' because he had impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''. Eric Heisserer was subsequently hired to provide a rewrite of Strick's script before the film moved into production.<ref name=\"LAint\"/> When Bayer came on board he received a script that reflected the combined efforts of Strick and Heisserer and which still \"needed to be tinkered with\". Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into \"[Freddy] as a person [and] how he became the thing he was\". Bayer expressed that unlike the ''Friday the 13th'' remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' remake was coming straight from the first film.<ref name=\"Bayerint\"/>\n\nFor the remake, Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy did have one-liners but they come from a darker sense of humor and were not intended to be as campy as in previous films. Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]] was used because if Freddy killed children, as in the original, it would have been easy for the teenage characters to figure out using the Internet what had happened.<ref name=\"Bloodint\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19996|title=Producer Brad Fuller Talks 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'|author=Chris Eggertsen|date=April 28, 2010|work=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=April 29, 2010|publisher=The Collective}}</ref> In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps because the dream-reality sequences could become repetitive.

The film stars [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Kyle Gallner]], [[Rooney Mara]], [[Katie Cassidy]], [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]], and [[Kellan Lutz]]. It is a [[remake]] of [[Wes Craven]]'s [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|1984 film of the same name]]. Produced by [[Michael Bay]] and [[Platinum Dunes]], the film was designed to reboot the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]] and is the ninth installment in the series. The film is set in a [[Fictional location|fictitious town]] of Ohio and centers around a group of teenagers living on one street who are stalked and murdered in their dreams by a disfigured man named [[Freddy Krueger]]. The teenagers discover that they all share a common link from their childhood that makes them targets for Krueger.\n\n''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was originally to follow the same design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, ''[[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|Friday the 13th]]'', where the writers took the best elements from each of the films in the original series and created a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline but tried to create a scarier film. To that end, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring back his darker nature. The writers developed the character to be a child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead. Freddy's physical appearance was changed with the use of computer-generated imagery to be closer to that of a burn victim. Because of the positive experiences Platinum Dunes' producers had in the area, ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was filmed primarily in Illinois. Craven expressed his displeasure when he was not consulted on the project. [[Robert Englund]], who portrayed Freddy in the previous eight films, voiced his support of the remake and the casting of Haley in the role of Freddy.\n\n''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' had its world premiere at Hollywood on April 27, 2010, and was theatrically released in North America on April 30, 2010, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and [[New Line Cinema]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, who criticized the teenage characters and story while offering some praise for Bayer's direction and Haley's performance. Despite this, it was box-office success, earned over $63 million at the domestic box office and over $115 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise and the highest-grossing slasher film in unadjusted dollars.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--STOP. Wikipedia is not a substitute for watching a movie, and plot summaries should not contain every minor detail. They are here to SUMMARIZE the basic events. For a horror movie, we don't need to explain how every single character was killed, and what everyone is doing that isn't relevant to the overall plot. Thank you. !-->\n[[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Kris Fowles|Kris Fowles]] meets her friend, Dean Russell, at the Springwood Diner. Dean falls asleep at the table and dreams that he meets a severely burned man in seared clothes who has a bladed gardener's glove on his right hand. The man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but it appears to Kris and their classmate, waitress [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Nancy Holbrook|Nancy Holbrook]], that Dean cuts himself. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man, then refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die like Dean. Jesse Braun, Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in Kris's blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having nightmares about the same man\u2014[[Freddy Krueger|Freddy]]. Jesse tells Nancy that they need to stop Freddy and warns her not to fall asleep, then runs off.\n\nJesse is arrested by the police under suspicion of murdering Kris. He tries not to fall asleep in his jail cell but fails, and is killed by Freddy. As her friends die, Nancy questions everyone's connection to each other, given that none of them can remember each other before their teenage years. Nancy and her friend Quentin Smith discover that all of them attended Badham Preschool. Nancy's mother, Gwen, reluctantly tells Nancy and Quentin that there was a groundskeeper at the preschool, Fred Krueger, who was accused of [[child sexual abuse|sexually abusing]] the children. Gwen explains that Nancy was his favorite, and that she came home one day and told her mother about the things Krueger did to her in a secret room. Gwen alerted the other parents, including Quentin's father Alan, and Kris's mother Nora, but she tells the teenagers that Krueger escaped before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. She discovers that all of the other kids have been killed, most of them in their sleep, and after Jesse\u2019s death, only she and Quentin are left.\n\nQuentin tries to accept that his nightmares are nothing more than repressed memories, but he falls asleep during swim practice and witnesses what really happened to Krueger\u2014the parents tracked him down and burned him alive. Quentin and Nancy believe that Krueger, now a [[vengeful ghost]], wants revenge on them for lying as children. As a result of their [[insomnia]], they have sporadic [[microsleep]] episodes and become [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]]. To try to stop Krueger, they decide to go to the preschool to learn what they can. On the way, Nancy is attacked by Krueger after a microsleep episode, but she pulls a piece of Krueger's sweater out of the dream world into reality. Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital where he steals [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] to help them stay awake. Finally at the preschool, they uncover Krueger's hidden room and the evidence that proves he did indeed abuse all of the children; they then realize that Kreuger wants revenge on them for telling the truth.\n\nNancy decides to pull Krueger out of the dream world and kill him in the real world. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she grabs Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy and explains that he deliberately left her for last so she would stay awake long enough to become comatose. Quentin awakens and uses the adrenaline to wake Nancy, who then pulls Krueger into reality. They fight and Nancy uses a broken paper cutter blade to kill him before she torches the secret room with Krueger's body inside. Nancy and Quentin escape. However, Krueger's remains are not found by the fire fighters who put out the fire. After Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital, Krueger suddenly appears.  While Nancy screams, Krueger kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror and then disappearing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of cast members of the Nightmare on Elm Street series|List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as [[Freddy Krueger|Fred \"Freddy\" Krueger]]\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Quentin Smith\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Nancy Holbrook|Nancy Holbrook]]\n**Kyra Krumins as young Nancy\n* [[Katie Cassidy]] as [[Tina Gray (A Nightmare on Elm Street)#Kris Fowles|Kris Fowles]]\n**Julianna Damm as young Kris\n* [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]] as Jesse Braun\n**Bayden Coyer as young Jesse\n* [[Kellan Lutz]] as Dean Russell\n**Max Holt as young Dean\n* [[Clancy Brown]] as Alan Smith \n* [[Connie Britton]] as Dr. Gwen Holbrook\n* Lia Mortensen as Nora Fowles\n* [[Kurt Naebig]] as Mr. Russell\n* Jennifer Robers as Mrs. Russell\n* [[Christian Stolte]] as Mr. Braun\n* [[Aaron Yoo]] as Marcus Yeon (uncredited) \n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn January 29, 2008, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that [[Michael Bay]] and his [[Platinum Dunes]] production company would reboot the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise with a remake of [[A Nightmare on Elm Street|the original 1984 film]].<ref name=\"NightAnno\">{{cite news|last=Fleming|first=Michael|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807.html?categoryid=13&cs=1|title=New Line sets up new 'Nightmare'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|date=January 29, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120529175832/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979807?refCatId=13|archive-date=May 29, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Producer Brad Fuller explained that they would follow the same tactic from their [[Friday the 13th (2009 film)|''Friday the 13th'' remake<!--STOP.

Bayer recognized that Craven attempted to put more meaning into his films and that the character of Freddy Krueger affected the lives of a generation of people. For Bayer, remaking ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' was about bringing that feeling to a new generation with a new spin on the character and story.<ref name=\"Bayerint\"/>\n\nFuller and Form likened the new film to their [[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|2003 remake of ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'']] but instead of a remake, they saw it as more of a reimagining.<ref name=\"setpreview\">{{cite news|last=Rotten|first=Ryan|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|title=Set Visit Preview: A Nightmare on Elm Street|work=Shock Till You Drop|publisher=CraveOnline|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=July 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723081206/http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=11115|archive-date=July 23, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The pair also explained that ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' would have a different tone than their ''Friday the 13th'' remake.

It's why we thought that we could reach an especially broad audience with a new film, since the feeling of having your dreams being invaded was something that would translate to any country and any culture.\"<ref name=\"LAint\"/> Overall, Bayer wanted to create a film in \"a darker world\" that made the audience ask, \"What makes a monster?\"\u2014is it a monster because of its physical appearance, someone with a scarred face and a clawed glove, or is it a monster because of something deeper within the man himself.<ref name=\"Rotint\"/>\n\n===Writing===\nWesley Strick was initially hired to pen a script for a new ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' because he had impressed Emmerich with a prequel script he wrote for the 1995 film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''.

Bayer explained that the script goes deeper into \"[Freddy] as a person [and] how he became the thing he was\". Bayer expressed that unlike the ''Friday the 13th'' remake that picked the best parts from the first four films, the ''Nightmare on Elm Street'' remake was coming straight from the first film.<ref name=\"Bayerint\"/>\n\nFor the remake, Freddy was brought back to his darker roots and away from the comical character he had become in later ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy did have one-liners but they come from a darker sense of humor and were not intended to be as campy as in previous films. Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a [[Child sexual abuse|child molester]] was used because if Freddy killed children, as in the original, it would have been easy for the teenage characters to figure out using the Internet what had happened.<ref name=\"Bloodint\">{{cite news|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/19996|title=Producer Brad Fuller Talks 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'|author=Chris Eggertsen|date=April 28, 2010|work=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=April 29, 2010|publisher=The Collective}}</ref> In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps because the dream-reality sequences could become repetitive.

He is divorced and struggles to maintain a relationship with his teenage son, Marcus. Marcus lives with Lucas' ex-wife, but he eventually decides to move in with Lucas. Nadja, a Russian emigrant and another teacher at the preschool, makes advances on Lucas and eventually becomes his girlfriend.\n\nOne of Lucas' students is a five-year-old girl named Klara, the daughter of his best friend, Theo. She has an [[Puppy love|innocent crush]] on Lucas, who treats her kindly, whereas her parents constantly argue; he also lets her walk his dog, Fanny. One day, Klara puts a heart-shaped ornament into his coat pocket, then gives him a kiss on the lips. After Lucas admonishes her, Klara's feelings are hurt. Drawing on a memory of a pornographic photo her older teenage brother and his friend showed her, she makes comments describing an erect penis; this leads Grethe, the preschool director, to believe Lucas [[indecent exposure|exposed]] himself to Klara. Grethe brings in a psychologist who asks Klara [[leading questions]] about what occurred; Klara gives unclear responses about Lucas, alternately denying and confirming the abuse.\n\nGrethe doesn't believe that a child would lie about such a serious matter. She informs the other parents that Klara was likely abused; she also advises them to look for signs of sexual abuse in their own children. The parents ask leading questions of their children, who also say they were abused, thereby destroying any public doubt about Klara's story. Lucas is fired, and the community quickly shuns him, labeling him as a [[Paedophilia|paedophile]].\n\nLucas tries to get some answers out of Grethe, but she is still convinced that the children are telling the truth. Johan, one of Lucas' drinking buddies, leads Lucas away and orders him to go home.\n\nLucas shows up to Theo's house and suggests that the two of them discuss the issue with Grethe before things get worse. However, Theo insists that his daughter has never once lied, and he says he isn't sure whom to believe. Theo's wife, Agnes, on the other hand, is certain that Lucas is guilty; she becomes enraged and throws him out, refusing to listen to his protests. As Lucas is leaving, Theo grabs him, pins him against the wall, and threatens to kill him if the accusations turn out to be true. After Lucas has left, Klara tries to tell her mother that he didn't do anything, but Agnes merely believes that Klara is in denial.\n\nLucas' friendship with Theo is subsequently destroyed. His relationship with Nadja is likewise ruined when she expresses uncertainty at his innocence, causing him to angrily throw her out of the house. Marcus, who arrives to move in with Lucas, becomes [[Ostracism|ostracised]] by association, and he is told by a grocery employee that neither he nor his father are welcome to shop there anymore. Lucas survives only with the financial support of his close friend Bruun\u2014whose father is extremely wealthy\u2014and of a few friends who still believe him.\n\nLucas is arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. However, the children's accounts all involve Lucas abusing them in his basement, which supports Lucas' innocence as his house has no basement. After a hearing, Lucas is released without charge, and he celebrates with Marcus and Bruun.\n\nDespite the ruling, the community still believes Lucas is guilty, and the ostracism turns into violence. Lucas' dog is killed, and a large stone is thrown through his kitchen window. Marcus decides to take matters into his own hands and visits Theo, who lets him enter his house as Marcus is friends with Klara's teenage brother. In front of the other half of Lucas' and Theo's group of friends, who have sided with Theo, Marcus accuses Klara of lying and spits at her, and is promptly attacked. He is only spared serious injury by Theo, who intervenes and tells Marcus to leave. Deciding that the situation is too dangerous, Lucas sends Marcus away to live with his mother. Without his son as an in-between, Lucas is forced to go grocery shopping himself, and when a butcher at the grocery store viciously assaults him, Lucas retaliates by breaking his nose.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Lucas reaches his breaking point; he angrily confronts, then beats Theo in front of everyone during a church service, telling him and the rest of the town to leave him alone. That night, Klara, mistaking her father for Lucas, apologizes to him as she drifts off to sleep. She insists that she didn't want things to turn out this way and that Lucas did nothing wrong. Realizing Lucas' innocence, Theo later visits him with food and alcohol as a peace offering.\n\nA year later, tensions in the community have simmered down, and everyone seems to have welcomed Lucas back in. Lucas and Nadja rekindle their relationship, and Marcus is accepted into the local hunting society as an adult. On a hunting expedition to commemorate the event, someone apparently shoots at Lucas with a rifle and barely misses. Blinded by the setting sun, Lucas is unable to identify his attacker.

He is divorced and struggles to maintain a relationship with his teenage son, Marcus. Marcus lives with Lucas' ex-wife, but he eventually decides to move in with Lucas. Nadja, a Russian emigrant and another teacher at the preschool, makes advances on Lucas and eventually becomes his girlfriend.\n\nOne of Lucas' students is a five-year-old girl named Klara, the daughter of his best friend, Theo. She has an [[Puppy love|innocent crush]] on Lucas, who treats her kindly, whereas her parents constantly argue; he also lets her walk his dog, Fanny. One day, Klara puts a heart-shaped ornament into his coat pocket, then gives him a kiss on the lips. After Lucas admonishes her, Klara's feelings are hurt. Drawing on a memory of a pornographic photo her older teenage brother and his friend showed her, she makes comments describing an erect penis; this leads Grethe, the preschool director, to believe Lucas [[indecent exposure|exposed]] himself to Klara. Grethe brings in a psychologist who asks Klara [[leading questions]] about what occurred; Klara gives unclear responses about Lucas, alternately denying and confirming the abuse.\n\nGrethe doesn't believe that a child would lie about such a serious matter. She informs the other parents that Klara was likely abused; she also advises them to look for signs of sexual abuse in their own children. The parents ask leading questions of their children, who also say they were abused, thereby destroying any public doubt about Klara's story. Lucas is fired, and the community quickly shuns him, labeling him as a [[Paedophilia|paedophile]].\n\nLucas tries to get some answers out of Grethe, but she is still convinced that the children are telling the truth. Johan, one of Lucas' drinking buddies, leads Lucas away and orders him to go home.\n\nLucas shows up to Theo's house and suggests that the two of them discuss the issue with Grethe before things get worse. However, Theo insists that his daughter has never once lied, and he says he isn't sure whom to believe. Theo's wife, Agnes, on the other hand, is certain that Lucas is guilty; she becomes enraged and throws him out, refusing to listen to his protests. As Lucas is leaving, Theo grabs him, pins him against the wall, and threatens to kill him if the accusations turn out to be true. After Lucas has left, Klara tries to tell her mother that he didn't do anything, but Agnes merely believes that Klara is in denial.\n\nLucas' friendship with Theo is subsequently destroyed. His relationship with Nadja is likewise ruined when she expresses uncertainty at his innocence, causing him to angrily throw her out of the house. Marcus, who arrives to move in with Lucas, becomes [[Ostracism|ostracised]] by association, and he is told by a grocery employee that neither he nor his father are welcome to shop there anymore. Lucas survives only with the financial support of his close friend Bruun\u2014whose father is extremely wealthy\u2014and of a few friends who still believe him.\n\nLucas is arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. However, the children's accounts all involve Lucas abusing them in his basement, which supports Lucas' innocence as his house has no basement. After a hearing, Lucas is released without charge, and he celebrates with Marcus and Bruun.\n\nDespite the ruling, the community still believes Lucas is guilty, and the ostracism turns into violence. Lucas' dog is killed, and a large stone is thrown through his kitchen window. Marcus decides to take matters into his own hands and visits Theo, who lets him enter his house as Marcus is friends with Klara's teenage brother. In front of the other half of Lucas' and Theo's group of friends, who have sided with Theo, Marcus accuses Klara of lying and spits at her, and is promptly attacked. He is only spared serious injury by Theo, who intervenes and tells Marcus to leave. Deciding that the situation is too dangerous, Lucas sends Marcus away to live with his mother. Without his son as an in-between, Lucas is forced to go grocery shopping himself, and when a butcher at the grocery store viciously assaults him, Lucas retaliates by breaking his nose.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Lucas reaches his breaking point; he angrily confronts, then beats Theo in front of everyone during a church service, telling him and the rest of the town to leave him alone. That night, Klara, mistaking her father for Lucas, apologizes to him as she drifts off to sleep. She insists that she didn't want things to turn out this way and that Lucas did nothing wrong. Realizing Lucas' innocence, Theo later visits him with food and alcohol as a peace offering.\n\nA year later, tensions in the community have simmered down, and everyone seems to have welcomed Lucas back in. Lucas and Nadja rekindle their relationship, and Marcus is accepted into the local hunting society as an adult. On a hunting expedition to commemorate the event, someone apparently shoots at Lucas with a rifle and barely misses. Blinded by the setting sun, Lucas is unable to identify his attacker. A moment later the unknown shooter flees in to the forest.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as Lucas\n* [[Alexandra Rapaport]] as Nadja, Lucas' girlfriend\n* [[Thomas Bo Larsen]] as Theo, Lucas' best friend\n* Lasse Fogelstr\u00f8m as Marcus, Lucas' son\n* [[Susse Wold]] as Grethe\n* [[Lars Ranthe]] as Bruun\n* [[Anne Louise Hassing]] as Agnes, Theo's wife\n* [[Bjarne Henriksen]] as Ole\n* Annika Wedderkopp as Klara, Theo and Agnes' daughter\n* Ole Dupont as Landowner / Lawyer\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced by [[Zentropa]] for 20 million [[Danish krone]]r.

{"title_page": "Law of cotangents", "text_new": "[[File:Herontriangle1greek.svg|thumb|270px|right|A triangle, showing the \"incircle\" and the partitioning of the sides.  The angle bisectors meet at the [[incenter]], which is the center of the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]].]]\n[[File:Herontriangle2greek.svg|thumb|270px|right|By the above reasoning, all six parts are as shown.]]\n{{Trigonometry}}\nIn [[trigonometry]], the '''law of cotangents'''<ref>The Universal Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Pan Reference Books, 1976, page 530. English version George Allen and Unwin, 1964. Translated from the German version Meyers Rechenduden, 1960.</ref> is a relationship among the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the cotangents of the halves of the three angles.\n\nJust as three quantities whose equality is expressed by the [[law of sines]] are equal to the diameter of the [[circumscribed circle]] of the triangle (or to its reciprocal, depending on how the law is expressed), so also the law of cotangents relates the radius of the [[inscribed circle]] of a [[triangle]] (the [[inradius]]) to its sides and angles.\n\n==Statement==\nUsing the usual notations for a triangle (see the figure at the upper right), where {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} are the lengths of the three sides, {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} are the vertices opposite those three respective sides, {{math|''\u03b1''}}, {{math|''\u03b2''}}, {{math|''\u03b3''}} are the corresponding angles at those vertices, {{math|''s''}} is the semi-perimeter, that is, {{math|''s'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''|2}}}}, and {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the inscribed circle, the law of [[trigonometric function|cotangent]]s states that\n:<math>\\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}{s-a} = \\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\beta}{2}\\right)}{s-b} = \\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)}{s-c} = \\frac{1}{r}\\,</math>\n\nand furthermore that the inradius is given by\n:<math>r = \\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s}}\\,.</math>\n\n==Proof==\nIn the upper figure, the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides of the triangle break the perimeter into 6 segments, in 3 pairs. In each pair the segments are of equal length. For example, the 2 segments adjacent to vertex {{math|''A''}} are equal.

English version George Allen and Unwin, 1964. Translated from the German version Meyers Rechenduden, 1960.</ref> is a relationship among the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the cotangents of the halves of the three angles.\n\nJust as three quantities whose equality is expressed by the [[law of sines]] are equal to the diameter of the [[circumscribed circle]] of the triangle (or to its reciprocal, depending on how the law is expressed), so also the law of cotangents relates the radius of the [[inscribed circle]] of a [[triangle]] (the [[inradius]]) to its sides and angles.\n\n==Statement==\nUsing the usual notations for a triangle (see the figure at the upper right), where {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, {{math|''c''}} are the lengths of the three sides, {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} are the vertices opposite those three respective sides, {{math|''\u03b1''}}, {{math|''\u03b2''}}, {{math|''\u03b3''}} are the corresponding angles at those vertices, {{math|''s''}} is the semi-perimeter, that is, {{math|''s'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a'' + ''b'' + ''c''|2}}}}, and {{math|''r''}} is the radius of the inscribed circle, the law of [[trigonometric function|cotangent]]s states that\n:<math>\\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}{s-a} = \\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\beta}{2}\\right)}{s-b} = \\frac{\\cot\\left(\\tfrac{\\gamma}{2}\\right)}{s-c} = \\frac{1}{r}\\,</math>\n\nand furthermore that the inradius is given by\n:<math>r = \\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s}}\\,.</math>\n\n==Proof==\nIn the upper figure, the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides of the triangle break the perimeter into 6 segments, in 3 pairs. In each pair the segments are of equal length. For example, the 2 segments adjacent to vertex {{math|''A''}} are equal. If we pick one segment from each pair, their sum will be the semiperimeter {{math|''s''}}. An example of this is the segments shown in color in the figure. The two segments making up the red line add up to {{math|''a''}}, so the blue segment must be of length {{math|''s'' \u2212 ''a''}}.

One day, Stella writes to Amudhavan asking him to take care of their daughter and leaves her family and runs away leading to Amu moving back home after 10 years to raise Pappa as a single father.  \n\nAmu finds it difficult to connect with Pappa having lived abroad for so long. They are shunned by their neighbours because of Pappa's health condition. They move in to his brother's house to live with his family and Amu's mother but his sister-in-law, irrationally fearing her own child will catch Pappa's \"illness\" asks them to move out. Amu returns home with Pappa where he continuously fights with some locals trying to force him to sell the house and leave the neighbourhood. Pappa and Amu slowly start bonding. One night when Pappa begins menstruation, Amu helps a panicked Pappa relax and seeks help from a woman named Vijaylakshmi. Vijaylakshmi (Viji) offers her help in return for basic needs and starts living with Amu and Pappa. Gradually, Viji and Amu become closer and marry. However, Viji's motives are revealed when she tries to kill Pappa by pushing her into a well only to be stopped by Amu. Amu discovers Viji is already married and was pretending to help them to gain ownership of his house. A dejected Amu leaves the house to Viji and moves away. Having received no money, he is forced to leave Pappa at home while he goes to work.\n\nPappa falls sick and the doctor diagnoses her with a fungal infection. She also refers Amu to Dr. Dhanapal who advises him to let Pappa stay at a special home for others with her health condition. Amu agrees with a heavy heart. On his way home he meets a trans-woman named Meera and they develop a bond. Meera helps him find a house. A few days later, while visiting Pappa, Amu discovers that Pappa was beaten by some workers at the home. He brings her back and seeks Dr. Dhanapal to understand more about Pappa's condition and her needs.\n\nFeeling helpless, Amu decides to end his and Pappa's lives and the two walk into the sea at night but are saved by Meera. The last chapter of Amuvadhan's story is about great love as he reveals that Meera taught him about love and the two are married.

Amu returns home with Pappa where he continuously fights with some locals trying to force him to sell the house and leave the neighbourhood. Pappa and Amu slowly start bonding. One night when Pappa begins menstruation, Amu helps a panicked Pappa relax and seeks help from a woman named Vijaylakshmi. Vijaylakshmi (Viji) offers her help in return for basic needs and starts living with Amu and Pappa. Gradually, Viji and Amu become closer and marry. However, Viji's motives are revealed when she tries to kill Pappa by pushing her into a well only to be stopped by Amu. Amu discovers Viji is already married and was pretending to help them to gain ownership of his house. A dejected Amu leaves the house to Viji and moves away. Having received no money, he is forced to leave Pappa at home while he goes to work.\n\nPappa falls sick and the doctor diagnoses her with a fungal infection. She also refers Amu to Dr. Dhanapal who advises him to let Pappa stay at a special home for others with her health condition. Amu agrees with a heavy heart. On his way home he meets a trans-woman named Meera and they develop a bond. Meera helps him find a house. A few days later, while visiting Pappa, Amu discovers that Pappa was beaten by some workers at the home. He brings her back and seeks Dr. Dhanapal to understand more about Pappa's condition and her needs.\n\nFeeling helpless, Amu decides to end his and Pappa's lives and the two walk into the sea at night but are saved by Meera. The last chapter of Amuvadhan's story is about great love as he reveals that Meera taught him about love and the two are married. Pappa stays happily with her loving father and step-mother, Meera.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammooty]] as Amudhavan \"Amu\"\n* Sadhana as Pappa, Amudhavan and Stella's daughter\n*[[Anjali (film actress)|Anjali]] as Vijayalakshmi \"Viji\"\n* Anjali Ameer as Meera\n* [[Lizzie Antony]] as Thangam alias Stella, Amudhavan's wife\n* [[Samuthirakani]]  as Dr. Dhanapal\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Amudhavan's mother\n* [[Livingston (actor)|Livingston]] as House owner\n* [[Aruldoss]] as Murugan, Amudhavan's friend and a taxi driver\n*  [[Pavel Navageethan]] as Babu\n* [[Shanmugarajan]] as Home in-charge\n* [[P.

He suffers from an irrational fear of ghosts and retreats to the safety of his home after sunset. His fear is so great he prefers to sleep with his widowed mother Geetha and have her accompany him to the bathroom at night, and also at the eating time. This creates major annoyance in the household, including Malan's brother Gamini, sister-in-law Nirmala  and their children.\n\nOne night, Malan engaged with a girl named Shaini and flirts to gain her attraction, but did not reveal it. Shaini also had some attraction to Malan and she started to flirt around him as well. Meanwhile, One day, Malan and his friends are forced to abandon their usual cricket ground and find a new one; one friend select an abandoned ground which is rumored to be haunted. A bizarre weather change scares them away. Malan brings home his cricket stumps, which have been stained with blood from a buried corpse in the ground. He focuses on wooing Shaini, where she asked Malan to come to a dinner. But as he is fear for ghosts, he went to the hotel with all his family. At the dinner, however, Malan's mother agreed on their relationship and fixed a date to meet Shaini's family. In the following days, his mother and sister-in-law are witness to several paranormal phenomena at night; prominently a ghost haunting the hallways. On consulting am exorcist, they perform 3 rituals to ascertain if the house is haunted:\n\n1. They keep a coconut on a [[Rangoli]] and pray with chants. The coconut rotates on its own.\n\n2. They keep an egg on a pan and see whether it turns color or explode it.\n\n3. They leave a lit lamp and two drops of blood and leave the house. A ghost of a woman appears before them and licks the blood.\n\nScared senseless, Malan's mother and sister-in-law hire two priests to rid their home of the ghost. The priests, however, are conmen, and escape with their lives. That night, the ghost possesses Malan, who begins acting increasingly [[effeminate]], alienating himself from Shaini and wearing women's clothes and jewelry. His family angrily confronts him, when it is revealed that there are actually three ghosts who have possessed him: a violent woman, a Tamil Hindu Man named Ramu, and a learning disabled boy. With the possession, Malan kills a women by hanging and a thug Wasantha by engraving him with his van. Malan's family ask Buddhist monk, who successfully drives the spirit away from Malan's body. The ghost of the woman, trapped, reveals her story.\n\nMaya/Mayantha is a [[transgender]] who was disowned by her father. She is offered shelter by a kind Tamil man Ramu, who has a [[disability]] son. Regretting that she couldn't become a doctor as she intended, she adopts another young [[transgender]] named Madhuri/Madhawi. and works hard to support her financially. When Madhuri leaves to study medicine abroad, Maya buys a plot of land where Madhuri intended to construct a hospital for the poor. That ground is unlawfully taken by Minister Ashoka. Maya angrily confronts the minister, who cunningly kills her. He also kills Ramu and his son. Before she died, she vowed to kill minister, his wife, and his henchmen Shantha. The bodies are then buried in Maya's own ground.\n\nThe Buddhist monk sympathizes with her, but remains duty-bound and traps her. After hearing her story, Malan is touched; risking the danger, he allows Maya to possess him once again. Malan/Maya confronts the minister, and disposes of his henchmen gruesomely. The minister seeks refuge in a [[Kali]] temple which Maya is forbidden from; but she asks the deity for justice and manages to chase him inside the temple. The three spirits combined kill the minister. A few years later, Malan has constructed the hospital for Dr.Madhuri as per Maya's wishes. It is revealed that Maya exists [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] in Malan's body to help him out when the need rises.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ranjan Ramanayake]] as Maya/Mayantha\n** Yohan Perera as Young Maya/Mayantha\n* [[Pubudu Chathuranga]] as Malan\n* Shehara Hewadewa as Shaini\n* [[Giriraj Kaushalya]] as Gamini\n* Nihal Fernando as Ramu\n* Sujeewa Priyalal as Madhuri/Madhawi\n* Nilmini Kottegoda as Geetha\n* Sarath Chandrasiri as Kapuwa\n* [[Wasantha Kumaravila]] as Shantha\n* Ishan Gammudali as Buddhist monk\n* [[Somy Rathnayake]] as Principal\n* [[Upeksha Swarnamali]] as Nirmala\n* Srimal Wedisinghe as Minister Ashoka\n* [[Mihira Sirithilaka]] as Ramu's son\n* [[Kumara Thirimadura]] as Maya's father\n* [[Damitha Abeyratne]] as Shantha's fianc\u00e9e\n* Anura Bandara Rajaguru as Swami\n* [[Maureen Charuni]] as Hansi's mother\n* Ramani Siriwardena as Shaini's mother\n* Nandana Hettiarachchi as Con Priest\n* Gunadasa Madurasinghe as Con Priest\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column\t = Singer(s)\n| title1\t= Heenen Awidinna<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topsinhalamp3.com/songs/surendra-perera-mp3-songs/heenen-awidinna-(maya)-mp3-song.php |title=Heenen Awidinna (Maya) |publisher=Top Sinhala mp3 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}</ref>\n| lyrics1= Nilar N.

He suffers from an irrational fear of ghosts and retreats to the safety of his home after sunset. His fear is so great he prefers to sleep with his widowed mother Geetha and have her accompany him to the bathroom at night, and also at the eating time. This creates major annoyance in the household, including Malan's brother Gamini , sister-in-law Nirmala  and their children.\n\nOne night, Malan engaged with a girl named Shaini and flirts to gain her attraction, but did not reveal it. Shaini also had some attraction to Malan and she started to flirt around him as well. Meanwhile, One day, Malan and his friends are forced to abandon their usual cricket ground and find a new one; one friend select an abandoned ground which is rumored to be haunted. A bizarre weather change scares them away. Malan brings home his cricket stumps, which have been stained with blood from a buried corpse in the ground. He focuses on wooing Shaini, where she asked Malan to come to a dinner. But as he is fear for ghosts, he went to the hotel with all his family. At the dinner, however, Malan's mother agreed on their relationship and fixed a date to meet Shaini's family. In the following days, his mother and sister-in-law are witness to several paranormal phenomena at night; prominently a ghost haunting the hallways. On consulting am exorcist, they perform 3 rituals to ascertain if the house is haunted:\n\n1. They keep a coconut on a [[Rangoli]] and pray with chants. The coconut rotates on its own.\n\n2. They keep an egg on a pan and see whether it turns color or explode it.\n\n3. They leave a lit lamp and two drops of blood and leave the house. A ghost of a woman appears before them and licks the blood.\n\nScared senseless, Malan's mother and sister-in-law hire two priests to rid their home of the ghost. The priests, however, are conmen, and escape with their lives. That night, the ghost possesses Malan, who begins acting increasingly [[effeminate]], alienating himself from Shaini and wearing women's clothes and jewelry. His family angrily confronts him, when it is revealed that there are actually three ghosts who have possessed him: a violent woman, a Tamil Hindu Man named Ramu, and a learning disabled boy. With the possession, Malan kills a women by hanging and a thug Wasantha by engraving him with his van. Malan's family ask Buddhist monk, who successfully drives the spirit away from Malan's body. The ghost of the woman, trapped, reveals her story.\n\nMaya/Mayantha is a [[transgender]] who was disowned by her father. She is offered shelter by a kind Tamil man Ramu , who has a [[disability]] son. Regretting that she couldn't become a doctor as she intended, she adopts another young [[transgender]] named Madhuri/Madhawi. and works hard to support her financially. When Madhuri leaves to study medicine abroad, Maya buys a plot of land where Madhuri intended to construct a hospital for the poor. That ground is unlawfully taken by Minister Ashoka. Maya angrily confronts the minister, who cunningly kills her. He also kills Ramu and his son. Before she died, she vowed to kill minister, his wife, and his henchmen Shantha. The bodies are then buried in Maya's own ground.\n\nThe Buddhist monk sympathizes with her, but remains duty-bound and traps her. After hearing her story, Malan is touched; risking the danger, he allows Maya to possess him once again. Malan/Maya confronts the minister, and disposes of his henchmen gruesomely. The minister seeks refuge in a [[Kali]] temple which Maya is forbidden from; but she asks the deity for justice and manages to chase him inside the temple. The three spirits combined kill the minister. A few years later, Malan has constructed the hospital for Dr.Madhuri as per Maya's wishes. It is revealed that Maya exists [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] in Malan's body to help him out when the need rises.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ranjan Ramanayake]] as Maya/Mayantha\n** Yohan Perera as Young Maya/Mayantha\n* [[Pubudu Chathuranga]] as Malan\n* Shehara Hewadewa as Shaini\n* [[Giriraj Kaushalya]] as Gamini\n* Nihal Fernando as Ramu\n* Sujeewa Priyalal as Madhuri/Madhawi\n* Nilmini Kottegoda as Geetha\n* Sarath Chandrasiri as Kapuwa\n* [[Wasantha Kumaravila]] as Shantha\n* Ishan Gammudali as Buddhist monk\n* [[Somy Rathnayake]] as Principal\n* [[Upeksha Swarnamali]] as Nirmala\n* Srimal Wedisinghe as Minister Ashoka\n* [[Mihira Sirithilaka]] as Ramu's son\n* [[Kumara Thirimadura]] as Maya's father\n* [[Damitha Abeyratne]] as Shantha's fianc\u00e9e\n* Anura Bandara Rajaguru as Swami\n* [[Maureen Charuni]] as Hansi's mother\n* Ramani Siriwardena as Shaini's mother\n* Nandana Hettiarachchi as Con Priest\n* Gunadasa Madurasinghe as Con Priest\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column\t = Singer(s)\n| title1\t= Heenen Awidinna<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topsinhalamp3.com/songs/surendra-perera-mp3-songs/heenen-awidinna-(maya)-mp3-song.php |title=Heenen Awidinna (Maya) |publisher=Top Sinhala mp3 |accessdate=11 March 2017}}</ref>\n| lyrics1= Nilar N.

[[azimuth]] of its flight, Soyuz-2 performs a roll maneuver during its flight to change direction. The maneuver would trigger the analog launch abort system designed for Soyuz-FG. Soyuz MS-14 tested a solution for this issue. The 14th flight of Soyuz MS is the 143rd flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. If all goes well, future crewed missions will use the new configuration starting with [[Soyuz MS-16]] in early 2020.<ref name=ria-20181222>{{cite news |title=\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0441\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0411\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043a \u041c\u041a\u0421, \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a |trans-title=Launch dates to ISS from Baikonur are defined, per source |url=https://ria.ru/20181222/1548471154.html |accessdate=28 December 2018 |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=22 December 2018 |language=ru}}</ref>\n\nBesides testing the integration of the new launcher and the abort system Soyuz MS-14 is also testing an upgraded navigation and propulsion control system.<ref name=energia-20180518>{{cite web |url=https://www.energia.ru/ru/news/news-2018/news_05-18.html |title=\u0420\u041a\u041a \u00ab\u042d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f\u00bb: \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u00ab\u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 \u041c\u0421\u00bb \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0435 2019 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 |lang=ru |trans-title=RKK Energia: launch of unmanned Soyuz MS is planned for August 2019 |publisher=[[RKK Energia]] |date=18 May 2018 |access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> The results of the testing will be used in the design of [[Soyuz GVK]], an uncrewed cargo delivery and return spacecraft, tentatively scheduled to be launched for the first time in 2022.<ref name=energia-20180518/>\n\nUnlike preceding and future Soyuz MS spacecraft, Soyuz MS-14 lacks various crew support systems.\n\nThe spacecraft carried cargo to the International Space Station, among other things a humanoid robot [[FEDOR (robot)|Fedor]] that travelled in the crew compartment of the Soyuz (which was available to use as the mission had no crew).

unpiloted mission of Soyuz to ISS.<ref>http://russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-14.html</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nUnlike the traditional [[Soyuz-FG]] launcher which is turned on its launchpad to set [[azimuth]] of its flight, Soyuz-2 performs a roll maneuver during its flight to change direction. The maneuver would trigger the analog launch abort system designed for Soyuz-FG. Soyuz MS-14 tested a solution for this issue. The 14th flight of Soyuz MS is the 143rd flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. If all goes well, future crewed missions will use the new configuration starting with [[Soyuz MS-16]] in early 2020.<ref name=ria-20181222>{{cite news |title=\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0441\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0441 \u0411\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043a \u041c\u041a\u0421, \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a |trans-title=Launch dates to ISS from Baikonur are defined, per source |url=https://ria.ru/20181222/1548471154.html |accessdate=28 December 2018 |agency=[[RIA Novosti]] |date=22 December 2018 |language=ru}}</ref>\n\nBesides testing the integration of the new launcher and the abort system Soyuz MS-14 is also testing an upgraded navigation and propulsion control system.<ref name=energia-20180518>{{cite web |url=https://www.energia.ru/ru/news/news-2018/news_05-18.html |title=\u0420\u041a\u041a \u00ab\u042d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f\u00bb: \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0442 \u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u00ab\u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 \u041c\u0421\u00bb \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0435 2019 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 |lang=ru |trans-title=RKK Energia: launch of unmanned Soyuz MS is planned for August 2019 |publisher=[[RKK Energia]] |date=18 May 2018 |access-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> The results of the testing will be used in the design of [[Soyuz GVK]], an uncrewed cargo delivery and return spacecraft, tentatively scheduled to be launched for the first time in 2022.<ref name=energia-20180518/>\n\nUnlike preceding and future Soyuz MS spacecraft, Soyuz MS-14 lacks various crew support systems.\n\nThe spacecraft carried cargo to the International Space Station, among other things a humanoid robot [[FEDOR (robot)|Fedor]] that travelled in the crew compartment of the Soyuz (which was available to use as the mission had no crew).
