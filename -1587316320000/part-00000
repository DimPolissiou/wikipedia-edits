Sadie introduces Flo to McTeague, a wildcatter with a large bankroll, to steal his money to get back to New York. \n\nWhen the theft is discovered McTeague drags Flo to where she lives.  Flo had passed the money to her friend who assisted the theft by leaving and was to meet Flo back at her apartment. \n\nFlo soon realizes her friend has run off without her and is threatened by McTeague that he will have her thrown in prison.  After pleading (while on the floor with some breast and leg exposed) McTeague is inspired to hire her as his housekeeper. She grudgingly accepts. \n\nMcTeague takes Flo to his home in the jungle where he continues to harass her.  \n\nBabe, a pilot and Flo's boyfriend, who left Flo for a two week assignment the day that Flo met McTeague.   Babe lands his plane that needs repairs at McTeague's.  Babe is unaware of Flo's presence, but she knows he is there and sneaks to him that night.\n\nSadie sent Babe to rescue Flo and they pretend to not know each other.  Earlier during a night of binge drinking  McTeague had told Flo he knew where the richest oil fields are and one day he would be king!\n\nBabe finds a chance to tell Flo that McTeague is a crook and they need to find the information on the oil.   \n\nThe next day Babe takes off on his seaplane but lets Flo know he'll be back for her.  Before Babe leaves he says he'll probably see him again in Panama.\n\nMcTeague seems puzzled about the reference and leaves Flo alone to visit the natives and before leaving gives her a loaded gun in case of trouble.\n\nBabe returns for Flo but won't leave until he find the papers regarding the oil.  In his excitement over finding the papers he reveals HE is the criminal and would never marry her.  Intent on getting away, Flo threatens to shoot Babe and does when he tries to leave.\n\nMcTeague realizes the Panama reference and heads back home where he finds Babe dead.  Flo believes she killed Babe and McTeague lets her believe it.  He puts Babe's body in his plane and sinks it.  McTeague sends Flo to New York.\n\nBack to the present, Flo learns she didn't kill Babe.  It was McTeague who shot Babe through the heart. McTeague tries to explain why he let her believe she killed Babe. Flo refuses his offer of making it up to her.  She tells McTeague she has no need of his money and points to a Rolls Royce parked on the street.   She tells him it belongs to the richest oilman and its her's too.    \n\nFlo leaves McTeague and approaches the car and asks the driver to let her get in and drive around the block.  The driver refuses and she walks down the street forlornly. \n\nThe owner of the car approaches and the driver tells the man he has something on his tie.  The owner is McTeague and he tells the driver to follow Flo.  Flo stops at a window to adjust her out of date clothing.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011.

The lyrics refer to [[sexual frustration]] and [[commercialism]].\n\nThe song was first released as a single in the United States in June 1965 and was also featured on the American version of the Rolling Stones' fourth studio album, ''[[Out of Our Heads]]'', released that July. \"Satisfaction\" was a hit, giving the Stones their first number one in the US. In the UK, the song initially was played only on [[Pirate radio|pirate radio stations]], because its lyrics were considered too sexually suggestive.<ref name=\"Nuzum\">{{cite book |last=Nuzum |first=Eric |title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-06-197673-5}}</ref> It later became the Rolling Stones' fourth number one in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" in the second spot on its list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\".

This stereo mix of \"Satisfaction\" also appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but has not yet been featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of the German and Japanese ''Hot Rocks'' CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the worldwide 2002 reissue of ''Hot Rocks'', an alternative quasi-stereo mix was used featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the center channel and the acoustic guitar and piano \"split\" left and right via a [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lukpac.org/stereostones/ |title=The Rolling Stones In Stereo |publisher=Lukpac.org |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrics and melody==\n[[File:Satisfaction riff.png|thumb|left|450px|Guitar riff from \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"]]The song opens with the guitar riff, which is joined by the bass halfway through. It is repeated three times with the drums and acoustic guitar before the vocal enters with the line: \"I can't get no satisfaction\". The key is E major, but with the 3rd and 7th [[degree (music)|degree]] occasionally lowered, creating \u2013 in the first part of the verses (\"I can't get no ...\") \u2013 a distinctive mellow sound. The accompanying chords (i.e. E major, D major and A major) are [[Borrowed chord|borrowed]] from the E [[Mixolydian mode|mixolydian]] scale, which is often used in [[blues]] and [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nThe title line is an example of a [[Double negative|negative concord]]. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then leaps half singing and half yelling into the [[refrain|chorus]], where the guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's irritation and confusion with the increasing commercialism of the modern world, where the radio broadcasts \"useless information\" and a man on television tells him \"how white my shirts can be \u2013 but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me,\" a reference to the then ubiquitous [[Marlboro Man|Marlboro Cowboy]] style advertisement. Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity, and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not getting any \"girl reaction\" was fairly controversial in its day, interpreted by some listeners (and radio programmers) as meaning a girl willing to have sex. Jagger commented that they \"didn't understand the dirtiest line\", as afterwards the girl asks him to return the following week as she is \"on a losing streak,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835889-2,00.html|url-access=limited|title=Going to Pot|date=1 July 1966|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time)]]|publisher=Time USA|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022141/http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C835889-2%2C00.html|archive-date=14 October 2007|url-status=live|access-date=18 December 2008|quote=But, gloats Jagger, \"They didn't understand the dirtiest line.\" That is the one where the girl pleads: \"Baby, better come back later next week 'cause you see I'm on a losing streak.\"}}</ref> an apparent reference to [[menstruation]].

Richards' guitar riff\u2014\u200cintended to be replaced by horns\u2014\u200copens and drives the song. The lyrics refer to [[sexual frustration]] and [[commercialism]].\n\nThe song was first released as a single in the United States in June 1965 and was also featured on the American version of the Rolling Stones' fourth studio album, ''[[Out of Our Heads]]'', released that July. \"Satisfaction\" was a hit, giving the Stones their first number one in the US. In the UK, the song initially was played only on [[Pirate radio|pirate radio stations]], because its lyrics were considered too sexually suggestive.<ref name=\"Nuzum\">{{cite book |last=Nuzum |first=Eric |title=Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-06-197673-5}}</ref> It later became the Rolling Stones' fourth number one in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" in the second spot on its list of \"[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\". The song was added to the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 2006.\n\n==Recording==\nKeith Richards wrote \"Satisfaction\" in his sleep and recorded a rough version of the riff on a [[Philips]] cassette player.

In the mid-1980s, a true stereo version of the song was released on German and Japanese editions of the CD reissue of ''[[Hot Rocks 1964\u20131971]]''. The stereo mix features a piano (played by session player [[Jack Nitzsche]], who also provides the song's iconic tambourine) and acoustic guitar that are barely audible in the original mono release (both instruments are also audible on a [[bootleg recording]] of the instrumental track). This stereo mix of \"Satisfaction\" also appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but has not yet been featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of the German and Japanese ''Hot Rocks'' CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the worldwide 2002 reissue of ''Hot Rocks'', an alternative quasi-stereo mix was used featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the center channel and the acoustic guitar and piano \"split\" left and right via a [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lukpac.org/stereostones/ |title=The Rolling Stones In Stereo |publisher=Lukpac.org |date=27 August 2002 |accessdate=27 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrics and melody==\n[[File:Satisfaction riff.png|thumb|left|450px|Guitar riff from \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"]]The song opens with the guitar riff, which is joined by the bass halfway through. It is repeated three times with the drums and acoustic guitar before the vocal enters with the line: \"I can't get no satisfaction\". The key is E major, but with the 3rd and 7th [[degree (music)|degree]] occasionally lowered, creating \u2013 in the first part of the verses (\"I can't get no ...\") \u2013 a distinctive mellow sound. The accompanying chords (i.e. E major, D major and A major) are [[Borrowed chord|borrowed]] from the E [[Mixolydian mode|mixolydian]] scale, which is often used in [[blues]] and [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nThe title line is an example of a [[Double negative|negative concord]]. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then leaps half singing and half yelling into the [[refrain|chorus]], where the guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's irritation and confusion with the increasing commercialism of the modern world, where the radio broadcasts \"useless information\" and a man on television tells him \"how white my shirts can be \u2013 but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me,\" a reference to the then ubiquitous [[Marlboro Man|Marlboro Cowboy]] style advertisement. Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity, and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not getting any \"girl reaction\" was fairly controversial in its day, interpreted by some listeners (and radio programmers) as meaning a girl willing to have sex. Jagger commented that they \"didn't understand the dirtiest line\", as afterwards the girl asks him to return the following week as she is \"on a losing streak,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835889-2,00.html|url-access=limited|title=Going to Pot|date=1 July 1966|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time)]]|publisher=Time USA|page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022141/http://time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C835889-2%2C00.html|archive-date=14 October 2007|url-status=live|access-date=18 December 2008|quote=But, gloats Jagger, \"They didn't understand the dirtiest line.\" That is the one where the girl pleads: \"Baby, better come back later next week 'cause you see I'm on a losing streak.\"}}</ref> an apparent reference to [[menstruation]].

He declared his brother-in-law Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani to be the [[Mahdi]], or redeemer, who arrives on earth several years before [[Day of Judgment#Islam|Judgement Day]]. His followers embellished the fact that Al-Qahtani's name and his father's name are identical to Prophet [[Muhammad|Mohammed]]'s name and that of his father, and developed a saying, \"His and his father's names were the same as Mohammed's and his father's, and he had come to Makkah from the north\", to justify their belief. The date of the attack, 20 November 1979, was the first day of the year 1400 according to the [[Islamic calendar]]; this ties in with the tradition of the ''[[mujaddid]]'', a person who appears at the turn of every century of the Islamic calendar to revive Islam, cleansing it of extraneous elements and restoring it to its pristine purity.<ref>Benjamin, ''The Age of Sacred Terror,'' (2002) p. 90</ref>\n\nAl-Otaybi was from one of the foremost families of Najd.

No one outside the mosque knew how many hostages remained, how many militants were in the mosque and what sort of preparations they had made.\n\nAt the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in [[Tunisia]] for a meeting of the Arab Summit.

Prince Sultan appointed [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud]], head of the [[Al Mukhabaraat Al 'Aammah]] (Saudi Intelligence), to take over the forward command post several hundred meters from the mosque, where Prince Turki would remain for the next several weeks. However, the first order of business was to seek the approval of the [[ulema]], which was led by Abdul Aziz bin Baz. Islam forbids any violence within the Grand Mosque, to the extent that plants cannot be uprooted without explicit religious sanction. Ibn Baz found himself in a delicate situation, especially as he had previously taught al-Otaybi in [[Medina]]. Regardless, the ulema issued a [[fatwa]] allowing deadly force to be used in retaking the mosque.<ref name=\"lt soft 103-4\">Wright, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), pp. 103\u2013104 \u2013 softcover</ref>\n\nWith religious approval granted, Saudi forces launched frontal assaults on three of the main gates. Again the assaulting force was repulsed as they were unable to break through the insurgents' defences. Snipers continued to pick off soldiers who revealed themselves. The insurgents aired their demands from the mosque's loudspeakers throughout the streets of Mecca, calling for the cut-off of oil exports to the United States and the expulsion of all foreign civilian and military experts from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Wright, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), p.92</ref> In [[Beirut]] an opposition organization (the [[Arab Socialist Action Party \u2013 Arabian Peninsula]]) issued a statement on 25 November, alleging to clarify the demands of the insurgents.

He declared his brother-in-law Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani to be the [[Mahdi]], or redeemer, who arrives on earth several years before [[Day of Judgment#Islam|Judgement Day]]. His followers embellished the fact that Al-Qahtani's name and his father's name are identical to Prophet [[Muhammad|Mohammed]]'s name and that of his father, and developed a saying, \"His and his father's names were the same as Mohammed's and his father's, and he had come to Makkah from the north\", to justify their belief. The date of the attack, 20 November 1979, was the first day of the year 1400 according to the [[Islamic calendar]]; this ties in with the tradition of the ''[[mujaddid]]'', a person who appears at the turn of every century of the Islamic calendar to revive Islam, cleansing it of extraneous elements and restoring it to its pristine purity.<ref>Benjamin, ''The Age of Sacred Terror,'' (2002) p. 90</ref>\n\nAl-Otaybi was from one of the foremost families of Najd. His grandfather had ridden with [[Ibn Saud]] in the early decades of the century and other of his family members were among foremost of the [[Ikhwan]].<ref name=gsec>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/mecca-mosque-1979.htm 1979 Makkah \u2013 Grand Mosque aka Holy Mosque], Global Security</ref> He was a preacher, a former corporal in the [[Saudi National Guard]] and a former student of [[Abd-al-Aziz ibn Abd-Allah ibn Baaz|Sheikh Abdel Aziz al-Baaz]] who went on to become the [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia|Grand Mufti]] of Saudi Arabia.\n\n===Goals===\n\"Al-Otaybi had turned against Bin-Baaz and began advocating a return to the original ways of Islam, among other things: a repudiation of the West; abolition of television and expulsion of non-Muslims\".<ref>Wright, ''Sacred Rage'', (2001), p. 152</ref> He proclaimed that \"the ruling Al-Saud dynasty had lost its legitimacy because it was corrupt, ostentatious and had destroyed Saudi culture by an aggressive policy of [[Westernization]]\".<ref name=gsec/> He regarded [[radio]], [[television]] and [[Women in the workforce|working women]] to be great \"evils.\"<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/30/archives/arabs-in-paris-say-1000-joined-seizure-of-mosque-radio-tv-and.html |title = Arabs in Paris Say 1,000 Joined Seizure of Mosque|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 30 November 1979}}</ref>\n\nAl-Otaybi and Qahtani had met while imprisoned together for sedition, when al-Otaybi claimed to have had a vision sent by God telling him that Qahtani was the Mahdi. Their declared goal was to institute a theocracy in preparation for the imminent apocalypse.

Al-Otaybi joined the local chapter of the [[Salafi]] group ''Al-Jamaa Al-Salafiya Al-Muhtasiba'' (The Salafi Group That Commands Right and Forbids Wrong) in Medina headed by renowned Sheikh [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]], chairman of the [[Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Issuing Fatwas]] at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Inside the Kingdom: Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VEYsi7ZmtywC|date=15 October 2009|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=9781101140734|page=9}}</ref> The followers preached their radical message in different mosques in Saudi Arabia without being arrested.<ref>Wright, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), p.88\u20139</ref> The government was reluctant to confront religious extremists.

When the government asked for a fatwa allowing armed force in the Grand Mosque, the language of bin Baz and other senior ulama \"was curiously restrained\". The scholars did not declare al-Otaibi and his followers non-Muslims, despite their violation of the sanctity of the Grand Mosque, but only termed them ''\"al-jamaah al-musallahah\"'' (the armed group). The senior scholars also insisted that before security forces attack them, the authorities must offer them the option to surrender.<ref name=lacey-30\n>{{cite book|last=Lacey|first=Robert|title=Inside the Kingdom: Kings, Clerics, Modernists, Terrorists, and the Struggle for Saudi Arabia|url=https://archive.org/details/insidekingdomkin00lace_0|url-access=registration|date=2009|publisher=Viking\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/insidekingdomkin00lace_0/page/30 30]\n|quote=Their language was curiously restrained.

They took defensive positions in the upper levels of the mosque, and sniper positions in the minarets, from which they commanded the grounds. No one outside the mosque knew how many hostages remained, how many militants were in the mosque and what sort of preparations they had made.\n\nAt the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in [[Tunisia]] for a meeting of the Arab Summit. The commander of the National Guard, Prince Abdullah, was also abroad for an official visit to Morocco. Therefore, [[King Khalid]] assigned the responsibility to the Sudairi Brothers \u2013 [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz|Prince Sultan]], then Minister of Defence, and [[Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Nayef]], then Minister of Interior, to deal with the incident.<ref name=case>{{cite journal|last=Astal|first=Kamal M.|title=Three case studies: Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Iraq|journal=Pakistan Journal of Applied Sciences|year=2002|volume=2|issue=3|pages=308\u2013319|url=http://docsdrive.com/pdfs/ansinet/jas/2002/308-319.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Siege==\n[[File:Smoke rising from the Grand Mosque, Mecca, 1979.JPG|thumb|left|Smoke rising from the Grand Mosque during the assault on the Marwa-Safa gallery, 1979.]]\n\nSoon after the rebel seizure, about 100 security officers of the Ministry of Interior attempted to retake the mosque, but were turned back with heavy casualties. The survivors were quickly joined by units of the [[Saudi Arabian Army]] and National Guard.

Prince Sultan appointed [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud]], head of the [[Al Mukhabaraat Al 'Aammah]] (Saudi Intelligence), to take over the forward command post several hundred meters from the mosque, where Prince Turki would remain for the next several weeks. However, the first order of business was to seek the approval of the [[ulema]], which was led by Abdul Aziz bin Baz. Islam forbids any violence within the Grand Mosque, to the extent that plants cannot be uprooted without explicit religious sanction. Ibn Baz found himself in a delicate situation, especially as he had previously taught al-Otaybi in [[Medina]]. Regardless, the ulema issued a [[fatwa]] allowing deadly force to be used in retaking the mosque.<ref name=\"lt soft 103-4\">Wright, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), pp. 103\u2013104 \u2013 softcover</ref>\n\nWith religious approval granted, Saudi forces launched frontal assaults on three of the main gates. Again the assaulting force was repulsed as they were unable to break through the insurgents' defences. Snipers continued to pick off soldiers who revealed themselves. The insurgents aired their demands from the mosque's loudspeakers throughout the streets of Mecca, calling for the cut-off of oil exports to the United States and the expulsion of all foreign civilian and military experts from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref>Wright, ''Looming Tower'', (2006), p.92</ref> In [[Beirut]] an opposition organization (the [[Arab Socialist Action Party \u2013 Arabian Peninsula]]) issued a statement on 25 November, alleging to clarify the demands of the insurgents.

He was one of the chief political theorists of the [[French Revolution]], and also played a prominent role in the [[French Consulate]] and [[First French Empire]].\n\nHis 1789 pamphlet ''[[What Is the Third Estate?]]'' became the manifesto of the Revolution, helping to transform the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] into the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in June 1789. He was offered a position on the [[French Directory]], but turned it down. After becoming a director in 1799, he was among the instigators of the {{lang|fr|[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]}} of [[18 Brumaire]] (9 November), which brought [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to power. He also coined the term \"''[[sociology|sociologie]]''\" in an unpublished manuscript, and made significant theoretical contributions to the nascent [[social sciences]].<ref name=Guil2006>Jean-Claude Guilhaumou (2006).

''Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines''. No.15.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nSiey\u00e8s was born on 3 May 1748 as the fifth child of Honor\u00e9 and Annabelle Siey\u00e8s in the town of [[Fr\u00e9jus]] in southern France.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 11\">Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 11</ref> His father was a local tax collector who made a humble income, and while the family had some noble blood, they were commoners.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 11\"/> His earliest education came by way of tutors and of the [[Jesuits]]. He also spent some time at the ''coll\u00e8ge'' of the ''Doctrinaires'' of [[Draguignan]].<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 11\"/> He originally wanted to join the military and become a soldier, but his frail health, combined with his parents' piety, led him instead to pursue a religious career. The vicar-general of Fr\u00e9jus offered aid to Siey\u00e8s, because he felt he was obliged to his father.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\">Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12</ref>\n\n==Education==\nSiey\u00e8s spent ten years at the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|seminary of Saint-Sulpice]] in Paris. There, he studied theology and engineering to prepare himself to enter the priesthood.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\"/> He quickly gained a reputation at the school for his aptitude and interest in the sciences, combined with his obsession over the \"new philosophic principles\" and dislike for conventional theology.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\"/> Siey\u00e8s was educated for priesthood in the Catholic Church at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]]. While there, he became influenced by the teachings of [[John Locke]], [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay|Quesnay]], [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], the [[Encyclop\u00e9die|Encyclop\u00e9distes]], and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political thinkers, all in preference to theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=57}} In 1770, he obtained his first theology diploma, ranking at the bottom of the list of passing candidates \u2013 a reflection of his antipathy toward his religious education. In 1772, he was ordained as a priest, and two years later he obtained his theology license.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr. (1994).

Durham and London: Duke University Press. p. 9.</ref>\n\n==Religious career==\n[[File:David d'Angers - Sieyes.jpg|thumb|left|150px| Bust of Siey\u00e8s by [[David d'Angers]] (1838).]]\nDespite Siey\u00e8s' embrace of Enlightenment thinking, he was ordained to the priesthood in 1773,<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\"/> but was not hired immediately. He spent time researching philosophy and developing music until about a year later in October 1774 when, as the result of demands by powerful friends, he was promised a canonry in [[Brittany]].<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13\">Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13</ref> Unfortunately for Siey\u00e8s, this canonry went into effect only when the preceding holder died. At the end of 1775, Siey\u00e8s acquired his first real position as secretary to the bishop of [[Tr\u00e9guier]] where he spent two years as deputy of the diocese. It is here that he sat in the Estates of Brittany and became disgusted with the immense power the privileged classes held.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13\"/> In 1780, the bishop of Tr\u00e9guier was transferred to the bishopric of [[Chartres]], and Siey\u00e8s accompanied him there as his [[vicar general]], eventually becoming a canon of the cathedral and [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]] of the [[Bishop of Chartres|diocese of Chartres]]. Due to the fact that the bishop of Tr\u00e9guier had high regards for Siey\u00e8s, he was able to act as a representative of his diocese in the Upper Chamber of the Clergy.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13\" /> It was during this time that Siey\u00e8s became aware of the ease with which nobles advanced in ecclesiastical offices compared to commoners. In particular, he was resentful of the privileges granted to the nobles within the Church system and thought the patronage system was a humiliation for commoners.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution The Abbe Siey\u00e8s and What is the Third Estate?'' p. 14.</ref>\n\nWhile remaining in ecclesiastical offices, Siey\u00e8s maintained a religious cynicism at odds with his position. By the time he determined to enter priesthood, Siey\u00e8s had \"freed himself from all superstitious sentiments and ideas\".<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15\">Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15</ref> Even when corresponding with his deeply religious father, Siey\u00e8s showed a severe lack of piety for the man in charge of the diocese of Chartres.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15\"/> It is theorised that Siey\u00e8s accepted a religious career not because he had any sort of strong religious inclination, but because he considered it the only means to advance his career as a political writer.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s and What is the Third Estate?'' p. 9</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==''What Is the Third Estate?''==\nIn 1788, [[Louis XVI of France]] proposed the convocation of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] of France after an interval of more than a century and a half. This proposal, and [[Jacques Necker]]'s invitation to French writers to state their views as to the organization of society by [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], enabled Siey\u00e8s to publish his celebrated January 1789 [[pamphlet]], ''Qu'est-ce que le tiers-\u00e9tat?'' (''[[What Is the Third Estate?]]'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}} He begins his answer:\n{{quote|What is the [[Estates of the realm#Third Estate|Third Estate]]? Everything. What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing. What does it desire to be? Something.}}\n\nThis phrase, which was to remain famous, is said to have been inspired by [[Nicolas Chamfort]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The pamphlet was very successful, and its author, despite his clerical vocation (which made him part of the [[Estates of the realm#First Estate|First Estate]]), was elected as the last (the twentieth) of the deputies to the Third Estate from Paris to the Estates-General.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}} He played his main role in the opening years of the Revolution, drafting the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], expanding on the theories of [[national sovereignty]], [[popular sovereignty]], and [[representative democracy|representation]] implied in his pamphlet, with a distinction between active and passive citizens that justified [[suffrage]] limited to male owners of property.\n\nSiey\u00e8s's pamphlet incited a radical reaction from its audience because it involved the \"political issues of the day and twisted them in a more revolutionary direction\".<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution: The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s and What is The Third Estate?'' p. 43.</ref> In the third chapter of the pamphlet, Siey\u00e8s proposed that the Third Estate wanted to be \"something\". But he also stated that, in allowing the privileged orders to exist, they are asking to become \"the least thing possible\". The usage of such rhetoric in his pamphlet appealed to common causes to unite the audience. At the same time it influenced them to move beyond simple demands and take a more radical position on the nature of government. In this case, the radical position taken by the Third Estate created a sense of awareness that the problems of France were not simply a matter of addressing \"royal tyranny\", but that unequal privileges under the law had divided the nation. It was from this point that the Revolution's struggle for fair distribution of power and equal rights began in earnest.\n\n===Impact on the Revolution===\nSiey\u00e8s's pamphlet played a key role in shaping the currents of revolutionary thought that propelled France towards the [[French Revolution]]. In his pamphlet, he outlined the desires and frustrations of the alienated class of people that made up the third estate. He attacked the foundations of the French [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] by arguing the nobility to be a fraudulent institution, preying on an overburdened and despondent bourgeoisie. The pamphlet voiced concerns that were to become crucial matters of debate during the convocation of the [[Estates-General of 1789]].\n\nWhereas the aristocracy defined themselves as an \u00e9lite ruling class charged with maintaining the social order in France, Siey\u00e8s saw the third estate as the primary mechanism of public service. Expression of radical thought at its best, the pamphlet placed sovereignty not in the hands of aristocrats but instead defined the nation of France by its productive orders composed of those who would generate services and produce goods for the benefit of the entire society. These included not only those involved in agricultural labor and craftsmanship, but also merchants, brokers, lawyers, financiers and others providing services. Siey\u00e8s challenged the hierarchical order of society by redefining who represented the nation. In his pamphlet, he condemns the privileged orders by saying their members were enjoying the best products of society without contributing to their production. Siey\u00e8s essentially argued that the aristocracy's privileges established it as an alien body acting outside of the nation of France, and deemed noble privilege \"treason to the commonwealth\".\n\nSiey\u00e8s's pamphlet had a significant influence on the structural concerns that arose surrounding the convocation of the Estates general. Specifically, the third estate demanded that the number of deputies for their order be equal to that of the two privileged orders combined, and most controversially \"that the States General Vote, Not by Orders, but by Heads\". The pamphlet took these issues to the masses and their partial appeasement was met with revolutionary reaction. By addressing the issues of representation directly, Siey\u00e8s inspired resentment and agitation that united the third estate against the feudalistic traditions of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. As a result, the Third Estate demanded the reorganization of the Estates General, but the two other orders proved unable or unwilling to provide a solution. Siey\u00e8s proposed that the members of the First and Second order join the Third Estate and become a united body to represent the nation as a whole. He not only suggested an invitation, however, but also stated that the Third Estate had the right to consider those who denied this invitation to be in default of their national responsibility.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr. ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution: The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s and What is the Third Estate?'' p. 16.</ref> The Third Estate adopted this measure on 5 June 1789; by doing so, they assumed the authority to represent the nation. This radical action was confirmed when they decided to change the name of the Estates General to the National Assembly, indicating that the separation of orders no longer existed.\n\n==Assemblies, Convention, and the Terror==\nAlthough not noted as a public speaker (he spoke rarely and briefly), Siey\u00e8s held major political influence, and he recommended the decision of the Estates to reunite its chamber as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], although he opposed the abolition of [[tithe]]s and the confiscation of Church lands. His opposition to the abolition of tithes discredited him in the National Assembly, and he was never able to regain his authority.<ref>John J. Meng, Review of ''Siey\u00e8s: His Life and His Nationalism'' by Glyndon G. Van Deusen, ''The Catholic Historical Review Vol. 19 No. 2'' (July 1933), p. 221. JSTOR (11, February 2010).</ref> Elected to the special committee on the [[Constitutional monarchy|constitution]], he opposed the right of \"''absolute veto''\" for the [[King of France]], which [[Honor\u00e9 Mirabeau]] unsuccessfully supported. He had considerable influence on the framing of the [[Departments of France|departmental]] system, but, after the spring of 1790, he was eclipsed by other politicians, and was elected only once to the post of fortnightly president of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\nLike all other members of the Constituent Assembly, he was excluded from the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] by the ordinance, initially proposed by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], that decreed that none of its members should be eligible for the next legislature. He reappeared in the third national Assembly, known as the [[National Convention]] of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (September 1792{{snd}}September 1795). He voted for the death of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], but not in the contemptuous terms sometimes ascribed to him.<ref>\"La Mort, sans phrases\" (\"Death, without rhetoric\") being his supposed words during the debate on Louis' fate</ref> He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the [[Girondin constitutional project]]. Menaced by the [[Reign of Terror]] and offended by its character, Siey\u00e8s even [[Abjuration|abjured his faith]] at the time of the installation of the [[Cult of Reason]]; afterwards, when asked what he had done during the Terror, he famously replied, \"{{lang|fr|J'ai v\u00e9cu}}\" (\"I lived\").{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\nUltimately, Siey\u00e8s failed to establish the kind of bourgeois revolution he had hoped for, one of representative order \"devoted to the peaceful pursuit of material comfort\".<ref>Sewell Jr., William H., p. 198</ref> His initial purpose was to instigate change in a more passive way, and to establish a constitutional monarchy. According to William Sewell, Siey\u00e8s' pamphlet set \"the tone and direction of The French Revolution \u2026 but its author could hardly control the Revolution's course over the long run\".<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution: The Abbe Sieyes and What is The Third Estate?'' p. 185.</ref> Even after 1791, when the monarchy seemed to many to be doomed, Siey\u00e8s \"continued to assert his belief in the monarchy\", which indicated he did not intend for the Revolution to take the course it did.<ref>Christopher Hibbert, ''The Days of The French Revolution'', p. 133.</ref>\nDuring the period he served in the National Assembly, Siey\u00e8s wanted to establish a constitution that would guarantee the rights of French men and would uphold equality under the law as the social goal of the Revolution; he was ultimately unable to accomplish his goal.\n\n==Directory==\nAfter the execution of Robespierre in 1794, Siey\u00e8s reemerged as an important political player during the constitutional debates that followed.<ref>Sewell Jr., William H., p. 19.</ref> In 1795, he went on a diplomatic mission to [[The Hague]], and was instrumental in drawing up a treaty between the French and [[Batavian Republic|Batavian]] republics. He resented the [[Constitution of the Year III]] enacted by the [[French Directory|Directory]], and refused to serve as a Director of the Republic. In May 1798, he went as the [[plenipotentiary]] of France to the court of Berlin, in order to try to induce [[Prussia]] to ally with France against the [[Second Coalition]]; this effort ultimately failed. His prestige grew nonetheless, and he was made Director of France in place of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]] in May 1799.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\nNevertheless, Siey\u00e8s considered ways to overthrow the Directory, and is said to have taken in view the replacement of the government with unlikely rulers such as [[Archduke Charles of Austria]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand of Brunswick]] (a major enemy of the Revolution). He attempted to undermine the constitution, and thus caused the revived [[Jacobin Club]] to be closed while making offers to [[Barthelemy Catherine Joubert|General Joubert]] for a {{lang|fr|coup d'\u00e9tat}}.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\n==Second Consul of France==\nThe death of Joubert at the [[Battle of Novi]] and the return of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] from [[History of Ottoman Egypt#French occupation|the Egypt campaign]] put an end to this project, but Siey\u00e8s regained influence by reaching a new understanding with Bonaparte. In the coup of [[18 Brumaire]], Siey\u00e8s and his allies dissolved the Directory, allowing Napoleon to seize power. Thereafter, Siey\u00e8s produced the constitution which he had long been planning, only to have it completely remodeled by Bonaparte,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}} who thereby achieved a coup within a coup \u2013 Bonaparte's [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] became the basis of the [[French Consulate]] of 1799\u20131804.\n\nThe [[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]] appointed Bonaparte, Siey\u00e8s, and [[Roger Ducos]] as \"Consuls of the French Republic\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=130}}</ref> In order to once again begin the function of government, these three men took the oath of \"Inviolable fidelity to the sovereignty of the people; to the French Republic, one and indivisible; to equality, liberty and the representative system\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Siey\u00e8s had many ideas, a lot of them were disfavored by Bonaparte and Roger-Ducos. One aspect that was agreed upon was the structure of power. A list of active citizens formed the basis of the proposed political structure. This list was to choose one-tenth of its members to form a communal list eligible for local office; from the communal list, one-tenth of its members were to form a departmental list; finally, one further list was made up from one-tenth of the members of the departmental list to create the national list.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=131}}</ref> This national list is where the highest officials of the land were to be chosen.\n\nSiey\u00e8s envisioned a {{lang|fr|Tribunat}} and a {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} to act as the shell of the national government. The {{lang|fr|Tribunat}} would present laws and discuss ratification of these laws in front of a jury.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=132}}</ref> This jury would not have any say in terms of what the laws granted consist of, but rather whether or not these laws passed. The {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} would be renewed from the national list. The main responsibility of the {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} was to choose the members of the two legislative bodies, and protect the constitution by right of absorption. By this curious provision, the {{lang|fr|College}} could forcibly elect to its ranks any individual deemed dangerous to the safety of the state, who would then be disqualified from any other office. This was a way to keep a closer eye on anyone who threatened the state.

When Napoleon briefly [[Hundred Days|returned to power]] in 1815, Siey\u00e8s was named to the Chamber of Peers. In 1816, after the [[Bourbon Restoration|Second Restoration]], Siey\u00e8s was expelled from the [[Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]] by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. He then moved to [[Brussels]], but returned to France after the [[July Revolution]] of 1830. He died in Paris in 1836 at the age of 88.\n\n==Contribution to social sciences==\nIn 1795, Siey\u00e8s became one of the first members of what would become the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the Institute of France. When the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] was reorganized in 1803, he was elected in the second class, replacing, in chair 31, [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], who had been guillotined on 12 November 1793 during the Reign of Terror. However, after the second [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] in 1815, Siey\u00e8s was expelled for his role in the execution of King Louis XVI, and was replaced by the [[G\u00e9rard de Lally-Tollendal|Marquis of Lally-Tollendal]], who was named to the Academy by a royal decree.\n\nIn 1780, Siey\u00e8s coined the term ''sociologie'' in an unpublished manuscript.<ref name=Guil2006/> The term was used again fifty years later by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] to refer to the science of society, which is known in English as sociology.<ref>''Des Manuscrits de Siey\u00e8s. 1773\u20131799'' (Volumes I and II).

Through the virtue of his own thoughts, he progressed in his ideologies from personal experiences. Starting at a young age, he began to feel repulsion towards the privileges of the nobility. He deemed this advantage gained by noble right as unfair to those of the lower class. This distaste he felt for the privileged class became evident during his time at the Estates of Brittany where he was able to observe, with dissatisfaction, domination by the nobility.\n\nAside from his opinions towards nobility, Sieyes also had a passion for music. He devoted himself assiduously to cultivating music as he had plenty of spare time.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\" /> Along with cultivating music, Sieyes also enjoyed writing reflections concerning these pieces.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15\" /> Siey\u00e8s had a collection of musical pieces he called \"{{lang|fr|la catalogue de ma petite musique}}\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=16}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Siey\u00e8s was passionate about his ideologies, he had a rather uninvolved social life. His journals and papers held much information about his studies but almost nothing pertaining to his personal life. His associates referred to him as cold and vain. In particular, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]] remarked that \"Men are in his eyes chess-pieces to be moved, they occupy his mind but say nothing to his heart.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=22}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Politics}}\n* ''[[What Is the Third Estate?]]'', a political pamphlet written by Siey\u00e8s\n* [[Les Neuf S\u0153urs]], a Parisian Masonic lodge of which Siey\u00e8s was a member\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Baczko, Bronislaw. \"the social contract of the French: Siey\u00e8s and Rousseau.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1988): S98\u2013S125.

He also spent some time at the ''coll\u00e8ge'' of the ''Doctrinaires'' of [[Draguignan]].<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 11\"/> He originally wanted to join the military and become a soldier, but his frail health, combined with his parents' piety, led him instead to pursue a religious career. The vicar-general of Fr\u00e9jus offered aid to Siey\u00e8s, because he felt he was obliged to his father.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\">Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12</ref>\n\n==Education==\nSiey\u00e8s spent ten years at the [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|seminary of Saint-Sulpice]] in Paris. There, he studied theology and engineering to prepare himself to enter the priesthood.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\"/> He quickly gained a reputation at the school for his aptitude and interest in the sciences, combined with his obsession over the \"new philosophic principles\" and dislike for conventional theology.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\"/> Siey\u00e8s was educated for priesthood in the Catholic Church at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]]. While there, he became influenced by the teachings of [[John Locke]], [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay|Quesnay]], [[Victor de Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]], [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], the [[Encyclop\u00e9die|Encyclop\u00e9distes]], and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political thinkers, all in preference to theology.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=57}} In 1770, he obtained his first theology diploma, ranking at the bottom of the list of passing candidates \u2013 a reflection of his antipathy toward his religious education. In 1772, he was ordained as a priest, and two years later he obtained his theology license.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr. (1994).

He spent time researching philosophy and developing music until about a year later in October 1774 when, as the result of demands by powerful friends, he was promised a canonry in [[Brittany]].<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13\">Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13</ref> Unfortunately for Siey\u00e8s, this canonry went into effect only when the preceding holder died. At the end of 1775, Siey\u00e8s acquired his first real position as secretary to the bishop of [[Tr\u00e9guier]] where he spent two years as deputy of the diocese. It is here that he sat in the Estates of Brittany and became disgusted with the immense power the privileged classes held.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13\"/> In 1780, the bishop of Tr\u00e9guier was transferred to the bishopric of [[Chartres]], and Siey\u00e8s accompanied him there as his [[vicar general]], eventually becoming a canon of the cathedral and [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|chancellor]] of the [[Bishop of Chartres|diocese of Chartres]]. Due to the fact that the bishop of Tr\u00e9guier had high regards for Siey\u00e8s, he was able to act as a representative of his diocese in the Upper Chamber of the Clergy.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 13\" /> It was during this time that Siey\u00e8s became aware of the ease with which nobles advanced in ecclesiastical offices compared to commoners. In particular, he was resentful of the privileges granted to the nobles within the Church system and thought the patronage system was a humiliation for commoners.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution The Abbe Siey\u00e8s and What is the Third Estate?'' p. 14.</ref>\n\nWhile remaining in ecclesiastical offices, Siey\u00e8s maintained a religious cynicism at odds with his position. By the time he determined to enter priesthood, Siey\u00e8s had \"freed himself from all superstitious sentiments and ideas\".<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15\">Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15</ref> Even when corresponding with his deeply religious father, Siey\u00e8s showed a severe lack of piety for the man in charge of the diocese of Chartres.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15\"/> It is theorised that Siey\u00e8s accepted a religious career not because he had any sort of strong religious inclination, but because he considered it the only means to advance his career as a political writer.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s and What is the Third Estate?'' p. 9</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==''What Is the Third Estate?''==\nIn 1788, [[Louis XVI of France]] proposed the convocation of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] of France after an interval of more than a century and a half. This proposal, and [[Jacques Necker]]'s invitation to French writers to state their views as to the organization of society by [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], enabled Siey\u00e8s to publish his celebrated January 1789 [[pamphlet]], ''Qu'est-ce que le tiers-\u00e9tat?'' (''[[What Is the Third Estate?]]'').{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}} He begins his answer:\n{{quote|What is the [[Estates of the realm#Third Estate|Third Estate]]? Everything. What has it been hitherto in the political order? Nothing. What does it desire to be? Something.}}\n\nThis phrase, which was to remain famous, is said to have been inspired by [[Nicolas Chamfort]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The pamphlet was very successful, and its author, despite his clerical vocation (which made him part of the [[Estates of the realm#First Estate|First Estate]]), was elected as the last (the twentieth) of the deputies to the Third Estate from Paris to the Estates-General.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}} He played his main role in the opening years of the Revolution, drafting the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], expanding on the theories of [[national sovereignty]], [[popular sovereignty]], and [[representative democracy|representation]] implied in his pamphlet, with a distinction between active and passive citizens that justified [[suffrage]] limited to male owners of property.\n\nSiey\u00e8s's pamphlet incited a radical reaction from its audience because it involved the \"political issues of the day and twisted them in a more revolutionary direction\".<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution: The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s and What is The Third Estate?'' p. 43.</ref> In the third chapter of the pamphlet, Siey\u00e8s proposed that the Third Estate wanted to be \"something\". But he also stated that, in allowing the privileged orders to exist, they are asking to become \"the least thing possible\". The usage of such rhetoric in his pamphlet appealed to common causes to unite the audience. At the same time it influenced them to move beyond simple demands and take a more radical position on the nature of government. In this case, the radical position taken by the Third Estate created a sense of awareness that the problems of France were not simply a matter of addressing \"royal tyranny\", but that unequal privileges under the law had divided the nation. It was from this point that the Revolution's struggle for fair distribution of power and equal rights began in earnest.\n\n===Impact on the Revolution===\nSiey\u00e8s's pamphlet played a key role in shaping the currents of revolutionary thought that propelled France towards the [[French Revolution]]. In his pamphlet, he outlined the desires and frustrations of the alienated class of people that made up the third estate. He attacked the foundations of the French [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] by arguing the nobility to be a fraudulent institution, preying on an overburdened and despondent bourgeoisie. The pamphlet voiced concerns that were to become crucial matters of debate during the convocation of the [[Estates-General of 1789]].\n\nWhereas the aristocracy defined themselves as an \u00e9lite ruling class charged with maintaining the social order in France, Siey\u00e8s saw the third estate as the primary mechanism of public service. Expression of radical thought at its best, the pamphlet placed sovereignty not in the hands of aristocrats but instead defined the nation of France by its productive orders composed of those who would generate services and produce goods for the benefit of the entire society. These included not only those involved in agricultural labor and craftsmanship, but also merchants, brokers, lawyers, financiers and others providing services. Siey\u00e8s challenged the hierarchical order of society by redefining who represented the nation. In his pamphlet, he condemns the privileged orders by saying their members were enjoying the best products of society without contributing to their production. Siey\u00e8s essentially argued that the aristocracy's privileges established it as an alien body acting outside of the nation of France, and deemed noble privilege \"treason to the commonwealth\".\n\nSiey\u00e8s's pamphlet had a significant influence on the structural concerns that arose surrounding the convocation of the Estates general. Specifically, the third estate demanded that the number of deputies for their order be equal to that of the two privileged orders combined, and most controversially \"that the States General Vote, Not by Orders, but by Heads\". The pamphlet took these issues to the masses and their partial appeasement was met with revolutionary reaction. By addressing the issues of representation directly, Siey\u00e8s inspired resentment and agitation that united the third estate against the feudalistic traditions of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. As a result, the Third Estate demanded the reorganization of the Estates General, but the two other orders proved unable or unwilling to provide a solution. Siey\u00e8s proposed that the members of the First and Second order join the Third Estate and become a united body to represent the nation as a whole. He not only suggested an invitation, however, but also stated that the Third Estate had the right to consider those who denied this invitation to be in default of their national responsibility.<ref>William H. Sewell Jr. ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution: The Abb\u00e9 Siey\u00e8s and What is the Third Estate?'' p. 16.</ref> The Third Estate adopted this measure on 5 June 1789; by doing so, they assumed the authority to represent the nation. This radical action was confirmed when they decided to change the name of the Estates General to the National Assembly, indicating that the separation of orders no longer existed.\n\n==Assemblies, Convention, and the Terror==\nAlthough not noted as a public speaker (he spoke rarely and briefly), Siey\u00e8s held major political influence, and he recommended the decision of the Estates to reunite its chamber as the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], although he opposed the abolition of [[tithe]]s and the confiscation of Church lands. His opposition to the abolition of tithes discredited him in the National Assembly, and he was never able to regain his authority.<ref>John J. Meng, Review of ''Siey\u00e8s: His Life and His Nationalism'' by Glyndon G. Van Deusen, ''The Catholic Historical Review Vol. 19 No. 2'' (July 1933), p. 221. JSTOR (11, February 2010).</ref> Elected to the special committee on the [[Constitutional monarchy|constitution]], he opposed the right of \"''absolute veto''\" for the [[King of France]], which [[Honor\u00e9 Mirabeau]] unsuccessfully supported. He had considerable influence on the framing of the [[Departments of France|departmental]] system, but, after the spring of 1790, he was eclipsed by other politicians, and was elected only once to the post of fortnightly president of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\nLike all other members of the Constituent Assembly, he was excluded from the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] by the ordinance, initially proposed by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], that decreed that none of its members should be eligible for the next legislature. He reappeared in the third national Assembly, known as the [[National Convention]] of the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (September 1792{{snd}}September 1795). He voted for the death of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], but not in the contemptuous terms sometimes ascribed to him.<ref>\"La Mort, sans phrases\" (\"Death, without rhetoric\") being his supposed words during the debate on Louis' fate</ref> He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the [[Girondin constitutional project]]. Menaced by the [[Reign of Terror]] and offended by its character, Siey\u00e8s even [[Abjuration|abjured his faith]] at the time of the installation of the [[Cult of Reason]]; afterwards, when asked what he had done during the Terror, he famously replied, \"{{lang|fr|J'ai v\u00e9cu}}\" (\"I lived\").{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\nUltimately, Siey\u00e8s failed to establish the kind of bourgeois revolution he had hoped for, one of representative order \"devoted to the peaceful pursuit of material comfort\".<ref>Sewell Jr., William H., p. 198</ref> His initial purpose was to instigate change in a more passive way, and to establish a constitutional monarchy. According to William Sewell, Siey\u00e8s' pamphlet set \"the tone and direction of The French Revolution \u2026 but its author could hardly control the Revolution's course over the long run\".<ref>William H. Sewell Jr., ''A Rhetoric of Bourgeois Revolution: The Abbe Sieyes and What is The Third Estate?'' p. 185.</ref> Even after 1791, when the monarchy seemed to many to be doomed, Siey\u00e8s \"continued to assert his belief in the monarchy\", which indicated he did not intend for the Revolution to take the course it did.<ref>Christopher Hibbert, ''The Days of The French Revolution'', p. 133.</ref>\nDuring the period he served in the National Assembly, Siey\u00e8s wanted to establish a constitution that would guarantee the rights of French men and would uphold equality under the law as the social goal of the Revolution; he was ultimately unable to accomplish his goal.\n\n==Directory==\nAfter the execution of Robespierre in 1794, Siey\u00e8s reemerged as an important political player during the constitutional debates that followed.<ref>Sewell Jr., William H., p. 19.</ref> In 1795, he went on a diplomatic mission to [[The Hague]], and was instrumental in drawing up a treaty between the French and [[Batavian Republic|Batavian]] republics. He resented the [[Constitution of the Year III]] enacted by the [[French Directory|Directory]], and refused to serve as a Director of the Republic. In May 1798, he went as the [[plenipotentiary]] of France to the court of Berlin, in order to try to induce [[Prussia]] to ally with France against the [[Second Coalition]]; this effort ultimately failed. His prestige grew nonetheless, and he was made Director of France in place of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rewbell]] in May 1799.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\nNevertheless, Siey\u00e8s considered ways to overthrow the Directory, and is said to have taken in view the replacement of the government with unlikely rulers such as [[Archduke Charles of Austria]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand of Brunswick]] (a major enemy of the Revolution). He attempted to undermine the constitution, and thus caused the revived [[Jacobin Club]] to be closed while making offers to [[Barthelemy Catherine Joubert|General Joubert]] for a {{lang|fr|coup d'\u00e9tat}}.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}}\n\n==Second Consul of France==\nThe death of Joubert at the [[Battle of Novi]] and the return of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] from [[History of Ottoman Egypt#French occupation|the Egypt campaign]] put an end to this project, but Siey\u00e8s regained influence by reaching a new understanding with Bonaparte. In the coup of [[18 Brumaire]], Siey\u00e8s and his allies dissolved the Directory, allowing Napoleon to seize power. Thereafter, Siey\u00e8s produced the constitution which he had long been planning, only to have it completely remodeled by Bonaparte,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=58}} who thereby achieved a coup within a coup \u2013 Bonaparte's [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] became the basis of the [[French Consulate]] of 1799\u20131804.\n\nThe [[Corps l\u00e9gislatif]] appointed Bonaparte, Siey\u00e8s, and [[Roger Ducos]] as \"Consuls of the French Republic\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=130}}</ref> In order to once again begin the function of government, these three men took the oath of \"Inviolable fidelity to the sovereignty of the people; to the French Republic, one and indivisible; to equality, liberty and the representative system\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Although Siey\u00e8s had many ideas, a lot of them were disfavored by Bonaparte and Roger-Ducos. One aspect that was agreed upon was the structure of power. A list of active citizens formed the basis of the proposed political structure. This list was to choose one-tenth of its members to form a communal list eligible for local office; from the communal list, one-tenth of its members were to form a departmental list; finally, one further list was made up from one-tenth of the members of the departmental list to create the national list.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=131}}</ref> This national list is where the highest officials of the land were to be chosen.\n\nSiey\u00e8s envisioned a {{lang|fr|Tribunat}} and a {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} to act as the shell of the national government. The {{lang|fr|Tribunat}} would present laws and discuss ratification of these laws in front of a jury.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=132}}</ref> This jury would not have any say in terms of what the laws granted consist of, but rather whether or not these laws passed. The {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} would be renewed from the national list. The main responsibility of the {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} was to choose the members of the two legislative bodies, and protect the constitution by right of absorption. By this curious provision, the {{lang|fr|College}} could forcibly elect to its ranks any individual deemed dangerous to the safety of the state, who would then be disqualified from any other office. This was a way to keep a closer eye on anyone who threatened the state. The power of the {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} was extended to electing the titular head of government, the {{lang|fr|Grand-Electeur}}. The {{lang|fr|Grand-Electeur}} would hold office for life but have no power. If the {{lang|fr|Grand-Electeur}} threatened to become dangerous, the {{lang|fr|College des Conservateurs}} would absorb him.<ref name=\":1\" /> The central idea of Siey\u00e8s' plan was a division of power.\n\n==Napoleonic era and final years==\nSiey\u00e8s soon retired from the post of provisional Consul, which he had accepted after 18 Brumaire, and became one of the first members of the [[S\u00e9nat conservateur]] (acting as its president in 1799); this concession was attributed to the large [[Estate (land)|estate]] at [[Crosne, Essonne|Crosne]] that he received from Napoleon.<ref>Crosne, [[Essonne]], had belonged to the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]], with a {{lang|fr|seigneurie}} that descended in the family of Brancas; both came to the French state with the Revolution.</ref> After the [[plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise]] in late December 1800, Siey\u00e8s defended the arbitrary and illegal proceedings whereby Napoleon ridded himself of the leading Jacobins.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nDuring the era of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] (1804\u20131814), Siey\u00e8s rarely emerged from his retirement. When Napoleon briefly [[Hundred Days|returned to power]] in 1815, Siey\u00e8s was named to the Chamber of Peers. In 1816, after the [[Bourbon Restoration|Second Restoration]], Siey\u00e8s was expelled from the [[Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]] by [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]]. He then moved to [[Brussels]], but returned to France after the [[July Revolution]] of 1830. He died in Paris in 1836 at the age of 88.\n\n==Contribution to social sciences==\nIn 1795, Siey\u00e8s became one of the first members of what would become the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the Institute of France. When the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] was reorganized in 1803, he was elected in the second class, replacing, in chair 31, [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], who had been guillotined on 12 November 1793 during the Reign of Terror. However, after the second [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] in 1815, Siey\u00e8s was expelled for his role in the execution of King Louis XVI, and was replaced by the [[G\u00e9rard de Lally-Tollendal|Marquis of Lally-Tollendal]], who was named to the Academy by a royal decree.\n\nIn 1780, Siey\u00e8s coined the term ''sociologie'' in an unpublished manuscript.<ref name=Guil2006/> The term was used again fifty years later by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] to refer to the science of society, which is known in English as sociology.<ref>''Des Manuscrits de Siey\u00e8s. 1773\u20131799'' (Volumes I and II).

Paris: Champion (1999, 2007).</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nSiey\u00e8s was always considered intellectual and intelligent by his peers and mentors alike. Through the virtue of his own thoughts, he progressed in his ideologies from personal experiences. Starting at a young age, he began to feel repulsion towards the privileges of the nobility. He deemed this advantage gained by noble right as unfair to those of the lower class. This distaste he felt for the privileged class became evident during his time at the Estates of Brittany where he was able to observe, with dissatisfaction, domination by the nobility.\n\nAside from his opinions towards nobility, Sieyes also had a passion for music. He devoted himself assiduously to cultivating music as he had plenty of spare time.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 12\" /> Along with cultivating music, Sieyes also enjoyed writing reflections concerning these pieces.<ref name=\"Van Deusen, Glyndon G., p. 15\" /> Siey\u00e8s had a collection of musical pieces he called \"{{lang|fr|la catalogue de ma petite musique}}\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=16}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Siey\u00e8s was passionate about his ideologies, he had a rather uninvolved social life. His journals and papers held much information about his studies but almost nothing pertaining to his personal life. His associates referred to him as cold and vain. In particular, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]] remarked that \"Men are in his eyes chess-pieces to be moved, they occupy his mind but say nothing to his heart.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Siey\u00e8s: His Life And His Nationalism|last=Van Deusen|first=Glyndon|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-404-51362-X|location=|pages=22}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Politics}}\n* ''[[What Is the Third Estate?]]'', a political pamphlet written by Siey\u00e8s\n* [[Les Neuf S\u0153urs]], a Parisian Masonic lodge of which Siey\u00e8s was a member\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Baczko, Bronislaw. \"the social contract of the French: Siey\u00e8s and Rousseau.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' (1988): S98\u2013S125.

[[Satanism|Satanist]] [[Anton LaVey]] is credited as the film's technical advisor and appeared in the film playing a minor role.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[curse]] affects the Preston family, caused by their betrayal of the Satanic priest Jonathan Corbis ([[Ernest Borgnine]]). Corbis has harassed the Preston family for generations to obtain a Satanic book of great power. Corbis captures patriarch Steve Preston (George Sawaya), who is allowed to escape to warn his wife Emma ([[Ida Lupino]]) and younger son Mark ([[William Shatner]]) about Corbis' wrath. He tells them to give the book to Corbis, but during a rainstorm he melts into a waxy substance.\n\nMark takes the book, hoping to meet with Corbis and defeat him. In a [[ghost town]] in the desert, Corbis gives Mark a drink of water from an old hand-pumped well. Mark drinks but then spits out the bitter water. He challenges Corbis to a battle of faith, then draws a pistol and aims it at him. Corbis belittles this threat and Mark tries to escape, but he is surrounded by Corbis' followers. He produces a cross, but Corbis transforms it into a snake and Mark discards it. Corbis' followers capture Preston, and Corbis uses a ritual to erase Mark\u2019s memory in preparation for a ceremony later that evening.\n\nMark's older brother, Tom ([[Tom Skerritt]]), and his wife, Julie, search for Mark. They are accompanied by Dr. Sam Richards ([[Eddie Albert]]), a psychic researcher. Their search leads them to Corbis' church, where Corbis is performing a ceremony to convert Mark into one of his soulless minions; during the proceedings Corbis transforms into a Satanic goat-like demon. Tom witnesses all of this; he is discovered by the Satanists but eludes capture. Later he and Richards meet at the Satanic church, where they discover that the source of Corbis' power is an ornate glass bottle known as \"The Devil's Rain\", which contains the souls of Corbis' disciples.\n\nCorbis and the Satanists converge on the church. Richards threatens to destroy The Devil's Rain, but he is overpowered by the acolytes. He appeals to Mark's lost humanity and convinces him to destroy the bottle, which he does in defiance of Corbis' entreaties. A storm rages outside, and the Satanists melt in the rain. Tom and his wife make a hasty exit. As Tom holds his wife, it is revealed that he is actually embracing Corbis, and his wife's soul has become trapped within a new Devil's Rain.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Jonathan Corbis\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Dr. Sam Richards\n* [[William Shatner]] as Mark Preston\n* [[Ida Lupino]] as Emma Preston\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Tom Preston\n* [[Joan Prather]] as Julie Preston\n* [[Keenan Wynn]] as Sheriff Owens\n* [[John Travolta]] as Danny\n* George Sawaya as Steve Preston\n* [[Anton LaVey]] as High Priest of the Church of Satan\n* [[Woodrow Chambliss]] as John\n\n==Release==\n''The Devil's Rain'' was released in 1975, with screenings in New York on August 7 and Los Angeles on August 13, 1975.<ref name=\"afi\" />\n\n==Response==\n''The Devil's Rain'' received a uniformly negative critical response, with the chief complaint being the incoherent storyline.

He served as [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1932 and as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] from 1933 to 1934.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family of [[Westphalia]]n [[Roman Catholic]] aristocrats, Papen served in the [[Imperial German Army]] from 1898 onward and was trained as a [[German General Staff]] officer. He served as military attach\u00e9 in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] from 1913 to 1915, organising acts of sabotage in the United States and financing Mexican forces in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. After being expelled from the United States in 1915, he served as a battalion commander on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of [[World War I]] and finished his war service in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] as a lieutenant colonel.\n\nAppointed Chancellor in 1932 by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], Papen ruled by [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|presidential decree]]. He negotiated the end of reparations at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932]]. He launched the ''[[Preu\u00dfenschlag]]'' coup against the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] government of the [[Free State of Prussia]]. His failure to secure a base of support in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|''Reichstag'']] led to his dismissal by Hindenburg and replacement by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]]. Determined to return to power, Papen, believing that Hitler could be controlled once he was in the government, persuaded Hindenburg into appointing Hitler as Chancellor and Papen as Vice-Chancellor in 1933 in a cabinet ostensibly not under [[Nazi Party]] domination. With military dictatorship the only alternative to Nazi rule, Hindenburg consented. Papen and his allies were quickly marginalized by Hitler and he left the government after the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, during which the Nazis killed some of his confidants. Subsequently, Papen served as an ambassador of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in [[Vienna]] from 1934 to 1938 and in [[Ankara]] from 1939 to 1944.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], Papen was indicted in the [[Nuremberg trials]] of war criminals before the International Military Tribunal but was acquitted of all charges. In 1947 a West German [[denazification]] court found Papen to have acted as a main culprit to crimes. Papen was given an eight-year hard labour prison sentence but he was released on appeal in 1949. Papen's memoirs were published in 1952 and 1953, and he died in 1969.\n\n==Early life and education==\nPapen was born into a wealthy and noble Roman Catholic family in [[Werl]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]], the third child of Friedrich von Papen-K\u00f6ningen (1839\u20131906) and his wife Anna Laura von Steffens (1852\u20131939){{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=4}}\n \nPapen was sent to a cadet school in [[Bergisch Gladbach|Bensberg]] of his own volition at the age of 11 in 1891. His four years there were followed by three years of training at Prussian Main Military academy in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]]. He was trained as a ''Herrenreiter'' (\"gentleman rider\").{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=4}} He served for a period as a military attendant in the [[Kaiser]]'s Palace and as a second lieutenant in his father's old unit, the Westphalian [[Uhlan]] Regiment No. 5 in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. Papen joined the [[German General Staff]] as a captain in March 1913.\n\nHe married Martha von Boch-Galhau (1880\u20131961) on 3 May 1905. Papen's wife was the daughter of a wealthy Saarland industrialist whose dowry made him a very rich man.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}} An excellent horseman and a man of much charm, Papen cut a dashing figure and during this time, befriended [[Kurt von Schleicher]].{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}} Papen was proud of his family's having been granted hereditary rights since 1298 to mine brine salt at [[Werl]]. He always believed in the superiority of the aristocracy over commoners.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=2}} Fluent in both French and English, he travelled widely all over Europe, the Middle East and North America.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}} He was devoted to Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=5}} Influenced by the books of General [[Friedrich von Bernhardi]], Papen was a [[militarist]] throughout his life.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=5}}\n\n==Military attach\u00e9 in Washington, DC==\nHe entered the diplomatic service in December 1913 as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to the German ambassador in the United States. In early 1914 he travelled to [[Mexico]] (to which he was also accredited) and observed the [[Mexican Revolution]]. At one time, when the anti-Huerta Zapatistas were advancing on Mexico City, Papen organised a group of European volunteers to fight for Mexican General [[Victoriano Huerta]].{{sfn|Bisher|2016|pp=33\u201334, 71}} In the spring of 1914, as German military attach\u00e9 to Mexico, Papen was deeply involved in selling arms to the government of General Huerta, believing he could place Mexico in the German sphere of influence, though the collapse of Huerta's regime in July 1914 ended that hope.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=172}} In April 1914, Papen personally observed the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] when the US seized the city of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], despite orders from Berlin to stay in Mexico City.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=8}} During his time in Mexico, Papen acquired the love of international intrigue and adventure that characterised his later diplomatic postings in the United States, Austria and Turkey.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=8}} On 30 July 1914, Papen arrived in [[Washington, DC]] from Mexico to take up his post as German military attach\u00e9 to the United States.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=26}}\n\n[[File:Franz von Papen circa 1915 in helmet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Von Papen as the German Military Attach\u00e9 for Washington, DC in 1915]]\n\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], he tried to buy weapons in the United States for his country, but the UK's blockade made shipping arms to Germany almost impossible.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=11}} On 22 August 1914, Papen hired US private detective Paul Koeing, based in [[New York City]], to conduct a sabotage and bombing campaign against businesses in New York owned by citizens from the Allied nations.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=33}} Papen, who was given an unlimited fund of cash to draw on by Berlin, attempted to block the UK, French and Russian governments from buying war supplies in the United States.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=11}} Papen set up a front company that tried to [[Preclusive purchasing|preclusively purchase]] every hydraulic press in the US for the next two years to limit artillery shell production by US firms with contracts with the Allies.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=11}} To enable German citizens living in the Americas to go home to Germany, Papen set up an operation in New York to forge US passports.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=33}}\n\nStarting in September 1914, Papen abused his [[diplomatic immunity]] as German military attach\u00e9 and US neutrality to start organising plans for an invasion of [[Canada]], as well as a campaign of sabotage against canals, bridges and railroads.{{sfn|McMaster|1918|pp=258\u2013261}} In October 1914, Papen became involved in the [[Hindu\u2013German Conspiracy]], when he contacted anti-UK Indian nationalists living in California, and arranged for weapons to be handed over to them.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|pp=33\u201334}} In February 1915, he organised the [[Vanceboro international bridge bombing]], while his diplomatic immunity protected him from arrest.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=34}} At the same time, he was involved in plans to restore Huerta to power, arranging for the arming and financing of the planned invasion of Mexico.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=43}}\n\nPapen's activities were known to UK intelligence, which shared its information with the US government.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 584.</ref> As a result he was expelled from the [[United States]] for complicity in the planning of acts of [[sabotage]].{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=164}} On 28 December 1915, he was declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' after his exposure and was recalled to Germany.<ref name=\"current\">''Current Biography 1941'', pp. 651\u2013653.</ref> Upon his return, he was given the [[Iron Cross]].\n\nPapen remained involved in plots in the Americas as he contacted in February 1916 the Mexican Colonel Gonzalo Enrile, living in Cuba, in an attempt to arrange German support for [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]], the would-be strongman of Mexico.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=71}} Papen also served as an intermediary between the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the German government regarding the purchase and delivery of arms to be used against the UK during the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, as well as serving as an intermediary with [[Ghadar party|Indian nationalists]]. In April 1916, a US federal [[grand jury]] issued an indictment against Papen for a plot to blow up Canada's [[Welland Canal]]; he remained under indictment until he became Chancellor of Germany, at which time the charges were dropped.<ref name=\"current\"/>\n\n==Army service in World War I==\nAs a Roman Catholic, Papen belonged to the ''Zentrum'', the right of the center party that almost all German Catholics supported, but during the course of the war, the nationalist conservative Papen became estranged from his party.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=194}} Papen disapproved of [[Matthias Erzberger]], whose efforts to pull the ''Zentrum'' to the left, he was opposed to and regarded the [[Reichstag Peace Resolution]] of 19 July 1917 as almost treason.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=194}}\n\nLater in World War I, Papen returned to the army on active service, first on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1916 Papen took command of the 2nd Reserve Battalion of the 93rd Regiment of the [[4th Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|4th Guards Infantry Division]] fighting in [[Flanders]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=25}} On 22 August 1916 Papen's battalion took heavy losses while successfully resisting a UK attack during the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=25\u201326}} Between November 1916\u2013February 1917, Papen's battalion was engaged in almost continuous heavy fighting.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}} He was awarded the [[Iron Cross First Class|Iron Cross, 1st Class]]. On 11 April 1917, Papen fought at [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]], where his battalion was defeated with heavy losses by the [[Canadian Corps]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}}\n\nAfter Vimy, Papen asked for a transfer to the Middle East, which was approved.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}} From June 1917 Papen served as an officer on the General Staff in the Middle East, and then as an officer attached to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}} During his time in the Ottoman Empire, Papen was in \"the know\" about the Armenian genocide, which did not appear to have morally troubled him at all either at the time or later in his life.<ref>Ihrig, Stefan ''Justifying Genocide: Germany and the Armenians from Bismark to Hitler'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2016 page 352.</ref> During his time in Constantinople, Papen befriended [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. Between October\u2013December 1917, Papen took part in the heavy fighting in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=27}} Promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant-colonel]], he returned to Germany and left the army soon after the armistice which halted the fighting in November 1918.\n\nAfter the Turks signed an armistice with the Allies on 30 October 1918, the German [[Asia Corps]] was ordered home, and Papen was in the mountains at Karapunar when he heard on 11 November 1918 that the war was over.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=27}} The new republic ordered soldier's councils to be organised in the German Army, including the Asian corps, which General [[Otto Liman von Sanders]] attempted to obey, and which Papen refused to obey.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=28}} Sanders ordered Papen arrested for his insubordination, which caused Papen to leave his post without permission as he fled to Germany in civilian clothing to personally meet Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]], who had the charges dropped.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=29}}\n\n==Catholic politician==\nAfter leaving the German Army in the spring of 1919, Papen purchased a country estate, the ''Haus Merfeld'', living the life of a \"gentleman farmer\" in [[D\u00fclmen]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=31}} In April 1920, during the [[Ruhr uprising|Communist uprising in the Ruhr]], Papen took command of a ''[[Freikorps]]'' unit to protect Roman Catholicism from the [[Ruhr Red Army|\"Red marauders\"]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=34}} Impressed with his leadership of his ''Freikorps'' unit, Papen decided to pursue a career in politics.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=35}} In the fall of 1920, the president of the Westphalian Farmer's Association, Baron Engelbert von Kerkerinck zur Borg, told Papen his association would campaign for him if he ran for the Prussian ''[[Landtag]]''.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=39}}\n\nPapen entered politics and joined the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], better known as the ''Zentrum''. The [[monarchism|monarchist]] Papen formed part of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] wing of the party that rejected democracy and the [[Weimar Coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Papen's politics were much closer to the [[German National People's Party]]  than to the ''Zentrum'', and he seems to have belonged to the ''Zentrum'' on the account of his Roman Catholicism and a hope that he could shift his party to the right.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}}{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=197}} Papen was a figure of influence in the ''Zentrum'' by the virtue of being the largest shareholder and chief of the editorial board in the party's Catholic newspaper ''Germania'', which was the most prestigious of the Catholic papers in Germany.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=247}}{{sfn|Longerich|2019|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\nPapen was a member of the [[Landtag of Prussia]] from 1921 to 1928 and from 1930 to 1932, representing a rural, Catholic constituency in Westphalia.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=40}} Papen rarely attended the sessions of the Landtag and never spoke at the meetings during his time as a Landtag deputy.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=8}} Papen tried to have his name entered into the ''Zentrum'' party list for the Reichstag elections of May 1924, but was blocked by the ''Zentrum's'' leadership.{{sfn|Jones|2005|pp=194\u2013195}} In February 1925, Papen was one of the six ''Zentrum'' deputies in the Landtag who voted with the German National People's Party and the [[German People's Party]] against the SPD-''Zentrum'' government.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=197}} Papen was nearly expelled from the ''Zentrum'' for breaking with party discipline in the Landtag.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=197}} In the 1925 presidential elections, he surprised his party by supporting the right-wing candidate [[Paul von Hindenburg]] over [[Wilhelm Marx]]. Papen, along with two of his future cabinet ministers, was a member of [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]'s exclusive Berlin ''Deutscher Herrenklub'' (German Gentlemen's Club).{{sfn|Longerich|2019|p=247}}{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=41}}\n\nIn March 1930, Papen welcomed the coming of [[Paul von Hindenburg#Presidential governments|presidential government]].{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=205}} As the presidential government of chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] depended upon the Social Democrats in the ''Reichstag'' to \"tolerate\" it by not voting to cancel laws passed under [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]], Papen grew more critical.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=205}} In a speech before a group of farmers in October 1931, Papen called for Br\u00fcning to disallow the SPD and base his presidential government on \"tolerance\" from the [[NSDAP]] instead.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=206}} Papen demanded that Br\u00fcning transform the \"concealed dictatorship\" of a presidential government into a dictatorship that would unite all of the German right under its banner.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=206}} In the March\u2013April [[1932 German presidential election]], Papen voted for Hindenburg on the grounds he was the best man to unite the right, while in the Prussian Landtag's election of speaker of the Landtag, Papen voted for the Nazi [[Hans Kerrl]].{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=206}}\n\n==Chancellorship==\n[[File:PapenSchleicher0001.jpg|thumb|Chancellor Papen (left) with his eventual successor, Minister of Defence [[Kurt von Schleicher]], watching a horse race in Berlin-[[Karlshorst]].]]\nOn 1 June 1932, Papen was suddenly lifted to supreme importance when president Hindenburg appointed him [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]. Papen owed his appointment to the Chancellorship to General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], an old friend from the pre-war General Staff and influential advisor of President Hindenburg.

''The Gathering Storm'', p. 132.</ref> On 28 August 1935, Papen negotiated a deal under which the German press would cease its attacks on the Austrian government, in return for which the Austrian press would cease its attacks on Germany's.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=236}} Papen played a major role in negotiating the 1936 Austro-German agreement under which Austria declared itself a \"German state\" whose foreign policy would always be aligned with Berlin's and allowed for members of the \"national opposition\" to enter the Austrian cabinet in exchange for which the Austrian Nazis abandoned their terrorist campaign against the government.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=330\u2013331}}{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=376}} The treaty Papen signed in Vienna on 11 July 1936 promised that Germany would not seek to annexe Austria and largely placed Austria in the German sphere of influence, greatly reducing Italian influence on Austria.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=270}} In July 1936, Papen reported to Hitler that the Austro-German treaty he had just signed was the \"decisive step\" towards ending Austrian independence, and it was only a matter of time before the ''Anschluss'' took place.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=331}}\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1937, Papen pressured the Austrians to include more Nazis in the government.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=279}} In September 1937, Papen returned to Berlin when [[Benito Mussolini]] visited Germany, serving as Hitler's adviser on Italo-German talks about Austria.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=281}} Though Papen was dismissed from his mission in Austria on 4 February 1938, Hitler drafted him to arrange a meeting between the German dictator and Schuschnigg at [[Berchtesgaden]].{{sfn|Hildebrand|1986|p=29}} The ultimatum that Hitler presented to Schuschnigg at the meeting on 12 February 1938 led to the Austrian government's capitulation to German threats and pressure, and paved the way for the ''Anschluss''.\n\n==Ambassador to Turkey==\nPapen later served the German government as [[Germany\u2013Turkey relations|Ambassador to Turkey]] from 1939 to 1944. In April 1938, after the retirement of the previous ambassador, [[Friedrich von Keller (diplomat)|Frederich von Keller]] on his 65th birthday, the German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] attempted to appoint Papen as ambassador in Ankara, but the appointment was vetoed by the Turkish president [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] who remembered Papen well with considerable distaste when he had served alongside him in World War I.{{sfn|Watt|1989|pp=279\u2013280}} In November 1938 and in February 1939, the new Turkish president General [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] again vetoed Ribbentrop's attempts to have Papen appointed as German ambassador to Turkey.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=280}} In April 1939, Turkey accepted Papen as ambassador.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=280}} Papen was keen to return to Turkey, where he had served during World War I.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=591}}\n\nPapen arrived in Turkey on 27 April 1939, just after the signing of a UK-Turkish declaration of friendship.{{sfn|Watt|1989|pp=280\u2013281}} \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc wanted Turkey to join the UK-inspired \"peace front\" that was meant to stop Germany.{{sfn|Watt|1989|pp=281\u2013282}} On 24 June 1939, France and Turkey signed a declaration committing them to upholding collective security in the Balkans.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=305}} On 21 August 1939, Papen presented Turkey with a diplomatic note threatening economic sanctions and the cancellation of all arms contacts if Turkey did not cease leaning towards joining the UK-French \"peace front\", a threat that Turkey rebuffed.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=310}}\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and two days later on 3 September 1939 the UK and France declared war on Germany.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=390}} Papen claimed later to have been opposed to Hitler's foreign policy in 1939 and was very depressed when he heard the news of the German attack on Poland on the radio.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=390}} Papen continued his work of representing the ''Reich'' in Turkey under the grounds that resigning in protest \"would indicate the moral weakening in Germany\", which was something he could never do.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=390}}\n\nOn 19 October 1939, Papen suffered a notable setback when Turkey signed a treaty of alliance with France and the UK.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=392\u2013393}} During the [[Phoney War]], the conservative Catholic Papen found himself to his own discomfort working together with Soviet diplomats in Ankara to pressure Turkey not to enter the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=392}} In June 1940, with France's [[Battle of France|defeat]], \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc abandoned his pro-Allied neutrality, and Papen's influence in Ankara dramatically increased.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=78}}\n\nBetween 1940 and 1942 Papen signed three economic agreements that placed Turkey in the German economic sphere of influence.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=404}} Papen hinted more than once to Turkey that Germany was prepared to support Bulgarian claims to Thrace if Turkey did not prove more accommodating to Germany.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=397\u2013398}} In May 1941, when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the UK in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], Papen persuaded Turkey to allow arms in Syria to be shipped along a railroad linking Syria to Iraq.<ref>Hale, William ''Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774-2000'', London: Psychology Press, 2000 page 87</ref> In June 1941, Papen successfully negotiated a Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression with Turkey, signed on 17 June 1941, which prevented Turkey from entering the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=398\u2013399}} After [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941, Papen persuaded Turkey to close the Turkish straits to Soviet warships, but was unable to have the straits closed to Soviet merchant ships as he demanded.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=400}}\n\nPapen claimed after the war to have done everything within his power to save Turkish Jews living in countries occupied by Germany from deportation to the death camps, but an examination of the ''Ausw\u00e4rtige Amt'''s records do not support him.<ref name=\"Guttstadt, Corry page 141\">Guttstadt, Corry ''Turkey, the Jews, and the Holocaust'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013 page 141.</ref> During the war, Papen used his connections with Turkish Army officers with whom he served in World War I to try to influence Turkey into joining the Axis, held parties at the German embassy which were attended by leading Turkish politicians and used \"special funds\" to bribe Turks into following a pro-German line.<ref>Guttstadt, Corry ''Turkey, the Jews, and the Holocaust'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013 pages 41-42.</ref> As an ambassador to Turkey, Papen survived a Soviet assassination attempt on 24 February 1942 by agents from the [[NKVD]]:<ref>[[Pavel Sudoplatov]], ''Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness\u2014A Soviet Spymaster'' (Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1994), {{ISBN|0-316-77352-2}}</ref> a bomb exploded prematurely, killing the bomber and no-one else, although Papen was slightly injured. In 1943, Papen frustrated a UK attempt to have Turkey join the war on the Allied side by getting Hitler to send a letter to In\u00f6n\u00fc assuring him that Germany had no interest in invading Turkey and by threatening to have the [[Luftwaffe]] bomb [[Istanbul]] if Turkey joined the Allies.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=406}}\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1943, realising the war was lost, Papen attended secret meetings with the agents of the US [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) in Istanbul.<ref name=\"Bauer, Yehuda page 134\">Bauer, Yehuda ''Jews for Sale?: Nazi-Jewish Negotiations, 1933-1945'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996 page 134.</ref> Papen exaggerated his power in Germany to the OSS, and asked for US support to make him dictator of a post-Hitler Germany.<ref name=\"Bauer, Yehuda page 134\"/> US President [[Franklin D.

As [[nuncio]], the future [[Pope John XXIII]], Angelo Roncalli, became acquainted with Papen in Greece and Turkey during World War II. The German government considered appointing Papen ambassador to the [[Holy See]], but Pope Pius XII, after consulting [[Konrad von Preysing]], [[Archbishop of Berlin|Bishop of Berlin]], rejected this proposal. In August 1944, Papen had his last meeting with Hitler after arriving back in Germany from Turkey. Here, Hitler awarded Papen the [[Knight's Cross]] of the [[War Merit Cross]].<ref>Franz von Papen, ''Memoirs'', p. 532.</ref> In September 1944, Papen settled at his estate at [[Wallerfangen]] in the Saarland that had been given to him by his father-in-law.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=428}} On 29 November 1944, Papen could hear in the distance the guns of the advancing US Third Army, which caused him and his family to flee deeper into Germany.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=427}}\n\n==Post-war years==\n[[File:Vonpapen1.jpg|thumb|left|Papen at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].]]\nPapen was captured along with his son Franz Jr. at his own home by First Lieutenant Thomas McKinley{{sfn|Hagerman|1993|p=276}} and members of the [[194th Glider Infantry Regiment (United States)|194th Glider Infantry Regiment]], on 14 April 1945. Also present during the capture was a small band from the 550th Airborne glider Infantry.{{sfn|Hagerman|1993|p=277}} Papen was forced by the US to visit a concentration camp to see first-hand the nature of the regime he had served from start to finish and had done so much to bring about.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=428}}\n\n[[File:Franz von Papen 1964.jpg|thumb|Papen in April 1964]]\nPapen was one of the defendants at the main [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg War Crimes Trial]]. The investigating Tribunal found no solid evidence to support claims that Papen had been involved in the annexation of Austria.{{sfn|Grzebyk|2013|p=147}} The court acquitted him, stating that while he had committed a number of \"political immoralities,\" these actions were not punishable under the \"conspiracy to commit [[crimes against peace]]\" written in Papen's indictment.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=445}}\n\nPapen was subsequently sentenced to eight years' hard labour by a West German [[denazification]] court, but was released on appeal in 1949. Until 1954, Papen was forbidden to publish in West Germany, and so he wrote a series of articles in newspapers in Spain, attacking the Federal Republic from a conservative Catholic position in much the same terms that he had attacked the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=238}} Papen unsuccessfully tried to restart his political career in the 1950s; he lived at the Castle of Benzenhofen near [[Ravensburg]] in [[Upper Swabia]]. Pope John XXIII restored his title of ''Papal Chamberlain'' on 24 July 1959. Papen was also a [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knight of Malta]], and was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Pius IX|Pontifical Order of Pius IX]].\n\n[[File:WallerfangenFriedhof 20090601 Papen01 resized.jpg|thumb|Von Papen's grave in [[Wallerfangen]], [[Saarland]]]]\nPapen published a number of books and memoirs, in which he defended his policies and dealt with the years 1930 to 1933 as well as early western [[Cold War]] politics. Papen praised the [[Schuman Declaration|Schuman Plan]] as \"wise and statesmanlike\" and believed in the economic and military unification and integration of Western Europe.<ref>Franz von Papen, ''Memoirs'', pgs. 586\u2013587.</ref> In 1952 and 1953, Papen published his memoirs in two volumes in Switzerland. Right up until his death in 1969, Papen gave speeches and wrote articles in the newspapers defending himself against the charge that he had played a crucial role in having Hitler appointed Chancellor and that he had served a criminal regime, which led to vitriolic exchanges with West German historians, journalists and political scientists.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=441}} Franz von Papen died in [[Sasbach (Ortenau)|Obersasbach, West Germany]], on 2 May 1969 at the age of 89.<ref>Robert S.

He served as [[Chancellor of Germany]] in 1932 and as [[Vice-Chancellor of Germany|Vice-Chancellor]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] from 1933 to 1934.\n\nBorn into a wealthy family of [[Westphalia]]n [[Roman Catholic]] aristocrats, Papen served in the [[Imperial German Army]] from 1898 onward and was trained as a [[German General Staff]] officer. He served as military attach\u00e9 in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]] from 1913 to 1915, organising acts of sabotage in the United States and financing Mexican forces in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. After being expelled from the United States in 1915, he served as a battalion commander on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of [[World War I]] and finished his war service in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] as a lieutenant colonel.\n\nAppointed Chancellor in 1932 by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], Papen ruled by [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|presidential decree]]. He negotiated the end of reparations at the [[Lausanne Conference of 1932]]. He launched the ''[[Preu\u00dfenschlag]]'' coup against the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] government of the [[Free State of Prussia]]. His failure to secure a base of support in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|''Reichstag'']] led to his dismissal by Hindenburg and replacement by General [[Kurt von Schleicher]]. Determined to return to power, Papen, believing that Hitler could be controlled once he was in the government, persuaded Hindenburg into appointing Hitler as Chancellor and Papen as Vice-Chancellor in 1933 in a cabinet ostensibly not under [[Nazi Party]] domination. With military dictatorship the only alternative to Nazi rule, Hindenburg consented. Papen and his allies were quickly marginalized by Hitler and he left the government after the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, during which the Nazis killed some of his confidants. Subsequently, Papen served as an ambassador of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in [[Vienna]] from 1934 to 1938 and in [[Ankara]] from 1939 to 1944.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], Papen was indicted in the [[Nuremberg trials]] of war criminals before the International Military Tribunal but was acquitted of all charges. In 1947 a West German [[denazification]] court found Papen to have acted as a main culprit to crimes. Papen was given an eight-year hard labour prison sentence but he was released on appeal in 1949. Papen's memoirs were published in 1952 and 1953, and he died in 1969.\n\n==Early life and education==\nPapen was born into a wealthy and noble Roman Catholic family in [[Werl]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]], the third child of Friedrich von Papen-K\u00f6ningen (1839\u20131906) and his wife Anna Laura von Steffens (1852\u20131939){{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=4}}\n \nPapen was sent to a cadet school in [[Bergisch Gladbach|Bensberg]] of his own volition at the age of 11 in 1891. His four years there were followed by three years of training at Prussian Main Military academy in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Lichterfelde]]. He was trained as a ''Herrenreiter'' (\"gentleman rider\").{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=4}} He served for a period as a military attendant in the [[Kaiser]]'s Palace and as a second lieutenant in his father's old unit, the Westphalian [[Uhlan]] Regiment No. 5 in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. Papen joined the [[German General Staff]] as a captain in March 1913.\n\nHe married Martha von Boch-Galhau (1880\u20131961) on 3 May 1905. Papen's wife was the daughter of a wealthy Saarland industrialist whose dowry made him a very rich man.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}} An excellent horseman and a man of much charm, Papen cut a dashing figure and during this time, befriended [[Kurt von Schleicher]].{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}} Papen was proud of his family's having been granted hereditary rights since 1298 to mine brine salt at [[Werl]]. He always believed in the superiority of the aristocracy over commoners.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=2}} Fluent in both French and English, he travelled widely all over Europe, the Middle East and North America.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}} He was devoted to Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=5}} Influenced by the books of General [[Friedrich von Bernhardi]], Papen was a [[militarist]] throughout his life.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=5}}\n\n==Military attach\u00e9 in Washington, DC==\nHe entered the diplomatic service in December 1913 as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to the German ambassador in the United States. In early 1914 he travelled to [[Mexico]] (to which he was also accredited) and observed the [[Mexican Revolution]]. At one time, when the anti-Huerta Zapatistas were advancing on Mexico City, Papen organised a group of European volunteers to fight for Mexican General [[Victoriano Huerta]].{{sfn|Bisher|2016|pp=33\u201334, 71}} In the spring of 1914, as German military attach\u00e9 to Mexico, Papen was deeply involved in selling arms to the government of General Huerta, believing he could place Mexico in the German sphere of influence, though the collapse of Huerta's regime in July 1914 ended that hope.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=172}} In April 1914, Papen personally observed the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]] when the US seized the city of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], despite orders from Berlin to stay in Mexico City.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=8}} During his time in Mexico, Papen acquired the love of international intrigue and adventure that characterised his later diplomatic postings in the United States, Austria and Turkey.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=8}} On 30 July 1914, Papen arrived in [[Washington, DC]] from Mexico to take up his post as German military attach\u00e9 to the United States.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=26}}\n\n[[File:Franz von Papen circa 1915 in helmet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Von Papen as the German Military Attach\u00e9 for Washington, DC in 1915]]\n\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], he tried to buy weapons in the United States for his country, but the UK's blockade made shipping arms to Germany almost impossible.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=11}} On 22 August 1914, Papen hired US private detective Paul Koeing, based in [[New York City]], to conduct a sabotage and bombing campaign against businesses in New York owned by citizens from the Allied nations.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=33}} Papen, who was given an unlimited fund of cash to draw on by Berlin, attempted to block the UK, French and Russian governments from buying war supplies in the United States.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=11}} Papen set up a front company that tried to [[Preclusive purchasing|preclusively purchase]] every hydraulic press in the US for the next two years to limit artillery shell production by US firms with contracts with the Allies.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=11}} To enable German citizens living in the Americas to go home to Germany, Papen set up an operation in New York to forge US passports.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=33}}\n\nStarting in September 1914, Papen abused his [[diplomatic immunity]] as German military attach\u00e9 and US neutrality to start organising plans for an invasion of [[Canada]], as well as a campaign of sabotage against canals, bridges and railroads.{{sfn|McMaster|1918|pp=258\u2013261}} In October 1914, Papen became involved in the [[Hindu\u2013German Conspiracy]], when he contacted anti-UK Indian nationalists living in California, and arranged for weapons to be handed over to them.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|pp=33\u201334}} In February 1915, he organised the [[Vanceboro international bridge bombing]], while his diplomatic immunity protected him from arrest.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=34}} At the same time, he was involved in plans to restore Huerta to power, arranging for the arming and financing of the planned invasion of Mexico.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=43}}\n\nPapen's activities were known to UK intelligence, which shared its information with the US government.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 584.</ref> As a result he was expelled from the [[United States]] for complicity in the planning of acts of [[sabotage]].{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=164}} On 28 December 1915, he was declared ''[[persona non grata]]'' after his exposure and was recalled to Germany.<ref name=\"current\">''Current Biography 1941'', pp. 651\u2013653.</ref> Upon his return, he was given the [[Iron Cross]].\n\nPapen remained involved in plots in the Americas as he contacted in February 1916 the Mexican Colonel Gonzalo Enrile, living in Cuba, in an attempt to arrange German support for [[F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz (politician)|F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz]], the would-be strongman of Mexico.{{sfn|Bisher|2016|p=71}} Papen also served as an intermediary between the [[Irish Volunteers]] and the German government regarding the purchase and delivery of arms to be used against the UK during the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, as well as serving as an intermediary with [[Ghadar party|Indian nationalists]]. In April 1916, a US federal [[grand jury]] issued an indictment against Papen for a plot to blow up Canada's [[Welland Canal]]; he remained under indictment until he became Chancellor of Germany, at which time the charges were dropped.<ref name=\"current\"/>\n\n==Army service in World War I==\nAs a Roman Catholic, Papen belonged to the ''Zentrum'', the right of the center party that almost all German Catholics supported, but during the course of the war, the nationalist conservative Papen became estranged from his party.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=194}} Papen disapproved of [[Matthias Erzberger]], whose efforts to pull the ''Zentrum'' to the left, he was opposed to and regarded the [[Reichstag Peace Resolution]] of 19 July 1917 as almost treason.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=194}}\n\nLater in World War I, Papen returned to the army on active service, first on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1916 Papen took command of the 2nd Reserve Battalion of the 93rd Regiment of the [[4th Guards Infantry Division (German Empire)|4th Guards Infantry Division]] fighting in [[Flanders]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=25}} On 22 August 1916 Papen's battalion took heavy losses while successfully resisting a UK attack during the [[Battle of the Somme]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=25\u201326}} Between November 1916\u2013February 1917, Papen's battalion was engaged in almost continuous heavy fighting.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}} He was awarded the [[Iron Cross First Class|Iron Cross, 1st Class]]. On 11 April 1917, Papen fought at [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]], where his battalion was defeated with heavy losses by the [[Canadian Corps]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}}\n\nAfter Vimy, Papen asked for a transfer to the Middle East, which was approved.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}} From June 1917 Papen served as an officer on the General Staff in the Middle East, and then as an officer attached to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=26}} During his time in the Ottoman Empire, Papen was in \"the know\" about the Armenian genocide, which did not appear to have morally troubled him at all either at the time or later in his life.<ref>Ihrig, Stefan ''Justifying Genocide: Germany and the Armenians from Bismark to Hitler'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2016 page 352.</ref> During his time in Constantinople, Papen befriended [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]. Between October\u2013December 1917, Papen took part in the heavy fighting in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=27}} Promoted to the rank of [[lieutenant-colonel]], he returned to Germany and left the army soon after the armistice which halted the fighting in November 1918.\n\nAfter the Turks signed an armistice with the Allies on 30 October 1918, the German [[Asia Corps]] was ordered home, and Papen was in the mountains at Karapunar when he heard on 11 November 1918 that the war was over.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=27}} The new republic ordered soldier's councils to be organised in the German Army, including the Asian corps, which General [[Otto Liman von Sanders]] attempted to obey, and which Papen refused to obey.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=28}} Sanders ordered Papen arrested for his insubordination, which caused Papen to leave his post without permission as he fled to Germany in civilian clothing to personally meet Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]], who had the charges dropped.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=29}}\n\n==Catholic politician==\nAfter leaving the German Army in the spring of 1919, Papen purchased a country estate, the ''Haus Merfeld'', living the life of a \"gentleman farmer\" in [[D\u00fclmen]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=31}} In April 1920, during the [[Ruhr uprising|Communist uprising in the Ruhr]], Papen took command of a ''[[Freikorps]]'' unit to protect Roman Catholicism from the [[Ruhr Red Army|\"Red marauders\"]].{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=34}} Impressed with his leadership of his ''Freikorps'' unit, Papen decided to pursue a career in politics.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=35}} In the fall of 1920, the president of the Westphalian Farmer's Association, Baron Engelbert von Kerkerinck zur Borg, told Papen his association would campaign for him if he ran for the Prussian ''[[Landtag]]''.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=39}}\n\nPapen entered politics and joined the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], better known as the ''Zentrum''. The [[monarchism|monarchist]] Papen formed part of the [[Conservatism|conservative]] wing of the party that rejected democracy and the [[Weimar Coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Papen's politics were much closer to the [[German National People's Party]]  than to the ''Zentrum'', and he seems to have belonged to the ''Zentrum'' on the account of his Roman Catholicism and a hope that he could shift his party to the right.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=39}}{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=197}} Papen was a figure of influence in the ''Zentrum'' by the virtue of being the largest shareholder and chief of the editorial board in the party's Catholic newspaper ''Germania'', which was the most prestigious of the Catholic papers in Germany.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=247}}{{sfn|Longerich|2019|pp=244\u2013245}}\n\nPapen was a member of the [[Landtag of Prussia]] from 1921 to 1928 and from 1930 to 1932, representing a rural, Catholic constituency in Westphalia.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=40}} Papen rarely attended the sessions of the Landtag and never spoke at the meetings during his time as a Landtag deputy.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=8}} Papen tried to have his name entered into the ''Zentrum'' party list for the Reichstag elections of May 1924, but was blocked by the ''Zentrum's'' leadership.{{sfn|Jones|2005|pp=194\u2013195}} In February 1925, Papen was one of the six ''Zentrum'' deputies in the Landtag who voted with the German National People's Party and the [[German People's Party]] against the SPD-''Zentrum'' government.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=197}} Papen was nearly expelled from the ''Zentrum'' for breaking with party discipline in the Landtag.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=197}} In the 1925 presidential elections, he surprised his party by supporting the right-wing candidate [[Paul von Hindenburg]] over [[Wilhelm Marx]]. Papen, along with two of his future cabinet ministers, was a member of [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]'s exclusive Berlin ''Deutscher Herrenklub'' (German Gentlemen's Club).{{sfn|Longerich|2019|p=247}}{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=41}}\n\nIn March 1930, Papen welcomed the coming of [[Paul von Hindenburg#Presidential governments|presidential government]].{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=205}} As the presidential government of chancellor [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] depended upon the Social Democrats in the ''Reichstag'' to \"tolerate\" it by not voting to cancel laws passed under [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]], Papen grew more critical.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=205}} In a speech before a group of farmers in October 1931, Papen called for Br\u00fcning to disallow the SPD and base his presidential government on \"tolerance\" from the [[NSDAP]] instead.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=206}} Papen demanded that Br\u00fcning transform the \"concealed dictatorship\" of a presidential government into a dictatorship that would unite all of the German right under its banner.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=206}} In the March\u2013April [[1932 German presidential election]], Papen voted for Hindenburg on the grounds he was the best man to unite the right, while in the Prussian Landtag's election of speaker of the Landtag, Papen voted for the Nazi [[Hans Kerrl]].{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=206}}\n\n==Chancellorship==\n[[File:PapenSchleicher0001.jpg|thumb|Chancellor Papen (left) with his eventual successor, Minister of Defence [[Kurt von Schleicher]], watching a horse race in Berlin-[[Karlshorst]].]]\nOn 1 June 1932, Papen was suddenly lifted to supreme importance when president Hindenburg appointed him [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]]. Papen owed his appointment to the Chancellorship to General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], an old friend from the pre-war General Staff and influential advisor of President Hindenburg.

''The Gathering Storm'', p. 132.</ref> On 28 August 1935, Papen negotiated a deal under which the German press would cease its attacks on the Austrian government, in return for which the Austrian press would cease its attacks on Germany's.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=236}} Papen played a major role in negotiating the 1936 Austro-German agreement under which Austria declared itself a \"German state\" whose foreign policy would always be aligned with Berlin's and allowed for members of the \"national opposition\" to enter the Austrian cabinet in exchange for which the Austrian Nazis abandoned their terrorist campaign against the government.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=330\u2013331}}{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=376}} The treaty Papen signed in Vienna on 11 July 1936 promised that Germany would not seek to annexe Austria and largely placed Austria in the German sphere of influence, greatly reducing Italian influence on Austria.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=270}} In July 1936, Papen reported to Hitler that the Austro-German treaty he had just signed was the \"decisive step\" towards ending Austrian independence, and it was only a matter of time before the ''Anschluss'' took place.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=331}}\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1937, Papen pressured the Austrians to include more Nazis in the government.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=279}} In September 1937, Papen returned to Berlin when [[Benito Mussolini]] visited Germany, serving as Hitler's adviser on Italo-German talks about Austria.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=281}} Though Papen was dismissed from his mission in Austria on 4 February 1938, Hitler drafted him to arrange a meeting between the German dictator and Schuschnigg at [[Berchtesgaden]].{{sfn|Hildebrand|1986|p=29}} The ultimatum that Hitler presented to Schuschnigg at the meeting on 12 February 1938 led to the Austrian government's capitulation to German threats and pressure, and paved the way for the ''Anschluss''.\n\n==Ambassador to Turkey==\nPapen later served the German government as [[Germany\u2013Turkey relations|Ambassador to Turkey]] from 1939 to 1944. In April 1938, after the retirement of the previous ambassador, [[Friedrich von Keller (diplomat)|Frederich von Keller]] on his 65th birthday, the German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] attempted to appoint Papen as ambassador in Ankara, but the appointment was vetoed by the Turkish president [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] who remembered Papen well with considerable distaste when he had served alongside him in World War I.{{sfn|Watt|1989|pp=279\u2013280}} In November 1938 and in February 1939, the new Turkish president General [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] again vetoed Ribbentrop's attempts to have Papen appointed as German ambassador to Turkey.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=280}} In April 1939, Turkey accepted Papen as ambassador.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=280}} Papen was keen to return to Turkey, where he had served during World War I.{{sfn|Weinberg|1980|p=591}}\n\nPapen arrived in Turkey on 27 April 1939, just after the signing of a UK-Turkish declaration of friendship.{{sfn|Watt|1989|pp=280\u2013281}} \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc wanted Turkey to join the UK-inspired \"peace front\" that was meant to stop Germany.{{sfn|Watt|1989|pp=281\u2013282}} On 24 June 1939, France and Turkey signed a declaration committing them to upholding collective security in the Balkans.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=305}} On 21 August 1939, Papen presented Turkey with a diplomatic note threatening economic sanctions and the cancellation of all arms contacts if Turkey did not cease leaning towards joining the UK-French \"peace front\", a threat that Turkey rebuffed.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=310}}\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and two days later on 3 September 1939 the UK and France declared war on Germany.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=390}} Papen claimed later to have been opposed to Hitler's foreign policy in 1939 and was very depressed when he heard the news of the German attack on Poland on the radio.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=390}} Papen continued his work of representing the ''Reich'' in Turkey under the grounds that resigning in protest \"would indicate the moral weakening in Germany\", which was something he could never do.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=390}}\n\nOn 19 October 1939, Papen suffered a notable setback when Turkey signed a treaty of alliance with France and the UK.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=392\u2013393}} During the [[Phoney War]], the conservative Catholic Papen found himself to his own discomfort working together with Soviet diplomats in Ankara to pressure Turkey not to enter the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=392}} In June 1940, with France's [[Battle of France|defeat]], \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc abandoned his pro-Allied neutrality, and Papen's influence in Ankara dramatically increased.{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=78}}\n\nBetween 1940 and 1942 Papen signed three economic agreements that placed Turkey in the German economic sphere of influence.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=404}} Papen hinted more than once to Turkey that Germany was prepared to support Bulgarian claims to Thrace if Turkey did not prove more accommodating to Germany.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=397\u2013398}} In May 1941, when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the UK in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], Papen persuaded Turkey to allow arms in Syria to be shipped along a railroad linking Syria to Iraq.<ref>Hale, William ''Turkish Foreign Policy, 1774-2000'', London: Psychology Press, 2000 page 87</ref> In June 1941, Papen successfully negotiated a Treaty of Friendship and Non-aggression with Turkey, signed on 17 June 1941, which prevented Turkey from entering the war on the Allied side.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|pp=398\u2013399}} After [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union that began on 22 June 1941, Papen persuaded Turkey to close the Turkish straits to Soviet warships, but was unable to have the straits closed to Soviet merchant ships as he demanded.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=400}}\n\nPapen claimed after the war to have done everything within his power to save Turkish Jews living in countries occupied by Germany from deportation to the death camps, but an examination of the ''Ausw\u00e4rtige Amt'''s records do not support him.<ref name=\"Guttstadt, Corry page 141\">Guttstadt, Corry ''Turkey, the Jews, and the Holocaust'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013 page 141.</ref> During the war, Papen used his connections with Turkish Army officers with whom he served in World War I to try to influence Turkey into joining the Axis, held parties at the German embassy which were attended by leading Turkish politicians and used \"special funds\" to bribe Turks into following a pro-German line.<ref>Guttstadt, Corry ''Turkey, the Jews, and the Holocaust'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013 pages 41-42.</ref> As an ambassador to Turkey, Papen survived a Soviet assassination attempt on 24 February 1942 by agents from the [[NKVD]]:<ref>[[Pavel Sudoplatov]], ''Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness\u2014A Soviet Spymaster'' (Little, Brown and Company, Boston, 1994), {{ISBN|0-316-77352-2}}</ref> a bomb exploded prematurely, killing the bomber and no-one else, although Papen was slightly injured. In 1943, Papen frustrated a UK attempt to have Turkey join the war on the Allied side by getting Hitler to send a letter to In\u00f6n\u00fc assuring him that Germany had no interest in invading Turkey and by threatening to have the [[Luftwaffe]] bomb [[Istanbul]] if Turkey joined the Allies.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=406}}\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1943, realising the war was lost, Papen attended secret meetings with the agents of the US [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) in Istanbul.<ref name=\"Bauer, Yehuda page 134\">Bauer, Yehuda ''Jews for Sale?: Nazi-Jewish Negotiations, 1933-1945'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996 page 134.</ref> Papen exaggerated his power in Germany to the OSS, and asked for US support to make him dictator of a post-Hitler Germany.<ref name=\"Bauer, Yehuda page 134\"/> US President [[Franklin D.

As [[nuncio]], the future [[Pope John XXIII]], Angelo Roncalli, became acquainted with Papen in Greece and Turkey during World War II. The German government considered appointing Papen ambassador to the [[Holy See]], but Pope Pius XII, after consulting [[Konrad von Preysing]], [[Archbishop of Berlin|Bishop of Berlin]], rejected this proposal. In August 1944, Papen had his last meeting with Hitler after arriving back in Germany from Turkey. Here, Hitler awarded Papen the [[Knight's Cross]] of the [[War Merit Cross]].<ref>Franz von Papen, ''Memoirs'', p. 532.</ref> In September 1944, Papen settled at his estate at [[Wallerfangen]] in the Saarland that had been given to him by his father-in-law.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=428}} On 29 November 1944, Papen could hear in the distance the guns of the advancing US Third Army, which caused him and his family to flee deeper into Germany.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=427}}\n\n==Post-war years==\n[[File:Vonpapen1.jpg|thumb|left|Papen at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].]]\nPapen was captured along with his son Franz Jr. at his own home by First Lieutenant Thomas McKinley{{sfn|Hagerman|1993|p=276}} and members of the [[194th Glider Infantry Regiment (United States)|194th Glider Infantry Regiment]], on 14 April 1945. Also present during the capture was a small band from the 550th Airborne glider Infantry.{{sfn|Hagerman|1993|p=277}} Papen was forced by the US to visit a concentration camp to see first-hand the nature of the regime he had served from start to finish and had done so much to bring about.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=428}}\n\n[[File:Franz von Papen 1964.jpg|thumb|Papen in April 1964]]\nPapen was one of the defendants at the main [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg War Crimes Trial]]. The investigating Tribunal found no solid evidence to support claims that Papen had been involved in the annexation of Austria.{{sfn|Grzebyk|2013|p=147}} The court acquitted him, stating that while he had committed a number of \"political immoralities,\" these actions were not punishable under the \"conspiracy to commit [[crimes against peace]]\" written in Papen's indictment.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=445}}\n\nPapen was subsequently sentenced to eight years' hard labour by a West German [[denazification]] court, but was released on appeal in 1949. Until 1954, Papen was forbidden to publish in West Germany, and so he wrote a series of articles in newspapers in Spain, attacking the Federal Republic from a conservative Catholic position in much the same terms that he had attacked the Weimar Republic.{{sfn|Turner|1996|p=238}} Papen unsuccessfully tried to restart his political career in the 1950s; he lived at the Castle of Benzenhofen near [[Ravensburg]] in [[Upper Swabia]]. Pope John XXIII restored his title of ''Papal Chamberlain'' on 24 July 1959. Papen was also a [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Knight of Malta]], and was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Order of Pius IX|Pontifical Order of Pius IX]].\n\n[[File:WallerfangenFriedhof 20090601 Papen01 resized.jpg|thumb|Von Papen's grave in [[Wallerfangen]], [[Saarland]]]]\nPapen published a number of books and memoirs, in which he defended his policies and dealt with the years 1930 to 1933 as well as early western [[Cold War]] politics. Papen praised the [[Schuman Declaration|Schuman Plan]] as \"wise and statesmanlike\" and believed in the economic and military unification and integration of Western Europe.<ref>Franz von Papen, ''Memoirs'', pgs. 586\u2013587.</ref> In 1952 and 1953, Papen published his memoirs in two volumes in Switzerland. Right up until his death in 1969, Papen gave speeches and wrote articles in the newspapers defending himself against the charge that he had played a crucial role in having Hitler appointed Chancellor and that he had served a criminal regime, which led to vitriolic exchanges with West German historians, journalists and political scientists.{{sfn|Rolfs|1995|p=441}} Franz von Papen died in [[Sasbach (Ortenau)|Obersasbach, West Germany]], on 2 May 1969 at the age of 89.<ref>Robert S.
