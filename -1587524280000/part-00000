Or the enemy can be our own lack of discipline. Some people preach about hell like you're already going there, and to me the Gospel means 'Good News.' I'd rather say God is a God of mercy. So I think the people already know what they're doing wrong, and I certainly believe in hell. But to me, when I see thousands of people before me, it just doesn't come out of me to say, 'You guys are terrible, and you're going to hell.' I'd rather say that God is a God of mercy.

I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded.

It educates students from age 2 to age 18 and includes an early childhood center, an elementary school and a secondary school.\n\n==History and mission==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nThe Yeshivah of Flatbush was founded in 1927 by Dr. Joel Braverman, among others. At first, the school consisted of an elementary school, middle school and an atedenu (Pre-school) located on East 10th Street in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]]. The high school was founded in 1950 to complement the elementary school. The high school was originally in a building adjoining the elementary school. After 1962, a new high school building was built on Avenue J, and the elementary school expanded into what was formerly the high school building.\n\nThe institution combines a [[Torah study|Torah education]] and a secular education for both boys and girls. The school's philosophy is a synthesis of Judaic studies (Bible, Talmud, Jewish Thought) and the liberal arts.\n\nThe school has two mottos: \"The Standard of Excellence\" and \"''Im ein kemach ein Torah'',\" which roughly translates to: \"Without food (literally: flour) there is no Torah.\" In a staff trivia game in April 2020 there was some debate as to what the true school motto was.\n\n==Teaching philosophy==\nOne of the Yeshivah of Flatbush's fundamental tenets is its \"''Ivrit b'Ivrit''\" (literally, \"[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in Hebrew\") philosophy of teaching Judaics. This means that every such class is conducted completely in Hebrew, regardless of the level or ability of students.<ref>[http://www.lookstein.org/articles/ivrit.htm Ivrit B\u2019Ivrit: A Discussion in Ten Da\u2019at] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423114937/http://www.lookstein.org/articles/ivrit.htm |date=April 23, 2016 }}, ''Ten Da\u2019at'', Volume IV, Number 2, Spring 1990.</ref> With this technique, the Yeshivah aims to enable its students to achieve fluency in the [[Hebrew language]].<ref>[http://www.flatbush.org/YOF/InsideYof.asp?yoflinkname=mission Message from the President, Jack Rahmey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813232008/http://www.flatbush.org/YOF/InsideYof.asp?yoflinkname=mission |date=August 13, 2012 }}, accessed February 25, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Student demographics==\nThe Yeshivah of Flatbush comprises Jewish students and teachers from a variety of backgrounds. In the past, more than half of the students were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] whose families originated from communities in Germany, [[Poland]], [[Eastern Europe]] and Russia. In recent years, the majority has shifted to students of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] descent, mainly those whose families originated in [[Middle East]]ern countries. The overwhelming number of Sephardic students can be attributed to the growth of the [[Syrian Jews|Syrian community]] in Flatbush, and the decline in [[Ashkenazi]] enrollment can be attributed to the movement of [[Modern Orthodox]] communities to [[Long Island]] and [[New Jersey]], with a concomitant increase in the number and quality of [[Jewish day school]]s and [[yeshivot]] in those areas. Some [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], Native American, Estonian, Cuban, Honduran,  and [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] have also been enrolled.\n\n[[File:Joel Braverman HS 1609 Av J Yeshivah of Flatbush jeh.jpg|thumb|left|High school on Avenue J]]\n\n==Post-High school==\nMany graduates participate in year-long programs at [[yeshivot]], seminaries and volunteer organizations in Israel for a year. Afterwards, some continue their studies in similar institutions, enroll in university or enlist in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] for another year or more. However, most come back to the United States for university. Graduates of the Yeshivah of Flatbush have studied at universities and colleges across the country, from [[Tulane]] to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]  and [[Boston University]] to [[Yale]]. Some of the most popular universities among Flatbush's alumni, including [[Yeshiva University]] and the [[City University of New York]],  grant as much as a year's worth of credit to students who study in Israel for a year, allowing them to apply these credits to their undergraduate degree.\n\nA large number of students graduate with college credit due to the many [[Advanced Placement Program]] (AP) courses offered in the Junior, Senior, and more recently Sophomore years of high school.\n\n==Leadership==\nRabbi Dr. Raymond Harari is the ''[[rosh yeshivah]]'', or \"head of school,\" of the high school. Rabbi Dr. Raymond Harari, an alumnus of Yeshivah of Flatbush High School, received his BA in philosophy and MA in Jewish Studies from [[Yeshiva University]], his rabbinic ordination from [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (RIETS), and his PhD in Jewish History from [[New York University]]. In addition to his leadership roles at the school, he continues to teach a course in Talmud to high school students in the ninth and tenth grades. Between 1980 and 1998, Rabbi Harari led the B'nei Shaare Zion minyan at [[Congregation Shaare Zion]]. Currently{{When|date=April 2018}}, Rabbi Harari leads the Mikdash Eliyahu Congregation in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nRabbi Joseph Beyda is its principal, and Sari Bacon and Esther Hidary are the associate principals.\n\nThe elementary school was formerly led by Rabbi Lawrence Schwed who retired in 2016. Since 2017, the Head of Elementary School has been Rabbi Yahel Tsaidi (grades 1-8). Rabbi Tsaidi studied at Yeshivat Har Etzion, Yeshivat Hakotel, Yeshiva University and American Jewish University\u2019s Graduate Center for Education, where he received his Master\u2019s in the Arts of Teaching. He is pursuing his Doctorate in Education at the Azrieli School of Education.\n\nGrades 6-8 are led by Rabbi Dr. David Hertzberg.\n\nDebbie Levine-Greenbaum is the Director of Early Childhood, presiding over ''Atideinu'' (literally, \"Our Future\"), Nursery and Kindergarten classes.\n\nRabbi Dr. [[David Eliach]] is principal emeritus, following a decades-long tenure as principal of the high school.\n\nSince 2017, the school has been led by Rabbi Dr. Jeffrey Rothman, Executive Director.\n\n==Student government==\nEach spring the student body of the Yeshivah of Flatbush High School elects four juniors to positions in the Student Government Organization (SGO). These students assume their respective positions the following fall. The SGO plans various trips and other activities for students throughout the year. The SGO also organizes and plans Color War, which occurred recently for the first time, two years in a row.\n\nThe Senior Council is similarly chosen every year. Juniors elect four of their peers to lead them into and during their last year in the high school. The Council's responsibilities include collecting senior dues and planning the wintertime Senior Ski Trip, the springtime Senior Trip, and the year-ending Senior Dinner.\n\n==Community interaction==\nEach year, the Yeshivah holds events that cater to the New York Jewish community. The largest ones include the annual [[Yom HaShoah]] ([[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] Remembrance day) and [[Yom Ha'atzma'ut]] (Israel Independence Day) programs, which traditionally feature performances by the high school's Choir and Chamber Choir, now under the direction of Brian Gelfand.\n\nEach month, there is the Sunday Morning Learning program where students, faculty, and alumni get together for prayers, breakfast, and a faculty-prepared presentation of given texts.\n\n==Music and the arts==\nSince the early 1990s, the yeshivah has gained acclaim through its high school and chamber choirs. Under the direction of Mr. Daniel Henkin until the year 2007, the choral program at the yeshivah has been featured at venues ranging from New York city hall, Brooklyn city hall, The Jewish Heritage Museum, and others. Their repertoire spans across genres which include arrangements of both secular and religious pieces. In 2008, Daniel Henkin resigned as choir director and assumed a position at the [[Ramaz School|Ramaz Upper School]] in Manhattan. Henkin was replaced by Mr. Brian Gelfand, who directs the choir to date.\n\n==Sports==\nThe Flatbush Falcons compete in a number of sports: the [[hockey]], [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]], and [[bowling]] teams compete in the fall, while the [[softball]], [[pickleball]], [[soccer]] and boys varsity volleyball squads play in the spring; the [[Swimming (sport)|swim]], Badminton and [[tennis]] teams compete year-round. In most cases, teams are members of the [[Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Athletic League]], which represents many of the Jewish day schools in the New York area.\n\nThe Flatbush Varsity Tennis Team won their first championship ever this past year (June, 2017) beating Heschel 3-2. Players like Meyer Tawil, Joe Benhaim, and Meyer Kassin led the team to victory.\n\nTwo basketball tournaments are held every year. The Thomas Hausdorff Memorial Basketball Tournament in November brings the male junior varsity teams of three American Jewish high schools to Brooklyn for a weekend of competition and solidarity. At the Marc Sackin Memorial Basketball Tournament in December, the varsity team competes against other New York-area Jewish high schools. Hausdorff was a former principal of the school; Sackin was a student killed just days before his scheduled graduation in 1973.\n\n==Academic teams==\nThe Yeshivah of Flatbush's academic teams compete in a wide range of areas. Some of the teams include: [[debate]], [[Mock Trial]], [[Model Congress]], the [[Yeshiva University]] National [[Model United Nations]], [[Envirothon]], [[chess]], [[mathematics]], [[College Bowl]] and [[Torah]] Bowl.\n\n==Publications==\n*''The Phoenix'' - Student newspaper\n*''Imrei Shefer'' - A D'var [[Torah]] weekly (Hebrew)first initiated in 1974 by Marc Lichtenthal \u05d6\u2019\u05dc a member of the Class of 1975.\n*''Haaretz V'haam'' - An Israel-affairs newspaper\n*''Summit'' - Senior [[yearbook]]\n*\"Pegasus\" - A liberal arts pamphlet\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2011}}\n* Rabbi Dr. [[Howard Apfel]] - Rabbi and noted expert on medical halacha and ethics in Ramat Bet Shemesh Alef{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n* [[Robert J.

It educates students from age 2 to age 18 and includes an early childhood center, an elementary school and a secondary school.\n\n==History and mission==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}\nThe Yeshivah of Flatbush was founded in 1927 by Dr. Joel Braverman, among others. At first, the school consisted of an elementary school, middle school and an atedenu (Pre-school) located on East 10th Street in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]]. The high school was founded in 1950 to complement the elementary school. The high school was originally in a building adjoining the elementary school. After 1962, a new high school building was built on Avenue J, and the elementary school expanded into what was formerly the high school building.\n\nThe institution combines a [[Torah study|Torah education]] and a secular education for both boys and girls. The school's philosophy is a synthesis of Judaic studies (Bible, Talmud, Jewish Thought) and the liberal arts.\n\nThe school has two mottos: \"The Standard of Excellence\" and \"''Im ein kemach ein Torah'',\" which roughly translates to: \"Without food (literally: flour) there is no Torah.\"\n\n==Teaching philosophy==\nOne of the Yeshivah of Flatbush's fundamental tenets is its \"''Ivrit b'Ivrit''\" (literally, \"[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in Hebrew\") philosophy of teaching Judaics. This means that every such class is conducted completely in Hebrew, regardless of the level or ability of students.<ref>[http://www.lookstein.org/articles/ivrit.htm Ivrit B\u2019Ivrit: A Discussion in Ten Da\u2019at] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423114937/http://www.lookstein.org/articles/ivrit.htm |date=April 23, 2016 }}, ''Ten Da\u2019at'', Volume IV, Number 2, Spring 1990.</ref> With this technique, the Yeshivah aims to enable its students to achieve fluency in the [[Hebrew language]].<ref>[http://www.flatbush.org/YOF/InsideYof.asp?yoflinkname=mission Message from the President, Jack Rahmey] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813232008/http://www.flatbush.org/YOF/InsideYof.asp?yoflinkname=mission |date=August 13, 2012 }}, accessed February 25, 2007.</ref>\n\n==Student demographics==\nThe Yeshivah of Flatbush comprises Jewish students and teachers from a variety of backgrounds. In the past, more than half of the students were [[Ashkenazi Jews]] whose families originated from communities in Germany, [[Poland]], [[Eastern Europe]] and Russia. In recent years, the majority has shifted to students of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] descent, mainly those whose families originated in [[Middle East]]ern countries. The overwhelming number of Sephardic students can be attributed to the growth of the [[Syrian Jews|Syrian community]] in Flatbush, and the decline in [[Ashkenazi]] enrollment can be attributed to the movement of [[Modern Orthodox]] communities to [[Long Island]] and [[New Jersey]], with a concomitant increase in the number and quality of [[Jewish day school]]s and [[yeshivot]] in those areas. Some [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], Native American, Estonian, Cuban, Honduran,  and [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] have also been enrolled.\n\n[[File:Joel Braverman HS 1609 Av J Yeshivah of Flatbush jeh.jpg|thumb|left|High school on Avenue J]]\n\n==Post-High school==\nMany graduates participate in year-long programs at [[yeshivot]], seminaries and volunteer organizations in Israel for a year. Afterwards, some continue their studies in similar institutions, enroll in university or enlist in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] for another year or more. However, most come back to the United States for university. Graduates of the Yeshivah of Flatbush have studied at universities and colleges across the country, from [[Tulane]] to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]  and [[Boston University]] to [[Yale]]. Some of the most popular universities among Flatbush's alumni, including [[Yeshiva University]] and the [[City University of New York]],  grant as much as a year's worth of credit to students who study in Israel for a year, allowing them to apply these credits to their undergraduate degree.\n\nA large number of students graduate with college credit due to the many [[Advanced Placement Program]] (AP) courses offered in the Junior, Senior, and more recently Sophomore years of high school.\n\n==Leadership==\nRabbi Dr. Raymond Harari is the ''[[rosh yeshivah]]'', or \"head of school,\" of the high school. Rabbi Dr. Raymond Harari, an alumnus of Yeshivah of Flatbush High School, received his BA in philosophy and MA in Jewish Studies from [[Yeshiva University]], his rabbinic ordination from [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] (RIETS), and his PhD in Jewish History from [[New York University]]. In addition to his leadership roles at the school, he continues to teach a course in Talmud to high school students in the ninth and tenth grades. Between 1980 and 1998, Rabbi Harari led the B'nei Shaare Zion minyan at [[Congregation Shaare Zion]]. Currently{{When|date=April 2018}}, Rabbi Harari leads the Mikdash Eliyahu Congregation in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nRabbi Joseph Beyda is its principal, and Sari Bacon and Esther Hidary are the associate principals.\n\nThe elementary school was formerly led by Rabbi Lawrence Schwed who retired in 2016. Since 2017, the Head of Elementary School has been Rabbi Yahel Tsaidi (grades 1-8). Rabbi Tsaidi studied at Yeshivat Har Etzion, Yeshivat Hakotel, Yeshiva University and American Jewish University\u2019s Graduate Center for Education, where he received his Master\u2019s in the Arts of Teaching. He is pursuing his Doctorate in Education at the Azrieli School of Education.\n\nGrades 6-8 are led by Rabbi Dr. David Hertzberg.\n\nDebbie Levine-Greenbaum is the Director of Early Childhood, presiding over ''Atideinu'' (literally, \"Our Future\"), Nursery and Kindergarten classes.\n\nRabbi Dr. [[David Eliach]] is principal emeritus, following a decades-long tenure as principal of the high school.\n\nSince 2017, the school has been led by Rabbi Dr. Jeffrey Rothman, Executive Director.\n\n==Student government==\nEach spring the student body of the Yeshivah of Flatbush High School elects four juniors to positions in the Student Government Organization (SGO). These students assume their respective positions the following fall. The SGO plans various trips and other activities for students throughout the year. The SGO also organizes and plans Color War, which occurred recently for the first time, two years in a row.\n\nThe Senior Council is similarly chosen every year. Juniors elect four of their peers to lead them into and during their last year in the high school. The Council's responsibilities include collecting senior dues and planning the wintertime Senior Ski Trip, the springtime Senior Trip, and the year-ending Senior Dinner.\n\n==Community interaction==\nEach year, the Yeshivah holds events that cater to the New York Jewish community. The largest ones include the annual [[Yom HaShoah]] ([[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] Remembrance day) and [[Yom Ha'atzma'ut]] (Israel Independence Day) programs, which traditionally feature performances by the high school's Choir and Chamber Choir, now under the direction of Brian Gelfand.\n\nEach month, there is the Sunday Morning Learning program where students, faculty, and alumni get together for prayers, breakfast, and a faculty-prepared presentation of given texts.\n\n==Music and the arts==\nSince the early 1990s, the yeshivah has gained acclaim through its high school and chamber choirs. Under the direction of Mr. Daniel Henkin until the year 2007, the choral program at the yeshivah has been featured at venues ranging from New York city hall, Brooklyn city hall, The Jewish Heritage Museum, and others. Their repertoire spans across genres which include arrangements of both secular and religious pieces. In 2008, Daniel Henkin resigned as choir director and assumed a position at the [[Ramaz School|Ramaz Upper School]] in Manhattan. Henkin was replaced by Mr. Brian Gelfand, who directs the choir to date.\n\n==Sports==\nThe Flatbush Falcons compete in a number of sports: the [[hockey]], [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]], and [[bowling]] teams compete in the fall, while the [[softball]], [[pickleball]], [[soccer]] and boys varsity volleyball squads play in the spring; the [[Swimming (sport)|swim]], Badminton and [[tennis]] teams compete year-round. In most cases, teams are members of the [[Metropolitan Yeshiva High School Athletic League]], which represents many of the Jewish day schools in the New York area.\n\nThe Flatbush Varsity Tennis Team won their first championship ever this past year (June, 2017) beating Heschel 3-2. Players like Meyer Tawil, Joe Benhaim, and Meyer Kassin led the team to victory.\n\nTwo basketball tournaments are held every year. The Thomas Hausdorff Memorial Basketball Tournament in November brings the male junior varsity teams of three American Jewish high schools to Brooklyn for a weekend of competition and solidarity. At the Marc Sackin Memorial Basketball Tournament in December, the varsity team competes against other New York-area Jewish high schools. Hausdorff was a former principal of the school; Sackin was a student killed just days before his scheduled graduation in 1973.\n\n==Academic teams==\nThe Yeshivah of Flatbush's academic teams compete in a wide range of areas. Some of the teams include: [[debate]], [[Mock Trial]], [[Model Congress]], the [[Yeshiva University]] National [[Model United Nations]], [[Envirothon]], [[chess]], [[mathematics]], [[College Bowl]] and [[Torah]] Bowl.\n\n==Publications==\n*''The Phoenix'' - Student newspaper\n*''Imrei Shefer'' - A D'var [[Torah]] weekly (Hebrew)first initiated in 1974 by Marc Lichtenthal \u05d6\u2019\u05dc a member of the Class of 1975.\n*''Haaretz V'haam'' - An Israel-affairs newspaper\n*''Summit'' - Senior [[yearbook]]\n*\"Pegasus\" - A liberal arts pamphlet\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2011}}\n* Rabbi Dr. [[Howard Apfel]] - Rabbi and noted expert on medical halacha and ethics in Ramat Bet Shemesh Alef{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n* [[Robert J.

The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of [[George Lucas]] who hired him to work with the special effects for the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').

As with ''Dark Star'', Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym \"John T.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for Warner Bros.

He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting.

Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, ''The Thing'' was part of what Carpenter later called his \"Apocalypse Trilogy,\" a trio of films (''The Thing'', ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'') with bleak endings for the film's characters.

The next day he had made a list of requirements should he direct the film; they were: 100 percent creative control, the right to assume scriptwriting duties, being able to co-compose the film's musical score, total editorial control, the casting of [[Brian Dennehy]] as Santa Claus and a $5 million signing-on fee (the same amount that the film's star [[Dudley Moore]] was receiving). Salkind withdrew his offer for him to direct.\n\nAfter the financial failure of his big-budget action\u2013comedy ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), Carpenter struggled to get films financed.

Since [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the main actress from the original and the sequel ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original film, she asked Carpenter to direct ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he had never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a contention between Carpenter and ''Halloween'' producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter quit the project.

Although Carpenter has worked with various movie [[genres]], he is associated most commonly with [[horror film|horror]], [[action film|action]], and [[science fiction film]]s of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/movies/john-carpenter-directs-the-ward.html|title=A Lord of Fright Reclaims His Dark Domain|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Jason Zinoman|date=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost films of Carpenter's career were initially commercial and critical failures, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978), ''[[The Fog]]'' (1980), ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), and ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984). However, many of Carpenter's films from the 1970s and the 1980s have come to be considered as [[Cult film|cult classics]], and he has been acknowledged as an influential filmmaker. The cult classics that Carpenter has directed include ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), ''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (1976 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'' (1976), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), ''[[Christine (1983 film)|Christine]]'' (1983), ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), ''[[They Live]]'' (1988), and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995). He returned to the [[Halloween (franchise)|''Halloween'' franchise]] as both composer and executive producer for the horror sequel ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018).\n\nCarpenter composed or co-composed most of his films' music. He won a [[Saturn Award for Best Music]] for the film ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998). Carpenter has released three studio albums, titled ''[[Lost Themes]]'' (2015), ''[[Lost Themes II]]'' (2016), and ''[[Anthology: Movie Themes 1974\u20131998]]'' (2017).\n\n==Early life==\nCarpenter was born on January 16, 1948 in [[Carthage, New York]], the son of Milton Jean (''n\u00e9e'' Carter) and Howard Ralph Carpenter, a music professor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/70/John-Carpenter.html|work=Film Reference|title=John Carpenter Biography (1948\u2013)}}</ref> He and his family relocated to [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]] during 1953.<ref name=kye>{{cite book |editor=Kleber, John E. |others=Associate editors: [[Thomas D.

The film was rediscovered in the USC archives in 2011 and proved interesting because it revealed elements that would appear in his later film, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-carpenter-halloween-student-film-captain-voyeur-253747 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Mike | last=Barnes | title='Halloween' Director John Carpenter's First Student Film Unearthed | date=October 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe next year he collaborated with producer [[John Longenecker]] as co-writer, film editor, and music composer for ''[[The Resurrection of Broncho Billy]]'' (1970), which won an [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film]]. The short film was enlarged to [[35 mm movie film|35 mm]], sixty prints were made, and the film was released theatrically by Universal Studios for two years in the United States and Canada.\n\n===1970s: From student films to theatrical releases===\nCarpenter's first major film as director, ''[[Dark Star (film)|Dark Star]]'' (1974), was a science fiction comedy that he cowrote with [[Dan O'Bannon]] (who later went on to write ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', borrowing freely from much of ''Dark Star''). The film reportedly cost only $60,000 and was difficult to make as both Carpenter and O'Bannon completed the film by multitasking, with Carpenter doing the musical score as well as the writing, producing, and directing, while O'Bannon acted in the film and did the special effects (which caught the attention of [[George Lucas]] who hired him to work with the special effects for the film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'').

As with ''Dark Star'', Carpenter was responsible for many aspects of the film's creation. He not only wrote, directed, and scored it, but also edited the film using the pseudonym \"John T. Chance\" (the name of [[John Wayne]]'s character in ''Rio Bravo''). Carpenter has said that he considers ''Assault on Precinct 13'' to have been his first real film because it was the first film that he filmed on a schedule.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goldwasser |first=Dan |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=12 |title=John Carpenter \u2013 Interview |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=May 9, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> The film was the first time Carpenter worked with [[Debra Hill]], who played prominently in the making of some of Carpenter's most important films.\n\nCarpenter assembled a main cast that consisted of experienced but relatively obscure actors. The two main actors were [[Austin Stoker]], who had appeared previously in science fiction, disaster, and [[blaxploitation]] films, and [[Darwin Joston]], who had worked primarily for television and had once been Carpenter's next-door neighbor.<ref>Q & A session with John Carpenter and Austin Stoker at American Cinematheque's 2002 John Carpenter retrospective, in the ''Assault on Precinct 13'' 2003 special edition DVD.</ref>\n\nThe film received a critical reassessment in the United States, where it is now generally regarded as one of the best [[exploitation film]]s of the 1970s.<ref name=stills>Production Gallery (included in the 2003 special edition Region 1 DVD of ''Assault on Precinct 13''). 2003.</ref>\n\nCarpenter both wrote and directed the Lauren Hutton thriller ''[[Someone's Watching Me!]]''.

Originally an idea suggested by producer [[Irwin Yablans]] (titled ''The Babysitter Murders''), who thought of a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it occur during Halloween and developed a story.<ref name=\"scifi1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue339/interview.html |title=Syfy \u2013 Watch Full Episodes &#124; Imagine Greater |publisher=Scifi.com |date= |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Carpenter said of the basic concept: \"Halloween night.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for Warner Bros. (which picked up 'Black Christmas'), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. 'Halloween' is his movie and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked 'Black Christmas' and may have been influenced by it, but in no way did John Carpenter copy the idea.

After viewing a rough cut of the film, he was dissatisfied with the result. For the only time in his filmmaking career, he had to devise a way to salvage a nearly finished film that did not meet his standards. In order to make the film more coherent and frightening, Carpenter filmed additional footage that included a number of new scenes.\n\nDespite production problems and mostly negative critical reception, ''The Fog'' was another commercial success for Carpenter. The film was made on a budget of $1,000,000,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/rollingstone790628.html |title='THE FOG': A SPOOK RIDE ON FILM |access-date=March 16, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228140340/http://www.theofficialjohncarpenter.com/pages/press/rollingstone790628.html |archive-date=February 28, 2015 |magazine= Rolling Stone | via = theofficialjohncarpenter.com }}</ref> but it grossed over $21,000,000 in the United States alone.

''The Thing'' was distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nAlthough Carpenter's film used the same source material as the 1951 Howard Hawks film, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', it is more faithful to the [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]] novella, ''[[Who Goes There?]]'', upon which both films were based. Moreover, unlike the Hawks film, ''The Thing'' was part of what Carpenter later called his \"Apocalypse Trilogy,\" a trio of films (''The Thing'', ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'', and ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'') with bleak endings for the film's characters.

Salkind made the offer to Carpenter during lunch at The Ritz, and while he loved the idea of differing from his normal traditions and directing a children's fantasy film, he requested 24 hours to think about the offer. The next day he had made a list of requirements should he direct the film; they were: 100 percent creative control, the right to assume scriptwriting duties, being able to co-compose the film's musical score, total editorial control, the casting of [[Brian Dennehy]] as Santa Claus and a $5 million signing-on fee (the same amount that the film's star [[Dudley Moore]] was receiving). Salkind withdrew his offer for him to direct.\n\nAfter the financial failure of his big-budget action\u2013comedy ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'' (1986), Carpenter struggled to get films financed. He resumed making lower budget films such as ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' (1987), a film influenced by the [[BBC]] series ''[[Quatermass]]''. Although some of the films from this time, such as ''[[They Live]]'' (1988) did develop a cult audience, he never again realized mass-market potential.\n\nCarpenter was also offered ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' during 1989, and met with writer [[William Peter Blatty]] (who also authored the novel on which it was based, ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'') during the course of a week. However, the two disagreed about the film's climax and Carpenter refused the project. Blatty directed the film himself a year later. Carpenter said that although they argued about the ending, they had a mutual respect and talked about an interest they both shared: quantum physics.<ref>Gilles Boulenger.

Also notable from this decade are ''[[Body Bags (film)|Body Bags]]'', a television horror anthology film that was made in collaboration with [[Tobe Hooper]], ''[[In the Mouth of Madness]]'' (1995), yet another Lovecraftian homage, which did not do well either commercially or with critics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_mouth_of_madness/ |title=In the Mouth of Madness |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> but now has a cult following,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/12/05/in-the-mouth-of-john-carpenters-misunderstood-masterpiece/ | title=In the Mouth of John Carpenter's Misunderstood Masterpiece | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=December 5, 2014 | accessdate=November 20, 2016 | author=Calia, Michael}}</ref> and ''[[Vampires (1998 film)|Vampires]]'' (1998), which featured [[James Woods]] as the leader of a band of vampire hunters in league with the Catholic Church.\n\nCarpenter was originally in consideration to be the director for the ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978) sequel project, ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998). Since [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], the main actress from the original and the sequel ''[[Halloween II (1981 film)|Halloween II]]'' (1981), wanted to reunite the cast and crew of the original film, she asked Carpenter to direct ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. Carpenter agreed to direct the film, but his starting fee as director was $10 million. Carpenter rationalized this by believing the hefty fee was compensation for revenue he had never received from the original ''Halloween'', a matter that was still a contention between Carpenter and ''Halloween'' producer [[Moustapha Akkad]] even after twenty years. When Akkad balked at Carpenter's fee, Carpenter quit the project. [[Steve Miner]] assumed directing of ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'', which was a commercial success despite receiving mixed reviews.\n\nDuring 1998, Carpenter composed the soundtrack (titled \"Earth/Air\") for the [[video game]] ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', published for [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bestwesterngamesoundtracks.com/soundtracks/sentinel-returns-soundtrack/|title=Sentinel Returns Soundtrack \u2013 Review|date=May 14, 2015|website=Bestwesterngamessoundtracks.com|accessdate=December 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2000s: Semi-retirement===\n[[File:JohnCarpenter01.jpg|thumb|right|Carpenter in September 2001]]\nIn 2001, the film ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'' was released.

Go home.\"\n\nDuring 2007, [[Rob Zombie]] produced and directed ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'', a re-imagining of Carpenter's 1978 film that resulted in a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] two years later.\n\nCarpenter worked as director during 2005 for an episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime's]] ''[[Masters of Horror]]'' television series as one of the thirteen filmmakers involved in the first season. His episode, \"[[John Carpenter's Cigarette Burns|Cigarette Burns]]\", received generally positive reviews, and positive reactions from Carpenter fans, many of whom regard it as on par with his earlier horror classics. He has since contributed another original episode for the show's second season entitled \"[[Pro-Life (Masters of Horror)|Pro-Life]]\", about a young girl who is raped and impregnated by a demon and wants to have an abortion, but whose efforts are halted by her religious fanatic, gun-toting father and her three brothers.\n\n===2010s: ''The Ward'', focus on music and return to ''Halloween''===\n''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'', Carpenter's first film since 2001's ''[[Ghosts of Mars]]'', premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010.

Such singles include \"Show Me\", \"Free\", \"Desire\", \"Get it Up (the Feeling)\", \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", and her number-one hits \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\", \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give it All You Got]]\" featuring Chris Willis, \"Waiting On You\" and \"Everybody Loves the Night\".

Growing up, Nat\u00e9 enjoyed a wide variety of music; she enjoyed listening to artists such as [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Boy George]], whom Nat\u00e9 would later say helped her become more open to being more experimental with her style and production of music.<ref>{{cite news| author=DJ Ron Slomowicz| url=http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| title=Interview with Ultra Nate| publisher=Dance Music / Electronica| year=2007| accessdate=2007-09-21| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803141550/http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| archivedate=2004-08-03}}</ref>\n\nShe is best known in her home country for her 1990s dance crossover track, \"Free\".

It reached #52 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and #3 on the [[Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. Though she has had club success in America, she has found the majority of her singles and, especially, album sales success in [[Europe]].\n\n===Career===\nUltra Nat\u00e9 began her recording career on a major label, [[Warner Bros. Records]], signed through its British offices.<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=407}}</ref> Through it, she released her first two albums. Her debut album, ''[[Blue Notes in the Basement]]'' (1991) was created along with the [[Basement Boys]] and it featured the singles \"It's Over Now\", \"Deeper Love (Missing You)\", \"Is It Love\", and the gospel-tinged \"Rejoicing\".<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the [[alternative dance]]/[[house music|house]] ''[[One Woman's Insanity]]'' was released.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Although it still featured the Basement Boys' production on several tracks, this time Ultra found herself working with [[Nellee Hooper]], and [[Kwame Kwaten#Biography|D-Influence]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> At a time when soulful [[house music]] performers such as [[Robin S]] and [[Crystal Waters]] were scoring cross-over Top Ten Pop singles, it was believed that Ultra Nat\u00e9 would score a similar level of commercial success. Mainstream sales however were not achieved even though \"Show Me\" received moderate mainstream pop radio airplay. Singles included \"How Long\", \"Show Me\" (her first song to reach the top position on the US Dance charts) and \"Joy\". However, neither release sold very well, and she was dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1995, Ultra Nat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Party Girl (Turn Me Loose)\" to the soundtrack to the independent film starring [[Parker Posey]]. The single was commercially released by the [[King Street Sounds]] label.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. tried to push her in another direction, Ultra Nat\u00e9 left the major label and moved to the independent dance label, [[Strictly Rhythm]]. It was here that \"Free\", her biggest mainstream hit, was released in 1997.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The song, co-written by Nat\u00e9, Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone while production was held by both Springsteen and Ciafone, enjoyed heavy airplay throughout the summer, not only in clubs, but on rhythmic and mainstream radio stations in America and Europe. \"Free\" peaked at number 75 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It became a substantial hit in the UK, where it peaked at number four in the [[UK Singles Chart]], helping its parent album 'Situation: Critical' reach number seventeen on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> It was also successful in Canada where it reached number 10 at the Canadian Singles Charts.<ref>{{cite news | author=| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r351038/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | title= AllMusicGuide entry | website=[[AllMusic]]| date=2007-07-27 | accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>\n\nIt was with this album that Ultra Nat\u00e9's greatest commercial success was achieved, particularly in Europe, where singles such as \"Found a Cure\" (No. 6 in the UK), and \"New Kind of Medicine\" (No 14 UK) also charted.\n\nIn 1998, a new single \"Pressure\" was released internationally. Taken from the soundtrack to the film ''The 24 Hour Woman'', it contained three club mixes. The original version of the track was found on 'Situation: Critical\" but listed as \"Release the Pressure\".\n\nHer follow-up album ''[[Stranger Than Fiction (Ultra Nate album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'', which was released in 2001, featured the production work of artists such as [[Attica Blues (band)|Attica Blues]], [[4 Hero]], and Mood II Swing. Four singles were released: \"Desire\", \"Get It Up (The Feeling)\", \"Twisted\", and \"I Don't Understand It\".\n\nNat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Wonderful Place\" to the AIDS benefit compilation ''Keep Hope Alive: A Lifebeat Benefit Compilation''. Additionally, in 2004, she released the singles \"Feel Love\", \"Brass in Pocket\", \"Time of Our Lives\" (released as \"Ultra Devoted featuring Ultra Nat\u00e9 and Gerry DeVeaux\"), and a new version of \"Free\" that features twelve new mixes. In 2005, she collaborated with [[Alex Gaudino|Gaudino]] and released the single \"Bitter Sweet Melody\". Later in the same year she found herself again on the charts, when her featured vocals on the [[StoneBridge (DJ)|Stonebridge]] single \"[[Freak On]]\" became a successful dance hit. She also performed on the British show ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby One More Time]]''.\n\nHaving become a mother for the first time in the fall of 2005, Nat\u00e9 released her fifth album ''[[Grime, Silk, & Thunder]]'' on her newly created imprint Blufire in partnership with [[Tommy Boy Records]]. The first single released was \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", which became available through the US [[iTunes Store]] August 8, 2006 and reached number two on the American [[Hot Dance Club Play]] and made the Top 30 on the [[Hot Dance Airplay]] chart. The second single \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\" (a cover version of the [[Pointer Sisters]] hit) reached number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart (the week ending April 28, 2007). It also received airplay in the Rhythmic/Dance format radio where it reached the Top 30 of most playlists in this radio format. Following Automatic, Ultra released \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give It All You Got]]\" which features Chris Willis in Dec 2007. The song hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Music/Club Play charts the week ending February 23, 2008.\n\nIn mid-2009 it was announced that US singer [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], previously of [[Destiny's Child]] has collaborated on a song with Ultra called \"I'm Waiting On You\", for use on both of their next studio albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a162286/michelle-williams-162286/|title=Michelle Williams|first=Nick|last=Levine|date=29 June 2009|website=Digital Spy}}</ref> In 2010 Ultra has released a Bob Sinclar remix of her hit \"Free\" on Strictly Rhythm. \"Give It 2 U\" in collaboration with Quentin Harris for his album \"Sacrifice\". She also released \"Destination\" in collaboration with Tony Moran which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Dance Play chart. \"Destination\" was the second single off Tony's album, Mix Magic Music.\n\nIn 2010 she released an EP titled \"Things Happen At Night\" featuring Ultra's pop and soul melodies and vocals over percussive club beats done by Unruly productions. January 2011 is saw the release of Ultra's next single with Strictly Rhythm on her Deep Sugar label imprint called \"[[Turn It Up (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Turn It Up]]\" with a music video directed by Leo Herrera. \"Turn It Up\" was the first single to be released from her sixth studio album titled ''Hero Worship''.\n\nIn September 2011, she submitted the song, \"My Love\" to represent [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Switzerland]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], to be held in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. However, though close, the song failed to reach the final.<ref>[http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/17658 Eurovision Song Contest - Baku 2012 | News - Switzerland: American singer Ultra Nat\u00e9 on the race to Baku].

Such singles include \"Show Me\", \"Free\", \"Desire\", \"Get it Up (the Feeling)\", \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", and her number-one hits \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\", \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give it All You Got]]\" featuring Chris Willis, \"Waiting On You\" and \"Everybody Loves the Night\".

Growing up, Nat\u00e9 enjoyed a wide variety of music; she enjoyed listening to artists such as [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Boy George]], whom Nat\u00e9 would later say helped her become more open to being more experimental with her style and production of music.<ref>{{cite news| author=DJ Ron Slomowicz| url=http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| title=Interview with Ultra Nate| publisher=Dance Music / Electronica| year=2007| accessdate=2007-09-21| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803141550/http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| archivedate=2004-08-03}}</ref>\n\nShe is best known in her home country for her 1990s dance crossover track, \"Free\". She is also remembered in America for her team-up with [[Amber (singer)|Amber]] and [[Jocelyn Enriquez]] as [[Stars on 54]] on a 1998 cover of [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s \"If You Could Read My Mind\", which was a minor mainstream American hit. It reached #52 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and #3 on the [[Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. Though she has had club success in America, she has found the majority of her singles and, especially, album sales success in [[Europe]].\n\n===Career===\nUltra Nat\u00e9 began her recording career on a major label, [[Warner Bros. Records]], signed through its British offices.<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=407}}</ref> Through it, she released her first two albums. Her debut album, ''[[Blue Notes in the Basement]]'' (1991) was created along with the [[Basement Boys]] and it featured the singles \"It's Over Now\", \"Deeper Love (Missing You)\", \"Is It Love\", and the gospel-tinged \"Rejoicing\".<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the [[alternative dance]]/[[house music|house]] ''[[One Woman's Insanity]]'' was released.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Although it still featured the Basement Boys' production on several tracks, this time Ultra found herself working with [[Nellee Hooper]], and [[Kwame Kwaten#Biography|D-Influence]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> At a time when soulful [[house music]] performers such as [[Robin S]] and [[Crystal Waters]] were scoring cross-over Top Ten Pop singles, it was believed that Ultra Nat\u00e9 would score a similar level of commercial success. Mainstream sales however were not achieved even though \"Show Me\" received moderate mainstream pop radio airplay. Singles included \"How Long\", \"Show Me\" (her first song to reach the top position on the US Dance charts) and \"Joy\". However, neither release sold very well, and she was dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1995, Ultra Nat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Party Girl (Turn Me Loose)\" to the soundtrack to the independent film starring [[Parker Posey]]. The single was commercially released by the [[King Street Sounds]] label.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. tried to push her in another direction, Ultra Nat\u00e9 left the major label and moved to the independent dance label, [[Strictly Rhythm]]. It was here that \"Free\", her biggest mainstream hit, was released in 1997.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The song, co-written by Nat\u00e9, Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone while production was held by both Springsteen and Ciafone, enjoyed heavy airplay throughout the summer, not only in clubs, but on rhythmic and mainstream radio stations in America and Europe. \"Free\" peaked at number 75 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It became a substantial hit in the UK, where it peaked at number four in the [[UK Singles Chart]], helping its parent album 'Situation: Critical' reach number seventeen on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> It was also successful in Canada where it reached number 10 at the Canadian Singles Charts.<ref>{{cite news | author=| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r351038/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | title= AllMusicGuide entry | website=[[AllMusic]]| date=2007-07-27 | accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>\n\nIt was with this album that Ultra Nat\u00e9's greatest commercial success was achieved, particularly in Europe, where singles such as \"Found a Cure\" (No. 6 in the UK), and \"New Kind of Medicine\" (No 14 UK) also charted.\n\nIn 1998, a new single \"Pressure\" was released internationally. Taken from the soundtrack to the film ''The 24 Hour Woman'', it contained three club mixes. The original version of the track was found on 'Situation: Critical\" but listed as \"Release the Pressure\".\n\nHer follow-up album ''[[Stranger Than Fiction (Ultra Nate album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'', which was released in 2001, featured the production work of artists such as [[Attica Blues (band)|Attica Blues]], [[4 Hero]], and Mood II Swing. Four singles were released: \"Desire\", \"Get It Up (The Feeling)\", \"Twisted\", and \"I Don't Understand It\".\n\nNat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Wonderful Place\" to the AIDS benefit compilation ''Keep Hope Alive: A Lifebeat Benefit Compilation''. Additionally, in 2004, she released the singles \"Feel Love\", \"Brass in Pocket\", \"Time of Our Lives\" (released as \"Ultra Devoted featuring Ultra Nat\u00e9 and Gerry DeVeaux\"), and a new version of \"Free\" that features twelve new mixes. In 2005, she collaborated with [[Alex Gaudino|Gaudino]] and released the single \"Bitter Sweet Melody\". Later in the same year she found herself again on the charts, when her featured vocals on the [[StoneBridge (DJ)|Stonebridge]] single \"[[Freak On]]\" became a successful dance hit. She also performed on the British show ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby One More Time]]''.\n\nHaving become a mother for the first time in the fall of 2005, Nat\u00e9 released her fifth album ''[[Grime, Silk, & Thunder]]'' on her newly created imprint Blufire in partnership with [[Tommy Boy Records]]. The first single released was \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", which became available through the US [[iTunes Store]] August 8, 2006 and reached number two on the American [[Hot Dance Club Play]] and made the Top 30 on the [[Hot Dance Airplay]] chart. The second single \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\" (a cover version of the [[Pointer Sisters]] hit) reached number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart (the week ending April 28, 2007). It also received airplay in the Rhythmic/Dance format radio where it reached the Top 30 of most playlists in this radio format. Following Automatic, Ultra released \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give It All You Got]]\" which features Chris Willis in Dec 2007. The song hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Music/Club Play charts the week ending February 23, 2008.\n\nIn mid-2009 it was announced that US singer [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], previously of [[Destiny's Child]] has collaborated on a song with Ultra called \"I'm Waiting On You\", for use on both of their next studio albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a162286/michelle-williams-162286/|title=Michelle Williams|first=Nick|last=Levine|date=29 June 2009|website=Digital Spy}}</ref> In 2010 Ultra has released a Bob Sinclar remix of her hit \"Free\" on Strictly Rhythm. \"Give It 2 U\" in collaboration with Quentin Harris for his album \"Sacrifice\".
