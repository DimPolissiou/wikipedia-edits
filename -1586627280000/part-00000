Abrams]], and written by [[Drew Goddard]]. The film stars [[Michael Stahl-David]], [[Odette Yustman]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Jessica Lucas]], [[Lizzy Caplan]], and [[Mike Vogel]]. The film uses a [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] motif to follow five young [[New York City]] residents fleeing from a massive monster and various other smaller creatures that attack the city while they are having a farewell party.\n\nDevelopment began when producer [[J. J. Abrams]] started conceptualizing a new monster and enlisted [[Neville Page]] to design the creature, referred to as [[Clover (creature)|Clover]]. In February 2007, the project was secretly [[greenlit]] by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by Abrams' [[Bad Robot Productions]]. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] that same year. During production, the project went under several working titles, including ''Slusho'', ''Cheese'' and ''Greyshot''. As part of a [[viral marketing]] campaign, a teaser trailer was released ahead of screenings of ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' without a title attached. The film's official title was revealed in a second teaser trailer attached to screenings of ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]''. With limited details revealed about the film prior to release, it garnered online speculation, including forums and websites dedicated to uncovering any hidden information about the film. Several tie-ins, including a [[prequel]] [[manga]] series, were released as part of the film's marketing campaign.\n\n''Cloverfield'' was released on January 18, 2008, and received positive reviews from film critics. Many praised Reeves' direction and the film's [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style narrative. It earned $170.8 million worldwide at the box office against a $25 million budget. The film served as the first installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], followed by ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' in 2016 and ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/next-cloverfield-movie-god-particle-jj-abrams/ |title='God Particle' Is the Next Film in the 'Cloverfield' Universe |website=Collider}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe film is presented as [[Found footage (film technique)|footage]] from a personal camcorder recovered by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the area \"formerly known as [[Central Park]]\", bearing a disclaimer stating multiple sightings of a case designated \"Cloverfield\".\n\nRob has a farewell party thrown for him by his brother Jason and Jason's girlfriend Lily, in celebration of Rob's new job in Japan. Their friend Hud films testimonials for Rob during the party. Beth, a former romantic partner of Rob, brings a new man to the party.\n\nBeth and Rob argue over her guest and Beth leaves, and a supposed earthquake strikes shortly after, causing a brief citywide power outage; the local news reports a capsized [[oil tanker]] near [[Liberty Island]]. When the party-goers leave the building, the severed head of the [[Statue of Liberty]] is hurled into the street in front of them. Hud records [[Clover (creature)|an enormous creature]] several blocks away collapsing the [[Woolworth Building]]. Later, during the city's evacuation, the creature's tail destroys the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], killing Jason and several other people. News reports show the [[Army National Guard]]'s [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] attacking the monster. Smaller \"parasite\" creatures fall off its body and attack nearby pedestrians and soldiers.{{efn|The creatures are called HSP or \"Human-Scale Parasites\" in the [[Blu-ray]]'s Special Investigation Mode.}}\n\nRob listens to a phone message from Beth, stating that she is trapped in her apartment at the [[Time Warner Center]] and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and another party-goer, Marlena, venture into [[Midtown Manhattan]] to rescue Beth. By 3:17 am, they get caught in a battle between the creature and the Army National Guard and run into the subway, soon attacked by several of the parasitic creatures; during the scuffle, Marlena is bitten by one. The four escape the subway and come to a command center and field hospital. Marlena bleeds from her eyes in reaction to the bite. She is dragged into a tent, where she appears to explode. Rob, intending to save Beth, persuades one of the military leaders to let him go. The man then tells Rob when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its \"Hammer Down Protocol,\" which will destroy [[Manhattan]] in an attempt to kill the monster.\n\nThe group rescues Beth, impaled on exposed [[rebar]], and the four make their way to the evacuation site at [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they encounter the creature once more. Lily is rushed into a departing [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] helicopter and escapes. Moments later, Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being bombed. The bombing causes the creature to fall, but it lunges at the group's helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.\n\nLess than an hour later, a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warns that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in fifteen minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee; Hud retrieves the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch as [[air raid sirens|sirens]] blare and the bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge crumbles and the camera gets knocked out of Rob's hand and buried beneath some rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off, with both screaming while the monster roars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Cloverfield characters}}\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Marlena, a fellow partygoer and Hud's love interest who assists Rob in getting Beth out of NYC\n* [[Jessica Lucas]] as Lily, Jason's fiance who goes with Rob to rescue Beth, and ends up escaping NYC\n* [[T.J.

Some scenes were also written specifically for the audition process, not intended for use in the film. Despite not being told the premise of the film, Caplan stated that she accepted a role in ''Cloverfield'' solely because she was a fan of the Abrams-produced ''Lost'' (in which her former ''[[Related]]'' co-star [[Kiele Sanchez]] was a recurring character), and her experience of discovering its true nature initially caused her to state that she would not sign on for a film in the future \"without knowing full well what it is\".

This may have been either the satellite owned by the fictional Japanese media company, Tagruato, or the creature itself. A company news piece on the Tagruato website mentions that a piece of the Japanese Government's ChimpanzII satellite fell off into the Atlantic. Producers Bryan Burk and J. J.

According to Burk, \"The creative team has fleshed out an entire backstory which, if we're lucky, we might get to explore in future films\".

Obviously it also depends on how ''Cloverfield'' does worldwide and all of those things too, but really, for us creatively, we just want to find something that would be another challenge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Orlando Parfitt |title=Matt Reeves Clarifies ''Cloverfield'' Sequel Status |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=February 1, 2008 |url=http://uk.beta.rottentomatoes.com/m/cloverfield/news/1706543/ |accessdate=February 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416144348/http://uk.beta.rottentomatoes.com/m/cloverfield/news/1706543/ |archivedate=April 16, 2008 }}</ref>}}\n\nIn September 2008, when asked by [[CraveOnline]] what the current status is on ''Cloverfield 2'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Gossip |first=Latin |url=http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/tv/article/jj-abrams-is-on-the-fringe-70775 |title=J.J Abrams is on the Fringe |publisher=CraveOnline.com |date=September 11, 2008 |accessdate=December 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225142147/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/tv/article/jj-abrams-is-on-the-fringe-70775 |archivedate=February 25, 2011}}</ref> Abrams stated that at this point, they were still discussing it; however, he still feels reluctant to work on a sequel.

Abrams]], and written by [[Drew Goddard]]. The film stars [[Michael Stahl-David]], [[Odette Yustman]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Jessica Lucas]], [[Lizzy Caplan]], and [[Mike Vogel]]. The film uses a [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] motif to follow five young [[New York City]] residents fleeing from a massive monster and various other smaller creatures that attack the city while they are having a farewell party.\n\nDevelopment began when producer [[J. J. Abrams]] started conceptualizing a new monster and enlisted [[Neville Page]] to design the creature, referred to as [[Clover (creature)|Clover]]. In February 2007, the project was secretly [[greenlit]] by [[Paramount Pictures]] and produced by Abrams' [[Bad Robot Productions]]. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Los Angeles]] that same year. During production, the project went under several working titles, including ''Slusho'', ''Cheese'' and ''Greyshot''. As part of a [[viral marketing]] campaign, a teaser trailer was released ahead of screenings of ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' without a title attached. The film's official title was revealed in a second teaser trailer attached to screenings of ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]''. With limited details revealed about the film prior to release, it garnered online speculation, including forums and websites dedicated to uncovering any hidden information about the film. Several tie-ins, including a [[prequel]] [[manga]] series, were released as part of the film's marketing campaign.\n\n''Cloverfield'' was released on January 18, 2008 and received positive reviews from film critics. Many praised Reeves' direction and the film's [[cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] style narrative. It earned $170.8 million worldwide at the box office against a $25 million budget. The film served as the first installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], followed by ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' in 2016 and ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/next-cloverfield-movie-god-particle-jj-abrams/ |title='God Particle' Is the Next Film in the 'Cloverfield' Universe |website=Collider}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\nThe film is presented as [[Found footage (film technique)|footage]] from a personal camcorder recovered by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the area \"formerly known as [[Central Park]]\", bearing a disclaimer stating multiple sightings of a case designated \"Cloverfield\".\n\nRob has a farewell party thrown for him by his brother Jason and Jason's girlfriend Lily, in celebration of Rob's new job in Japan. Their friend Hud films testimonials for Rob during the party. Beth, a former romantic partner of Rob, brings a new man to the party.\n\nBeth and Rob argue over her guest and Beth leaves, and a supposed earthquake strikes shortly after, causing a brief citywide power outage; the local news reports a capsized [[oil tanker]] near [[Liberty Island]]. When the party-goers leave the building, the severed head of the [[Statue of Liberty]] is hurled into the street in front of them. Hud records [[Clover (creature)|an enormous creature]] several blocks away collapsing the [[Woolworth Building]]. Later, during the city's evacuation, the creature's tail destroys the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], killing Jason and several other people. News reports show the [[Army National Guard]]'s [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Infantry Division]] attacking the monster. Smaller \"parasite\" creatures fall off its body and attack nearby pedestrians and soldiers.{{efn|The creatures are called HSP or \"Human-Scale Parasites\" in the [[Blu-ray]]'s Special Investigation Mode.}}\n\nRob listens to a phone message from Beth, stating that she is trapped in her apartment at the [[Time Warner Center]] and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and another party-goer, Marlena, venture into [[Midtown Manhattan]] to rescue Beth. By 3:17 am, they get caught in a battle between the creature and the Army National Guard and run into the subway, soon attacked by several of the parasitic creatures; during the scuffle, Marlena is bitten by one. The four escape the subway and come to a command center and field hospital. Marlena bleeds from her eyes in reaction to the bite. She is dragged into a tent, where she appears to explode. Rob, intending to save Beth, persuades one of the military leaders to let him go. The man then tells Rob when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its \"Hammer Down Protocol,\" which will destroy [[Manhattan]] in an attempt to kill the monster.\n\nThe group rescues Beth, impaled on exposed [[rebar]], and the four make their way to the evacuation site at [[Grand Central Terminal]], where they encounter the creature once more. Lily is rushed into a departing [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] helicopter and escapes. Moments later, Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being bombed. The bombing causes the creature to fall, but it lunges at the group's helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.\n\nLess than an hour later, a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warns that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in fifteen minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee; Hud retrieves the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch as [[air raid sirens|sirens]] blare and the bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge crumbles and the camera gets knocked out of Rob's hand and buried beneath some rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off, with both screaming while the monster roars.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Cloverfield characters}}\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Lizzy Caplan]] as Marlena, a fellow partygoer and Hud's love interest who assists Rob in getting Beth out of NYC\n* [[Jessica Lucas]] as Lily, Jason's fiance who goes with Rob to rescue Beth, and ends up escaping NYC\n* [[T.J.

The fun of this movie was that it might not have been the only movie being made that night, there might be another movie! In today's day and age of people filming their lives on their camera phones and [[Handycam]]s, uploading it to [[YouTube]]... That was kind of exciting thinking about that.<ref>{{cite news |author=SpookyDan |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10927 |title=''Cloverfield'' Sequel Talk, Violent Plans! |publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |date=January 17, 2008 |accessdate=January 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308181518/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10927 |archivedate=March 8, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\nIn another interview, Reeves stated:\n\n{{quote|There's a moment on the Brooklyn Bridge, and there was a guy filming something on the side of the bridge, and Hud sees him filming and he turns over and he sees the ship that's been capsized and sees the headless Statue of Liberty, and then he turns back and this guy's briefly filming him. In my mind that was two movies intersecting for a brief moment, and I thought there was something interesting in the idea that this incident happened and there are so many different points of view, and there are several different movies at least happening that evening and we just saw one piece of another.<ref name=\"merry\"/>}}\n\nReeves also pointed out that the final scene on Coney Island shows something falling into the ocean in the background without an explanation. This may have been either the satellite owned by the fictional Japanese media company, Tagruato, or the creature itself. A company news piece on the Tagruato website mentions that a piece of the Japanese Government's ChimpanzII satellite fell off into the Atlantic. Producers Bryan Burk and J. J. Abrams also revealed their thoughts on possible sequels to ''Entertainment Weekly''. According to Burk, \"The creative team has fleshed out an entire backstory which, if we're lucky, we might get to explore in future films\". Abrams stated that he does not want to rush into the development of the sequel merely because the first film has been a success; he explained that he would rather create a sequel that is true to the previous film.<ref name=\"EWsequel\">{{cite magazine |author=SpookyDan |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/10991 |title=''Cloverfield'' Monster Has History, More Sequel Talk! |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 27, 2008 |accessdate=January 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218204747/http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/10991/ |archivedate=February 18, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of January 2008, Reeves entered early talks with Paramount to direct a sequel, which would likely be filmed before Reeves's other project, ''The Invisible Woman''.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117979910.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Paramount sows ''Cloverfield'' sequel |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=January 30, 2008 |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |quote=There's a good chance the sequel will be Reeves' next film, in which case he will direct 'The Invisible Woman' afterward.

The thing about doing a sequel is that I think we all really feel protective of that experience.

Despite the historical nomenclature \"imaginary\", complex numbers are regarded in the mathematical sciences as just as \"real\" as the real numbers, and are fundamental in many aspects of the scientific description of the natural world.{{refn|group=\"note\"|For an extensive account of the history, from initial skepticism to ultimate acceptance, See {{harv|Bourbaki|1998}}, pages 18-24.}}<ref>{{cite book |title=The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe |edition=reprinted |first1=Roger |last1=Penrose |publisher=Random House |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4464-1820-8 |pages=72\u201373 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWTNCwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=VWTNCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 Extract of p. 73]: \"complex numbers, as much as reals, and perhaps even more, find a unity with nature that is truly remarkable.

For example, the equation\n:<math>(x+1)^2 = -9</math>\nhas no real solution, since the square of a real number cannot be negative. Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem.

Furthermore, complex numbers can also be divided by nonzero complex numbers. Overall, the complex number system is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nGeometrically, complex numbers extend the concept of the [[one-dimensional]] [[number line]] to the [[two-dimensional]] [[complex plane]] by using the [[horizontal axis]] for the real part and the [[vertical axis]] for the imaginary part. The complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can be identified with the point {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} in the complex plane. A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]]; the points for these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane.  A complex number whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number; its point lies on the horizontal axis of the complex plane.  Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form, which associates each complex number with its distance from the origin (its magnitude) and with a particular angle known as the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of this complex number.\n\nThe geometric identification of the complex numbers with the complex plane, which is a [[Euclidean plane]] (<math>\\mathbb R^2</math>), makes their structure as a real 2-dimensional [[vector space]] evident. Real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be taken as components of a vector with respect to the canonical [[standard basis]]. The addition of complex numbers is thus immediately depicted as the usual component-wise addition of vectors. However, the complex numbers allow for a richer algebraic structure, comprising additional operations, that are not necessarily available in a vector space; for example, the multiplication of two complex numbers always yields again a complex number, and should not be mistaken for the usual \"products\" involving vectors, like the ''[[scalar multiplication]]'', the ''[[scalar product]]'' or other (sesqui)linear [[bilinear form|forms]], available in many vector spaces; and the broadly exploited ''[[vector product]]'' exists only in an [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-dependent form in three dimensions.\n\n==Definition==\n\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[complex plane]].

For example, {{math|2 + 3''i''}} is a complex number.<ref>{{cite book|title=College algebra |last=Axler |first=Sheldon |page=262|publisher=Wiley|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThis way, a complex number is defined as a [[polynomial]] with real coefficients in the single indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, for which the relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} is imposed. Based on this definition, complex numbers can be added and multiplied, using the addition and multiplication for polynomials. The relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} induces the equalities {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''</sup> {{=}} 1, ''i''<sup>4''k''+1</sup> {{=}} ''i'', ''i''<sup>4''k''+2</sup> {{=}} \u22121,}} and {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''+3</sup> {{=}} \u2212''i'',}} which hold for all integers {{mvar|k}}; these allow the reduction of any polynomial that results from the addition and multiplication of complex numbers to a linear polynomial in {{mvar|i}}, again of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}} with real coefficients {{mvar|a, b.}}\n\nThe real number {{mvar|a}} is called the ''real part'' of the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}; the real number {{mvar|b}} is called its ''imaginary part''.

Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, that is, {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'' < 0,}} it is common to write {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''{{!}}b{{!}}i''}} instead of {{math|''a'' + (\u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'')''i''}}; for example, for {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u22124,}} {{math|3 \u2212 4''i''}} can be written instead of {{math|3 + (\u22124)''i''.}}\n\nSince in polynomials with real coefficients the multiplication of the indeterminate {{math|''i''}} and a real is commutative, the polynomial {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} may be written as {{math|''a'' + ''ib''.}} This is often expedient for imaginary parts denoted by expressions, for example, when {{mvar|b}} is a radical.<ref>See {{harv|Ahlfors|1979}}.</ref>\n\nThe real part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Re(''z'')}} or {{math|\u211c(''z'')}}; the imaginary part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Im(''z'')}} or {{math|\u2111(''z'')}}.

Because each complex number is represented in two dimensions, visually graphing a complex function would require the perception of a [[four dimensional space]], which is possible only in projections. Because of this, other ways of visualizing complex functions have been designed.\n\nIn [[Domain coloring]] the output dimensions are represented by color and brightness, respectively. Each point in the complex plane as domain is ''ornated'', typically with ''color'' representing the argument of the complex number, and ''brightness'' representing the magnitude. Dark spots mark moduli near zero, brighter spots are farther away from the origin, the gradation may be discontinuous, but is assumed as monotonous. The colors often vary in steps of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} for {{math|0}} to {{math|2{{pi}}}} from red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, to magenta. These plots are called [[Domain coloring|color wheel graphs]]. This provides a simple way to visualize the functions without losing information.

Unlike domain coloring, Riemann surfaces can represent [[multivalued function]]s like <math>\\sqrt{z}</math>.\n\n==History==\nThe solution in [[nth root|radicals]] (without [[trigonometric functions]]) of a general [[cubic equation]] contains the square roots of [[negative numbers]] when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the [[rational root test]] if the cubic is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] (the so-called [[casus irreducibilis]]). This conundrum led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,<ref>{{cite book|first=Morris |last= Kline|title=A history of mathematical thought, volume 1|page=253}}</ref> though his understanding was rudimentary.\n\nWork on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every [[polynomial equation]] of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an [[algebraically closed field]], where any polynomial equation has a [[Root of a function|root]].\n\nMany mathematicians contributed to the development of complex numbers.

They were soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's formula for a cubic equation of the form <math>x^3 = px + q</math>{{refn|group=\"note\"|In modern notation, Tartaglia's solution is based on expanding the cube of the sum of two cube roots: <math>\\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right)^3 = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv} \\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right) + u + v</math> With <math>x = \\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}</math>, <math>p = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv}</math>, <math>q = u + v</math>, {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} can be expressed in terms of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} as <math>u = q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math> and <math>v = q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math>, respectively.

Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic equations with real roots then, as later{{when|date=March 2020}} mathematicians{{who|date=March 2020}} showed rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus irreducibilis|is unavoidable]]. [[Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.\n\nThe term \"imaginary\" for these quantities was coined by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature<ref>{{Citation |title=La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie &#124; The Geometry of Ren\u00e9 Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |year=1954 |origyear=1637 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=978-0-486-60068-0 |page= |url=https://archive.org/details/geometryofrenede00rend |accessdate=20 April 2011 }}</ref>\n{{quote|[...] sometimes only imaginary, that is one can imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity that matches that which we imagine.\n''([...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on peut toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque \u00e9quation, mais qu'il n'y a quelquefois aucune quantit\u00e9 qui corresponde \u00e0 celle qu'on imagine.)''}}\nA further source of confusion was that the equation <math>\\sqrt{-1}^2=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math> seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity <math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab}</math>, which is valid for non-negative real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and which was also used in complex number calculations with one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} positive and the other negative.

This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol {{math|''i''}} in place of {{sqrt|\u22121}} to guard against this mistake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Even so, Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today. In his elementary algebra text book, [[Elements of Algebra]], he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.\n\nIn the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 [[Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which bears his name, [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta. </math>\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]]:\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta } </math>\n\nby formally manipulating complex [[power series]] and observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential identities.\n\nThe idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane ([[#Complex plane|above]]) was first described by [[Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John Wallis|Wallis's]] ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nWessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed. In 1806 [[Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#History|fundamental theorem of algebra]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] had earlier published an essentially [[topology|topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about \"the true metaphysics of the square root of \u22121\". It was not until 1831 that he overcame these doubts and published his treatise on complex numbers as points in the plane,<ref name=Gauss1831>{{cite web|last=Gauss|first=C.F.|title=Anzeige von Theoria residuorum biquadraticorum, commentatio secunda (Notice on the Theory of Biquadratic Residues, second treatise)|journal=G\u00f6ttingische gelehrte Anzeigen|date=1831|url=https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/view/gauss_theoria_1831?p=6|page=638|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=Ewald>{{cite web|last=Ewald|first=William B.|title=From Kant to Hilbert: A Source Book in the Foundations of Mathematics|volume=1|page=313|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=rykSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA313|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref> largely establishing modern notation and terminology. \n\n<blockquote>If one formerly contemplated this subject from a false point of view and therefore found a mysterious darkness, this is in large part attributable to clumsy terminology.

Argand called <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''direction factor'', and <math>r = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</math> the ''modulus''; Cauchy (1828) called <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''reduced form'' (l'expression r\u00e9duite) and apparently introduced the term ''argument''; Gauss used {{math|''i''}} for <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math>, introduced the term ''complex number'' for {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}, and called {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup>}} the ''norm''. The expression ''direction coefficient'', often used for <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math>, is due to Hankel (1867), and ''absolute value,'' for ''modulus,'' is due to Weierstrass.\n\nLater classical writers on the general theory include [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto H\u00f6lder]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and many others.\n\n==Relations and operations==\n===Equality===\nTwo complex numbers are equal [[if and only if]] both their real and imaginary parts are equal. That is, complex numbers <math>z_1</math> and <math>z_2</math> are equal if and only if\n<math>\\operatorname{Re}(z_{1}) = \\operatorname{Re}(z_{2})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Im} (z_{1}) = \\operatorname{Im} (z_{2})</math>. Nonzero complex numbers written in [[polar form]] are equal if and only if they have the same magnitude and their arguments differ by an integer multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}}}.\n\n===Ordering===\nSince complex numbers are naturally thought of as existing on a two-dimensional plane, there is no natural [[linear ordering]] on the set of complex numbers. In fact, there is no [[linear ordering]] on the complex numbers that is compatible with addition and multiplication \u2013 the complex numbers cannot have the structure of an [[ordered field]]. This is because any square in an ordered field is at least {{math|0}}, but {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\n\n===Conjugate===\n{{See also|Complex conjugate}}\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|Geometric representation of {{mvar|z}} and its conjugate <math>\\overline{z}</math> in the complex plane]]\nThe ''[[complex conjugate]]'' of the complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} is given by {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''yi''}}. It is denoted by either <math>\\overline{z}</math> or {{math|''z''*}}.<ref>For the former notation, See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref> This [[unary operation]] on complex numbers cannot be expressed by applying only their basic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nGeometrically, <math>\\overline{z}</math> is the [[reflection symmetry|\"reflection\"]] of {{mvar|z}} about the real axis. Conjugating twice gives the original complex number\n:<math>\\overline{\\overline{z}}=z,</math>\n\nwhich makes this operation an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]. The reflection leaves both the real part and the magnitude of <math>z</math> unchanged, that is\n:<math>\\operatorname{Re}(\\overline{z}) = \\operatorname{Re}(z)\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad |\\overline{z}| = |z|.</math>\n\nThe imaginary part and the argument of a complex number <math>z</math> change their sign under conjugation\n:<math>\\operatorname{Im}(\\overline{z}) = -\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{arg}(\\overline{z}) \\equiv -\\operatorname{arg}(z) \\pmod {2\\pi}.</math>\n\nFor details on argument and magnitude, see the section on [[#Polar form|Polar form]].\n\nThe product of a complex number <math>z= x + yi</math> and its conjugate is always a positive real number and equals the square of the magnitude of each:\n:<math>z\\cdot \\overline{z} = x^2 + y^2 = |z|^2 = |\\overline{z}|^2.</math>\n\nThis property can be used to convert a fraction with a complex denominator to an equivalent fraction with a real denominator by expanding both numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the given denominator. This process is sometimes called \"[[rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalization]]\" of the denominator (although the denominator in the final expression might be an irrational real number), because it resembles the method to remove roots from simple expressions in a denominator.\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number {{mvar|z}} can be extracted using the conjugation:\n: <math>\\operatorname{Re}(z) = \\dfrac{z+\\overline{z}}{2},\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{Im}(z) = \\dfrac{z-\\overline{z}}{2i}.</math>\nMoreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.\n\nConjugation distributes over the basic complex arithmetic operations:\n: <math>\\overline{z\\pm w} = \\overline{z} \\pm \\overline{w},</math>\n: <math>\\overline{z\\cdot w} = \\overline{z} \\cdot\\overline{w},\\quad \\overline{z/w} = \\overline{z}/\\overline{w}.</math>\n\nConjugation is also employed in [[inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry studying reflections more general than ones about a line. In the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis of electrical circuits]], the complex conjugate is used in finding the equivalent impedance when the [[maximum power transfer theorem]] is looked for.\n\n===Addition and subtraction===\n[[File:Vector Addition.svg|200px|right|thumb|Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram.]]\n\nTwo complex numbers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are most easily [[addition|added]] by separately adding their real and imaginary parts of the summands. That is to say:\n:<math>a + b =(x+yi) + (u+vi) = (x+u) + (y+v)i.</math>\nSimilarly, [[subtraction]] can be performed as\n:<math>a - b =(x+yi) - (u+vi) = (x-u) + (y-v)i.</math>\n\nUsing the visualization of complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, interpreted as points in the complex plane, is the point obtained by building a [[parallelogram]] from the three vertices <math>O</math>, and the points of the arrows labeled <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> (provided that they are not on a line). Equivalently, calling these points <math>A,\\; B,</math> respectively and the fourth point of the parallelogram <math>X,</math> the [[triangle]]s <math>OAB</math> and <math>XBA</math> are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. A visualization of the subtraction can be achieved by considering addition of the negative [[subtrahend]].\n\n===Multiplication===\nSince the real part, the imaginary part, and the indeterminate <math>i</math> in a complex number are all considered as numbers in themselves, two complex numbers, given as <math>z=x+yi</math> and <math>w= u+vi</math> are multiplied under the rules of the [[distributive property]], the [[commutative property|commutative properties]] and the defining property <math>i^2 = -1</math> in the following way\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz\\cdot w &= (x+yi)\\cdot (u+vi)  & \\\\\n&=x(u+vi) + yi(u+vi)  &&\\text{by the (right) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + xvi + yiu + yivi &&\\text{by the (left) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + yivi + xvi + yiu &&\\text{by the commutativity of addition} \\\\\n&=xu + yvi^2 + xvi + yui &&\\text{by the commutativity of multiplication} \\\\\n&=(xu + yvi^2) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the associativity of addition} \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the defining property of } i \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i &&\\text{by the distributive law}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Reciprocal and division===\nUsing the conjugation, the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a nonzero complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} can always be broken down to\n: <math>\\frac{1}{z}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{z \\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{x^2+y^2}=\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i,</math>\n\nsince ''non-zero'' implies that <math>x^2 + y^2</math> is greater than zero.\n\nThis can be used to express a division of an arbitrary complex number <math>w= u+vi</math> by a non-zero complex number <math>z</math> as\n:<math>\\frac {w}{z}= w\\cdot \\frac {1}{z}= (u+vi)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i\\right)= \\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}\\left((ux+vy)+(vx-uy)i\\right).</math>\n\n===Multiplication and division in polar form===\n[[File:Complex multi.svg|right|thumb|Multiplication of {{math|2 + ''i''}} (blue triangle) and {{math|3 + ''i''}} (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by [[square root of 5|{{sqrt|5}}]], the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]\nFormulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler in polar form than the corresponding formulas in Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers {{math|1=''z''<sub>1</sub> = ''r''<sub>1</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|1=''z''<sub>2</sub> = ''r''<sub>2</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub>)}}, because of the trigonometric identities\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = \\cos(a + b)</math>\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\sin(b) + \\sin(a)\\cos(b) = \\sin(a + b)</math>\n\nwe may derive\n\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\\cos(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2)).</math>\nIn other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to a quarter-[[turn (geometry)|turn]] counter-clockwise, which gives back {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of\n:<math>(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i. </math>\nSince the real and imaginary part of {{math|5 + 5''i''}} are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 (in [[radian]]). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangles are [[arctan]](1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) </math>\nholds. As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this \u2013 known as [[Machin-like formulas]] \u2013 are used for high-precision approximations of [[pi|\u03c0]].\n\nSimilarly, division is given by\n:<math>\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\left(\\cos(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2)\\right).</math>\n\n===Square root===\n{{see also|Square root#Square roots of negative and complex numbers|l1=Square roots of negative and complex numbers}}\nThe square roots of {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} (with {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}) are <math> \\pm (\\gamma + \\delta i)</math>, where\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\delta = \\sgn (b) \\sqrt{\\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}},</math>\n\nwhere sgn is the [[sign function|signum]] function.

For extending this to the complex domain, one can start from Euler's formula. It implies that, if a complex number {{mvar|z}} is written in [[polar form]]\n:<math> z = r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ),</math>\nthen its [[complex logarithm]] should be\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\ln(r) + \\varphi i.</math>\n\nHowever, because cosine and sine are periodic functions,  the addition to <math>\\varphi</math> of an integer multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}}}. does not change {{mvar|z}}. For example, <math>e^{i\\pi} = e^{3i\\pi} = -1</math>, so both <math>i \\pi</math> and <math>3i\\pi</math> are possible values for the natural logarithm of <math>-1</math>.\n\nTherefore the complex logarithm must be defined as a [[multivalued function]]:\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\left\\{ \\ln(r) + \\varphi i+ 2\\pi ki \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nAlternatively, a [[branch cut]] can be used to define a true function. If {{mvar|z}} is not a negative real number, the [[principal value]] of the complex logarithm is obtained with <math>-\\pi < \\varphi < \\pi.</math> This is an [[analytic function]] outside the negative real numbers, but it cannot be prolongated to a function that is continuous at any negative real number.\n\nIt follows that if {{mvar|z}} is as above, and if {{mvar|t}} is another complex number, then the ''exponentiation'' is the multivalued function\n:<math>z^t=\\left\\{e^{t\\ln r}\\,(\\cos(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt)+i\\sin(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt))\\}\\mid k\\in \\mathbb Z\\right\\}</math>\n\n====Integer and fractional exponents====\n{{visualisation_complex_number_roots.svg}}\nIf, in the preceding formula, {{mvar|t}} is an integer, then the sine and the cosine are independent of {{mvar|k}}. Thus, if the exponent {{mvar|n}} is an integer, then <math>z^n</math> is well defined, and the exponentiation formula simplifies to [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n:<math> z^{n}=(r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ))^n = r^n \\, (\\cos n\\varphi + i \\sin n \\varphi).</math>\n\nThe {{mvar|n}} [[Nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are given by\n:<math>z^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]r \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right) + i \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)</math>\nfor {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2212 1}}. (Here <math>\\sqrt[n]r</math> is the usual (positive) {{mvar|n}}th root of the positive real number {{mvar|r}}.) Because sine and cosine are periodic, other integer values of {{mvar|k}} do not give other values.\n\nWhile the {{mvar|n}}th root of a positive real number {{mvar|r}} is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number {{mvar|c}} satisfying {{math|1=''c''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''r''}}, there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex {{mvar|n}}th root of a complex number. Therefore, the {{mvar|n}}th root is a [[multivalued function|{{mvar|n}}-valued function]] of {{mvar|z}}. This implies that, contrary to the case of positive real numbers, one has  \n:<math>(z^n)^{1/n} \\ne z,</math>\nsince the left-hand side consists of {{mvar|n}} values, and the right-hand side is a single value.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Field structure===\nThe set '''C''' of complex numbers is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref> Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number {{mvar|z}}, its [[additive inverse]] {{math|\u2212''z''}} is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero complex number has a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}:\n:<math>z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1,</math>\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1.</math>\nThese two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a field.\n\nUnlike the reals, '''C''' is not an [[ordered field]], that is to say, it is not possible to define a relation {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub> < ''z''<sub>2</sub>}} that is compatible with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is necessarily positive, so {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}} precludes the existence of an [[total order|ordering]] on '''C'''.<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, page 25.</ref>\n\nWhen the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to reflect that fact.

This property does not hold for the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]] '''Q''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} does not have a rational root, since [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] is not a rational number) nor the real numbers '''R''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''}} does not have a real root for {{math|''a'' > 0}}, since the square of {{mvar|x}} is positive for any real number {{mvar|x}}).\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], or [[topology|topological]] ones such as the [[winding number]], or a proof combining [[Galois theory]] and the fact that any real polynomial of ''odd'' degree has at least one real root.\n\nBecause of this fact, theorems that hold ''for any algebraically closed field'', apply to '''C'''. For example, any non-empty complex [[square matrix]] has at least one (complex) [[eigenvalue]].\n\n===Algebraic characterization===\nThe field '''C''' has the following three properties: first, it has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. This means that {{math|1=1 + 1 + \u22ef + 1 \u2260 0}} for any number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its [[transcendence degree]] over '''Q''', the [[prime field]] of '''C''', is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Third, it is [[algebraically closed]] (see above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a field) to '''C'''. For example, the [[algebraic closure]] of [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] also satisfies these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic (as fields, but not as topological fields).<ref>{{citation\n | last = Marker | first = David\n | editor1-last = Marker | editor1-first = D.\n | editor2-last = Messmer | editor2-first = M.\n | editor3-last = Pillay | editor3-first = A.\n | contribution = Introduction to the Model Theory of Fields\n | contribution-url = https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235423155\n | isbn = 978-3-540-60741-0\n | mr = 1477154\n | pages = 1\u201337\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin\n | series = Lecture Notes in Logic\n | title = Model theory of fields\n | volume = 5\n | year = 1996}}</ref> Also, '''C''' is isomorphic to the field of complex [[Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that '''C''' contains many proper subfields that are isomorphic to '''C'''.\n\n===Characterization as a topological field===\nThe preceding characterization of '''C''' describes only the algebraic aspects of '''C'''. That is to say, the properties of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]] and [[continuity (topology)|continuity]], which matter in areas such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt with. The following description of '''C''' as a [[topological ring|topological field]] (that is, a field that is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], which allows the notion of convergence) does take into account the topological properties. '''C''' contains a subset {{math|''P''}} (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:\n* {{math|''P''}} is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.\n* If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are distinct elements of {{math|''P''}}, then either {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}} or {{math|''y'' \u2212 ''x''}} is in {{math|''P''}}.\n* If {{mvar|S}} is any nonempty subset of {{math|''P''}}, then {{math|1=''S'' + ''P'' = ''x'' + ''P''}} for some {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\nMoreover, '''C''' has a nontrivial [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[automorphism]] {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''*}} (namely the complex conjugation), such that {{math|''x\u2009x''*}} is in {{math|''P''}} for any nonzero {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\n\nAny field {{mvar|F}} with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the sets {{math|1= ''B''(''x'',\u2009''p'') = {\u2009''y'' {{!}} ''p'' \u2212 (''y'' \u2212 ''x'')(''y'' \u2212 ''x'')* \u2208 ''P''\u2009}\u2009}} as a [[base (topology)|base]], where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the field and {{mvar|p}} ranges over {{math|''P''}}. With this topology {{mvar|F}} is isomorphic as a ''topological'' field to '''C'''.\n\nThe only [[connected space|connected]] [[locally compact]] [[topological ring|topological fields]] are '''R''' and '''C'''. This gives another characterization of '''C''' as a topological field, since '''C''' can be distinguished from '''R''' because the nonzero complex numbers are [[connected space|connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.4|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\n==Formal construction==\n===Construction as ordered pairs===\n[[William Rowan Hamilton]] introduced the approach to define the set {{math|'''C'''}} of complex numbers<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Numbers|first=Leo |last=Corry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|pages=215\u201316}}</ref> as the set {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} of {{nowrap|[[ordered pair]]s {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}}}} of real numbers, in which the following rules for addition and multiplication are imposed:<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref>\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n(a, b) + (c, d) &= (a + c, b + d)\\\\\n(a, b) \\cdot (c, d) &= (ac - bd, bc + ad).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is then just a matter of notation to express {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} as {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n===Construction as a quotient field===\nThough this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic nature of {{math|'''C'''}} more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations that behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the [[distributive law]]\n:<math>(x+y) z = xz + yz</math>\nmust hold for any three elements {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} of a field. The set {{math|'''R'''}} of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial {{math|''p''(''X'')}} with real [[coefficient]]s is an expression of the form\n:<math>a_nX^n+\\dotsb+a_1X+a_0,</math>\nwhere the {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}} of all such polynomials with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. This ring is called the [[polynomial ring]] over the real numbers.\n\nThe set of complex numbers is defined as the [[quotient ring]] {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>   This extension field contains two square roots of {{math|\u22121}}, namely (the [[coset]]s of) {{math|''X''}} and {{math|\u2212''X''}}, respectively. (The cosets of) {{math|1}} and {{math|''X''}} form a basis of {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}} as a real [[vector space]], which means that each element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a [[linear combination]] in these two elements. Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} of real numbers.  The quotient ring is a field, because {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} is [[Irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the ideal it generates is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]].\n\nThe formulas for addition and multiplication in the ring {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}}, modulo the relation {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}}, correspond to the formulas for addition and multiplication of complex numbers defined as ordered pairs.  So the two definitions of the field {{math|'''C'''}} are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (as fields).\n\nAccepting that {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, since it is an [[algebraic extension]] of {{math|'''R'''}} in this approach, {{math|'''C'''}} is therefore the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n===Matrix representation of complex numbers===<!-- .This section is linked from [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] -->\nComplex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can also be represented by {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that have the following form:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nHere the entries {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and [[matrix multiplication|product]] of such matrices, the product being:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  c &   -d  \\\\\n  d & \\;\\; c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n  ac-bd &   -ad-bc  \\\\\n  bc+ad & \\;\\; -bd+ac\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be expressed in terms of [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] by using this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:\n:<math> |z|^2 =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a & -b  \\\\\n  b &  a\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= a^2 + b^2.\n</math>\nThe conjugate <math>\\overline z</math> corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.\n\nThough this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most common, many other representations arise from matrices ''other than'' <math>\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\1 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)</math> that square to the negative of the [[identity matrix]]. See the article on [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]] for other representations of complex numbers.\n\n==Complex analysis==\n[[File:Sin1perz.png|thumb|270px|[[Domain coloring|Color wheel graph]] of {{math|sin(1/''z'')}}. Black parts inside refer to numbers having large absolute values.]]\n{{main|Complex analysis}}\n<!--\n[[File:Color complex plot.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Domain coloring]] plot of the function\n<br /><math>f(x) = \\tfrac{(x^2 - 1)(x - 2 - i)^2}{x^2 + 2 + 2 i}</math><br />\nThe hue represents the function argument, while the saturation and [[Lightness (color)|value]] represent the magnitude.]]\n\nThe absolute value has three important properties:\n\n:<math> | z | \\geq 0, \\,</math> where <math> | z | = 0 \\,</math> [[if and only if]] <math> z = 0</math>\n\n:<math> | z + w | \\leq | z | + | w | \\,</math> ([[triangle inequality]])\n\n:<math> | z \\cdot w | = | z | \\cdot | w | </math>\n\nfor all complex numbers {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}. These imply that {{math|1={{!}}1{{!}} = 1}} and {{math|1={{!}}''z''/''w''{{!}} = {{!}}''z''{{!}}/{{!}}''w''{{!}}}}. By defining the '''distance''' function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and we can therefore talk about [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]].\n\nIn general, distances between complex numbers are given by the distance function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, which turns the complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and introduces the ideas of [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]]. All of the standard properties of two dimensional space therefore hold for the complex numbers, including important properties of the modulus such as non-negativity, and the [[triangle inequality]] (<math>| z + w | \\leq | z | + | w |</math> for all {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}).\n\n-->\n\nThe study of functions of a complex variable is known as [[complex analysis]] and has enormous practical use in [[applied mathematics]] as well as in other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in [[real analysis]] or even [[number theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see [[prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, [[complex function]]s have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.\n\n===Complex exponential and related functions===\nThe notions of [[convergent series]] and [[continuous function]]s in (real) analysis have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence <!--(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' \u2265 0</sub>--> of complex numbers is said to [[convergent sequence|converge]] if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]]s, where the absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view, '''C''', endowed with the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2|</math>\nis a complete [[metric space]], which notably includes the [[triangle inequality]]\n:<math>|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|</math>\nfor any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nLike in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number of [[elementary function]]s: the ''[[exponential function]]'' {{math|exp(''z'')}}, also written {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}}, is defined as the [[infinite series]]\n:<math>\\exp(z):= 1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2\\cdot 1}+\\frac{z^3}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}+\\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}. </math>\n\nThe series defining the real trigonometric functions [[sine]] and [[cosine]], as well as the [[hyperbolic functions]] sinh and cosh, also carry over to complex arguments without change. For the other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, such as [[tangent (function)|tangent]], things are slightly more complicated, as the defining series do not converge for all complex values. Therefore, one must define them either in terms of sine, cosine and exponential, or, equivalently, by using the method of [[analytic continuation]].\n\n''[[Euler's formula]]'' states:\n:<math>\\exp(i\\varphi) = \\cos(\\varphi) + i\\sin(\\varphi) </math>\nfor any real number ''\u03c6'', in particular\n:<math>\\exp(i \\pi) = -1 </math>\nUnlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an [[infinite set|infinitude]] of complex solutions {{mvar|z}} of the equation\n:<math>\\exp(z) = w </math>\nfor any complex number {{math|''w'' \u2260 0}}. It can be shown that any such solution {{mvar|z}} \u2013 called [[complex logarithm]] of {{mvar|w}} \u2013 satisfies\n:<math>\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i\\arg(w), </math>\nwhere arg is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] defined [[#Polar form|above]], and ln the (real) [[natural logarithm]]. As arg is a [[multivalued function]], unique only up to a multiple of 2''\u03c0'', log is also multivalued. The [[principal value]] of log is often taken by restricting the imaginary part to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{open-closed|\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0}}.\n\nComplex [[exponentiation]] {{math|''z''<sup>''\u03c9''</sup>}} is defined as\n:<math>z^\\omega = \\exp(\\omega \\log z), </math>\nand is multi-valued, except when <math>\\omega</math> is an integer. For {{math|1=''\u03c9'' = 1 / ''n''}}, for some natural number {{mvar|n}}, this recovers the non-uniqueness of {{mvar|n}}th roots mentioned above.\n\nComplex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the unmodified power and logarithm identities, particularly when na\u00efvely treated as single-valued functions; see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]. For example, they do not satisfy\n:<math>a^{bc} = \\left(a^b\\right)^c.</math>\nBoth sides of the equation are multivalued by the definition of complex exponentiation given here, and the values on the left are a subset of those on the right.\n\n===Holomorphic functions===\nA function ''f''&thinsp;: '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' is called [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if it satisfies the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]]. For example, any [[Linear transformation#Definition and first consequences|'''R'''-linear]] map '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' can be written in the form\n:<math>f(z)=az+b\\overline{z}</math>\nwith complex coefficients {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. This map is holomorphic [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}. The second summand <math>b \\overline z</math> is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]].\n\nComplex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For example, any two holomorphic functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} that agree on an arbitrarily small [[open subset]] of '''C''' necessarily agree everywhere. [[Meromorphic function]]s, functions that can locally be written as {{math|''f''(''z'')/(''z'' \u2212 ''z''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>''n''</sup>}} with a holomorphic function {{mvar|f}}, still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], such as {{math|sin(1/''z'')}} at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}.\n\n==Applications==\nComplex numbers have applications in many scientific areas, including [[signal processing]], [[control theory]], [[electromagnetism]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[cartography]], and [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]]. Some of these applications are described below.\n\n===Geometry===\n====Shapes====\nThree [[collinearity|non-collinear]] points <math>u, v, w</math> in the plane determine the '''shape''' of the triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math>. Locating the points in the complex plane, this shape of a triangle may be expressed by complex arithmetic as\n:<math>S(u, v, w) = \\frac {u - w}{u - v}. </math>\nThe shape <math>S</math> of a triangle will remain the same, when the complex plane is transformed by translation or dilation (by an [[affine transformation]]), corresponding to the intuitive notion of shape, and describing [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Thus each triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math> is in a [[shape#Similarity classes|similarity class]] of triangles with the same shape.<ref>{{citation|last=Lester|first=J.A.|title=Triangles I: Shapes|journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]|volume=52|pages=30\u201354|year=1994|doi=10.1007/BF01818325}}</ref>\n\n====Fractal geometry====\n[[File:Mandelset hires.png|right|250px|thumb|The Mandelbrot set with the real and imaginary axes labeled.]]\nThe [[Mandelbrot set]] is a popular example of a fractal formed on the complex plane.

The [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be found as follows, according to [[Marden's theorem]]:<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=An Elementary Proof of Marden's Theorem|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=115|issue=4|pages=330\u201338|year=2008a|doi=10.1080/00029890.2008.11920532|issn=0002-9890|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308104622/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|archive-date=8 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=The Most Marvelous Theorem in Mathematics|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|journal=[[Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications]]|year=2008b|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208014954/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|archive-date=8 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane as {{math|1=''a'' = ''x''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''A''</sub>''i''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''x''<sub>''B''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''B''</sub>''i''}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = ''x''<sub>''C''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''C''</sub>''i''}}. Write the [[cubic equation]] <math>\\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0</math>, take its derivative, and equate the (quadratic) derivative to zero. [[Marden's Theorem]] says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers denoting the locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n[[File:Pentagon construct.gif|right|thumb|Construction of a regular pentagon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using straightedge and compass]].]]\nAs mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in '''C'''. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic number]]s \u2013 they are a principal object of study in [[algebraic number theory]]. Compared to {{overline|'''Q'''}}, the algebraic closure of '''Q''', which also contains all algebraic numbers, '''C''' has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] to the [[number field]] containing [[root of unity|roots of unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular [[nonagon]] [[compass and straightedge constructions|using only compass and straightedge]] \u2013 a purely geometric problem.\n\nAnother example are [[Gaussian integer]]s, that is, numbers of the form {{math|''x'' + ''iy''}}, where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are integers, which can be used to classify [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|sums of squares]].\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\nAnalytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example, the [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|\u03b6(''s'')}} is related to the distribution of [[prime number]]s.\n\n===Improper integrals===\nIn applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-valued [[improper integral]]s, by means of complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see [[methods of contour integration]].\n\n===Dynamic equations===\nIn [[differential equation]]s, it is common to first find all complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the [[Linear differential equation#Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients|characteristic equation]] of a [[linear differential equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''e''<sup>''rt''</sup>}}. Likewise, in [[difference equations]], the complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''r''<sup>''t''</sup>}}.\n\n=== In applied mathematics ===\n\n====Control theory====\nIn [[control theory]], systems are often transformed from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Laplace transform]]. The system's [[zeros and poles]] are then analyzed in the ''complex plane''. The [[root locus]], [[Nyquist plot]], and [[Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the complex plane.\n\nIn the root locus method, it is important whether zeros and poles are in the left or right half planes, that is, have real part greater than or less than zero. If a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are\n\n* in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],\n* all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO stability|stable]],\n* on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal stability]].\n\nIf a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a [[nonminimum phase]] system.\n\n====Signal analysis====\nComplex numbers are used in [[signal analysis]] and other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the original quantities. For a [[sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the absolute value {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} of the corresponding {{mvar|z}} is the [[amplitude]] and the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] {{math|arg(''z'')}} is the [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\nIf [[Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form\n\n:<math>x(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{X( t ) \\} </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X( t ) = A e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{ i \\phi } e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi) } </math>\n\nwhere \u03c9 represents the [[angular frequency]] and the complex number ''A'' encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.\n\nThis use is also extended into [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and [[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data compression|compress]], restore, and otherwise process [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sound|audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.\n\nAnother example, relevant to the two side bands of [[amplitude modulation]] of AM radio, is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\cos((\\omega + \\alpha)t) + \\cos\\left((\\omega - \\alpha)t\\right)\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i(\\omega + \\alpha)t} + e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left(e^{i\\alpha t} + e^{-i\\alpha t}\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(2\\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===In physics===\n\n====Electromagnetism and electrical engineering====\n{{Main|Alternating current}}\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], the [[Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]. The treatment of [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. This approach is called [[phasor]] calculus.\n\nIn electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by {{math|''j''}}, to avoid confusion with {{mvar|I}}, which is generally in use to denote [[electric current]], or, more particularly, {{mvar|i}}, which is generally in use to denote instantaneous electric current.\n\nSince the [[voltage]] in an AC [[electric circuit|circuit]] is oscillating, it can be represented as\n\n:<math> V(t) = V_0 e^{j \\omega t} = V_0 \\left (\\cos\\omega t + j \\sin\\omega t \\right ),</math>\n\nTo obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:\n\n:<math> v(t) = \\mathrm{Re}(V) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left [ V_0 e^{j \\omega t} \\right ] = V_0 \\cos \\omega t.</math>\n\nThe complex-valued signal <math>V(t)</math> is called the [[analytic signal|analytic]] representation of the real-valued, measurable signal <math>v(t)</math>.\n<ref>{{citation|last1=Grant|first1=I.S.|title=Electromagnetism|year=2008|edition=2|publisher=Manchester Physics Series|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9|last2=Phillips|first2=W.R.}}</ref>\n\n====Fluid dynamics====\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to describe [[potential flow in two dimensions]].\n\n====Quantum mechanics====\nThe complex number field is intrinsic to the [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex [[Hilbert space]]s provide the context for one such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original foundation formulas of quantum mechanics \u2013 the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] and Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] \u2013 make use of complex numbers.\n\n====Relativity====\nIn [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is [[Wick rotation|used in an essential way]] in [[quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are essential to [[spinor]]s, which are a generalization of the [[tensor]]s used in relativity.\n\n==Generalizations and related notions==\nThe process of extending the field '''R''' of reals to '''C''' is known as the [[Cayley\u2013Dickson construction]]. It can be carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and [[octonion]]s '''O''' which (as a real vector space) are of dimension&nbsp;4 and 8, respectively.\nIn this context the complex numbers have been called the '''binarions'''.<ref>Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', pp 64, Universitext, Springer {{isbn|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n\nJust as by applying the construction to reals the property of [[ordered field|ordering]] is lost, properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish with each extension. The [[quaternion]]s lose commutativity, that is, {{math|''x''\u00b7''y'' \u2260 ''y''\u00b7''x''}} for some quaternions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',}} and the multiplication of [[octonion]]s, additionally to not being commutative, fails to be associative: {{math|(''x''\u00b7''y'')\u00b7''z'' \u2260 ''x''\u00b7(''y''\u00b7''z'')}} for some octonions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',\u2009''z''.}}\n\nReals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all [[normed division algebra]]s over '''R'''. By [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] they are the only ones; the [[sedenion]]s, the next step in the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction, fail to have this structure.\n\nThe Cayley\u2013Dickson construction is closely related to the [[regular representation]] of '''C''', thought of as an '''R'''-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] (an '''R'''-vector space with a multiplication), with respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}. This means the following: the '''R'''-linear map\n:<math>\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}, z \\mapsto wz</math>\nfor some fixed complex number {{mvar|w}} can be represented by a {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} matrix (once a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}, this matrix is\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\operatorname{Re}(w) & -\\operatorname{Im}(w) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Im}(w) & \\;\\; \\operatorname{Re}(w)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>,\nthat is, the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex numbers above. While this is a [[linear representation]] of '''C''' in the [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one. Any matrix\n:<math>J = \\begin{pmatrix}p & q \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0</math>\nhas the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: {{math|1=''J''<sup>2</sup> = \u2212''I''}}. Then\n:<math>\\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>\nis also isomorphic to the field '''C''', and gives an alternative complex structure on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. This is generalized by the notion of a [[linear complex structure]].\n\n[[Hypercomplex number]]s also generalize '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. For example, this notion contains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are elements of the ring {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1)}} (as opposed to {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}}). In this ring, the equation {{math|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> = 1}} has four solutions.\n\nThe field '''R''' is the completion of '''Q''', the field of [[rational number]]s, with respect to the usual [[absolute value]] [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. Other choices of [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]] on '''Q''' lead to the fields '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] (for any [[prime number]] ''p''), which are thereby analogous to '''R'''. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing '''Q''' than '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. The algebraic closures <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> still carry a norm, but (unlike '''C''') are not complete with respect to it. The completion <math>\\mathbf{C}_p</math> of <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> turns out to be algebraically closed. This field is called ''p''-adic complex numbers by analogy.\n\nThe fields '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> and their finite field extensions, including '''C''', are [[local field]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Complex numbers}}\n* [[Algebraic surface]]\n* [[Circular motion#Using complex numbers|Circular motion using complex numbers]]\n* [[Complex-base system]]\n* [[Complex geometry]]\n* [[Eisenstein integer]]\n* [[Euler's identity]]\n* [[Geometric algebra#Unit pseudoscalars|Geometric algebra]] (which includes the complex plane as the 2-dimensional [[Spinor#Two dimensions|spinor]] subspace <math>\\mathcal{G}_2^+</math>)\n* [[Root of unity]]\n* [[Unit complex number]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n====Works cited====\n* {{Citation |last=Ahlfors |first=Lars |authorlink=Lars Ahlfors |title=Complex analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1979 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-07-000657-7}}\n* {{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|last=Apostol |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Apostol|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley |ref={{harvid|Apostol|1981}} }}\n* {{springer|id=c/c024140|title=Complex number|year=2001|first=E.D.|last=Solomentsev}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikiversity|Complex Numbers}}\n{{wikibooks|Calculus/Complex numbers}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Number/Complex Numbers}}\n* {{citation |last= Penrose |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Penrose |title= The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe |publisher= Alfred A.

For example, the equation\n:<math>(x+1)^2 = -9</math>\nhas no real solution, since the square of a real number cannot be negative. Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem. The idea is to [[field extension|extend]] the real numbers with an [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] {{math|''i''}} (sometimes called the [[imaginary unit]]) that is taken to satisfy the relation {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}, so that solutions to equations like the preceding one can be found.

The 16th-century Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] is credited with introducing complex numbers in his attempts to find solutions to [[cubic equations]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Burton |first1=David M. |title=The History of Mathematics |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |edition= 3rd |page=294 |isbn=978-0-07-009465-9 |year=1995}}</ref>\n\nFormally, the complex number system can be defined as the [[field extension|algebraic extension]] of the ordinary real numbers by an imaginary number {{math|''i''}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  This means that complex numbers can be added, subtracted, and multiplied, as polynomials in the variable {{math|''i''}}, with the rule {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}} imposed.  Furthermore, complex numbers can also be divided by nonzero complex numbers. Overall, the complex number system is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nGeometrically, complex numbers extend the concept of the [[one-dimensional]] [[number line]] to the [[two-dimensional]] [[complex plane]] by using the [[horizontal axis]] for the real part and the [[vertical axis]] for the imaginary part. The complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can be identified with the point {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} in the complex plane. A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]]; the points for these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane.  A complex number whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number; its point lies on the horizontal axis of the complex plane.  Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form, which associates each complex number with its distance from the origin (its magnitude) and with a particular angle known as the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of this complex number.\n\nThe geometric identification of the complex numbers with the complex plane, which is a [[Euclidean plane]] (<math>\\mathbb R^2</math>), makes their structure as a real 2-dimensional [[vector space]] evident. Real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be taken as components of a vector with respect to the canonical [[standard basis]]. The addition of complex numbers is thus immediately depicted as the usual component-wise addition of vectors. However, the complex numbers allow for a richer algebraic structure, comprising additional operations, that are not necessarily available in a vector space; for example, the multiplication of two complex numbers always yields again a complex number, and should not be mistaken for the usual \"products\" involving vectors, like the ''[[scalar multiplication]]'', the ''[[scalar product]]'' or other (sesqui)linear [[bilinear form|forms]], available in many vector spaces; and the broadly exploited ''[[vector product]]'' exists only in an [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-dependent form in three dimensions.\n\n==Definition==\n\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[complex plane]]. The real part of a complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}} is {{mvar|x}}, and its imaginary part is {{mvar|y}}.]]\n\nBased on the concept of [[real number]]s, a complex number is a number of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers and {{math|''i''}} is an indeterminate satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. For example, {{math|2 + 3''i''}} is a complex number.<ref>{{cite book|title=College algebra |last=Axler |first=Sheldon |page=262|publisher=Wiley|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThis way, a complex number is defined as a [[polynomial]] with real coefficients in the single indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, for which the relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} is imposed. Based on this definition, complex numbers can be added and multiplied, using the addition and multiplication for polynomials. The relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} induces the equalities {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''</sup> {{=}} 1, ''i''<sup>4''k''+1</sup> {{=}} ''i'', ''i''<sup>4''k''+2</sup> {{=}} \u22121,}} and {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''+3</sup> {{=}} \u2212''i'',}} which hold for all integers {{mvar|k}}; these allow the reduction of any polynomial that results from the addition and multiplication of complex numbers to a linear polynomial in {{mvar|i}}, again of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}} with real coefficients {{mvar|a, b.}}\n\nThe real number {{mvar|a}} is called the ''real part'' of the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}; the real number {{mvar|b}} is called its ''imaginary part''.

Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, that is, {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'' < 0,}} it is common to write {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''{{!}}b{{!}}i''}} instead of {{math|''a'' + (\u2212''{{!}}b{{!}}'')''i''}}; for example, for {{math|''b'' {{=}} \u22124,}} {{math|3 \u2212 4''i''}} can be written instead of {{math|3 + (\u22124)''i''.}}\n\nSince in polynomials with real coefficients the multiplication of the indeterminate {{math|''i''}} and a real is commutative, the polynomial {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} may be written as {{math|''a'' + ''ib''.}} This is often expedient for imaginary parts denoted by expressions, for example, when {{mvar|b}} is a radical.<ref>See {{harv|Ahlfors|1979}}.</ref>\n\nThe real part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Re(''z'')}} or {{math|\u211c(''z'')}}; the imaginary part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Im(''z'')}} or {{math|\u2111(''z'')}}.

Another prominent space on which the coordinates may be projected is the two-dimensional surface of a sphere, which is then called [[Riemann sphere]].\n\n=== Cartesian complex plane ===\nThe definition of the complex numbers involving two arbitrary real values immediately suggest the use of Cartesian coordinates in the complex plane. The horizontal (''real'') axis is generally used to display the real part with increasing values to the right and the imaginary part marks the vertical (''imaginary'') axis, increasing values upwards.\n\nA charted number may be either viewed as the coordinatized point, or as a [[Vector (geometric)|position vector]] from the origin to this point. The coordinate values of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are said to give its ''Cartesian'', ''rectangular'', or ''algebraic'' form.\n\nNotably, the operations of addition and multiplication take on a very natural geometric character when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors: addition corresponds to [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector addition]], while multiplication (see [[#Multiplication and division in polar form|below]]) corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes and adding the angles they make with the real axis. Viewed in this way the multiplication of a complex number by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to rotating the position vector [[orientation (geometry)|counterclockwise]] by a quarter [[turn (geometry)|turn]] ([[right angle|90\u00b0]]) about the origin\n: <math>(a + bi)\\cdot i = ai + b(i)^2 = -b + ai .</math>\n\n=== Polar complex plane {{anchor|Polar form}}=== <!-- [[Nth root]] links to this section -->\n{{Main|Polar coordinate system}}\n{{Redirect|Polar form|the higher-dimensional analogue|Polar decomposition}}\n[[File:Complex number illustration modarg.svg|right|thumb|Argument {{mvar|\u03c6}} and modulus {{mvar|r}} locate a point in the complex plane.]]\n\n====Modulus and argument====\nAn alternative option for coordinates in the complex plane is the [[polar coordinate system]] that uses the distance of the point {{mvar|z}} from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (''O''), and the angle subtended between the [[positive real axis]] and the line segment ''Oz'' in a counterclockwise sense.

Because each complex number is represented in two dimensions, visually graphing a complex function would require the perception of a [[four dimensional space]], which is possible only in projections. Because of this, other ways of visualizing complex functions have been designed.\n\nIn [[Domain coloring]] the output dimensions are represented by color and brightness, respectively. Each point in the complex plane as domain is ''ornated'', typically with ''color'' representing the argument of the complex number, and ''brightness'' representing the magnitude. Dark spots mark moduli near zero, brighter spots are farther away from the origin, the gradation may be discontinuous, but is assumed as monotonous. The colors often vary in steps of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} for {{math|0}} to {{math|2{{pi}}}} from red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, to magenta. These plots are called [[Domain coloring|color wheel graphs]]. This provides a simple way to visualize the functions without losing information.

However, Riemann surfaces are built in such a way that rotating them 180 degrees shows the imaginary output, and vice versa.

This conundrum led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,<ref>{{cite book|first=Morris |last= Kline|title=A history of mathematical thought, volume 1|page=253}}</ref> though his understanding was rudimentary.\n\nWork on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every [[polynomial equation]] of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an [[algebraically closed field]], where any polynomial equation has a [[Root of a function|root]].\n\nMany mathematicians contributed to the development of complex numbers. The rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and root extraction of complex numbers were developed by the Italian mathematician [[Rafael Bombelli]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Katz |first1=Victor J. |title=A History of Mathematics, Brief Version |section= 9.1.4 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=978-0-321-16193-2 |year=2004}}</ref> A more abstract formalism for the complex numbers was further developed by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who extended this abstraction to the theory of [[quaternions]].\n\nThe earliest fleeting reference to [[square root]]s of [[negative number]]s can perhaps be said to occur in the work of the [[Hellenistic mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Hero of Alexandria]] in the 1st century [[AD]], where in his ''[[Hero of Alexandria#Bibliography|Stereometrica]]'' he considers, apparently in error, the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]] to arrive at the term <math>\\sqrt{81 - 144} = 3i\\sqrt{7}</math> in his calculations, although negative quantities were not conceived of in [[Hellenistic mathematics]] and Hero merely replaced it by its positive (<math>\\sqrt{144 - 81} = 3\\sqrt{7}</math>).<ref>{{Citation |title=An Imaginary Tale: The Story of {{sqrt|\u22121}} |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |year=2007 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-12798-9 |url=http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=149&threadID=383188&messageID=1181284 |accessdate=20 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012090553/http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=149&threadID=383188&messageID=1181284 |archive-date=12 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe impetus to study complex numbers as a topic in itself first arose in the 16th century when [[algebraic solution]]s for the roots of [[Cubic equation|cubic]] and [[Quartic equation|quartic]] [[polynomial]]s were discovered by Italian mathematicians (see [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]], [[Gerolamo Cardano]]). It was soon{{when|date=March 2020}} realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's formula for a cubic equation of the form <math>x^3 = px + q</math>{{refn|group=\"note\"|In modern notation, Tartaglia's solution is based on expanding the cube of the sum of two cube roots: <math>\\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right)^3 = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv} \\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right) + u + v</math> With <math>x = \\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}</math>, <math>p = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv}</math>, <math>q = u + v</math>, {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} can be expressed in terms of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} as <math>u = q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math> and <math>v = q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math>, respectively.

However formal calculations with complex numbers show that the equation {{math|1=''z''<sup>3</sup> = ''i''}} has solutions {{math|\u2212''i''}}, <math>{\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math> and <math>{\\tfrac{-\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math>. Substituting these in turn for <math>{\\sqrt{-1}^{1/3}}</math> in Tartaglia's cubic formula and simplifying, one gets 0, 1 and \u22121 as the solutions of {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' = 0}}. Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic equations with real roots then, as later{{when|date=March 2020}} mathematicians{{who|date=March 2020}} showed rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus irreducibilis|is unavoidable]]. [[Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.\n\nThe term \"imaginary\" for these quantities was coined by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature<ref>{{Citation |title=La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie &#124; The Geometry of Ren\u00e9 Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |year=1954 |origyear=1637 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=978-0-486-60068-0 |page= |url=https://archive.org/details/geometryofrenede00rend |accessdate=20 April 2011 }}</ref>\n{{quote|[...] sometimes only imaginary, that is one can imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity that matches that which we imagine.\n''([...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on peut toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque \u00e9quation, mais qu'il n'y a quelquefois aucune quantit\u00e9 qui corresponde \u00e0 celle qu'on imagine.)''}}\nA further source of confusion was that the equation <math>\\sqrt{-1}^2=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math> seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity <math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab}</math>, which is valid for non-negative real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and which was also used in complex number calculations with one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{a}}</math>) in the case when both {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol {{math|''i''}} in place of {{sqrt|\u22121}} to guard against this mistake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Even so, Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today. In his elementary algebra text book, [[Elements of Algebra]], he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.\n\nIn the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 [[Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which bears his name, [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta. </math>\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]]:\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta } </math>\n\nby formally manipulating complex [[power series]] and observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential identities.\n\nThe idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane ([[#Complex plane|above]]) was first described by [[Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John Wallis|Wallis's]] ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nWessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed. In 1806 [[Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#History|fundamental theorem of algebra]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] had earlier published an essentially [[topology|topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about \"the true metaphysics of the square root of \u22121\".

The expression ''direction coefficient'', often used for <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math>, is due to Hankel (1867), and ''absolute value,'' for ''modulus,'' is due to Weierstrass.\n\nLater classical writers on the general theory include [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto H\u00f6lder]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and many others.\n\n==Relations and operations==\n===Equality===\nTwo complex numbers are equal [[if and only if]] both their real and imaginary parts are equal.

This process is sometimes called \"[[rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalization]]\" of the denominator (although the denominator in the final expression might be an irrational real number), because it resembles the method to remove roots from simple expressions in a denominator.\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number {{mvar|z}} can be extracted using the conjugation:\n: <math>\\operatorname{Re}(z) = \\dfrac{z+\\overline{z}}{2},\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{Im}(z) = \\dfrac{z-\\overline{z}}{2i}.</math>\nMoreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.\n\nConjugation distributes over the basic complex arithmetic operations:\n: <math>\\overline{z\\pm w} = \\overline{z} \\pm \\overline{w},</math>\n: <math>\\overline{z\\cdot w} = \\overline{z} \\cdot\\overline{w},\\quad \\overline{z/w} = \\overline{z}/\\overline{w}.</math>\n\nConjugation is also employed in [[inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry studying reflections more general than ones about a line.

A visualization of the subtraction can be achieved by considering addition of the negative [[subtrahend]].\n\n===Multiplication===\nSince the real part, the imaginary part, and the indeterminate <math>i</math> in a complex number are all considered as numbers in themselves, two complex numbers, given as <math>z=x+yi</math> and <math>w= u+vi</math> are multiplied under the rules of the [[distributive property]], the [[commutative property|commutative properties]] and the defining property <math>i^2 = -1</math> in the following way\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz\\cdot w &= (x+yi)\\cdot (u+vi)  & \\\\\n&=x(u+vi) + yi(u+vi)  &&\\text{by the (right) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + xvi + yiu + yivi &&\\text{by the (left) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + yivi + xvi + yiu &&\\text{by the commutativity of addition} \\\\\n&=xu + yvi^2 + xvi + yui &&\\text{by the commutativity of multiplication} \\\\\n&=(xu + yvi^2) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the associativity of addition} \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the defining property of } i \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i &&\\text{by the distributive law}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Reciprocal and division===\nUsing the conjugation, the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a nonzero complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} can always be broken down to\n: <math>\\frac{1}{z}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{z \\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{x^2+y^2}=\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i,</math>\n\nsince ''non-zero'' implies that <math>x^2 + y^2</math> is greater than zero.\n\nThis can be used to express a division of an arbitrary complex number <math>w= u+vi</math> by a non-zero complex number <math>z</math> as\n:<math>\\frac {w}{z}= w\\cdot \\frac {1}{z}= (u+vi)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i\\right)= \\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}\\left((ux+vy)+(vx-uy)i\\right).</math>\n\n===Multiplication and division in polar form===\n[[File:Complex multi.svg|right|thumb|Multiplication of {{math|2 + ''i''}} (blue triangle) and {{math|3 + ''i''}} (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by [[square root of 5|{{sqrt|5}}]], the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]\nFormulas for multiplication, division and exponentiation are simpler in polar form than the corresponding formulas in Cartesian coordinates. Given two complex numbers {{math|1=''z''<sub>1</sub> = ''r''<sub>1</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|1=''z''<sub>2</sub> = ''r''<sub>2</sub>(cos\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub> + ''i''\u2009sin\u200a\u03c6<sub>2</sub>)}}, because of the trigonometric identities\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = \\cos(a + b)</math>\n:<math> \\cos(a)\\sin(b) + \\sin(a)\\cos(b) = \\sin(a + b)</math>\n\nwe may derive\n\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = r_1 r_2 (\\cos(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2)).</math>\nIn other words, the absolute values are multiplied and the arguments are added to yield the polar form of the product. For example, multiplying by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to a quarter-[[turn (geometry)|turn]] counter-clockwise, which gives back {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of\n:<math>(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i. </math>\nSince the real and imaginary part of {{math|5 + 5''i''}} are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or \u03c0/4 (in [[radian]]). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangles are [[arctan]](1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) </math>\nholds. As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this \u2013 known as [[Machin-like formulas]] \u2013 are used for high-precision approximations of [[pi|\u03c0]].\n\nSimilarly, division is given by\n:<math>\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\left(\\cos(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2)\\right).</math>\n\n===Square root===\n{{see also|Square root#Square roots of negative and complex numbers|l1=Square roots of negative and complex numbers}}\nThe square roots of {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} (with {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}) are <math> \\pm (\\gamma + \\delta i)</math>, where\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\delta = \\sgn (b) \\sqrt{\\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}},</math>\n\nwhere sgn is the [[sign function|signum]] function.

For extending this to the complex domain, one can start from Euler's formula. It implies that, if a complex number {{mvar|z}} is written in [[polar form]]\n:<math> z = r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ),</math>\nthen its [[complex logarithm]] should be\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\ln(r) + \\varphi i.</math>\n\nHowever, because cosine and sine are periodic functions,  the addition to <math>\\varphi</math> of an integer multiple of {{math|2{{pi}}}}. does not change {{mvar|z}}. For example, <math>e^{i\\pi} = e^{3i\\pi} = -1</math>, so both <math>i \\pi</math> and <math>3i\\pi</math> are possible values for the natural logarithm of <math>-1</math>.\n\nTherefore the complex logarithm must be defined as a [[multivalued function]]:\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\left\\{ \\ln(r) + \\varphi i+ 2\\pi ki \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nAlternatively, a [[branch cut]] can be used to define a true function. If {{mvar|z}} is not a negative real number, the [[principal value]] of the complex logarithm is obtained with <math>-\\pi < \\varphi < \\pi.</math> This is an [[analytic function]] outside the negative real numbers, but it cannot be prolongated to a function that is continuous at any negative real number.\n\nIt follows that if {{mvar|z}} is as above, and if {{mvar|t}} is another complex number, then the ''exponentiation'' is the multivalued function\n:<math>z^t=\\left\\{e^{t\\ln r}\\,(\\cos(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt)+i\\sin(\\varphi t+ 2 \\pi kt))\\}\\mid k\\in \\mathbb Z\\right\\}</math>\n\n====Integer and fractional exponents====\n{{visualisation_complex_number_roots.svg}}\nIf, in the preceding formula, {{mvar|t}} is an integer, then the sine and the cosine are independent of {{mvar|k}}. Thus, if the exponent {{mvar|n}} is an integer, then <math>z^n</math> is well defined, and the exponentiation formula simplifies to [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n:<math> z^{n}=(r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ))^n = r^n \\, (\\cos n\\varphi + i \\sin n \\varphi).</math>\n\nThe {{mvar|n}} [[Nth root|{{mvar|n}}th roots]] of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are given by\n:<math>z^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]r \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right) + i \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)</math>\nfor {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2212 1}}. (Here <math>\\sqrt[n]r</math> is the usual (positive) {{mvar|n}}th root of the positive real number {{mvar|r}}.) Because sine and cosine are periodic, other integer values of {{mvar|k}} do not give other values.\n\nWhile the {{mvar|n}}th root of a positive real number {{mvar|r}} is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number {{mvar|c}} satisfying {{math|1=''c''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''r''}}, there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex {{mvar|n}}th root of a complex number. Therefore, the {{mvar|n}}th root is a [[multivalued function|{{mvar|n}}-valued function]] of {{mvar|z}}. This implies that, contrary to the case of positive real numbers, one has  \n:<math>(z^n)^{1/n} \\ne z,</math>\nsince the left-hand side consists of {{mvar|n}} values, and the right-hand side is a single value.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Field structure===\nThe set '''C''' of complex numbers is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref> Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number {{mvar|z}}, its [[additive inverse]] {{math|\u2212''z''}} is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero complex number has a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}:\n:<math>z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1,</math>\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1.</math>\nThese two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a field.\n\nUnlike the reals, '''C''' is not an [[ordered field]], that is to say, it is not possible to define a relation {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub> < ''z''<sub>2</sub>}} that is compatible with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is necessarily positive, so {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}} precludes the existence of an [[total order|ordering]] on '''C'''.<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, page 25.</ref>\n\nWhen the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to reflect that fact. For example: [[complex analysis]], complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], complex [[polynomial]], and complex [[Lie algebra]].\n\n===Solutions of polynomial equations===\nGiven any complex numbers (called [[coefficient]]s) {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, the equation\n:<math>a_n z^n + \\dotsb + a_1 z + a_0 = 0</math>\nhas at least one complex solution ''z'', provided that at least one of the higher coefficients {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is nonzero.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  This is the statement of the ''[[fundamental theorem of algebra]]'', of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. Because of this fact, '''C''' is called an [[algebraically closed field]]. This property does not hold for the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]] '''Q''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} does not have a rational root, since [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] is not a rational number) nor the real numbers '''R''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''}} does not have a real root for {{math|''a'' > 0}}, since the square of {{mvar|x}} is positive for any real number {{mvar|x}}).\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], or [[topology|topological]] ones such as the [[winding number]], or a proof combining [[Galois theory]] and the fact that any real polynomial of ''odd'' degree has at least one real root.\n\nBecause of this fact, theorems that hold ''for any algebraically closed field'', apply to '''C'''. For example, any non-empty complex [[square matrix]] has at least one (complex) [[eigenvalue]].\n\n===Algebraic characterization===\nThe field '''C''' has the following three properties: first, it has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. This means that {{math|1=1 + 1 + \u22ef + 1 \u2260 0}} for any number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its [[transcendence degree]] over '''Q''', the [[prime field]] of '''C''', is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Third, it is [[algebraically closed]] (see above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a field) to '''C'''. For example, the [[algebraic closure]] of [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] also satisfies these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic (as fields, but not as topological fields).<ref>{{citation\n | last = Marker | first = David\n | editor1-last = Marker | editor1-first = D.\n | editor2-last = Messmer | editor2-first = M.\n | editor3-last = Pillay | editor3-first = A.\n | contribution = Introduction to the Model Theory of Fields\n | contribution-url = https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235423155\n | isbn = 978-3-540-60741-0\n | mr = 1477154\n | pages = 1\u201337\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin\n | series = Lecture Notes in Logic\n | title = Model theory of fields\n | volume = 5\n | year = 1996}}</ref> Also, '''C''' is isomorphic to the field of complex [[Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that '''C''' contains many proper subfields that are isomorphic to '''C'''.\n\n===Characterization as a topological field===\nThe preceding characterization of '''C''' describes only the algebraic aspects of '''C'''. That is to say, the properties of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]] and [[continuity (topology)|continuity]], which matter in areas such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt with. The following description of '''C''' as a [[topological ring|topological field]] (that is, a field that is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], which allows the notion of convergence) does take into account the topological properties. '''C''' contains a subset {{math|''P''}} (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:\n* {{math|''P''}} is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.\n* If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are distinct elements of {{math|''P''}}, then either {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''y''}} or {{math|''y'' \u2212 ''x''}} is in {{math|''P''}}.\n* If {{mvar|S}} is any nonempty subset of {{math|''P''}}, then {{math|1=''S'' + ''P'' = ''x'' + ''P''}} for some {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\nMoreover, '''C''' has a nontrivial [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[automorphism]] {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''*}} (namely the complex conjugation), such that {{math|''x\u2009x''*}} is in {{math|''P''}} for any nonzero {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\n\nAny field {{mvar|F}} with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the sets {{math|1= ''B''(''x'',\u2009''p'') = {\u2009''y'' {{!}} ''p'' \u2212 (''y'' \u2212 ''x'')(''y'' \u2212 ''x'')* \u2208 ''P''\u2009}\u2009}} as a [[base (topology)|base]], where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the field and {{mvar|p}} ranges over {{math|''P''}}. With this topology {{mvar|F}} is isomorphic as a ''topological'' field to '''C'''.\n\nThe only [[connected space|connected]] [[locally compact]] [[topological ring|topological fields]] are '''R''' and '''C'''. This gives another characterization of '''C''' as a topological field, since '''C''' can be distinguished from '''R''' because the nonzero complex numbers are [[connected space|connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.4|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\n==Formal construction==\n===Construction as ordered pairs===\n[[William Rowan Hamilton]] introduced the approach to define the set {{math|'''C'''}} of complex numbers<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Numbers|first=Leo |last=Corry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|pages=215\u201316}}</ref> as the set {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} of {{nowrap|[[ordered pair]]s {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}}}} of real numbers, in which the following rules for addition and multiplication are imposed:<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15\u201316.</ref>\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n(a, b) + (c, d) &= (a + c, b + d)\\\\\n(a, b) \\cdot (c, d) &= (ac - bd, bc + ad).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is then just a matter of notation to express {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} as {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n===Construction as a quotient field===\nThough this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic nature of {{math|'''C'''}} more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations that behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the [[distributive law]]\n:<math>(x+y) z = xz + yz</math>\nmust hold for any three elements {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} of a field. The set {{math|'''R'''}} of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial {{math|''p''(''X'')}} with real [[coefficient]]s is an expression of the form\n:<math>a_nX^n+\\dotsb+a_1X+a_0,</math>\nwhere the {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}} of all such polynomials with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. This ring is called the [[polynomial ring]] over the real numbers.\n\nThe set of complex numbers is defined as the [[quotient ring]] {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>   This extension field contains two square roots of {{math|\u22121}}, namely (the [[coset]]s of) {{math|''X''}} and {{math|\u2212''X''}}, respectively. (The cosets of) {{math|1}} and {{math|''X''}} form a basis of {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}} as a real [[vector space]], which means that each element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a [[linear combination]] in these two elements. Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} of real numbers.  The quotient ring is a field, because {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} is [[Irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the ideal it generates is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]].\n\nThe formulas for addition and multiplication in the ring {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}}, modulo the relation {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} \u22121}}, correspond to the formulas for addition and multiplication of complex numbers defined as ordered pairs.  So the two definitions of the field {{math|'''C'''}} are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (as fields).\n\nAccepting that {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, since it is an [[algebraic extension]] of {{math|'''R'''}} in this approach, {{math|'''C'''}} is therefore the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n===Matrix representation of complex numbers===<!-- .This section is linked from [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] -->\nComplex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can also be represented by {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that have the following form:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nHere the entries {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and [[matrix multiplication|product]] of such matrices, the product being:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  c &   -d  \\\\\n  d & \\;\\; c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n  ac-bd &   -ad-bc  \\\\\n  bc+ad & \\;\\; -bd+ac\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be expressed in terms of [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] by using this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:\n:<math> |z|^2 =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a & -b  \\\\\n  b &  a\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= a^2 + b^2.\n</math>\nThe conjugate <math>\\overline z</math> corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.\n\nThough this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most common, many other representations arise from matrices ''other than'' <math>\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\1 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)</math> that square to the negative of the [[identity matrix]].

Black parts inside refer to numbers having large absolute values.]]\n{{main|Complex analysis}}\n<!--\n[[File:Color complex plot.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Domain coloring]] plot of the function\n<br /><math>f(x) = \\tfrac{(x^2 - 1)(x - 2 - i)^2}{x^2 + 2 + 2 i}</math><br />\nThe hue represents the function argument, while the saturation and [[Lightness (color)|value]] represent the magnitude.]]\n\nThe absolute value has three important properties:\n\n:<math> | z | \\geq 0, \\,</math> where <math> | z | = 0 \\,</math> [[if and only if]] <math> z = 0</math>\n\n:<math> | z + w | \\leq | z | + | w | \\,</math> ([[triangle inequality]])\n\n:<math> | z \\cdot w | = | z | \\cdot | w | </math>\n\nfor all complex numbers {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}. These imply that {{math|1={{!}}1{{!}} = 1}} and {{math|1={{!}}''z''/''w''{{!}} = {{!}}''z''{{!}}/{{!}}''w''{{!}}}}. By defining the '''distance''' function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and we can therefore talk about [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]].\n\nIn general, distances between complex numbers are given by the distance function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}''z'' \u2212 ''w''{{!}}}}, which turns the complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and introduces the ideas of [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]]. All of the standard properties of two dimensional space therefore hold for the complex numbers, including important properties of the modulus such as non-negativity, and the [[triangle inequality]] (<math>| z + w | \\leq | z | + | w |</math> for all {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}).\n\n-->\n\nThe study of functions of a complex variable is known as [[complex analysis]] and has enormous practical use in [[applied mathematics]] as well as in other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in [[real analysis]] or even [[number theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see [[prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, [[complex function]]s have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.\n\n===Complex exponential and related functions===\nThe notions of [[convergent series]] and [[continuous function]]s in (real) analysis have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence <!--(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' \u2265 0</sub>--> of complex numbers is said to [[convergent sequence|converge]] if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]]s, where the absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view, '''C''', endowed with the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2|</math>\nis a complete [[metric space]], which notably includes the [[triangle inequality]]\n:<math>|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|</math>\nfor any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nLike in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number of [[elementary function]]s: the ''[[exponential function]]'' {{math|exp(''z'')}}, also written {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}}, is defined as the [[infinite series]]\n:<math>\\exp(z):= 1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2\\cdot 1}+\\frac{z^3}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}+\\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}. </math>\n\nThe series defining the real trigonometric functions [[sine]] and [[cosine]], as well as the [[hyperbolic functions]] sinh and cosh, also carry over to complex arguments without change. For the other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, such as [[tangent (function)|tangent]], things are slightly more complicated, as the defining series do not converge for all complex values. Therefore, one must define them either in terms of sine, cosine and exponential, or, equivalently, by using the method of [[analytic continuation]].\n\n''[[Euler's formula]]'' states:\n:<math>\\exp(i\\varphi) = \\cos(\\varphi) + i\\sin(\\varphi) </math>\nfor any real number ''\u03c6'', in particular\n:<math>\\exp(i \\pi) = -1 </math>\nUnlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an [[infinite set|infinitude]] of complex solutions {{mvar|z}} of the equation\n:<math>\\exp(z) = w </math>\nfor any complex number {{math|''w'' \u2260 0}}. It can be shown that any such solution {{mvar|z}} \u2013 called [[complex logarithm]] of {{mvar|w}} \u2013 satisfies\n:<math>\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i\\arg(w), </math>\nwhere arg is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] defined [[#Polar form|above]], and ln the (real) [[natural logarithm]]. As arg is a [[multivalued function]], unique only up to a multiple of 2''\u03c0'', log is also multivalued. The [[principal value]] of log is often taken by restricting the imaginary part to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{open-closed|\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0}}.\n\nComplex [[exponentiation]] {{math|''z''<sup>''\u03c9''</sup>}} is defined as\n:<math>z^\\omega = \\exp(\\omega \\log z), </math>\nand is multi-valued, except when <math>\\omega</math> is an integer. For {{math|1=''\u03c9'' = 1 / ''n''}}, for some natural number {{mvar|n}}, this recovers the non-uniqueness of {{mvar|n}}th roots mentioned above.\n\nComplex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the unmodified power and logarithm identities, particularly when na\u00efvely treated as single-valued functions; see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]. For example, they do not satisfy\n:<math>a^{bc} = \\left(a^b\\right)^c.</math>\nBoth sides of the equation are multivalued by the definition of complex exponentiation given here, and the values on the left are a subset of those on the right.\n\n===Holomorphic functions===\nA function ''f''&thinsp;: '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' is called [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if it satisfies the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]]. For example, any [[Linear transformation#Definition and first consequences|'''R'''-linear]] map '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' can be written in the form\n:<math>f(z)=az+b\\overline{z}</math>\nwith complex coefficients {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. This map is holomorphic [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}. The second summand <math>b \\overline z</math> is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]].\n\nComplex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For example, any two holomorphic functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} that agree on an arbitrarily small [[open subset]] of '''C''' necessarily agree everywhere. [[Meromorphic function]]s, functions that can locally be written as {{math|''f''(''z'')/(''z'' \u2212 ''z''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>''n''</sup>}} with a holomorphic function {{mvar|f}}, still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], such as {{math|sin(1/''z'')}} at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}.\n\n==Applications==\nComplex numbers have applications in many scientific areas, including [[signal processing]], [[control theory]], [[electromagnetism]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[cartography]], and [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]]. Some of these applications are described below.\n\n===Geometry===\n====Shapes====\nThree [[collinearity|non-collinear]] points <math>u, v, w</math> in the plane determine the '''shape''' of the triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math>. Locating the points in the complex plane, this shape of a triangle may be expressed by complex arithmetic as\n:<math>S(u, v, w) = \\frac {u - w}{u - v}. </math>\nThe shape <math>S</math> of a triangle will remain the same, when the complex plane is transformed by translation or dilation (by an [[affine transformation]]), corresponding to the intuitive notion of shape, and describing [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Thus each triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math> is in a [[shape#Similarity classes|similarity class]] of triangles with the same shape.<ref>{{citation|last=Lester|first=J.A.|title=Triangles I: Shapes|journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]|volume=52|pages=30\u201354|year=1994|doi=10.1007/BF01818325}}</ref>\n\n====Fractal geometry====\n[[File:Mandelset hires.png|right|250px|thumb|The Mandelbrot set with the real and imaginary axes labeled.]]\nThe [[Mandelbrot set]] is a popular example of a fractal formed on the complex plane. It is defined by plotting every location <math>c</math> where iterating the sequence <math>f_c(z)=z^2+c</math> does not [[diverge (stability theory)|diverge]] when [[Iteration|iterated]] infinitely. Similarly, [[Julia set]]s have the same rules, except where <math>c</math> remains constant.\n\n====Triangles====\nEvery triangle has a unique [[Steiner inellipse]] \u2013 an [[ellipse]] inside the triangle and tangent to the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. The [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be found as follows, according to [[Marden's theorem]]:<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=An Elementary Proof of Marden's Theorem|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=115|issue=4|pages=330\u201338|year=2008a|doi=10.1080/00029890.2008.11920532|issn=0002-9890|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308104622/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|archive-date=8 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=The Most Marvelous Theorem in Mathematics|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|journal=[[Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications]]|year=2008b|access-date=1 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208014954/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|archive-date=8 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane as {{math|1=''a'' = ''x''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''A''</sub>''i''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''x''<sub>''B''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''B''</sub>''i''}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = ''x''<sub>''C''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''C''</sub>''i''}}. Write the [[cubic equation]] <math>\\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0</math>, take its derivative, and equate the (quadratic) derivative to zero. [[Marden's Theorem]] says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers denoting the locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n[[File:Pentagon construct.gif|right|thumb|Construction of a regular pentagon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using straightedge and compass]].]]\nAs mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in '''C'''. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic number]]s \u2013 they are a principal object of study in [[algebraic number theory]]. Compared to {{overline|'''Q'''}}, the algebraic closure of '''Q''', which also contains all algebraic numbers, '''C''' has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] to the [[number field]] containing [[root of unity|roots of unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular [[nonagon]] [[compass and straightedge constructions|using only compass and straightedge]] \u2013 a purely geometric problem.\n\nAnother example are [[Gaussian integer]]s, that is, numbers of the form {{math|''x'' + ''iy''}}, where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are integers, which can be used to classify [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|sums of squares]].\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\nAnalytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example, the [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|\u03b6(''s'')}} is related to the distribution of [[prime number]]s.\n\n===Improper integrals===\nIn applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-valued [[improper integral]]s, by means of complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see [[methods of contour integration]].\n\n===Dynamic equations===\nIn [[differential equation]]s, it is common to first find all complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the [[Linear differential equation#Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients|characteristic equation]] of a [[linear differential equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''e''<sup>''rt''</sup>}}. Likewise, in [[difference equations]], the complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''r''<sup>''t''</sup>}}.\n\n=== In applied mathematics ===\n\n====Control theory====\nIn [[control theory]], systems are often transformed from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Laplace transform]]. The system's [[zeros and poles]] are then analyzed in the ''complex plane''. The [[root locus]], [[Nyquist plot]], and [[Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the complex plane.\n\nIn the root locus method, it is important whether zeros and poles are in the left or right half planes, that is, have real part greater than or less than zero. If a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are\n\n* in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],\n* all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO stability|stable]],\n* on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal stability]].\n\nIf a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a [[nonminimum phase]] system.\n\n====Signal analysis====\nComplex numbers are used in [[signal analysis]] and other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the original quantities. For a [[sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the absolute value {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} of the corresponding {{mvar|z}} is the [[amplitude]] and the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] {{math|arg(''z'')}} is the [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\nIf [[Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form\n\n:<math>x(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{X( t ) \\} </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X( t ) = A e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{ i \\phi } e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi) } </math>\n\nwhere \u03c9 represents the [[angular frequency]] and the complex number ''A'' encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.\n\nThis use is also extended into [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and [[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data compression|compress]], restore, and otherwise process [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sound|audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.\n\nAnother example, relevant to the two side bands of [[amplitude modulation]] of AM radio, is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\cos((\\omega + \\alpha)t) + \\cos\\left((\\omega - \\alpha)t\\right)\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i(\\omega + \\alpha)t} + e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left(e^{i\\alpha t} + e^{-i\\alpha t}\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(2\\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===In physics===\n\n====Electromagnetism and electrical engineering====\n{{Main|Alternating current}}\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], the [[Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]. The treatment of [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. This approach is called [[phasor]] calculus.\n\nIn electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by {{math|''j''}}, to avoid confusion with {{mvar|I}}, which is generally in use to denote [[electric current]], or, more particularly, {{mvar|i}}, which is generally in use to denote instantaneous electric current.\n\nSince the [[voltage]] in an AC [[electric circuit|circuit]] is oscillating, it can be represented as\n\n:<math> V(t) = V_0 e^{j \\omega t} = V_0 \\left (\\cos\\omega t + j \\sin\\omega t \\right ),</math>\n\nTo obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:\n\n:<math> v(t) = \\mathrm{Re}(V) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left [ V_0 e^{j \\omega t} \\right ] = V_0 \\cos \\omega t.</math>\n\nThe complex-valued signal <math>V(t)</math> is called the [[analytic signal|analytic]] representation of the real-valued, measurable signal <math>v(t)</math>.\n<ref>{{citation|last1=Grant|first1=I.S.|title=Electromagnetism|year=2008|edition=2|publisher=Manchester Physics Series|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9|last2=Phillips|first2=W.R.}}</ref>\n\n====Fluid dynamics====\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to describe [[potential flow in two dimensions]].\n\n====Quantum mechanics====\nThe complex number field is intrinsic to the [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex [[Hilbert space]]s provide the context for one such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original foundation formulas of quantum mechanics \u2013 the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] and Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] \u2013 make use of complex numbers.\n\n====Relativity====\nIn [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is [[Wick rotation|used in an essential way]] in [[quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are essential to [[spinor]]s, which are a generalization of the [[tensor]]s used in relativity.\n\n==Generalizations and related notions==\nThe process of extending the field '''R''' of reals to '''C''' is known as the [[Cayley\u2013Dickson construction]]. It can be carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and [[octonion]]s '''O''' which (as a real vector space) are of dimension&nbsp;4 and 8, respectively.\nIn this context the complex numbers have been called the '''binarions'''.<ref>Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', pp 64, Universitext, Springer {{isbn|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n\nJust as by applying the construction to reals the property of [[ordered field|ordering]] is lost, properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish with each extension. The [[quaternion]]s lose commutativity, that is, {{math|''x''\u00b7''y'' \u2260 ''y''\u00b7''x''}} for some quaternions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',}} and the multiplication of [[octonion]]s, additionally to not being commutative, fails to be associative: {{math|(''x''\u00b7''y'')\u00b7''z'' \u2260 ''x''\u00b7(''y''\u00b7''z'')}} for some octonions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',\u2009''z''.}}\n\nReals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all [[normed division algebra]]s over '''R'''. By [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] they are the only ones; the [[sedenion]]s, the next step in the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction, fail to have this structure.\n\nThe Cayley\u2013Dickson construction is closely related to the [[regular representation]] of '''C''', thought of as an '''R'''-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] (an '''R'''-vector space with a multiplication), with respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}. This means the following: the '''R'''-linear map\n:<math>\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}, z \\mapsto wz</math>\nfor some fixed complex number {{mvar|w}} can be represented by a {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} matrix (once a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}, this matrix is\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\operatorname{Re}(w) & -\\operatorname{Im}(w) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Im}(w) & \\;\\; \\operatorname{Re}(w)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>,\nthat is, the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex numbers above. While this is a [[linear representation]] of '''C''' in the [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one. Any matrix\n:<math>J = \\begin{pmatrix}p & q \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0</math>\nhas the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: {{math|1=''J''<sup>2</sup> = \u2212''I''}}. Then\n:<math>\\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>\nis also isomorphic to the field '''C''', and gives an alternative complex structure on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. This is generalized by the notion of a [[linear complex structure]].\n\n[[Hypercomplex number]]s also generalize '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. For example, this notion contains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are elements of the ring {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 1)}} (as opposed to {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}}). In this ring, the equation {{math|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> = 1}} has four solutions.\n\nThe field '''R''' is the completion of '''Q''', the field of [[rational number]]s, with respect to the usual [[absolute value]] [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. Other choices of [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]] on '''Q''' lead to the fields '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] (for any [[prime number]] ''p''), which are thereby analogous to '''R'''. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing '''Q''' than '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. The algebraic closures <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> still carry a norm, but (unlike '''C''') are not complete with respect to it.

The standards of [[sound quality]] ([[fidelity]]) and music production have evolved throughout the decades, meaning that some older examples of lo-fi may not have been originally recognized as such.

Pioneering, influential, or otherwise significant artists include [[the Beach Boys]] (''[[Smiley Smile]]''), [[R.

At various points since the 1980s, \"lo-fi\" has been connoted with [[cassette culture]], the [[DIY culture|DIY ethos]] of punk, [[indie rock]], [[Na\u00efve art|primitivism]], [[outsider music]], [[authenticity in art|authenticity]], [[slacker]]/[[Generation X]] stereotypes, and cultural [[nostalgia]]. The notion of \"bedroom\" musicians expanded following the rise of modern [[digital audio workstation]]s, and in the late 2000s, lo-fi aesthetics served as the basis of the [[chillwave]] and [[hypnagogic pop]] music genres.\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Definitions and etymology==\n{{Quote box\n | quote = At its most crudely sketched, lo-fi was primitivist and realist in the 1980s, postmodern in the 1990s, and archaicist in the 2000s.\n | source = \u2014Adam Harper, '' Lo-Fi Aesthetics in Popular Music Discourse'' (2014){{sfn|Harper|2014|p=5}}\n | align = right\n | width = 25em\n |}}\n\nLo-fi is the opposite of [[hi-fi]].<ref name=\"Bartlett2013\" /> Historically, the prescriptions of \"lo-fi\" have been relative to technological advances and the expectations of ordinary music listeners, causing the rhetoric and discourse surrounding the term to shift numerous times.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=4\u20137}} Usually spelled as \"low-fi\" before the 1990s, the term has existed since at least the 1950s, shortly after the acceptance of \"high fidelity\", and its definition evolved continuously between the 1970s and 2000s. In the 1976 edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', lo-fi was added under the definition of \"sound production less good in quality than 'hi-fi'\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=7, 11}} Music educator [[R. Murray Schafer]], in the glossary for his 1977 book ''The Tuning of the World'', defined the term as \"unfavourable signal-to-noise ratio.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=9}}\n\nThere was virtually no appreciation for the imperfections of lo-fi music among critics until the 1980s, during which there was an emergent romanticism for [[home recording|home-recording]] and \"[[do-it-yourself]]\" (DIY) qualities.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=3\u20134, 10}} Afterward, \"DIY\" was often used interchangeably with \"lo-fi\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=44, 117}}  By the end of the 1980s, qualities such as \"home-recorded\", \"technically primitive\", and \"inexpensive equipment\" were commonly associated with the \"lo-fi\" label, and throughout the 1990s, such ideas became central to how \"lo-fi\" was popularly understood.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=11}} Consequently, in 2003, the ''Oxford Dictionary'' added a second definition for the term\u2014\"a genre of rock music characterized by minimal production, giving a raw and unsophisticated sound\".

More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of [[audio engineering]] as undesirable effects, such as a degraded [[audio signal]] or fluctuations in tape speed.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=15\u201316, 21, 29}} The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\" /> Recordings deemed unprofessional or \"amateurish\" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, [[distortion (music)|distortion]], or room acoustics).{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=12}} Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as \"phonographic\" and \"non-phonographic imperfections\". He defines the former as \"elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=18}}\n\nRecording imperfections may \"fall loosely into two categories, distortion and noise\", in Harper's view, although he acknowledges that definitions of \"distortion\" and \"noise\" vary and sometimes overlap.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=18\u201319}} The most prominent form of distortion in lo-fi aesthetics is [[harmonic distortion]], which can occur when an audio signal is amplified beyond the [[dynamic range]] of a device. However, this effect is not usually considered to be an imperfection. The same process is used for the electric guitar sounds of [[rock and roll]], and since the advent of [[digital recording]], to give a recording a feeling of \"analogue warmth\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=20}} Distortion that is generated as a byproduct of the recording process (\"phonographic distortion\") is typically avoided in professional contexts. \"Tape saturation\" and \"saturation distortion\" alternately describe the harmonic distortion that occurs when a [[tape head]] approaches its limit of residual [[magnetic tape|magnetization]] (a common aspect of tape recorder maintenance that is fixed with [[degaussing]] tools). Effects include a decrease in high-frequency signals and an increase in noise.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=20, 25}} Generally, lo-fi recordings are likely to have little or no frequency information above 10 kilohertz.<ref name=\"Dittmar2013\">{{cite book|last=Dittmar|first=Tim|title=Audio Engineering 101: A Beginner's Guide to Music Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_L7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA241|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-11174-7|page=241}}</ref>\n\n\"Non-phonographic\" imperfections may involve noises that are generated by the performance (\"coughing, sniffing, page-turning and chair sounds\") or the environment (\"passing vehicles, household noises, the sounds of neighbours and animals\").{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=26\u201327}} Harper acknowledges that the \"appreciation of distortion and noise is not limited to lo-fi aesthetics, of course, and lo-fi aesthetics ... does not extend to all appreciations for distortion and noise. The difference lies in the ways in which distortion and noise are ''understood'' to be imperfections in lo-fi.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=29}} He also distinguishes between \"recording imperfections\" and \"sonic imperfections [that] occur as a result of imperfect sound-reproduction or -modulation equipment ...  Hypothetically, at least, lo-fi effects are created during recording and production itself, and perceptibly remain in master recordings that are then identically copied for release.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=16}}\n\nBruce Bartlett, in his 2013 guide ''Practical Recording Techniques'', states that \"lo-fi sounds might have a narrow frequency response (a thin, cheap sound), and might include noise such as hiss or record scratches. They could be distorted or wobbly in pitch.\"<ref name=\"Bartlett2013\"/> He offers the following methods for replicating lo-fi sounds: mixing levels so that they are unbalanced; placing obstructions between a microphone and the sound sources; placing the microphone in an unusual spot, such as in a wastebasket; recording with older, lower-quality instruments or equipment; and highlighting [[spill (audio)|spill]] and [[sound reflection]]s.<ref name=\"Bartlett2013\">{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Bruce|title=Practical Recording Techniques: The Step- By- Step Approach to Professional Audio Recording|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5EMaN3y0WY0C&pg=PA229|year=2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-12534-8|pages=229\u2013233}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1950s\u20131970s: Origins and influential works===\n[[File:Beach Boys 1967 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[The Beach Boys]] (pictured in 1967) recorded albums at [[Beach Boys Studio|Brian Wilson's home studio]] from 1967 to 1972.]]\n\nDIY music predates [[written history]], but \"lo-fi\" as it was understood after the 1990s can be traced to 1950s rock and roll.<ref name=\"udDIY\">{{cite web |last1=Chilton |first1=Martin |title=DIY Music: How Musicians Did It For Themselves |url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/history-diy-music/ |website=UDiscover Music |date=August 1, 2018}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] writes that the genre's recordings were made \"cheaply and quickly, often on substandard equipment.

Centered on artists such as [[Guided by Voices]], [[Sebadoh]], [[Beck]], and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], most of the writing about alternative and lo-fi aligned it with [[Generation X]] and \"[[slacker]]\" stereotypes that originated from [[Douglas Coupland]]'s novel ''[[Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture|Generation X]]'' and [[Richard Linklater]]'s film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]'' (both released 1991).{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=273\u2013274, 294}} Some of the delineation between [[grunge music|grunge]] and lo-fi came with respect to the music's \"[[authenticity in art|authenticity]]\". Even though Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] was well known for being fond of Johnston, K Records, and [[the Shaggs]], there was a faction of indie rock that viewed grunge as a [[sell-out]] genre, believing that the imperfections of lo-fi was what gave the music its authenticity.{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=307}}\n\nIn April 1993, the term \"lo-fi\" gained mainstream currency after it was featured as a headline in the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\"/> The most widely-read article was published by the same paper in August 1994 with the headline \"Lo-Fi Rockers Opt for Raw Over Slick\". In contrast to a similar story ran in the paper seven years earlier, which never deployed \"lo-fi\" in the context of an unprofessional recording, writer Matt Deihl conflated \"lo-fi\" with \"DIY\" and \"a rough sound quality\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=44}} He wrote:\n\n{{quote|Alternately called lo-fi, referring to the rough sound quality resulting from such an approach, or D.I.Y., an acronym for \"do it yourself,\" this tradition is distinguished by an aversion to state-of-the-art recording techniques. ...

More specifically, those that are generally viewed in the field of [[audio engineering]] as undesirable effects, such as a degraded [[audio signal]] or fluctuations in tape speed.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=15\u201316, 21, 29}} The aesthetic may also extend to substandard or disaffected musical performances.<ref name=\"IIIShattuc2003\" /> Recordings deemed unprofessional or \"amateurish\" are usually with respect to performance (out-of-tune or out-of-time notes) or mixing (audible hiss, [[distortion (music)|distortion]], or room acoustics).{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=12}} Musicologist Adam Harper identifies the difference as \"phonographic\" and \"non-phonographic imperfections\". He defines the former as \"elements of a recording that are perceived (or imagined to be perceived) as detrimental to it and that originate in the specific operation of the recording medium itself. Today, they are usually the first characteristics people think about when the subject of 'lo-fi' is brought up.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=18}}\n\nRecording imperfections may \"fall loosely into two categories, distortion and noise\", in Harper's view, although he acknowledges that definitions of \"distortion\" and \"noise\" vary and sometimes overlap.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=18\u201319}} The most prominent form of distortion in lo-fi aesthetics is [[harmonic distortion]], which can occur when an audio signal is amplified beyond the [[dynamic range]] of a device. However, this effect is not usually considered to be an imperfection. The same process is used for the electric guitar sounds of [[rock and roll]], and since the advent of [[digital recording]], to give a recording a feeling of \"analogue warmth\".{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=20}} Distortion that is generated as a byproduct of the recording process (\"phonographic distortion\") is typically avoided in professional contexts. \"Tape saturation\" and \"saturation distortion\" alternately describe the harmonic distortion that occurs when a [[tape head]] approaches its limit of residual [[magnetic tape|magnetization]] (a common aspect of tape recorder maintenance that is fixed with [[degaussing]] tools). Effects include a decrease in high-frequency signals and an increase in noise.{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=20, 25}} Generally, lo-fi recordings are likely to have little or no frequency information above 10 kilohertz.<ref name=\"Dittmar2013\">{{cite book|last=Dittmar|first=Tim|title=Audio Engineering 101: A Beginner's Guide to Music Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_L7AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA241|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-136-11174-7|page=241}}</ref>\n\n\"Non-phonographic\" imperfections may involve noises that are generated by the performance (\"coughing, sniffing, page-turning and chair sounds\") or the environment (\"passing vehicles, household noises, the sounds of neighbours and animals\").{{sfn|Harper|2014|pp=26\u201327}} Harper acknowledges that the \"appreciation of distortion and noise is not limited to lo-fi aesthetics, of course, and lo-fi aesthetics ... does not extend to all appreciations for distortion and noise. The difference lies in the ways in which distortion and noise are ''understood'' to be imperfections in lo-fi.\"{{sfn|Harper|2014|p=29}} He also distinguishes between \"recording imperfections\" and \"sonic imperfections [that] occur as a result of imperfect sound-reproduction or -modulation equipment ...

The \"front\" lane is nearest the street and the \"back\" lane away from the street. This location design is known as a double drive-thru. A metal awning provides shade for several tables for customers desiring to park and eat, but there is no indoor dining. A walk-up window faces the parking area. These restaurants store food and supplies in a separate building, and it is not uncommon for a driver to be asked to wait a moment while employees carry supplies to the kitchen across the rear lane.\n\nThis design is a popular image on In-N-Out ads and artwork, which often shows classic cars such as 1965 Mustangs and 1968 Firebirds visiting the original restaurants. The original Covina restaurant, located on Arrow Highway west of Grand Avenue, was forced to close in the early 1990s due to re-engineering and development of the area. A modern design, drive-up/dining room restaurant was built a few hundred feet away. The replacement building was much larger, being nearly half the size of the previous building's lot.\n\n[[Image:Gayley and Leconte.jpg|thumb|left|A Kanner Architects-designed store near the [[UCLA]] campus in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], Los Angeles]]\n\nLike many chain restaurants, newer In-N-Out restaurants are based on a set of templates or \"cookie-cutter\" blueprints, which are chosen based on available space and expected traffic levels. While the external appearance of its buildings may vary to meet local zoning and architectural requirements, the interior floor plan and decor in most recently constructed In-N-Out restaurants are identical. However, some restaurants are designed to stand out, such as the restaurants at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco]] and [[Westwood, Los Angeles]].\n\n[[Image:Palms trees in x.JPG|thumb|Example of In-N-Out's crossed palm trees]]\nToday's typical location has an interior layout that includes a customer service counter with [[Point of sale|registers]] in front of a kitchen and food preparation area. There are separate storage areas for paper goods (napkins, bags, etc.) and \"dry\" food goods (potatoes, buns, etc.), as well as a walk-in refrigerator for perishable goods (lettuce, cheese, spread, etc.), and a dedicated meat refrigerator for burger patties. The customer area includes an indoor dining room with a combination of booths, tables, and bar-style seating. Outside seating is usually available as well, with tables and benches. Most newer restaurants contain a one-lane [[drive-through]].\n\nThere are other design elements common among today's In-N-Out locations. Matching In-N-Out's California-inspired [[palm tree]] theme, palm trees are sometimes planted to form an \"X\" in front of the restaurants. This is an allusion to founder Harry Snyder's favorite movie, [[Stanley Kramer|Stanley Kramer's]] ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', in which the characters look for a hidden treasure and find it under \"the big W\" made by four palm trees, with the middle two forming an \"X\".<ref name=\"Savio\">{{cite web |date=August 9, 2006 |url=http://www.gilroydispatch.com/printer/article.asp?c=180266 |title=The Ins and Outs of In-N-Out |newspaper=Gilroy Dispatch |first=Kelly |last=Savio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032558/http://gilroydispatch.com/printer/article.asp?c=180266 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:Flickr mayr 326671363--In-N-Out sign and kitchen.jpg|thumb|left|190px|A typical interior with the company's motto, \"Quality you can taste\"]]\n[[File:In-N-Out Burger sign, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In-N-Out Burger sign in [[Los Angeles]]]]\nLike other fast-food chains, In-N-Out uses roadside billboards that attract customers to the nearest location. Billboard ads display an image of the trademarked Double-Double burger. The chain uses short radio commercials, often limited to the song \"In-N-Out, In-N-Out. That's what a hamburger's all about.\" Television commercials, which are less common, feature the hamburger's visual appeal. In-N-Out seldom uses celebrities in ads, although [[John Cleese]] and [[John Goodman]] have voiced radio spots. In the past, the Snyders also sponsored Christmas music programming with [[voice-over]]s expressing the meaning of the holiday.\n\nIn addition to commercials, In-N-Out benefits from enthusiastic [[fan (person)|fans]] who talk to each other. For many years, it has given customers free bumper stickers, which simply say \"In-N-Out Burger\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Perman |first=Stacy |title=In-N-Out Burger: A Behind-the-Counter Look at the Fast-Food Chain That Breaks All the Rules |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PVLwhCRIjXoC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149#v=onepage&f=false |pages=149\u201350 |isbn=9780061872143}}</ref> The company helps devoted customers advertise its brand by selling souvenir clothing with the In-N-Out logo.<ref name=\"Time review\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,53002,00.html |title=Restaurant Review: The In-N-Out Burger |last=Pellegrini |first=Frank |work=Time |date=August 21, 2000 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> Celebrity fans and free endorsements in mass media also promote the business.

French fries and fountain drinks are available, as well as three flavors of milkshakes. The hamburgers come with lettuce, tomato, with or without onions (the customer is asked upon ordering, and may have them fresh or grilled), and a sauce, which is called \"spread\" (a [[Thousand Island dressing]] variant).\n\nThere are, however, additional named items not on the menu, but available at every In-N-Out. These variations reside on the chain's \"secret menu\", though the menu is accessible on the company's web site. These variations include 3\u00d73 (which has three patties and three slices of cheese), 4\u00d74 (four patties and four slices of cheese), [[Neapolitan ice cream|Neapolitan]] shakes, grilled cheese sandwich (consists of the same ingredients as the burgers except the meat, plus two slices of melted cheese), Protein Style (wrap with lettuce; consists of the same ingredients as the burgers except buns), and Animal Style (cooked in a thin layer of mustard, adding condiments including pickles, grilled onions, and extra spread).

The \"front\" lane is nearest the street and the \"back\" lane away from the street. This location design is known as a double drive-thru. A metal awning provides shade for several tables for customers desiring to park and eat, but there is no indoor dining. A walk-up window faces the parking area. These restaurants store food and supplies in a separate building, and it is not uncommon for a driver to be asked to wait a moment while employees carry supplies to the kitchen across the rear lane.\n\nThis design is a popular image on In-N-Out ads and artwork, which often shows classic cars such as 1965 Mustangs and 1968 Firebirds visiting the original restaurants. The original Covina restaurant, located on Arrow Highway west of Grand Avenue, was forced to close in the early 1990s due to re-engineering and development of the area. A modern design, drive-up/dining room restaurant was built a few hundred feet away. The replacement building was much larger, being nearly half the size of the previous building's lot.\n\n[[Image:Gayley and Leconte.jpg|thumb|left|A Kanner Architects-designed store near the [[UCLA]] campus in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]], Los Angeles]]\n\nLike many chain restaurants, newer In-N-Out restaurants are based on a set of templates or \"cookie-cutter\" blueprints, which are chosen based on available space and expected traffic levels. While the external appearance of its buildings may vary to meet local zoning and architectural requirements, the interior floor plan and decor in most recently constructed In-N-Out restaurants are identical. However, some restaurants are designed to stand out, such as the restaurants at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco]] and [[Westwood, Los Angeles]].\n\n[[Image:Palms trees in x.JPG|thumb|Example of In-N-Out's crossed palm trees]]\nToday's typical location has an interior layout that includes a customer service counter with [[Point of sale|registers]] in front of a kitchen and food preparation area. There are separate storage areas for paper goods (napkins, bags, etc.) and \"dry\" food goods (potatoes, buns, etc.), as well as a walk-in refrigerator for perishable goods (lettuce, cheese, spread, etc.), and a dedicated meat refrigerator for burger patties. The customer area includes an indoor dining room with a combination of booths, tables, and bar-style seating. Outside seating is usually available as well, with tables and benches. Most newer restaurants contain a one-lane [[drive-through]].\n\nThere are other design elements common among today's In-N-Out locations. Matching In-N-Out's California-inspired [[palm tree]] theme, palm trees are sometimes planted to form an \"X\" in front of the restaurants. This is an allusion to founder Harry Snyder's favorite movie, [[Stanley Kramer|Stanley Kramer's]] ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'', in which the characters look for a hidden treasure and find it under \"the big W\" made by four palm trees, with the middle two forming an \"X\".<ref name=\"Savio\">{{cite web |date=August 9, 2006 |url=http://www.gilroydispatch.com/printer/article.asp?c=180266 |title=The Ins and Outs of In-N-Out |newspaper=Gilroy Dispatch |first=Kelly |last=Savio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032558/http://gilroydispatch.com/printer/article.asp?c=180266 |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:Flickr mayr 326671363--In-N-Out sign and kitchen.jpg|thumb|left|190px|A typical interior with the company's motto, \"Quality you can taste\"]]\n[[File:In-N-Out Burger sign, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In-N-Out Burger sign in [[Los Angeles]]]]\nLike other fast-food chains, In-N-Out uses roadside billboards that attract customers to the nearest location. Billboard ads display an image of the trademarked Double-Double burger. The chain uses short radio commercials, often limited to the song \"In-N-Out, In-N-Out. That's what a hamburger's all about.\" Television commercials, which are less common, feature the hamburger's visual appeal. In-N-Out seldom uses celebrities in ads, although [[John Cleese]] and [[John Goodman]] have voiced radio spots. In the past, the Snyders also sponsored Christmas music programming with [[voice-over]]s expressing the meaning of the holiday.\n\nIn addition to commercials, In-N-Out benefits from enthusiastic [[fan (person)|fans]] who talk to each other. For many years, it has given customers free bumper stickers, which simply say \"In-N-Out Burger\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Perman |first=Stacy |title=In-N-Out Burger: A Behind-the-Counter Look at the Fast-Food Chain That Breaks All the Rules |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |year=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PVLwhCRIjXoC&pg=PA149&lpg=PA149#v=onepage&f=false |pages=149\u201350 |isbn=9780061872143}}</ref> The company helps devoted customers advertise its brand by selling souvenir clothing with the In-N-Out logo.<ref name=\"Time review\">{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,53002,00.html |title=Restaurant Review: The In-N-Out Burger |last=Pellegrini |first=Frank |work=Time |date=August 21, 2000 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> Celebrity fans and free endorsements in mass media also promote the business.
