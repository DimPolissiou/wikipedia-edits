Over [[geological time]] bornhardts may degrade to form other landforms such as [[nubbin (landform)|nubbins]] (or [[hillock|knoll]]s) and castle koppies.<ref name=\"Twidale2007\" /> Bornhardts were previously thought of as characteristically [[climatic geomorphology|tropical landforms]], but have been shown to be more related to [[lithology]] and [[structural geology|rock structure]] than climate.<ref name=\"Thomas2004\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Tropical Geomorphology |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |publisher=Routledge |location=London |last=Thomas |first=Michael F. |editor-last=Goudie |editor-first=Andrew S. |editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |volume=2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofge0001unse/page/1063 1063-1069] |year=2004 |isbn=0-415-32738-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofge0001unse/page/1063 }}</ref>\n\nDepending on their shape they are known as sugar loaves, whalebacks, turtlebacks or simply domes. They are locally known as [[dwala]]s, half-oranges, [[matopos]], etc. Often, the underlying geological fracture pattern is shown by the surface arrangement of bornhardts, as can be seen in the [[Kamiesberge]] of [[Namaqualand]] and the [[Everard Ranges]] of [[Central Australia]].<ref name=\"Twidale1981\" />\n\nBornhardts commonly show extensive [[Exfoliation joint|sheet jointing]]. There are two main theories on the origins of bornhardts, each relating to jointing. The ''exogenetic'' theory asserts that sheet jointing is formed in response to the emerging topography, while the ''endogenetic'' theory suggests that the topography in bornhardts reflects already existing sheet jointing.{{sfn|Twidale|Vidal-Roman\u00ed|2005|pp=32-48}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Granite dome}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist\n|refs =\n<ref name=\"Allaby2010\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBuCBtOMs1kC&pg=PA53 |title=A Dictionary of Ecology |publisher=Oxford University Press |first=Michael |last=Allaby |edition=4th |page=53 |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-19-956766-9}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Mayhew2015\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kry6BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA56 |title=A Dictionary of Geography |publisher=Oxford University Press |first=Susan |last=Mayhew |edition=5th |page=56 |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-19-968085-6}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Twidale1981\">{{cite journal |title=Granitic Inselbergs: Domed, Block-Strewn and Castellated |journal=[[The Geographical Journal]] |first=C.

Fronted by singer-songwriter [[Jay Kay]], the band were a prominent component of the London-based funk/jazz movement of the 1990s.

They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live. Over the years, Kay has consistently remained as the leader through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band d\u00e9buted with \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\" under [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz records]], which led to Kay signing a record deal with [[S2_Records|Sony Soho<sup>2</sup>]]. While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The group has won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]], as well as one [[Grammy Award]], two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, and two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]]s.

The Steelers defeated the Cowboys by the score of 21\u201317 to win their second consecutive Super Bowl. They were the third team to win back-to-back Super Bowls. (The [[Miami Dolphins]] won [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowls VII]] and [[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]], and the [[Green Bay Packers]] won [[Super Bowl I|Super Bowls I]] and [[Super Bowl II|II]].) It was also the first Super Bowl in which both participating teams had previously won a Super Bowl, as the Steelers were the defending champions and the Cowboys had won [[Super Bowl VI]].\n\nThe game was played at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]<ref>This was the last game played on [[AstroTurf]] at the Orange Bowl. The artificial surface was installed in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], but after this game, the AstroTurf was ripped up and grass was replanted for the [[1976 NFL season|1976]] season. Also, this was the last open-air stadium [[Super Bowl]] to be played on AstroTurf. Every outdoor Super Bowl since then had been played on grass, until [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] when it was played on a next-generation artificial surface.</ref> in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], on January 18, 1976, one of the first major national events of the [[United States Bicentennial]] year. Both the pre-game and halftime show celebrated the Bicentennial, while players on both teams wore special patches on their jerseys with the Bicentennial logo.\n\nSuper Bowl X featured a contrast of playing styles between the Steelers and the Cowboys, which were, at the time, the two most popular teams in the league. The Steelers, dominating teams with their \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense and running game, finished the regular season with a league best 12\u20132 record and defeated the [[1975 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in the playoffs. The Cowboys, with their offense and \"flex\" defense, became the first NFC [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team to advance to the Super Bowl after posting a 10\u20134 regular season record and postseason victories over the [[1975 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and the [[1975 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]].\n\nTrailing 10\u20137 in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl X, the Steelers rallied to score 14 unanswered points, including a 64-yard touchdown reception by Pittsburgh wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]]. The Cowboys cut the score, 21\u201317, late in the game with wide receiver [[Percy Howard]]'s 34-yard touchdown reception, but Pittsburgh safety [[Glen Edwards (American football)|Glen Edwards]] halted Dallas' rally with an end zone interception as time expired. Swann, who caught four passes for a Super Bowl record 161 yards and one touchdown, became the first wide receiver to be named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]].\n\n==Background==\nThe NFL awarded Super Bowl X to Miami on April 3, 1973, at the owners' meetings held in Scottsdale, Arizona.<ref name=\"USA Today Super Bowl X Play by Play\" />\n\n===Dallas Cowboys===\n{{main|1975 Dallas Cowboys season}}\n\nThe Cowboys, considered a [[Cinderella team]] entering the Super Bowl, advanced to their third Super Bowl in team history with their rather high-tech offense and \"flex\" defense. Quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] had a solid season, passing for 2,666 yards and 17 touchdowns, while also rushing for 310 yards. Wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] led the team with 46 receptions for 822 yards and 8 touchdowns. Wide receiver [[Golden Richards]] and tight end [[Jean Fugett]] were also reliable targets in the Cowboys' passing game, combining for 59 receptions and 939 receiving yards.\n\nLike the Steelers, Dallas was a run-based team. Fullback [[Robert Newhouse]] was their leading rusher with\n930 yards, and also caught 34 passes for 274 yards. Halfback [[Doug Dennison]] contributed 388 yards. Perhaps the most talented player in the backfield was halfback [[Preston Pearson]] (no relation to receiver Drew Pearson), who signed on the team as a [[free agent]] after being cut by the Steelers in the preseason.  Preston rushed for 509 yards, caught 27 passes for 351 yards, and added another 391 yards returning kickoffs.  Preston had been especially effective in the playoffs, where he caught 12 passes for 200 yards and three touchdowns, and was extremely eager to increase his numbers in the Super Bowl against the team that let him go.  Up front, the offensive line was led by All-Pro right tackle [[Rayfield Wright]].\n\nThe Cowboys' \"Flex\" defense was anchored by linemen [[Harvey Martin]] and [[Ed Jones (American football)|Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones]]. Linebacker [[Lee Roy Jordan]] led the team with six interceptions, while linebacker [[D. D. Lewis (Dallas Cowboys)|D.D. Lewis]] was an effective weapon pass rushing. The starting players in Dallas' defensive secondary, future Hall of Fame cornerback [[Mel Renfro]], cornerback Mark Washington, and safeties [[Charlie Waters]] and future Hall of Famer [[Cliff Harris]], combined for 12 interceptions.\n\nEven though the Cowboys finished in second place in the [[NFC East]] with a 10\u20134 record, they qualified for the playoffs as the [[National Football Conference|NFC]]'s [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team (during that time, only one wild card team from each conference entered the playoffs).  The Dallas Cowboys became the first [[National Football Conference|NFC]] [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] team to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{main|1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season}}\n\nThe Steelers became the first official #1 seed to reach the Super Bowl. Playoff seeds were instituted in [[1975 NFL season|1975]]. The Steelers finished the regular season with a league-best 12\u20132 record, dominating opponents with their \"Steel Curtain\" defense and powerful running game. Fullback [[Franco Harris]] ranked second in the league with 1,246 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, while also catching 28 passes for 214 yards and another touchdown. Halfback [[Rocky Bleier]] had 528 rushing yards, and fullback [[John Fuqua|John \"Frenchy\" Fuqua]] added 285 yards and 18 receptions. Still, the Steelers had a fine passing attack led by quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]]. Bradshaw threw for 2,055 yards, 18 touchdowns, and nine interceptions while rushing for 210 yards and three touchdowns. One reason why Bradshaw's numbers were much improved from the previous season was the emergence of wide receivers [[Lynn Swann]] and [[John Stallworth]]. Both saw limited playing time in the previous season, but became significant contributors in 1975. Swann caught a team-leading 49 passes for 781 yards and 11 touchdowns. Stallworth only had 20 receptions, but he had an average of 21.2 yards per catch, recording a total of 423 reception yards.\n\nThe Steelers' \"Steel Curtain\" defense dominated the league, ranking third in fewest yards allowed (4,019) and sending 8 of their 11 starters to the [[Pro Bowl]]: defensive linemen [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] (future Pro Football Hall of Fame player) and [[L. C. Greenwood]]; future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebackers [[Jack Ham]] and [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]; [[Andy Russell (American football)|Andy Russell]], the team's third starting linebacker; future Hall of Fame defensive back [[Mel Blount]]; and safeties [[Glen Edwards (American football)|Glen Edwards]] and [[Mike Wagner]].\n\nGreene made the Pro Bowl despite missing six games with injuries. Ham and Lambert had the best seasons of their careers, while Blount led the league with 11 interceptions and was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year.  Wagner had 4 interceptions and 3 fumble recoveries, while Edwards had 3 interceptions, while also returning 25 punts for 267 yards.\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{Further|1975\u201376 NFL playoffs}}\n\nDallas went on to defeat the [[1975 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 17\u201314, with a 50-yard touchdown pass from Staubach to Drew Pearson with less than a minute to play in what was called the \"[[The Hail Mary (American football game)|Hail Mary pass]]\". They went on to crush the [[1975 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], 37\u20137, in the [[NFC Championship Game]]. As a result, the Cowboys became the first wild card team to advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nMeanwhile, even though Pittsburgh's offense lost a total of 12 turnovers in their two playoff games, the Steelers only gave up a combined total of 20 points in their victories over the [[1975 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] in the AFC Divisional playoff game 28\u201310, and the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in the [[AFC Championship Game]] 16\u201310.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===\nComing into Super Bowl X, most sports writers and fans expected that Swann would not play. He had suffered a severe concussion in the AFC Championship Game against the Raiders that forced him to spend two days in a hospital. If he did play, many assumed he would just be used as a decoy to draw coverage away from the other receivers.\n\nThroughout the week leading up to the Super Bowl, Swann was unable to participate in several team practices or was limited to only a minor workout in them. However, a few days before the game, he received a verbal challenge from Dallas safety [[Cliff Harris]], who stated, \"I'm not going to hurt anyone intentionally. But getting hit again while he's running a pass route must be in the back of Swann's mind. I know it would be in the back of my mind.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nflportal.com/SuperBowl/sb10.html|title=Super Bowl X|website=www.nflportal.com|access-date=January 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032816/http://www.nflportal.com/SuperBowl/sb10.html|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSwann responded \"I'm still not 100 percent. I value my health, but I've had no dizzy spells. I read what Harris said. He was trying to intimidate me. He said I'd be afraid out there. He needn't worry. He doesn't know Lynn Swann.

Schachter worked as an officiating supervisor and instant replay official following his on-field retirement.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n[[NFL on CBS|CBS]] televised the game in the [[United States]] with [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Pat Summerall]] (calling his first Super Bowl in that role) and [[color commentator]] [[Tom Brookshier]]. Toward the end of the game, [[Hank Stram]] took over for Brookshier, who had left the booth to head down to the locker room area to conduct the postgame interviews with the winning team. Two days after the Super Bowl, Stram was hired as coach of the [[New Orleans Saints]], interrupting his broadcasting career for two seasons.\n\nOn radio, [[Verne Lundquist]] and Al Wisk announced the game for the [[Dallas Cowboys Radio Network]], and [[Jack Fleming]] and [[Myron Cope]] called the game for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network]]. Ed Ingles and [[Jim Kelly (sportscaster)|Jim Kelly]] called the game nationally for [[NFL on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]]. Hosting television coverage was ''[[The NFL Today]]'' crew of [[Brent Musburger]]; [[Irv Cross]] and [[Phyllis George]]. During this game, CBS began using [[Jan Stoeckart|Jack Trombey]]'s \"Horizontal Hold\" as the theme music. That would be used the following season for the ''NFL Today'' pregame show between [[1976 NFL season|1976]] and [[1980 NFL season|1980]] in its original form, with a remake for [[1981 NFL season|1981]] followed by updates for [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1989 NFL season|1989]] before its retirement.\n\n==Entertainment==\n[[File:American revolution bicentennial.svg|thumb|right|125px|Each player wore the Bicentennial logo on their jerseys]]\nThe overall theme of the Super Bowl entertainment was to celebrate the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Each Cowboys and Steelers player wore a special patch with the Bicentennial logo on their jerseys.\n\nThe performance event group [[Up with People]] performed during both the pregame festivities and the halftime show titled \"200 Years and Just a Baby: A Tribute to America's Bicentennial\". Up with People dancers portrayed various American historical figures along with a rendition of [[Steve Goodman]]'s \"[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]\".  Singer [[Tom Sullivan (singer)|Tom Sullivan]] sang the national anthem.\n\nScenes for the 1977 [[thriller film|suspense film]] ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]],'' about a fictional terrorist attack on the Super Bowl via the [[Goodyear Blimp]], were filmed during the game.\n\nThis was the last Super Bowl to kick off as early as 2:00&nbsp;p.m. (EST), thereby allowing a finish time before the commencement of many of the nation's evening church services.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl where the play clock was visible to teams and spectators. Visible play clocks were mandated by NFL rules beginning with the [[1976 NFL season|1976 season]].\n\n==Game summary==\nThe Steelers won their second straight Super Bowl, largely through the plays by Swann and by stopping a rally by the Cowboys late in the fourth quarter.  Officials did not call a single penalty on the Steelers during the game, while the Cowboys were called for only 2 penalties for 20 yards.\n\n===First quarter===\nOn the opening kickoff, the Cowboys ran a reverse where rookie linebacker [[Thomas \"Hollywood\" Henderson]] took a handoff from [[Preston Pearson]] and returned the ball a Super Bowl-record 48 yards before kicker [[Roy Gerela]] forced him out of bounds at the Steelers' 44-yard line. Gerela suffered badly bruised ribs that appeared to affect his kicking performance all afternoon. On the first play of the game, Steelers defensive lineman [[L. C. Greenwood]] sacked Cowboys quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], forcing him to fumble. Although Dallas recovered the fumble, they eventually were forced to punt. The sack was a foreshadow of things to come for Staubach, who was sacked seven times on the day. The Steelers managed to get one first down and advanced to their own 40-yard line, but then they too were forced to punt. Steelers punter [[Bobby Walden]] fumbled the snap. Walden managed to recover his own fumble, but Dallas took over on the Steelers' 29-yard line.  On the very next play, Staubach threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], taking a 7\u20130 lead. The score was the first touchdown permitted in the first quarter by the Steelers' defense in 1975.\n\nInstead of trying to immediately tie the game on a long passing play, the Steelers ran the ball on the first four plays of their ensuing possession, and then quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] completed a 32-yard pass to wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]] to reach the Cowboys' 16-yard line. Swann soared over the outstretched reach of defensive back Mark Washington before tight-roping the sideline to make the reception. Two running plays further advanced the ball to the 7-yard line. Then on third down and one, the Steelers managed to fool the Cowboys.  Pittsburgh brought in two tight ends, which usually signals a running play.  After the snap, tight end [[Randy Grossman]] faked a block to the inside as if it were a running play, but then ran a pass route into the end zone, and Bradshaw threw the ball to him for a touchdown, tying the game, 7\u20137. This marked the first Super Bowl that both teams scored in the first quarter.\n\n===Second quarter===\nDallas responded on their next drive, advancing the ball 51 yards, all rushing, (30 of them on five carries from fullback [[Robert Newhouse]]) before incurring a third down false start penalty, and scoring on kicker [[Toni Fritsch]]'s 36-yard field goal to take a 10\u20137 lead early in the second quarter.<ref name=\"USA Today Super Bowl X Play by Play\">{{cite web|title=USA Today Super Bowl X Play by Play|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/super/superbowl-x-plays.htm|publisher=USATODAY.com}}</ref> The 51 rushing yards the Cowboys amassed on the drive tripled what the Minnesota Vikings gained against Pittsburgh for all of Super Bowl IX. The Steelers subsequently advanced to the Cowboys' 36-yard line on their next possession, but on fourth down and two, Bradshaw's pass was broken up by Dallas safety [[Cliff Harris]].\n\nLater in the period, Dallas drove to the Steelers' 20-yard line. But in three plays, the Cowboys lost 25 yards. On first down, Newhouse was tackled for a 3-yard loss by linebacker [[Andy Russell (American football player)|Andy Russell]]. Then Greenwood sacked Staubach for a 12-yard loss.  And on third down, Staubach was sacked again, this time for a 10-yard loss, by defensive end [[Dwight White]]. The sacks pushed Dallas out of field goal range and they were forced to punt.  The Steelers' offense got the ball back their own 6-yard line with 3:47 left in the half. On the drive, Bradshaw completed a 53-yard pass to Swann to advance the ball to the Cowboys' 37-yard line; Swann's catch has become one of the most memorable acrobatic catches in Super Bowl history.  On the very next play, Bradshaw just missed connections with Swann at the Dallas 6. Pittsburgh drove to the 19-yard line after the two-minute warning, but the drive stalled there and ended with no points after Gerela missed a 36-yard field goal attempt with 22 seconds remaining in the period.\n\n===Third quarter===\nEarly in the third quarter, Pittsburgh got a great scoring opportunity when defensive back [[J. T. Thomas (cornerback)|J. T. Thomas]] intercepted a pass from Staubach and returned it 35 yards to the Cowboys' 25-yard line. However, once again the Steelers failed to score as the Dallas defense kept Pittsburgh out of the end zone and Gerela missed his second field goal, a 33-yard attempt.  After the miss, Harris mockingly patted Gerela on his helmet and thanked him for \"helping Dallas out,\" but was immediately thrown to the ground by Steeler linebacker [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]. Lambert could have been ejected from the game for defending his teammate, but the officials decided to allow him to remain.<ref>No. 13 of [http://espn.go.com/page2/s/superbowlmoments100.html 100 Greatest Super Bowl Moments], espn.com (Last retrieved October 28, 2005)</ref>\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nThe third quarter was completely scoreless and the Cowboys maintained their 10\u20137 lead going into the final period.  However, early in the fourth quarter, Dallas punter [[Mitch Hoopes]] was forced to punt from inside his own goal line.  As Hoopes stepped up to make the kick, Steelers running back [[Reggie Harrison]] broke through the line and blocked the punt.  The ball went through the end zone for a safety, cutting the Dallas lead to 10\u20139. It was the second safety recorded in Super Bowl history, the first occurring a year earlier when White downed Minnesota's Fran Tarkenton on a fumble recovery in the end zone. Then Steelers running back [[Mike Collier]] returned the free kick 25 yards to the Cowboys' 45-yard line.  Dallas halted the ensuing drive at the 20-yard line, but this time Gerela successfully kicked a 36-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh their first lead of the game, 12\u201310. Then on the first play of the Cowboys' next drive, Steelers defensive back [[Mike Wagner]] intercepted a pass from Staubach and returned it 19 yards to the Dallas 7-yard line. Wagner's interception came off the same play Dallas used to score their opening touchdown. Instead of surveying the middle of the field, Wagner watched Pearson and recognized the pattern. Staubach later said: \"It was our bread and butter play all season long. It was the first time it didn't work.\"  The Cowboys defense again managed to prevent a touchdown, but Gerela kicked an 18-yard field goal to increase the Steelers lead to 15\u201310.\n\nThe Steelers forced a punt and regained possession of the ball on their own 30-yard line with 4:25 left in the final period, giving them a chance to either increase their lead or run out the clock to win the game. But after two plays, the Steelers found themselves facing 3rd-and-4 on their own 36-yard line. Assuming that the Cowboys would be expecting a short pass or a run, Bradshaw decided to try a long pass and told Swann in the huddle to run a deep post pattern. As Bradshaw dropped back to pass, Harris and linebacker [[D. D. Lewis (Dallas Cowboys)|D.D. Lewis]] both [[blitz (American football)|blitzed]] in an attempt to sack him. But Bradshaw managed to dodge Lewis and throw the ball just before being leveled by Harris and lineman [[Larry Cole]], who landed a helmet-to-helmet hit on Bradshaw. Swann then caught the ball at the 5-yard line and ran into the end zone for a 64-yard touchdown completion. Bradshaw never did see Swann's catch or the touchdown since Cole's hit to Bradshaw's helmet knocked him out of the game with a head injury. It was only after he was assisted to the locker room that he was told what happened.\n\nAfter play resumed, Gerela missed the extra point attempt, but the Steelers now had a 21\u201310 lead with 3:02 left in the game, and the Cowboys needed two touchdowns to come back.\n\nStaubach then led his team 80 yards in 5 plays on the ensuing drive, scoring on a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Percy Howard]] and cutting their deficit to 21\u201317 (Howard's touchdown reception was the only catch of his NFL career; he was not mentioned by name by [[John Facenda]] in the highlight package produced by [[NFL Films]]). After [[Gerry Mullins]] recovered Dallas' onside kick attempt, the Steelers then tried to run out the clock on the next drive with four straight running plays, but the Cowboys defense stopped them on fourth down at their 39-yard line, giving Dallas one more chance to win. Some questioned why Noll would elect to go for it on fourth down but, as later explained by [[NFL Films]], his entire kicking game had been suspect all game long with Gerela missing an extra point and two field goals while Walden fumbled a snap on a punt, and nearly had two punts blocked. (Gerela's problems may have begun on the opening kickoff when he was forced to make a touchdown saving tackle on Hollywood Henderson.) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbx|title=Super Bowl X Box Score: Pittsburgh 21, Dallas 17|website=www.nfl.com}}</ref>\n\nWith 1:22 left in the game, Staubach started out the drive with an 11-yard scramble to midfield, and then followed it up with a 12-yard completion to Preston Pearson at the Steelers' 38-yard line. Pearson inexplicably ran towards the middle rather than running out of bounds to stop the clock.  On the next play, Staubach couldn't handle a low snap but managed to recover the ball and throw it downfield for an incompletion. On second down with 12 seconds left, he threw a pass intended for Howard in the end zone, but the ball bounced off Howard's helmet and a Hail Mary replay was not to be. Had Howard positioned himself inches back from his position in the end zone as the ball came down he would have had a better opportunity to catch the ball and write himself into Cowboy folklore. Then on third down, Staubach once again tried to complete a pass to Howard in the end zone, but the ball was tipped by Wagner into the arms of safety [[Glen Edwards (American football)|Glen Edwards]] for an interception as time expired, sealing Pittsburgh's victory.\n\nBradshaw finished the game with 9 out of 19 pass completions for 209 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions. He also added another 16 yards rushing the ball.  Staubach completed 15 out of 24 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns with three interceptions.  He also rushed for 22 yards on five carries, but was sacked seven times.  Steelers running back [[Franco Harris]] was the leading rusher of the game with 82 rushing yards, and also caught a pass for 26 yards.  Newhouse was the Cowboys top rusher with 56 yards, and caught two passes for 12 yards.  Greenwood recorded a Super Bowl record four sacks but it has gone unrecognized since the NFL didn't officially record sacks until 1982.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe game was remembered for being the most exciting of the first 10 Super Bowl games. Swann's heroics and Lambert's 14 tackles and throw-down of Cliff Harris are the indelible images from the game. After being benched to start the 1974 campaign and being booed for most of his first four seasons in Pittsburgh, Bradshaw became the first quarterback to throw two game-winning touchdown passes in Super Bowl competition. The [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers']] bid for three-consecutive championships ended in a 24\u20137 loss to the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in the [[1976-77 NFL playoffs|1976 AFC Championship game]] after a [[1976 NFL season|season]] that saw Pittsburgh's defense shut out five opponents and allow only 28 points in a 9-game span. The loss to Pittsburgh coupled with an early playoff exit in [[1976 Dallas Cowboys season|1976]] largely influenced the Cowboys to draft [[Tony Dorsett]] in the 1977 Draft to help infuse life into Dallas' offense. Dorsett helped lead [[1977 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]] to a [[Super Bowl XII]] victory over the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], who defeated the Steelers in the first round of the playoffs that year.\n\nPittsburgh and Dallas would battle in another thriller in [[Super Bowl XIII]] (also played in Miami). The result was the same, as the Steelers prevailed 35\u201331. But Super Bowl X was the game that began the rivalry between the two storied franchises. The Cowboys gained a measure of revenge by defeating the Steelers 27\u201317 in [[Super Bowl XXX]] following the [[1995 NFL season|1995 season]].\n\nThis was the final football game to be played on [[artificial turf]] (specifically, [[Poly-Turf]]) at the Orange Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mvMjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b-0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6999,377430|title=The Spokesman-Review - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> The surface in 1976 reverted to natural grass, and remained so until the stadium's closure in 2007. Poly-Turf was first installed at the Orange Bowl in 1970 and replaced in 1972, but players complained often of the slickness of the surfaces, and fields became discolored due to the intense sunshine common to south Florida.\n\n===Box score===\n{{Americanfootballbox\n| bg = #eee\n| titlestyle = text-align:center; background-color:#000; color:#fff\n| title = Super Bowl X: Pittsburgh Steelers 21,

between the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) champion [[1975 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] and the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) champion [[1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] to decide the [[National Football League]] (NFL) champion for the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]]. The Steelers defeated the Cowboys by the score of 21\u201317 to win their second consecutive Super Bowl. They were the third team to win back-to-back Super Bowls. (The [[Miami Dolphins]] won [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowls VII]] and [[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]], and the [[Green Bay Packers]] won [[Super Bowl I|Super Bowls I]] and [[Super Bowl II|II]].) It was also the first Super Bowl in which both participating teams had previously won a Super Bowl, as the Steelers were the defending champions and the Cowboys had won [[Super Bowl VI]].\n\nThe game was played at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]<ref>This was the last game played on [[AstroTurf]] at the Orange Bowl. The artificial surface was installed in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], but after this game, the AstroTurf was ripped up and grass was replanted for the [[1976 NFL season|1976]] season. Also, this was the last open-air stadium [[Super Bowl]] to be played on AstroTurf. Every outdoor Super Bowl since then had been played on grass, until [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] when it was played on a next-generation artificial surface.</ref> in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], on January 18, 1976, one of the first major national events of the [[United States Bicentennial]] year. Both the pre-game and halftime show celebrated the Bicentennial, while players on both teams wore special patches on their jerseys with the Bicentennial logo.\n\nSuper Bowl X featured a contrast of playing styles between the Steelers and the Cowboys, which were, at the time, the two most popular teams in the league. The Steelers, dominating teams with their \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense and running game, finished the regular season with a league best 12\u20132 record and defeated the [[1975 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in the playoffs. The Cowboys, with their offense and \"flex\" defense, became the first NFC [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team to advance to the Super Bowl after posting a 10\u20134 regular season record and postseason victories over the [[1975 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] and the [[1975 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]].\n\nTrailing 10\u20137 in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl X, the Steelers rallied to score 14 unanswered points, including a 64-yard touchdown reception by Pittsburgh wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]]. The Cowboys cut the score, 21\u201317, late in the game with wide receiver [[Percy Howard]]'s 34-yard touchdown reception, but Pittsburgh safety [[Glen Edwards (American football)|Glen Edwards]] halted Dallas' rally with an end zone interception as time expired. Swann, who caught four passes for a Super Bowl record 161 yards and one touchdown, became the first wide receiver to be named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]].\n\n==Background==\nThe NFL awarded Super Bowl X to Miami on April 3, 1973, at the owners' meetings held in Scottsdale, Arizona.<ref name=\"USA Today Super Bowl X Play by Play\" />\n\n===Dallas Cowboys===\n{{main|1975 Dallas Cowboys season}}\n\nThe Cowboys, considered a [[Cinderella team]] entering the Super Bowl, advanced to their third Super Bowl in team history with their rather high-tech offense and \"flex\" defense. Quarterback [[Roger Staubach]] had a solid season, passing for 2,666 yards and 17 touchdowns, while also rushing for 310 yards. Wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] led the team with 46 receptions for 822 yards and 8 touchdowns. Wide receiver [[Golden Richards]] and tight end [[Jean Fugett]] were also reliable targets in the Cowboys' passing game, combining for 59 receptions and 939 receiving yards.\n\nLike the Steelers, Dallas was a run-based team. Fullback [[Robert Newhouse]] was their leading rusher with\n930 yards, and also caught 34 passes for 274 yards. Halfback [[Doug Dennison]] contributed 388 yards. Perhaps the most talented player in the backfield was halfback [[Preston Pearson]] (no relation to receiver Drew Pearson), who signed on the team as a [[free agent]] after being cut by the Steelers in the preseason.  Preston rushed for 509 yards, caught 27 passes for 351 yards, and added another 391 yards returning kickoffs.  Preston had been especially effective in the playoffs, where he caught 12 passes for 200 yards and three touchdowns, and was extremely eager to increase his numbers in the Super Bowl against the team that let him go.  Up front, the offensive line was led by All-Pro right tackle [[Rayfield Wright]].\n\nThe Cowboys' \"Flex\" defense was anchored by linemen [[Harvey Martin]] and [[Ed Jones (American football)|Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones]]. Linebacker [[Lee Roy Jordan]] led the team with six interceptions, while linebacker [[D. D. Lewis (Dallas Cowboys)|D.D. Lewis]] was an effective weapon pass rushing. The starting players in Dallas' defensive secondary, future Hall of Fame cornerback [[Mel Renfro]], cornerback Mark Washington, and safeties [[Charlie Waters]] and future Hall of Famer [[Cliff Harris]], combined for 12 interceptions.\n\nEven though the Cowboys finished in second place in the [[NFC East]] with a 10\u20134 record, they qualified for the playoffs as the [[National Football Conference|NFC]]'s [[wild card (sports)|wild-card]] team (during that time, only one wild card team from each conference entered the playoffs).  The Dallas Cowboys became the first [[National Football Conference|NFC]] [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] team to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{main|1975 Pittsburgh Steelers season}}\n\nThe Steelers became the first official #1 seed to reach the Super Bowl. Playoff seeds were instituted in [[1975 NFL season|1975]]. The Steelers finished the regular season with a league-best 12\u20132 record, dominating opponents with their \"Steel Curtain\" defense and powerful running game. Fullback [[Franco Harris]] ranked second in the league with 1,246 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, while also catching 28 passes for 214 yards and another touchdown. Halfback [[Rocky Bleier]] had 528 rushing yards, and fullback [[John Fuqua|John \"Frenchy\" Fuqua]] added 285 yards and 18 receptions. Still, the Steelers had a fine passing attack led by quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]]. Bradshaw threw for 2,055 yards, 18 touchdowns, and nine interceptions while rushing for 210 yards and three touchdowns. One reason why Bradshaw's numbers were much improved from the previous season was the emergence of wide receivers [[Lynn Swann]] and [[John Stallworth]]. Both saw limited playing time in the previous season, but became significant contributors in 1975. Swann caught a team-leading 49 passes for 781 yards and 11 touchdowns. Stallworth only had 20 receptions, but he had an average of 21.2 yards per catch, recording a total of 423 reception yards.\n\nThe Steelers' \"Steel Curtain\" defense dominated the league, ranking third in fewest yards allowed (4,019) and sending 8 of their 11 starters to the [[Pro Bowl]]: defensive linemen [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] (future Pro Football Hall of Fame player) and [[L. C. Greenwood]]; future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] linebackers [[Jack Ham]] and [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]; [[Andy Russell (American football)|Andy Russell]], the team's third starting linebacker; future Hall of Fame defensive back [[Mel Blount]]; and safeties [[Glen Edwards (American football)|Glen Edwards]] and [[Mike Wagner]].\n\nGreene made the Pro Bowl despite missing six games with injuries. Ham and Lambert had the best seasons of their careers, while Blount led the league with 11 interceptions and was named the NFL's Defensive Player of the Year.  Wagner had 4 interceptions and 3 fumble recoveries, while Edwards had 3 interceptions, while also returning 25 punts for 267 yards.\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{Further|1975\u201376 NFL playoffs}}\n\nDallas went on to defeat the [[1975 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]], 17\u201314, with a 50-yard touchdown pass from Staubach to Drew Pearson with less than a minute to play in what was called the \"[[The Hail Mary (American football game)|Hail Mary pass]]\". They went on to crush the [[1975 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]], 37\u20137, in the [[NFC Championship Game]]. As a result, the Cowboys became the first wild card team to advance to the Super Bowl.\n\nMeanwhile, even though Pittsburgh's offense lost a total of 12 turnovers in their two playoff games, the Steelers only gave up a combined total of 20 points in their victories over the [[1975 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] in the AFC Divisional playoff game 28\u201310, and the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in the [[AFC Championship Game]] 16\u201310.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===\nComing into Super Bowl X, most sports writers and fans expected that Swann would not play. He had suffered a severe concussion in the AFC Championship Game against the Raiders that forced him to spend two days in a hospital. If he did play, many assumed he would just be used as a decoy to draw coverage away from the other receivers.\n\nThroughout the week leading up to the Super Bowl, Swann was unable to participate in several team practices or was limited to only a minor workout in them. However, a few days before the game, he received a verbal challenge from Dallas safety [[Cliff Harris]], who stated, \"I'm not going to hurt anyone intentionally. But getting hit again while he's running a pass route must be in the back of Swann's mind. I know it would be in the back of my mind.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nflportal.com/SuperBowl/sb10.html|title=Super Bowl X|website=www.nflportal.com|access-date=January 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032816/http://www.nflportal.com/SuperBowl/sb10.html|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSwann responded \"I'm still not 100 percent. I value my health, but I've had no dizzy spells. I read what Harris said. He was trying to intimidate me. He said I'd be afraid out there. He needn't worry. He doesn't know Lynn Swann.

Schachter worked as an officiating supervisor and instant replay official following his on-field retirement.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n[[NFL on CBS|CBS]] televised the game in the [[United States]] with [[play-by-play|play-by-play announcer]] [[Pat Summerall]] (calling his first Super Bowl in that role) and [[color commentator]] [[Tom Brookshier]]. Toward the end of the game, [[Hank Stram]] took over for Brookshier, who had left the booth to head down to the locker room area to conduct the postgame interviews with the winning team. Two days after the Super Bowl, Stram was hired as coach of the [[New Orleans Saints]], interrupting his broadcasting career for two seasons.\n\nOn radio, [[Verne Lundquist]] and Al Wisk announced the game for the [[Dallas Cowboys Radio Network]], and [[Jack Fleming]] and [[Myron Cope]] called the game for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network]]. Ed Ingles and [[Jim Kelly (sportscaster)|Jim Kelly]] called the game nationally for [[NFL on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]]. Hosting television coverage was ''[[The NFL Today]]'' crew of [[Brent Musburger]]; [[Irv Cross]] and [[Phyllis George]]. During this game, CBS began using [[Jan Stoeckart|Jack Trombey]]'s \"Horizontal Hold\" as the theme music. That would be used the following season for the ''NFL Today'' pregame show between [[1976 NFL season|1976]] and [[1980 NFL season|1980]] in its original form, with a remake for [[1981 NFL season|1981]] followed by updates for [[1984 NFL season|1984]] and [[1989 NFL season|1989]] before its retirement.\n\n==Entertainment==\n[[File:American revolution bicentennial.svg|thumb|right|125px|Each player wore the Bicentennial logo on their jerseys]]\nThe overall theme of the Super Bowl entertainment was to celebrate the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Each Cowboys and Steelers player wore a special patch with the Bicentennial logo on their jerseys.\n\nThe performance event group [[Up with People]] performed during both the pregame festivities and the halftime show titled \"200 Years and Just a Baby: A Tribute to America's Bicentennial\". Up with People dancers portrayed various American historical figures along with a rendition of [[Steve Goodman]]'s \"[[City of New Orleans (song)|City of New Orleans]]\".  Singer [[Tom Sullivan (singer)|Tom Sullivan]] sang the national anthem.\n\nScenes for the 1977 [[thriller film|suspense film]] ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]],'' about a fictional terrorist attack on the Super Bowl via the [[Goodyear Blimp]], were filmed during the game.\n\nThis was the last Super Bowl to kick off as early as 2:00&nbsp;p.m. (EST), thereby allowing a finish time before the commencement of many of the nation's evening church services.\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl where the play clock was visible to teams and spectators. Visible play clocks were mandated by NFL rules beginning with the [[1976 NFL season|1976 season]].\n\n==Game summary==\nThe Steelers won their second straight Super Bowl, largely through the plays by Swann and by stopping a rally by the Cowboys late in the fourth quarter.  Officials did not call a single penalty on the Steelers during the game, while the Cowboys were called for only 2 penalties for 20 yards.\n\n===First quarter===\nOn the opening kickoff, the Cowboys ran a reverse where rookie linebacker [[Thomas \"Hollywood\" Henderson]] took a handoff from [[Preston Pearson]] and returned the ball a Super Bowl-record 48 yards before kicker [[Roy Gerela]] forced him out of bounds at the Steelers' 44-yard line. Gerela suffered badly bruised ribs that appeared to affect his kicking performance all afternoon. On the first play of the game, Steelers defensive lineman [[L. C. Greenwood]] sacked Cowboys quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], forcing him to fumble. Although Dallas recovered the fumble, they eventually were forced to punt. The sack was a foreshadow of things to come for Staubach, who was sacked seven times on the day. The Steelers managed to get one first down and advanced to their own 40-yard line, but then they too were forced to punt. Steelers punter [[Bobby Walden]] fumbled the snap. Walden managed to recover his own fumble, but Dallas took over on the Steelers' 29-yard line.  On the very next play, Staubach threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]], taking a 7\u20130 lead. The score was the first touchdown permitted in the first quarter by the Steelers' defense in 1975.\n\nInstead of trying to immediately tie the game on a long passing play, the Steelers ran the ball on the first four plays of their ensuing possession, and then quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] completed a 32-yard pass to wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]] to reach the Cowboys' 16-yard line. Swann soared over the outstretched reach of defensive back Mark Washington before tight-roping the sideline to make the reception. Two running plays further advanced the ball to the 7-yard line. Then on third down and one, the Steelers managed to fool the Cowboys.  Pittsburgh brought in two tight ends, which usually signals a running play.  After the snap, tight end [[Randy Grossman]] faked a block to the inside as if it were a running play, but then ran a pass route into the end zone, and Bradshaw threw the ball to him for a touchdown, tying the game, 7\u20137. This marked the first Super Bowl that both teams scored in the first quarter.\n\n===Second quarter===\nDallas responded on their next drive, advancing the ball 51 yards, all rushing, (30 of them on five carries from fullback [[Robert Newhouse]]) before incurring a third down false start penalty, and scoring on kicker [[Toni Fritsch]]'s 36-yard field goal to take a 10\u20137 lead early in the second quarter.<ref name=\"USA Today Super Bowl X Play by Play\">{{cite web|title=USA Today Super Bowl X Play by Play|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/super/superbowl-x-plays.htm|publisher=USATODAY.com}}</ref> The 51 rushing yards the Cowboys amassed on the drive tripled what the Minnesota Vikings gained against Pittsburgh for all of Super Bowl IX. The Steelers subsequently advanced to the Cowboys' 36-yard line on their next possession, but on fourth down and two, Bradshaw's pass was broken up by Dallas safety [[Cliff Harris]].\n\nLater in the period, Dallas drove to the Steelers' 20-yard line. But in three plays, the Cowboys lost 25 yards. On first down, Newhouse was tackled for a 3-yard loss by linebacker [[Andy Russell (American football player)|Andy Russell]]. Then Greenwood sacked Staubach for a 12-yard loss.  And on third down, Staubach was sacked again, this time for a 10-yard loss, by defensive end [[Dwight White]]. The sacks pushed Dallas out of field goal range and they were forced to punt.  The Steelers' offense got the ball back their own 6-yard line with 3:47 left in the half. On the drive, Bradshaw completed a 53-yard pass to Swann to advance the ball to the Cowboys' 37-yard line; Swann's catch has become one of the most memorable acrobatic catches in Super Bowl history.  On the very next play, Bradshaw just missed connections with Swann at the Dallas 6. Pittsburgh drove to the 19-yard line after the two-minute warning, but the drive stalled there and ended with no points after Gerela missed a 36-yard field goal attempt with 22 seconds remaining in the period.\n\n===Third quarter===\nEarly in the third quarter, Pittsburgh got a great scoring opportunity when defensive back [[J. T. Thomas (cornerback)|J. T. Thomas]] intercepted a pass from Staubach and returned it 35 yards to the Cowboys' 25-yard line. However, once again the Steelers failed to score as the Dallas defense kept Pittsburgh out of the end zone and Gerela missed his second field goal, a 33-yard attempt.  After the miss, Harris mockingly patted Gerela on his helmet and thanked him for \"helping Dallas out,\" but was immediately thrown to the ground by Steeler linebacker [[Jack Lambert (American football)|Jack Lambert]]. Lambert could have been ejected from the game for defending his teammate, but the officials decided to allow him to remain.<ref>No. 13 of [http://espn.go.com/page2/s/superbowlmoments100.html 100 Greatest Super Bowl Moments], espn.com (Last retrieved October 28, 2005)</ref>\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nThe third quarter was completely scoreless and the Cowboys maintained their 10\u20137 lead going into the final period.  However, early in the fourth quarter, Dallas punter [[Mitch Hoopes]] was forced to punt from inside his own goal line.  As Hoopes stepped up to make the kick, Steelers running back [[Reggie Harrison]] broke through the line and blocked the punt.  The ball went through the end zone for a safety, cutting the Dallas lead to 10\u20139. It was the second safety recorded in Super Bowl history, the first occurring a year earlier when White downed Minnesota's Fran Tarkenton on a fumble recovery in the end zone. Then Steelers running back [[Mike Collier]] returned the free kick 25 yards to the Cowboys' 45-yard line.  Dallas halted the ensuing drive at the 20-yard line, but this time Gerela successfully kicked a 36-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh their first lead of the game, 12\u201310. Then on the first play of the Cowboys' next drive, Steelers defensive back [[Mike Wagner]] intercepted a pass from Staubach and returned it 19 yards to the Dallas 7-yard line. Wagner's interception came off the same play Dallas used to score their opening touchdown. Instead of surveying the middle of the field, Wagner watched Pearson and recognized the pattern. Staubach later said: \"It was our bread and butter play all season long. It was the first time it didn't work.\"  The Cowboys defense again managed to prevent a touchdown, but Gerela kicked an 18-yard field goal to increase the Steelers lead to 15\u201310.\n\nThe Steelers forced a punt and regained possession of the ball on their own 30-yard line with 4:25 left in the final period, giving them a chance to either increase their lead or run out the clock to win the game. But after two plays, the Steelers found themselves facing 3rd-and-4 on their own 36-yard line. Assuming that the Cowboys would be expecting a short pass or a run, Bradshaw decided to try a long pass and told Swann in the huddle to run a deep post pattern. As Bradshaw dropped back to pass, Harris and linebacker [[D. D. Lewis (Dallas Cowboys)|D.D. Lewis]] both [[blitz (American football)|blitzed]] in an attempt to sack him. But Bradshaw managed to dodge Lewis and throw the ball just before being leveled by Harris and lineman [[Larry Cole]], who landed a helmet-to-helmet hit on Bradshaw. Swann then caught the ball at the 5-yard line and ran into the end zone for a 64-yard touchdown completion. Bradshaw never did see Swann's catch or the touchdown since Cole's hit to Bradshaw's helmet knocked him out of the game with a head injury. It was only after he was assisted to the locker room that he was told what happened.\n\nAfter play resumed, Gerela missed the extra point attempt, but the Steelers now had a 21\u201310 lead with 3:02 left in the game, and the Cowboys needed two touchdowns to come back.\n\nStaubach then led his team 80 yards in 5 plays on the ensuing drive, scoring on a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Percy Howard]] and cutting their deficit to 21\u201317 (Howard's touchdown reception was the only catch of his NFL career; he was not mentioned by name by [[John Facenda]] in the highlight package produced by [[NFL Films]]). After [[Gerry Mullins]] recovered Dallas' onside kick attempt, the Steelers then tried to run out the clock on the next drive with four straight running plays, but the Cowboys defense stopped them on fourth down at their 39-yard line, giving Dallas one more chance to win. Some questioned why Noll would elect to go for it on fourth down but, as later explained by [[NFL Films]], his entire kicking game had been suspect all game long with Gerela missing an extra point and two field goals while Walden fumbled a snap on a punt, and nearly had two punts blocked. (Gerela's problems may have begun on the opening kickoff when he was forced to make a touchdown saving tackle on Hollywood Henderson.) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/boxscore/sbx|title=Super Bowl X Box Score: Pittsburgh 21, Dallas 17|website=www.nfl.com}}</ref>\n\nWith 1:22 left in the game, Staubach started out the drive with an 11-yard scramble to midfield, and then followed it up with a 12-yard completion to Preston Pearson at the Steelers' 38-yard line. Pearson inexplicably ran towards the middle rather than running out of bounds to stop the clock.  On the next play, Staubach couldn't handle a low snap but managed to recover the ball and throw it downfield for an incompletion. On second down with 12 seconds left, he threw a pass intended for Howard in the end zone, but the ball bounced off Howard's helmet and a Hail Mary replay was not to be. Had Howard positioned himself inches back from his position in the end zone as the ball came down he would have had a better opportunity to catch the ball and write himself into Cowboy folklore. Then on third down, Staubach once again tried to complete a pass to Howard in the end zone, but the ball was tipped by Wagner into the arms of safety [[Glen Edwards (American football)|Glen Edwards]] for an interception as time expired, sealing Pittsburgh's victory.\n\nBradshaw finished the game with 9 out of 19 pass completions for 209 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions. He also added another 16 yards rushing the ball.  Staubach completed 15 out of 24 passes for 204 yards and two touchdowns with three interceptions.  He also rushed for 22 yards on five carries, but was sacked seven times.  Steelers running back [[Franco Harris]] was the leading rusher of the game with 82 rushing yards, and also caught a pass for 26 yards.  Newhouse was the Cowboys top rusher with 56 yards, and caught two passes for 12 yards.  Greenwood recorded a Super Bowl record four sacks but it has gone unrecognized since the NFL didn't officially record sacks until 1982.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe game was remembered for being the most exciting of the first 10 Super Bowl games. Swann's heroics and Lambert's 14 tackles and throw-down of Cliff Harris are the indelible images from the game. After being benched to start the 1974 campaign and being booed for most of his first four seasons in Pittsburgh, Bradshaw became the first quarterback to throw two game-winning touchdown passes in Super Bowl competition. The [[1976 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers']] bid for three-consecutive championships ended in a 24\u20137 loss to the [[1976 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] in the [[1976-77 NFL playoffs|1976 AFC Championship game]] after a [[1976 NFL season|season]] that saw Pittsburgh's defense shut out five opponents and allow only 28 points in a 9-game span. The loss to Pittsburgh coupled with an early playoff exit in [[1976 Dallas Cowboys season|1976]] largely influenced the Cowboys to draft [[Tony Dorsett]] in the 1977 Draft to help infuse life into Dallas' offense. Dorsett helped lead [[1977 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]] to a [[Super Bowl XII]] victory over the [[1977 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], who defeated the Steelers in the first round of the playoffs that year.\n\nPittsburgh and Dallas would battle in another thriller in [[Super Bowl XIII]] (also played in Miami). The result was the same, as the Steelers prevailed 35\u201331. But Super Bowl X was the game that began the rivalry between the two storied franchises. The Cowboys gained a measure of revenge by defeating the Steelers 27\u201317 in [[Super Bowl XXX]] following the [[1995 NFL season|1995 season]].\n\nThis was the final football game to be played on [[artificial turf]] (specifically, [[Poly-Turf]]) at the Orange Bowl.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mvMjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=b-0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6999,377430|title=The Spokesman-Review - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> The surface in 1976 reverted to natural grass, and remained so until the stadium's closure in 2007. Poly-Turf was first installed at the Orange Bowl in 1970 and replaced in 1972, but players complained often of the slickness of the surfaces, and fields became discolored due to the intense sunshine common to south Florida.\n\n===Box score===\n{{Americanfootballbox\n| bg = #eee\n| titlestyle = text-align:center; background-color:#000; color:#fff\n| title = Super Bowl X: Pittsburgh Steelers 21,

By and large, Armenia's Muslim community (once composed of [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurds]]) is virtually nonexistent due to population exchange between Armenia and Azerbaijan during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].\n\n== LGBT rights in Armenia ==\n{{Main|LGBT rights in Armenia}}\n\nHomosexuality has been legal in Armenia since 2003.<ref name=\"ILGA 2013\">[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf State-sponsored Homophobia A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEmVxpKn?url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |date=2013-07-19 }}</ref> However, even though it has been decriminalized, the situation of local lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) citizens has not changed substantially.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.
