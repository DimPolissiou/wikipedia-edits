When CMY \"primaries\" are combined at full strength, the resulting \"secondary\" mixtures are red, green, and blue\nSubtractiveColor.svg|Mixing all three theoretically results in black, but imperfect ink formulations do not give true black, which is why an additional ''K'' component is needed.\nFile:NIEdot367.jpg|An example of color printing from 1902.

This is called the CMYK color model.\nFile:RGB illumination.jpg|On a computer display, yellow is created by combining green and red light at the right intensity on a black screen.\n</gallery>\n\nYellow is found between green and orange on the spectrum of visible light. It is the color the human eye sees when it looks at light with a [[dominant wavelength]] between 570 and 590 nanometers.\n\nIn color printing, yellow is one of the three colors of ink, along with [[magenta]] and [[cyan]], which, along with black,  can be overlaid in the right combination, along with black, to print any full color image. (See the [[CMYK color model]]).  A particular yellow is used, called Process yellow (also known as \"pigment yellow\", \"printer's yellow\", and \"canary yellow\") subtractive [[primary color]]s, along with [[magenta]] and [[cyan]]. Process yellow is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure yellow ink.\n\nThe yellow on a color television or computer screen is created in a completely different way; by combining green and red light at the right level of intensity. (See [[RGB color model]]).\n\n==== Complementary colors ====\n\n[[File:PlanckianLocusWithYellowComplements.png|thumb|upright|Complements of yellow have a dominant wavelength in the range 380 to 480&nbsp;nm.

This definition, however, does not constrain what version of white will be specified. In the nineteenth century, the scientists [[Hermann Grassmann|Grassmann]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] did experiments in which they concluded that finding a good complement for spectral yellow was difficult, but that the result was indigo, that is, a wavelength that today's color scientists would call '''violet or purple'''. Helmholtz says \"Yellow and indigo blue\" are complements.<ref>{{cite book | title = Physiological Optics | first = Hermann | last = von Helmholtz | publisher = Dover | year = 1924 | isbn = 978-0-486-44260-0}}</ref> Grassmann reconstructs Newton's category boundaries in terms of wavelengths and says \"This indigo therefore falls within the limits of color between which, according to Helmholtz, the complementary colors of yellow lie.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Theory of Compound Colors | first = Hermann G\u00fcnter | last = Grassmann | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume =4 | year = 1854 | pages = 254\u201364 }}</ref>\n\nNewton's own color circle has yellow directly opposite the boundary between indigo and violet. These results, that the complement of yellow is a wavelength shorter than 450&nbsp;nm, are derivable from the modern [[CIE 1931]] system of colorimetry if it is assumed that the yellow is about 580&nbsp;nm or shorter wavelength, and the specified white is the color of a blackbody radiator of temperature 2800 [[kelvin|K]] or lower (that is, the white of an ordinary incandescent light bulb). More typically, with a daylight-colored or around 5000 to 6000 K white, the complement of yellow will be in the blue wavelength range, which is the standard modern answer for the complement of yellow.\n\nBecause of the characteristics of paint pigments and use of different [[color wheel]]s, painters traditionally regard the complement of yellow as the color indigo or blue-violet.\n\n==== Lasers ====\n[[Laser]]s emitting in the yellow part of the spectrum are less common and more expensive than most other colors.<ref name=\"laserglow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/index.php?portable |title=Laserglow \u2013 Blue, Red, Yellow, Green Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=27 March 2009 |quote=described as an \"extremely rare yellow\".}}</ref> In commercial products diode pumped solid state ([[Diode-pumped solid-state laser|DPSS]]) technology is employed to create the yellow light.

They serve two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in [[photosynthesis]], and they protect the green [[chlorophyll]] from photodamage.<ref name=\"fasebj.org\"/>\n\nIn late summer, as [[daylight]] hours shorten and temperatures cool, the [[vein]]s that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off. The water and [[mineral]] intake into the leaf is reduced, slowly at first, and then more rapidly. It is during this time that the chlorophyll begins to decrease.\nAs the chlorophyll diminishes, the yellow and red carotenoids become more and more visible, creating the classic [[autumn leaf color]].\n\nCarotenoids are common in many living things; they give the characteristic color to [[carrot]]s, [[maize]], [[daffodil]]s, [[rutabaga]]s, [[buttercup]]s and bananas. They are responsible for the red of cooked [[lobster]]s, the pink of [[flamingoes]] and [[salmon]] and the yellow of [[Domestic canary|canaries]] and [[egg yolk]]s.\n\n[[Xanthophylls]] are the most common yellow [[pigment]]s that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group. The name is from Greek ''xanthos'' ('''\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2''', \"yellow\") + ''phyllon'' ('''\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd''', \"leaf\"). Xanthophylls are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants, but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat. For example, the yellow color of chicken egg yolks, fat, and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume. Chicken farmers understand this, and often add [[xanthophyll]]s, usually [[lutein]], to make the egg yolks more yellow.\n\nBananas are green when they are picked because of the chlorophyll their skin contains. Once picked, they begin to ripen; [[hormones]] in the bananas convert amino acids into ethylene gas, which stimulates the production of several [[enzymes]]. These enzymes start to change the color, texture and flavor of the banana.

The cave of [[Lascaux]] has an image of a horse colored with yellow estimated to be 17,300 years old.\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nIn Ancient [[Egypt]], yellow was associated with gold, which was considered to be imperishable, eternal and indestructible. The skin and bones of the gods were believed to be made of [[gold]]. The Egyptians used yellow extensively in tomb paintings; they usually used either yellow ochre or the brilliant [[orpiment]], though it was made of [[arsenic]] and was highly toxic. A small paintbox with orpiment pigment was found in the tomb of King [[Tutankhamun]]. Men were always shown with brown faces, women with yellow ochre or gold faces.<ref name=\"webexhibits.org\"/>\n\nThe ancient Romans used yellow in their paintings to represent [[gold]] and also in skin tones. It is found frequently in the murals of [[Pompeii]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Lascaux2.jpg|Image of a horse colored with [[yellow ochre]] from  [[Lascaux]] cave.\nFile:Tomb of Nakht.jpg|Paintings in the Tomb of Nakht in [[ancient Egypt]] (15th century BC).\nFile:Harfenspielerin R\u00f6misches Fresko.jpg|Yellow ochre was often used in wall paintings in Ancient Roman villas and towns.\nFile:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|[[Byzantine art]] made lavish use of gold, seen in this detail of the [[mosaic]] of the Emperor [[Justinian]] from the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], Italy (before 547 AD).\nFile:Flag of Palaeologus Dynasty.svg|The flag of the [[Paleologus dynasty]] of Byzantine emperors was red and gold. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Post-classical history ===\nDuring the Post-Classical period, yellow became firmly established as the color of [[Judas Iscariot]], the disciple who betrayed [[Jesus Christ]], even though the [[Bible]] never describes his clothing. From this connection, yellow also took on associations with [[envy]], [[jealousy]] and duplicity.\n\nThe tradition started in the Renaissance of marking non-Christian outsiders, such as Jews, with the color yellow. In 16th century Spain, those accused of [[heresy]] and who refused to renounce their views were compelled to come before the [[Spanish Inquisition]] dressed in a yellow cape.<ref>Eva Heller (2000). ''Psychologie de la couleur -effets et symboliques'', p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe color yellow has been historically associated with moneylenders and finance. The [[National Pawnbrokers Association]]'s logo depicts three golden spheres hanging from a bar, referencing the three bags of gold that the patron saint of pawnbroking, [[Nicholas of Myra|St. Nicholas]], holds in his hands.

His painting ''Rain, Steam, and Speed \u2013 the Great Central Railway'' was dominated by glowing yellow clouds.\n\n[[Georges Seurat]] used the new synthetic colors in his experimental paintings composed of tiny points of primary colors, particularly in his famous ''Sunday Afternoon on the Isle de la Grand jatte'' (1884\u201386). He did not know that the new synthetic yellow pigment, zinc yellow or [[zinc chromate]], which he used in the light green lawns, was highly unstable and would quickly turn brown.<ref>John Gage, (1993), ''Colour and Culture \u2013 Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction'', p. 220.</ref>\n\nThe painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] was a particular admirer of the color yellow, the color of sunshine. Writing to his sister from the south of France in 1888, he wrote, \"Now we are having beautiful warm, windless weather that is very beneficial to me. The sun, a light that for lack of a better word I can only call yellow, bright sulfur yellow, pale lemon gold. How beautiful yellow is!\" In Arles, Van Gogh painted sunflowers inside a small house he rented at 2 Place Lamartine, a house painted with a color that Van Gogh described as \"buttery yellow.\" Van Gogh was one of the first artists to use commercially manufactured paints, rather than paints he made himself. He used the traditional yellow ochre, but also [[chrome yellow]], first made in 1809, and [[cadmium yellow]], first made in 1820.<ref>Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, in 1895, a new popular art form began to appear in New York newspapers; the color [[comic strip]]. It took advantage of a new [[color printing]] process, which used [[color separation]] and three different colors of ink; magenta, cyan, and yellow, plus black, to create all the colors on the page. One of the first characters in the new comic strips was a humorous boy of the New York streets named Mickey Dugen, more commonly known as the [[Yellow Kid]], from the yellow nightshirt he wore.

Jews in [[Nazi Germany]] and German-occupied countries were required to sew yellow triangles with the star of David onto their clothing.\n\nIn the 20th century, modernist painters reduced painting to its simplest colors and geometric shapes. The Dutch modernist painter [[Piet Mondrian]] made a series of paintings which consisted of a pure white canvas with a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of yellow, red, and blue.\n\nYellow was particularly valued in the 20th century because of its high visibility. Because of its ability to be seen well from greater distances and at high speeds, yellow makes for the ideal color to be viewed from moving automobiles.<ref name=\"Yellowtown\" /> It often replaced red as the color of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, and was popular in neon signs, especially in [[Las Vegas]] and in China, where yellow was the most esteemed color.\n\nIn the 1960s, Pickett Brand developed the \"Eye Saver Yellow\" [[slide rule]], which was produced with a specific yellow color (Angstrom 5600) that reflects long-wavelength rays and promotes optimum eye-ease to help prevent eyestrain and improve visual accuracy.<ref name=\"Yellowtown\" />\n\nThe 21st century saw the use of unusual materials and technologies to create new ways of experiencing the color yellow. One example was ''The weather project'', by Danish-Icelandic artist [[Olafur Eliasson]], which was installed in the open space of the Turbine Hall of London's [[Tate Modern]] in 2003.\n\nEliasson used [[humidifiers]] to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of [[sugar]] and water, as well as a semi-circular disc made up of hundreds of [[monochromatic]] lamps which radiated yellow light. The ceiling of the hall was covered with a huge [[mirror]], in which visitors could see themselves as tiny black shadows against a mass of light.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">Cynthia Zarin (November 13, 2006), [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/11/13/061113fa_fact_zarin#ixzz1FQvk1dMc Seeing Things.

It is made from the dried red [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] of the [[crocus sativus]] flower. It must be picked by hand and it takes 150 flowers to obtain a single gram of stigma, so it is extremely expensive. It probably originated in the Mediterranean or Southwest Asia, and its use was detailed in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under [[Ashurbanipal]].{{Sfn|Russo|Dreher|Mathre|2003|p=6}} It was known in India at the time of the [[Buddha]], and after his death his followers decreed that monks should wear robes the color of saffron. Saffron was used to dye the robes of the senior Buddhist monks, while ordinary monks wore robes dyed with [[Gamboge]] or [[Curcuma longa]], also known as Turmeric.\n\nThe color of saffron comes from [[crocin]], a red variety of [[carotenoid]] natural pigment. The color of the dyed fabric varies from deep red to orange to yellow, depending upon the type of saffron and the process. Most saffron today comes from Iran, but it is also grown commercially in Spain, Italy and Kashmir in India, and as a boutique crop in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and other countries. In the United States, it has been cultivated by the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] community since the early 18th century. Because of the high price of saffron, other similar dyes and spices are often sold under the name saffron; for instance, what is called ''Indian saffron'' is often really turmeric.\n* [[Reseda luteola]], also known as dyers weed, yellow weed or weld, has been used as a yellow dye from neolithic times. It grew wild along the roads and walls of Europe, and was introduced into North America, where it grows as a weed. It was used as both as a yellow dye, whose color was deep and lasting, and to dye fabric green, first by dyeing it blue with indigo, then dyeing it with reseda luteola to turn it a rich, solid and lasting green.

In China, there are five directions of the compass; north, south, east, west, and the middle, each with a symbolic color. Yellow signifies the middle. China is called the Middle Kingdom; the palace of the Emperor was considered to be in the exact center of the world.<ref name=\"autogenerated82\">Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe legendary first emperor of China was called the [[Yellow Emperor]].

After the [[Song Dynasty]], bright yellow color can only be worn by the emperor. Distinguished visitors were honored with a yellow, not a red, carpet.\n\nIn Chinese symbolism, yellow, red and green are masculine colors, while black and white are considered feminine. In the traditional symbolism of the two opposites which complement each other, the [[yin and yang]], the masculine yang is traditionally represented by yellow. Just as there are five elements, five directions and five colors in the Chinese world-view, there are also five seasons; summer, winter, fall, spring, and the end of summer, symbolized by yellow leaves.<ref name=\"autogenerated82\" />\n\nIn current [[Chinese culture|Chinese pop culture]], the term \"yellow movie\" (\u9ec3\u8272\u96fb\u5f71) refers to films and other cultural items of a pornographic nature and is analogous to the English term \"[[wikt:blue movie|blue movie]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1045153.stm|title=Chinese porn trader jailed for life|work=BBC News|accessdate=23 March 2009|first=Duncan|last=Hewitt|date=28 November 2000}}</ref> In 2007, this became the basis of the '[[very erotic very violent]]' (literally, 'very yellow very violent') controversy in mainland China.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Zhengde.jpg|Portrait of the [[Zhengde Emperor]] from the [[Ming dynasty]].\nFile:Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in court dress (18th century).\nFile:Imperial Yellow Peking Glass Vase Closeup.jpg|[[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang]] period [[Peking glass]] vase.

Yellow combined with red symbolized heat and energy. A room painted yellow feels warmer than a room painted white, and a lamp with yellow light seems more natural than a lamp with white light.\n\nAs the color of light, yellow is also associated with knowledge and wisdom. In English and many other languages, \"brilliant\" and \"bright\" mean intelligent. In [[Islam]], the yellow color of gold symbolizes wisdom. In medieval European symbolism, red symbolized passion, blue symbolized the spiritual, and yellow symbolized reason. In many European universities, yellow gowns and caps are worn by members of the faculty of physical and natural sciences, as yellow is the color of reason and research.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n\n=== Gold and blond ===\n[[File:Aureus, Auguste, Lyon, btv1b104440369.jpg|thumb|right|Gold coin, Aureus, Auguste, Lyon.]]\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, the gods were often depicted with yellow, or blonde hair, which was described in literature as 'golden'. The color yellow was associated with the sun gods [[Helios]] and [[Apollo]]. It was fashionable in ancient Greece for men and women to dye their hair yellow, or to spend time in the sun to bleach it.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 73.</ref> In ancient Rome, prostitutes were required to bleach their hair, to be easily identified, but it also became a fashionable hair color for aristocratic women, influenced by the exotic blonde hair of many of the newly conquered slaves from Gaul, Britain, and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italianthro.blogspot.fr/2011/11/hair-dye-and-wigs-in-ancient-rome.html|title=Hair dye and wigs in Ancient Rome}}</ref> However, in medieval Europe and later, the word yellow often had negative connotations; associated with betrayal, so yellow hair was more poetically called 'blond,' 'light', 'fair,' or most often \"golden\".<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 73.</ref>\n\n=== Visibility and caution ===\nYellow is the most visible color from a distance, so it is often used for objects that need to be seen, such as fire engines, road maintenance equipment, school buses and taxicabs. It is also often used for warning signs, since yellow traditionally signals caution, rather than danger. [[Shades of yellow#Safety yellow|Safety yellow]] is often used for safety and accident prevention information. A yellow light on a traffic signal means slow down, but not stop. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) uses Pantone 116 (a yellow hue) as their standard color implying \"general warning,\" while the Federal Highway Administration similarly uses yellow to communicate warning or caution on highway signage.<ref name=\"Yellowtown\">{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Karen|year=2010|title=Yellowtown: Urban Signage, Class, and Race|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=2|pages=183\u2013198|doi=10.2752/175470710X12696138525668}}</ref> A yellow [[penalty card]] in a soccer match means warning, but not expulsion.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:First Student 132.jpg|School bus\nFile:Gelber Briefkasten der Deutschen Post.JPG|A mailbox in Germany.

While many flags use yellow, their symbolism varies widely, from civic virtue to golden treasure, golden fields, the desert, royalty, the keys to Heaven and the leadership of the Communist Party. In classic European [[heraldry]], yellow, along with white, is one of the two [[tincture (heraldry)|metals]] (called gold and silver) and therefore flags following heraldic design rules must use either yellow or white to separate any of their other colors (see [[rule of tincture]]).\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:Flag of India.svg|[[Flag of India]] (1947).

The robe and its color is a sign of renunciation of the outside world and commitment to the order. The candidate monk, with his master, first appears before the monks of the monastery in his own clothes, with his new robe under his arm, and asks to enter the order. He then takes his vows, puts on the robes, and with his begging bowl, goes out to the world. Thereafter, he spends his mornings begging and his afternoons in contemplation and study, either in a forest, garden, or in the monastery.<ref name=\"Henri Arvon 1951 pg. 61\u201364\">Henri Arvon (1951). ''Le bouddhisme'', pp. 61\u201364.</ref> According to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries, the robe dye is allowed to be obtained from six kinds of substances: roots and tubers, plants, bark, leaves, flowers and fruits. The robes should also be boiled in water a long time to get the correctly sober color. Saffron and ochre, usually made with dye from the [[curcuma longa]] plant or the heartwood of the [[jackfruit]] tree, are the most common colors. The so-called forest monks usually wear ochre robes and city monks saffron, though this is not an official rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/robe_txt.htm |title=The Buddhanet- buddhist studies- the monastic robe |accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref> The color of robes also varies somewhat among the different \"vehicles\", or schools of Buddhism, and by country, depending on their doctrines and the dyes available. The monks of the strict [[Vajrayana]], or [[Tantric Buddhism]], practiced in [[Tibet]], wear the most colorful robes of saffron and red. The monks of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], practiced mainly in Japan, China and Korea, wear lighter yellow or saffron, often with white or black. Monks of [[Hinayana Buddhism]], practiced in Southeast Asia, usually wear ochre or saffron color.

When CMY \"primaries\" are combined at full strength, the resulting \"secondary\" mixtures are red, green, and blue\nSubtractiveColor.svg|Mixing all three theoretically results in black, but imperfect ink formulations do not give true black, which is why an additional ''K'' component is needed.\nFile:NIEdot367.jpg|An example of color printing from 1902.

This is called the CMYK color model.\nFile:RGB illumination.jpg|On a computer display, yellow is created by combining green and red light at the right intensity on a black screen.\n</gallery>\n\nYellow is found between green and orange on the spectrum of visible light. It is the color the human eye sees when it looks at light with a [[dominant wavelength]] between 570 and 590 nanometers.\n\nIn color printing, yellow is one of the three colors of ink, along with [[magenta]] and [[cyan]], which, along with black,  can be overlaid in the right combination, along with black, to print any full color image. (See the [[CMYK color model]]).  A particular yellow is used, called Process yellow (also known as \"pigment yellow\", \"printer's yellow\", and \"canary yellow\") subtractive [[primary color]]s, along with [[magenta]] and [[cyan]]. Process yellow is not an RGB color, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure yellow ink.\n\nThe yellow on a color television or computer screen is created in a completely different way; by combining green and red light at the right level of intensity. (See [[RGB color model]]).\n\n==== Complementary colors ====\n\n[[File:PlanckianLocusWithYellowComplements.png|thumb|upright|Complements of yellow have a dominant wavelength in the range 380 to 480&nbsp;nm. The green lines show several possible pairs of complementary colors with respect to different blackbody color temperature neutrals, illustrated by the \"[[Planckian locus]]\".]]\nTraditionally, the [[complementary color]] of yellow is [[purple]]; the two colors are opposite each other on the color wheel long used by painters.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Roelofs | first1 = Isabelle | last2 = Petillion | first2 = Fabien | title = La couleur expliqu\u00e9e aux artistes | year=2012 | publisher=Eyrolles | location=Paris | isbn=978-2-212-13486-5}}</ref> [[Vincent Van Gogh]], an avid student of color theory,  used combinations of yellow and purple in several of his paintings for the maximum contrast and harmony.<ref>{{cite book | first = John | last = Gage | year = 2006 | title = La Couleur dans l'art | pages = 50\u201351 }}</ref>\n\nHunt defines that \"two colors are complementary when it is possible to reproduce the tristimulus values of a specified achromatic stimulus by an additive mixture of these two stimuli.\"<ref name=hunt>{{cite book | title = Measuring Color | first = J.

This definition, however, does not constrain what version of white will be specified. In the nineteenth century, the scientists [[Hermann Grassmann|Grassmann]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] did experiments in which they concluded that finding a good complement for spectral yellow was difficult, but that the result was indigo, that is, a wavelength that today's color scientists would call '''violet or purple'''. Helmholtz says \"Yellow and indigo blue\" are complements.<ref>{{cite book | title = Physiological Optics | first = Hermann | last = von Helmholtz | publisher = Dover | year = 1924 | isbn = 978-0-486-44260-0}}</ref> Grassmann reconstructs Newton's category boundaries in terms of wavelengths and says \"This indigo therefore falls within the limits of color between which, according to Helmholtz, the complementary colors of yellow lie.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Theory of Compound Colors | first = Hermann G\u00fcnter | last = Grassmann | journal = Philosophical Magazine | volume =4 | year = 1854 | pages = 254\u201364 }}</ref>\n\nNewton's own color circle has yellow directly opposite the boundary between indigo and violet. These results, that the complement of yellow is a wavelength shorter than 450&nbsp;nm, are derivable from the modern [[CIE 1931]] system of colorimetry if it is assumed that the yellow is about 580&nbsp;nm or shorter wavelength, and the specified white is the color of a blackbody radiator of temperature 2800 [[kelvin|K]] or lower (that is, the white of an ordinary incandescent light bulb). More typically, with a daylight-colored or around 5000 to 6000 K white, the complement of yellow will be in the blue wavelength range, which is the standard modern answer for the complement of yellow.\n\nBecause of the characteristics of paint pigments and use of different [[color wheel]]s, painters traditionally regard the complement of yellow as the color indigo or blue-violet.\n\n==== Lasers ====\n[[Laser]]s emitting in the yellow part of the spectrum are less common and more expensive than most other colors.<ref name=\"laserglow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/index.php?portable |title=Laserglow \u2013 Blue, Red, Yellow, Green Lasers |publisher=Laserglow.com| accessdate=27 March 2009 |quote=described as an \"extremely rare yellow\".}}</ref> In commercial products diode pumped solid state ([[Diode-pumped solid-state laser|DPSS]]) technology is employed to create the yellow light.

They serve two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in [[photosynthesis]], and they protect the green [[chlorophyll]] from photodamage.<ref name=\"fasebj.org\"/>\n\nIn late summer, as [[daylight]] hours shorten and temperatures cool, the [[vein]]s that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off. The water and [[mineral]] intake into the leaf is reduced, slowly at first, and then more rapidly. It is during this time that the chlorophyll begins to decrease.\nAs the chlorophyll diminishes, the yellow and red carotenoids become more and more visible, creating the classic [[autumn leaf color]].\n\nCarotenoids are common in many living things; they give the characteristic color to [[carrot]]s, [[maize]], [[daffodil]]s, [[rutabaga]]s, [[buttercup]]s and bananas. They are responsible for the red of cooked [[lobster]]s, the pink of [[flamingoes]] and [[salmon]] and the yellow of [[Domestic canary|canaries]] and [[egg yolk]]s.\n\n[[Xanthophylls]] are the most common yellow [[pigment]]s that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group. The name is from Greek ''xanthos'' ('''\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2''', \"yellow\") + ''phyllon'' ('''\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd''', \"leaf\"). Xanthophylls are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants, but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat. For example, the yellow color of chicken egg yolks, fat, and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume. Chicken farmers understand this, and often add [[xanthophyll]]s, usually [[lutein]], to make the egg yolks more yellow.\n\nBananas are green when they are picked because of the chlorophyll their skin contains. Once picked, they begin to ripen; [[hormones]] in the bananas convert amino acids into ethylene gas, which stimulates the production of several [[enzymes]]. These enzymes start to change the color, texture and flavor of the banana. The green chlorophyll supply is stopped and the yellow color of the carotenoids replaces it; eventually, as the enzymes continue their work, the cell walls break down and the bananas turn brown.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Fall colors near the Eagle Lake trailhead.jpg|Autumn colors along the [[Eagle River (Cook Inlet)|Eagle River]] near [[Anchorage]], [[Alaska]]\nFile:Cornwall Daffodils.jpg|[[Daffodils]] in [[Cornwall]]\nFile:Bananas.jpg|[[Banana]]s, like autumn [[leaves]], [[Domestic canary|canaries]] and [[egg yolks]], get their yellow color from natural pigments called [[carotenoids]].\nFile:Raw egg.jpg|The yolk of a raw egg.

The cave of [[Lascaux]] has an image of a horse colored with yellow estimated to be 17,300 years old.\n\n=== Ancient history ===\nIn Ancient [[Egypt]], yellow was associated with gold, which was considered to be imperishable, eternal and indestructible. The skin and bones of the gods were believed to be made of [[gold]]. The Egyptians used yellow extensively in tomb paintings; they usually used either yellow ochre or the brilliant [[orpiment]], though it was made of [[arsenic]] and was highly toxic. A small paintbox with orpiment pigment was found in the tomb of King [[Tutankhamun]]. Men were always shown with brown faces, women with yellow ochre or gold faces.<ref name=\"webexhibits.org\"/>\n\nThe ancient Romans used yellow in their paintings to represent [[gold]] and also in skin tones. It is found frequently in the murals of [[Pompeii]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Lascaux2.jpg|Image of a horse colored with [[yellow ochre]] from  [[Lascaux]] cave.\nFile:Tomb of Nakht.jpg|Paintings in the Tomb of Nakht in [[ancient Egypt]] (15th century BC).\nFile:Harfenspielerin R\u00f6misches Fresko.jpg|Yellow ochre was often used in wall paintings in Ancient Roman villas and towns.\nFile:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|[[Byzantine art]] made lavish use of gold, seen in this detail of the [[mosaic]] of the Emperor [[Justinian]] from the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], Italy (before 547 AD).\nFile:Flag of Palaeologus Dynasty.svg|The flag of the [[Paleologus dynasty]] of Byzantine emperors was red and gold. \n</gallery>\n\n=== Post-classical history ===\nDuring the Post-Classical period, yellow became firmly established as the color of [[Judas Iscariot]], the disciple who betrayed [[Jesus Christ]], even though the [[Bible]] never describes his clothing. From this connection, yellow also took on associations with [[envy]], [[jealousy]] and duplicity.\n\nThe tradition started in the Renaissance of marking non-Christian outsiders, such as Jews, with the color yellow. In 16th century Spain, those accused of [[heresy]] and who refused to renounce their views were compelled to come before the [[Spanish Inquisition]] dressed in a yellow cape.<ref>Eva Heller (2000). ''Psychologie de la couleur -effets et symboliques'', p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe color yellow has been historically associated with moneylenders and finance. The [[National Pawnbrokers Association]]'s logo depicts three golden spheres hanging from a bar, referencing the three bags of gold that the patron saint of pawnbroking, [[Nicholas of Myra|St. Nicholas]], holds in his hands.

His painting ''Rain, Steam, and Speed \u2013 the Great Central Railway'' was dominated by glowing yellow clouds.\n\n[[Georges Seurat]] used the new synthetic colors in his experimental paintings composed of tiny points of primary colors, particularly in his famous ''Sunday Afternoon on the Isle de la Grand jatte'' (1884\u201386). He did not know that the new synthetic yellow pigment, zinc yellow or [[zinc chromate]], which he used in the light green lawns, was highly unstable and would quickly turn brown.<ref>John Gage, (1993), ''Colour and Culture \u2013 Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to Abstraction'', p. 220.</ref>\n\nThe painter [[Vincent van Gogh]] was a particular admirer of the color yellow, the color of sunshine. Writing to his sister from the south of France in 1888, he wrote, \"Now we are having beautiful warm, windless weather that is very beneficial to me. The sun, a light that for lack of a better word I can only call yellow, bright sulfur yellow, pale lemon gold. How beautiful yellow is!\" In Arles, Van Gogh painted sunflowers inside a small house he rented at 2 Place Lamartine, a house painted with a color that Van Gogh described as \"buttery yellow.\" Van Gogh was one of the first artists to use commercially manufactured paints, rather than paints he made himself. He used the traditional yellow ochre, but also [[chrome yellow]], first made in 1809, and [[cadmium yellow]], first made in 1820.<ref>Stefano Zuffi (2012), ''Color in Art'', pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, in 1895, a new popular art form began to appear in New York newspapers; the color [[comic strip]]. It took advantage of a new [[color printing]] process, which used [[color separation]] and three different colors of ink; magenta, cyan, and yellow, plus black, to create all the colors on the page. One of the first characters in the new comic strips was a humorous boy of the New York streets named Mickey Dugen, more commonly known as the [[Yellow Kid]], from the yellow nightshirt he wore.

Jews in [[Nazi Germany]] and German-occupied countries were required to sew yellow triangles with the star of David onto their clothing.\n\nIn the 20th century, modernist painters reduced painting to its simplest colors and geometric shapes. The Dutch modernist painter [[Piet Mondrian]] made a series of paintings which consisted of a pure white canvas with a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of yellow, red, and blue.\n\nYellow was particularly valued in the 20th century because of its high visibility. Because of its ability to be seen well from greater distances and at high speeds, yellow makes for the ideal color to be viewed from moving automobiles.<ref name=\"Yellowtown\" /> It often replaced red as the color of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, and was popular in neon signs, especially in [[Las Vegas]] and in China, where yellow was the most esteemed color.\n\nIn the 1960s, Pickett Brand developed the \"Eye Saver Yellow\" [[slide rule]], which was produced with a specific yellow color (Angstrom 5600) that reflects long-wavelength rays and promotes optimum eye-ease to help prevent eyestrain and improve visual accuracy.<ref name=\"Yellowtown\" />\n\nThe 21st century saw the use of unusual materials and technologies to create new ways of experiencing the color yellow. One example was ''The weather project'', by Danish-Icelandic artist [[Olafur Eliasson]], which was installed in the open space of the Turbine Hall of London's [[Tate Modern]] in 2003.\n\nEliasson used [[humidifiers]] to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of [[sugar]] and water, as well as a semi-circular disc made up of hundreds of [[monochromatic]] lamps which radiated yellow light. The ceiling of the hall was covered with a huge [[mirror]], in which visitors could see themselves as tiny black shadows against a mass of light.<ref name=\"newyorker.com\">Cynthia Zarin (November 13, 2006), [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/11/13/061113fa_fact_zarin#ixzz1FQvk1dMc Seeing Things.

It is made from the dried red [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] of the [[crocus sativus]] flower. It must be picked by hand and it takes 150 flowers to obtain a single gram of stigma, so it is extremely expensive. It probably originated in the Mediterranean or Southwest Asia, and its use was detailed in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under [[Ashurbanipal]].{{Sfn|Russo|Dreher|Mathre|2003|p=6}} It was known in India at the time of the [[Buddha]], and after his death his followers decreed that monks should wear robes the color of saffron. Saffron was used to dye the robes of the senior Buddhist monks, while ordinary monks wore robes dyed with [[Gamboge]] or [[Curcuma longa]], also known as Turmeric.\n\nThe color of saffron comes from [[crocin]], a red variety of [[carotenoid]] natural pigment. The color of the dyed fabric varies from deep red to orange to yellow, depending upon the type of saffron and the process. Most saffron today comes from Iran, but it is also grown commercially in Spain, Italy and Kashmir in India, and as a boutique crop in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland and other countries. In the United States, it has been cultivated by the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] community since the early 18th century. Because of the high price of saffron, other similar dyes and spices are often sold under the name saffron; for instance, what is called ''Indian saffron'' is often really turmeric.\n* [[Reseda luteola]], also known as dyers weed, yellow weed or weld, has been used as a yellow dye from neolithic times. It grew wild along the roads and walls of Europe, and was introduced into North America, where it grows as a weed. It was used as both as a yellow dye, whose color was deep and lasting, and to dye fabric green, first by dyeing it blue with indigo, then dyeing it with reseda luteola to turn it a rich, solid and lasting green. It was the most common yellow dye in Europe from the Middle Ages until the 18th century, when it was replaced first by the bark of the quercitron tree from North America, then by synthetic dyes. It was also widely used in North Africa and in the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs \u2013 pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n* [[Gamboge]] is a deep saffron to mustard yellow pigment and dye.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd Ed.

In China, there are five directions of the compass; north, south, east, west, and the middle, each with a symbolic color. Yellow signifies the middle. China is called the Middle Kingdom; the palace of the Emperor was considered to be in the exact center of the world.<ref name=\"autogenerated82\">Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe legendary first emperor of China was called the [[Yellow Emperor]].

After the [[Song Dynasty]], bright yellow color can only be worn by the emperor. Distinguished visitors were honored with a yellow, not a red, carpet.\n\nIn Chinese symbolism, yellow, red and green are masculine colors, while black and white are considered feminine. In the traditional symbolism of the two opposites which complement each other, the [[yin and yang]], the masculine yang is traditionally represented by yellow. Just as there are five elements, five directions and five colors in the Chinese world-view, there are also five seasons; summer, winter, fall, spring, and the end of summer, symbolized by yellow leaves.<ref name=\"autogenerated82\" />\n\nIn current [[Chinese culture|Chinese pop culture]], the term \"yellow movie\" (\u9ec3\u8272\u96fb\u5f71) refers to films and other cultural items of a pornographic nature and is analogous to the English term \"[[wikt:blue movie|blue movie]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1045153.stm|title=Chinese porn trader jailed for life|work=BBC News|accessdate=23 March 2009|first=Duncan|last=Hewitt|date=28 November 2000}}</ref> In 2007, this became the basis of the '[[very erotic very violent]]' (literally, 'very yellow very violent') controversy in mainland China.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Zhengde.jpg|Portrait of the [[Zhengde Emperor]] from the [[Ming dynasty]].\nFile:Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|The [[Qianlong Emperor]] in court dress (18th century).\nFile:Imperial Yellow Peking Glass Vase Closeup.jpg|[[Daoguang Emperor|Daoguang]] period [[Peking glass]] vase.

Yellow combined with red symbolized heat and energy. A room painted yellow feels warmer than a room painted white, and a lamp with yellow light seems more natural than a lamp with white light.\n\nAs the color of light, yellow is also associated with knowledge and wisdom. In English and many other languages, \"brilliant\" and \"bright\" mean intelligent. In [[Islam]], the yellow color of gold symbolizes wisdom. In medieval European symbolism, red symbolized passion, blue symbolized the spiritual, and yellow symbolized reason. In many European universities, yellow gowns and caps are worn by members of the faculty of physical and natural sciences, as yellow is the color of reason and research.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', pp. 72\u201373.</ref>\n\n=== Gold and blond ===\n[[File:Aureus, Auguste, Lyon, btv1b104440369.jpg|thumb|right|Gold coin, Aureus, Auguste, Lyon.]]\nIn ancient Greece and Rome, the gods were often depicted with yellow, or blonde hair, which was described in literature as 'golden'. The color yellow was associated with the sun gods [[Helios]] and [[Apollo]]. It was fashionable in ancient Greece for men and women to dye their hair yellow, or to spend time in the sun to bleach it.<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 73.</ref> In ancient Rome, prostitutes were required to bleach their hair, to be easily identified, but it also became a fashionable hair color for aristocratic women, influenced by the exotic blonde hair of many of the newly conquered slaves from Gaul, Britain, and Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://italianthro.blogspot.fr/2011/11/hair-dye-and-wigs-in-ancient-rome.html|title=Hair dye and wigs in Ancient Rome}}</ref> However, in medieval Europe and later, the word yellow often had negative connotations; associated with betrayal, so yellow hair was more poetically called 'blond,' 'light', 'fair,' or most often \"golden\".<ref>Eva Heller (2000), ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'', p. 73.</ref>\n\n=== Visibility and caution ===\nYellow is the most visible color from a distance, so it is often used for objects that need to be seen, such as fire engines, road maintenance equipment, school buses and taxicabs. It is also often used for warning signs, since yellow traditionally signals caution, rather than danger. [[Shades of yellow#Safety yellow|Safety yellow]] is often used for safety and accident prevention information. A yellow light on a traffic signal means slow down, but not stop. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) uses Pantone 116 (a yellow hue) as their standard color implying \"general warning,\" while the Federal Highway Administration similarly uses yellow to communicate warning or caution on highway signage.<ref name=\"Yellowtown\">{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Karen|year=2010|title=Yellowtown: Urban Signage, Class, and Race|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=2|pages=183\u2013198|doi=10.2752/175470710X12696138525668}}</ref> A yellow [[penalty card]] in a soccer match means warning, but not expulsion.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:First Student 132.jpg|School bus\nFile:Gelber Briefkasten der Deutschen Post.JPG|A mailbox in Germany.

While many flags use yellow, their symbolism varies widely, from civic virtue to golden treasure, golden fields, the desert, royalty, the keys to Heaven and the leadership of the Communist Party. In classic European [[heraldry]], yellow, along with white, is one of the two [[tincture (heraldry)|metals]] (called gold and silver) and therefore flags following heraldic design rules must use either yellow or white to separate any of their other colors (see [[rule of tincture]]).\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:Flag of India.svg|[[Flag of India]] (1947).

The robe and its color is a sign of renunciation of the outside world and commitment to the order. The candidate monk, with his master, first appears before the monks of the monastery in his own clothes, with his new robe under his arm, and asks to enter the order. He then takes his vows, puts on the robes, and with his begging bowl, goes out to the world. Thereafter, he spends his mornings begging and his afternoons in contemplation and study, either in a forest, garden, or in the monastery.<ref name=\"Henri Arvon 1951 pg. 61\u201364\">Henri Arvon (1951). ''Le bouddhisme'', pp. 61\u201364.</ref> According to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries, the robe dye is allowed to be obtained from six kinds of substances: roots and tubers, plants, bark, leaves, flowers and fruits. The robes should also be boiled in water a long time to get the correctly sober color. Saffron and ochre, usually made with dye from the [[curcuma longa]] plant or the heartwood of the [[jackfruit]] tree, are the most common colors. The so-called forest monks usually wear ochre robes and city monks saffron, though this is not an official rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/robe_txt.htm |title=The Buddhanet- buddhist studies- the monastic robe |accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref> The color of robes also varies somewhat among the different \"vehicles\", or schools of Buddhism, and by country, depending on their doctrines and the dyes available. The monks of the strict [[Vajrayana]], or [[Tantric Buddhism]], practiced in [[Tibet]], wear the most colorful robes of saffron and red. The monks of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], practiced mainly in Japan, China and Korea, wear lighter yellow or saffron, often with white or black. Monks of [[Hinayana Buddhism]], practiced in Southeast Asia, usually wear ochre or saffron color. Monks of the forest tradition in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asia wear robes of a brownish ochre, dyed from the wood of the [[jackfruit]] tree.<ref name=\"Henri Arvon 1951 pg. 61\u201364\" /><ref name=\"Anne Varichon 2000 pg. 62\">Anne Varichon (2000), ''Couleurs- pigments et teintures dans les mains des peuples'', p. 62.</ref>\n* In [[Hinduism]], the divinity [[Krishna]] is commonly portrayed dressed in yellow. Yellow and saffron are also the colors worn by [[sadhu]], or wandering holy men in India. The Hindu almighty and divine god Lord Ganesha or Ganpati is mostly dressed with a dhotar in yellow, which is popularly known as pivla pitambar and is considered to be the most auspicious one.\n* In [[Islam]], the yellow color of gold symbolizes wisdom.\n* In the religions of the islands of [[Polynesia]], yellow is a sacred color, the color of the divine essence; the word \"yellow\" in the local languages is the same as the name of the [[curcuma longa]] plant, which is considered the food of the gods.<ref name=\"Anne Varichon 2000 pg. 62\" />\n* In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], yellow symbolizes gold, and in [[Christian mythology]] the golden key to the Kingdom of Heaven, which divine Christ gave to Saint Peter. The flag of the [[Vatican City]] and the colors of the pope are yellow and white, symbolizing the gold key and the silver key. White and yellow together can also symbolize [[easter]], rebirth and Resurrection. Yellow also has a negative meaning, symbolizing betrayal; [[Judas Iscariot]] is usually portrayed wearing a pale yellow toga. Yellow and golden [[Halo (religious iconography)|halos]] mark the saints in religious paintings.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Rank celebration of Thai Buddhist monk 1.jpg|Buddhist monks at the promotion ceremony of a monk in Thailand\nFile:Buddhist monks of Tibet7.jpg|Buddhist monks in [[Tibet]]\nFile:Ueno monk.jpg|A Japanese Buddhist monk in downtown Tokyo\nFile:Sadou Kathmandu 04 04.jpg|A Hindu [[sadhu]], or ascetic wandering monk or holy man, in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]].\nFile:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|Christ giving the golden key of the kingdom heaven to [[Saint Peter]] (1481\u201382), by [[Pietro Perugino]].

Its purpose is to give field officers and detectives instant information to help identify patterns and stop emerging crime. \n\nThe NYPD RTCC opened on July 18, 2005 and provides support 24/7. The center was built at a cost of $11 million. The information in the center is available to the 37,000 police officers of the [[New York City Police Department]].  The RTCC was funded in part by grants from the non-profit [[New York City Police Foundation]].<ref>\n*[http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?&aid=52142 NYPD Unveils High-Tech Real Time Crime Center At Police Headquarters]\n*[http://www.gcn.com/print/24_29/37061-1.html Real-time crime fighting comes to Gotham]\n</ref>\n\nRTCC data sources include a data warehouse in which billions of records are made available to detectives and other officers within minutes, instead of days or weeks.

It borders the states of [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[New Hampshire]] to the east, and [[New York (state)|New York]] to the west, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] to the north. Vermont is the only state in New England that does not border the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Vermont is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|second-smallest by population]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|sixth-smallest by area]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 U.S. states]]. The [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], the [[List of capitals in the United States|least populous state capital]] in the United States. The most populous city, [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], is the [[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population|least populous city]] to be the most populous city in a state. \n\nFor some 12,000 years, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] inhabited this area. The historically competitive tribes of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Abenaki]] and Iroquoian-speaking [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] were active in the area at the time of European encounter.\n\nDuring the 17th century, French colonists claimed the territory as part of the [[Kingdom of France]]'s colony of [[New France]]. After the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe. For years, each country enlisted Native American allies in continuous raiding and warfare between the New England and New France colonies. This produced an active trade in captives taken during such raids, often held for ransom, although some captives were adopted by families into the Mohawk or Abenaki tribes.\n\nAfter being defeated in 1763 in the [[Seven Years' War]], France ceded its territory east of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Thereafter, the nearby British [[Thirteen Colonies]], especially the provinces of [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of New York|New York]], disputed the extent of the area called the [[New Hampshire Grants]] to the west of the [[Connecticut River]], encompassing present-day Vermont. The provincial government of New York sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants from the government of New Hampshire. The [[Green Mountain Boys]] militia protected the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the newly-arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York.\n\nUltimately, a group of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the [[Vermont Republic]] in 1777 as an independent state during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Vermont Republic [[history of slavery in Vermont|abolished slavery]] before any of the other states.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vermont Constitution of 1777|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/archives-records/state-archives/government-history/vermont-constitutions/1777-constitution.aspx|publisher=State of Vermont|accessdate=April 12, 2019|location=Chapter I, Section I|quote=Therefore, no male person, born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person, as a servant, slave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after she arrives to the age of eighteen years, unless they are bound by their own consent, after they arrive to such age, or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Lee Ann| last=Cox| title=Patchwork Freedom |url=https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/patchwork-freedom |publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=|date =29 January 2014}}</ref> Vermont was also the first state to produce an African-American university graduate, [[Alexander Twilight]], in 1823.\n\nVermont was [[admission to the Union|admitted]] to the newly established [[United States#Independence and expansion (1776\u20131865)|United States]] as the fourteenth state in 1791. Vermont is one of the four U.S. states that were previously [[sovereign state]]s (along with [[Republic of Texas|Texas]], [[California Republic|California]], and [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]]).\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Vermont was a strong source of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] sentiment, although it was also tied to [[King Cotton]] through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied on southern cotton. It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate in the [[American Civil War]]. In the 21st century, [[Protestant]]s (30%) and [[Catholic]]s (22%) make up the majority of those reporting a religious preference, with 37% reporting no religion, the highest rate of [[Atheism|irreligion]] of all states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion & Public Life |date=May 12, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref> Other religions individually contribute no more than two percent to the total.\n\nThe geography of the state is marked by the [[Green Mountains]], which run north\u2013south up the middle of the state, separating [[Lake Champlain]] and other valley terrain on the west from the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River valley]] that defines much of its eastern border. A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. The state's climate is characterized by warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.\n\nVermont's economic activity of $34 billion in 2018 ranked 52nd on the [[list of U.S. states and territories by GDP]] (every state plus [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Puerto Rico]] were larger), but 34th in GDP per capita. In 1960, Vermonters' politics started to shift from being reliably Republican toward favoring Democratic candidates. Starting in 1963, Vermont voters have alternated between electing Republican and Democratic governors. Since 2007, Vermont has elected only Democrats and Independents to Congress. In 2000, the state legislature was the first to recognize [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples. In 2011\u20132012, the state officially recognized four Abenaki tribes.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[Samuel de Champlain]] claimed the area around what is now [[Lake Champlain]], giving the name, ''Verd Mont'' (Green Mountain) to the region he found, on a 1647 map.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfhrDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=Champlain+map+1647+%22Verd+mont%22&source=bl&ots=B8JEB1XN-R&sig=ACfU3U0EcUBl_Q1UDGr_YuB9y9JcGKztVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4qaz3vKnnAhWigXIEHbjmAAYQ6AEwHHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=Champlain%20map%201647%20%22Verd%20mont%22&f=false|title=New England Rocks: Historic Geological Wonders|last=Conway|first=Michael J.

In the mid-20th century, descendants began to reclaim their French names, especially surnames.\n\nBeginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont industries attracted numerous [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] [[immigrants]], adding to its residents of mostly [[English Americans|English]] and some [[Quebec diaspora#United States|French-Canadian]] ancestry. Many of the immigrants migrated to [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre]], where the men worked as stonecutters of [[granite]], for which there was a national market. Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states.\n\nIn this period, many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses to support their families. Such facilities also helped absorb new residents and help them learn the new culture; European immigrants peaked in number between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others.<ref name=\"barre\">{{cite web|url=http://vermonthistory.org/journal/74/05_Richards.pdf |author=Susan Richards| title=Making Home Pay: Italian and Scottish Boardinghouse Keepers in Barre, 1880\u20131910| work=Vermont History Journal |date=2005 |access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nGradually the new immigrants were absorbed into the state. Times of tension aroused divisions. In the early 20th century, some people in Vermont became alarmed about what they considered to be a decline in rural areas; people left farming to move to cities and others seemed unable to fit within society. In addition, there was a wave of immigration by French Canadians, and those of Protestant Yankee stock feared being overtaken by the new people, who added to the Catholic population of Irish and Italians. Based on the colonial past, some Yankee residents considered the French Canadians to have intermarried too frequently with Native Americans.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn an era influenced by ideas of [[Social Darwinism]], some Vermont leaders promoted [[eugenics]], an idea that the population could be managed and improved by limiting marriage and reproduction by certain members classified as unfit or defective. It passed a marriage law, to limit marriage by people considered unfit. In 1915 the [[Brandon State School for the Feebleminded]] opened, the beginning of a related effort to segregate and control those judged unfit to reproduce.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nThe state followed efforts to improve children's welfare by establishing other institutions to house the mentally ill or disabled. From 1925\u20131928 the [[Eugenics Survey of Vermont]] conducted research and recorded the histories of families it determined were degenerate or dependent. It also attempted to educate the public about why restrictive measures, including voluntary sterilization, were desirable. Review by current historians reveals the results were socially prejudiced, as the surveys tended to target the poor and disenfranchised minorities, including French Canadians, Abenaki, and disabled.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law. Vermont like other states, sterilized some patients in institutions and persons it had identified through surveys as degenerate or unfit. It nominally had permission from the patients or their guardians, but abuses have been documented. Two-thirds of the sterilizations were done on women, and poor, unwed mothers were targeted, among others. The surgery was performed at institutions and hospitals in the state supposedly devoted to care of people in need. There is disagreement about how many sterilizations were performed; most were completed from 1931 to 1941, but such procedures were recorded as late as 1970.<ref name=\"VT.ster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VT/VT.html |title=Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States: Vermont|author=Lutz Kaelber |publisher=University of Vermont|date=2009|access-date=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Natural disasters====\n\nIn addition to the increased intensity and flooding caused by [[Global warming|climate change]],<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://climatechange.vermont.gov/|title=Climate Change in Vermont {{!}} Climate Change in Vermont|website=climatechange.vermont.gov|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> the state has suffered several extreme natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes, and extensive rain and flooding.\n\nLarge-scale [[flooding]] occurred in early November 1927.

Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited [[suffrage]]. They were first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative races.\n\nIn 1964, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' required \"[[one man, one vote]]\" redistricting in all states. It had found that many state legislatures had not redistricted and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated and industrial urban areas. In addition, it found that many states had an upper house based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties. This gave disproportionate power to rural and lightly populated counties. The court ruled there was no basis for such a structure. Major changes in political apportionment took place in Vermont and other affected states.\n\nThis ruling required districts to be reassessed after every census and to be based on roughly equal population, rather than geography (such as counties). Under redistricting, residents in urban areas were to gain an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state. Vermont and some other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states in those years, who had not redistricted since the turn of the century.<ref name = Udall>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/88th/641014.html |website=Congressman's Report |first=Morris K. |last=Udall |title=Reapportionment\u2014I \"One Man, One Vote\" . . .

Before the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay, and people began to move out to newer suburbs.\n\nVermont was for many years a stronghold of the Republican Party. Ethno-political culture of the last century has seen a dramatic shift in voter turnout in the Green Mountain State. Since 1992, Vermont has voted for the Democrat in every Presidential election. Before 1992, Vermont voted for the Republican in every single Presidential election with the exception of 1964.<ref>Changing Patterns of Voting in the Northern United States: Electoral Realignment, 1952\u20131996 page 45 \"historian Charles Morrissey has noted that Canadian support for the democratic party{{nbsp}}...\" \"Table 3.5 Frenchest towns were most Democrat voting towns\" Page 50, table 3.6 also shows towns with highest portion of French ancestry have highest portion of Democrat voters, highest portion of English ancestry corresponds with highest portion of Republican voters</ref><ref>The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History.

As a result, urban areas in Vermont gained political power.\n\nThe legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote in the 1960s. It passed the Land Use and Development Law ([[Act 250 (Vermont law)|Act 250]]) in 1970 to discourage suburban sprawl and to limit major growth to already developed areas. The law, the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions appointed by the Governor, who judged land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state's environment and many small communities.

It borders the states of [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[New Hampshire]] to the east, and [[New York (state)|New York]] to the west, and the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]] to the north. Vermont is the only state in New England that does not border the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Vermont is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|second-smallest by population]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|sixth-smallest by area]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 U.S. states]]. The [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] is [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], the [[List of capitals in the United States|least populous state capital]] in the United States. The most populous city, [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], is the [[List of U.S. states' largest cities by population|least populous city]] to be the most populous city in a state. \n\nFor some 12,000 years, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] inhabited this area. The historically competitive tribes of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking [[Abenaki]] and Iroquoian-speaking [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] were active in the area at the time of European encounter.\n\nDuring the 17th century, French colonists claimed the territory as part of the [[Kingdom of France]]'s colony of [[New France]]. After the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe. For years, each country enlisted Native American allies in continuous raiding and warfare between the New England and New France colonies. This produced an active trade in captives taken during such raids, often held for ransom, although some captives were adopted by families into the Mohawk or Abenaki tribes.\n\nAfter being defeated in 1763 in the [[Seven Years' War]], France ceded its territory east of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Thereafter, the nearby British [[Thirteen Colonies]], especially the provinces of [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of New York|New York]], disputed the extent of the area called the [[New Hampshire Grants]] to the west of the [[Connecticut River]], encompassing present-day Vermont. The provincial government of New York sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants from the government of New Hampshire. The [[Green Mountain Boys]] militia protected the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the newly-arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York.\n\nUltimately, a group of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the [[Vermont Republic]] in 1777 as an independent state during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The Vermont Republic [[history of slavery in Vermont|abolished slavery]] before any of the other states.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vermont Constitution of 1777|url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/archives-records/state-archives/government-history/vermont-constitutions/1777-constitution.aspx|publisher=State of Vermont|accessdate=April 12, 2019|location=Chapter I, Section I|quote=Therefore, no male person, born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person, as a servant, slave, or apprentice, after he arrives to the age of twenty-one years; nor female, in like manner, after she arrives to the age of eighteen years, unless they are bound by their own consent, after they arrive to such age, or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | first=Lee Ann| last=Cox| title=Patchwork Freedom |url=https://www.uvm.edu/uvmnews/news/patchwork-freedom |publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=|date =29 January 2014}}</ref> Vermont was also the first state to produce an African-American university graduate, [[Alexander Twilight]], in 1823.\n\nVermont was [[admission to the Union|admitted]] to the newly established [[United States#Independence and expansion (1776\u20131865)|United States]] as the fourteenth state in 1791. Vermont is one of the four U.S. states that were previously [[sovereign state]]s (along with [[Republic of Texas|Texas]], [[California Republic|California]], and [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]]).\n\nDuring the mid-19th century, Vermont was a strong source of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] sentiment, although it was also tied to [[King Cotton]] through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied on southern cotton. It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate in the [[American Civil War]]. In the 21st century, [[Protestant]]s (30%) and [[Catholic]]s (22%) make up the majority of those reporting a religious preference, with 37% reporting no religion, the highest rate of [[Atheism|irreligion]] of all states.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion & Public Life |date=May 12, 2015 |accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref> Other religions individually contribute no more than two percent to the total.\n\nThe geography of the state is marked by the [[Green Mountains]], which run north\u2013south up the middle of the state, separating [[Lake Champlain]] and other valley terrain on the west from the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River valley]] that defines much of its eastern border. A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. The state's climate is characterized by warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.\n\nVermont's economic activity of $34 billion in 2018 ranked 52nd on the [[list of U.S. states and territories by GDP]] (every state plus [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Puerto Rico]] were larger), but 34th in GDP per capita. In 1960, Vermonters' politics started to shift from being reliably Republican toward favoring Democratic candidates. Starting in 1963, Vermont voters have alternated between electing Republican and Democratic governors. Since 2007, Vermont has elected only Democrats and Independents to Congress. In 2000, the state legislature was the first to recognize [[civil union]]s for same-sex couples. In 2011\u20132012, the state officially recognized four Abenaki tribes.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[Samuel de Champlain]] claimed the area around what is now [[Lake Champlain]], giving the name, ''Verd Mont'' (Green Mountain) to the region he found, on a 1647 map.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xfhrDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=Champlain+map+1647+%22Verd+mont%22&source=bl&ots=B8JEB1XN-R&sig=ACfU3U0EcUBl_Q1UDGr_YuB9y9JcGKztVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj4qaz3vKnnAhWigXIEHbjmAAYQ6AEwHHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=Champlain%20map%201647%20%22Verd%20mont%22&f=false|title=New England Rocks: Historic Geological Wonders|last=Conway|first=Michael J.

In the mid-20th century, descendants began to reclaim their French names, especially surnames.\n\nBeginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont industries attracted numerous [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] [[immigrants]], adding to its residents of mostly [[English Americans|English]] and some [[Quebec diaspora#United States|French-Canadian]] ancestry. Many of the immigrants migrated to [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre]], where the men worked as stonecutters of [[granite]], for which there was a national market. Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states.\n\nIn this period, many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses to support their families. Such facilities also helped absorb new residents and help them learn the new culture; European immigrants peaked in number between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others.<ref name=\"barre\">{{cite web|url=http://vermonthistory.org/journal/74/05_Richards.pdf |author=Susan Richards| title=Making Home Pay: Italian and Scottish Boardinghouse Keepers in Barre, 1880\u20131910| work=Vermont History Journal |date=2005 |access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nGradually the new immigrants were absorbed into the state. Times of tension aroused divisions. In the early 20th century, some people in Vermont became alarmed about what they considered to be a decline in rural areas; people left farming to move to cities and others seemed unable to fit within society. In addition, there was a wave of immigration by French Canadians, and those of Protestant Yankee stock feared being overtaken by the new people, who added to the Catholic population of Irish and Italians. Based on the colonial past, some Yankee residents considered the French Canadians to have intermarried too frequently with Native Americans.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn an era influenced by ideas of [[Social Darwinism]], some Vermont leaders promoted [[eugenics]], an idea that the population could be managed and improved by limiting marriage and reproduction by certain members classified as unfit or defective. It passed a marriage law, to limit marriage by people considered unfit. In 1915 the [[Brandon State School for the Feebleminded]] opened, the beginning of a related effort to segregate and control those judged unfit to reproduce.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nThe state followed efforts to improve children's welfare by establishing other institutions to house the mentally ill or disabled. From 1925\u20131928 the [[Eugenics Survey of Vermont]] conducted research and recorded the histories of families it determined were degenerate or dependent. It also attempted to educate the public about why restrictive measures, including voluntary sterilization, were desirable. Review by current historians reveals the results were socially prejudiced, as the surveys tended to target the poor and disenfranchised minorities, including French Canadians, Abenaki, and disabled.<ref name=\"VT.ster\"/>\n\nIn 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law. Vermont like other states, sterilized some patients in institutions and persons it had identified through surveys as degenerate or unfit. It nominally had permission from the patients or their guardians, but abuses have been documented. Two-thirds of the sterilizations were done on women, and poor, unwed mothers were targeted, among others. The surgery was performed at institutions and hospitals in the state supposedly devoted to care of people in need. There is disagreement about how many sterilizations were performed; most were completed from 1931 to 1941, but such procedures were recorded as late as 1970.<ref name=\"VT.ster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~lkaelber/eugenics/VT/VT.html |title=Eugenics: Compulsory Sterilization in 50 American States: Vermont|author=Lutz Kaelber |publisher=University of Vermont|date=2009|access-date=14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Natural disasters====\n\nIn addition to the increased intensity and flooding caused by [[Global warming|climate change]],<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://climatechange.vermont.gov/|title=Climate Change in Vermont {{!}} Climate Change in Vermont|website=climatechange.vermont.gov|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> the state has suffered several extreme natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes, and extensive rain and flooding.\n\nLarge-scale [[flooding]] occurred in early November 1927.

Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited [[suffrage]]. They were first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative races.\n\nIn 1964, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' required \"[[one man, one vote]]\" redistricting in all states. It had found that many state legislatures had not redistricted and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated and industrial urban areas. In addition, it found that many states had an upper house based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties. This gave disproportionate power to rural and lightly populated counties. The court ruled there was no basis for such a structure. Major changes in political apportionment took place in Vermont and other affected states.\n\nThis ruling required districts to be reassessed after every census and to be based on roughly equal population, rather than geography (such as counties). Under redistricting, residents in urban areas were to gain an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state. Vermont and some other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states in those years, who had not redistricted since the turn of the century.<ref name = Udall>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/udall/congrept/88th/641014.html |website=Congressman's Report |first=Morris K. |last=Udall |title=Reapportionment\u2014I \"One Man, One Vote\" . . .

Before the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay, and people began to move out to newer suburbs.\n\nVermont was for many years a stronghold of the Republican Party. Ethno-political culture of the last century has seen a dramatic shift in voter turnout in the Green Mountain State. Since 1992, Vermont has voted for the Democrat in every Presidential election. Before 1992, Vermont voted for the Republican in every single Presidential election with the exception of 1964.<ref>Changing Patterns of Voting in the Northern United States: Electoral Realignment, 1952\u20131996 page 45 \"historian Charles Morrissey has noted that Canadian support for the democratic party{{nbsp}}...\" \"Table 3.5 Frenchest towns were most Democrat voting towns\" Page 50, table 3.6 also shows towns with highest portion of French ancestry have highest portion of Democrat voters, highest portion of English ancestry corresponds with highest portion of Republican voters</ref><ref>The Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History.

As a result, urban areas in Vermont gained political power.\n\nThe legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote in the 1960s. It passed the Land Use and Development Law ([[Act 250 (Vermont law)|Act 250]]) in 1970 to discourage suburban sprawl and to limit major growth to already developed areas. The law, the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions appointed by the Governor, who judged land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state's environment and many small communities.
