Often the unaffected eye will compensate for the loss of vision in the other eye; however, this results in some loss of [[depth perception]] and [[parallax]].  Deterioration of sight may begin in either the central or peripheral vision. Deterioration is likely to begin in the upper part of the vision field as this corresponds with the bottom of the eye where blood usually pools. Flashes of light, known as [[photopsia]], and [[floaters]] are common symptoms. Persistent color patterns may also be perceived in the affected eye. Initially, these may be mistaken for psychological [[hallucinations]], but are actually the result of both [[retinal detachment]] and foreign fluids mechanically interacting with the photoreceptors located on the retina.\n\nOne early warning sign of Coats' disease is yellow-eye in flash photography. Just as the [[red-eye effect]] is caused by a reflection off blood vessels in the back of a normal eye, an eye affected by Coats' will glow yellow in photographs as light reflects off cholesterol deposits. Children with yellow-eye in photographs are typically advised to immediately seek evaluation from an optometrist or ophthalmologist, who will assess and diagnose the condition and refer to a vitreo-retinal specialist.\n[[File:Coats disease - camera with flash.jpg|thumbnail|A young child with the yellow eye of Coats' disease - still in an early stage. Only visible with a flash camera.]]\n\nCoats' disease itself is painless. Pain may occur if fluid is unable to drain from the eye properly, causing the internal pressure to swell, resulting in painful glaucoma.\n\n===Presentation===\nCoats' usually affects only one eye (unilateral) and occurs predominantly in young males 1/100,000, with the onset of symptoms generally appearing in the first decade of life. Peak age of onset is between 6\u20138 years of age, but onset can range from 5 months to 71 years.<ref name=\"EdwardDP\">EdwardDP, Mafee MF, Garcia-Valenzuela E, Weiss RA.

Blood leaks from the abnormal vessels into the back of the eye, leaving behind cholesterol deposits and damaging the retina. Coats' disease normally progresses slowly.

[[Laser surgery]] or [[cryotherapy]] (freezing) can be used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels, thus halting progression of the disease.  However, if the leaking blood vessels are clustered around the [[optic nerve]], this treatment is not recommended as accidental damage to the nerve itself can result in permanent blindness. Although Coats' disease tends to progress to visual loss, it may stop progressing on its own, either temporarily or permanently. Cases have been documented in which the condition even reverses itself. However, once total retinal detachment occurs, sight loss is permanent in most cases. Removal of the eye (enucleation) is an option if pain or further complications arise.\n\n==History==\nCoats' disease is named after George Coats.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|synd|2146}}</ref><ref>G. Coats.

It is a [[genetic disorder]]. The hallmark of the disease is the failure of initiated [[muscle contraction|contraction]] to terminate, often referred to as delayed relaxation of the muscles ([[myotonia]]) and [[hypokinesia|rigidity]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1041228 |title=Myotonia Congenita |year=2008 |last1=Gutmann |first1=Laurie |last2=Phillips Lh |first2=Lawrence |journal=Seminars in Neurology |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=244\u20138 |pmid=1947487}}</ref> Symptoms include delayed relaxation of the muscles after voluntary contraction (myotonia), and may also include stiffness, [[hypertrophy]] (enlargement), transient weakness in some forms of the disorder (from certain genetic mutations), severe masseter spasm, and [[cramp]]ing. The condition is sometimes referred to as '''fainting goat syndrome''', as it is responsible for the eponymous 'fainting' seen in [[fainting goats]] when presented with a sudden stimulus. Of note, myotonia congenita has no association with malignant hyperthermia (MH).\n\n==Symptoms and signs==\nThe prolonged muscle contractions, which occur most commonly in the leg muscles in recessive mutations, and more commonly in the hands, face, and eyelids in dominant mutations,<ref name=\"Lossin 2008 25-55\"/> are often enhanced by inactivity, and in some forms are relieved by repetitive movement known as \"the warm-up effect\". This effect often diminishes quickly with rest. Some individuals with myotonia congenita are prone to falling as a result of hasty movements or an inability to stabilize themselves after a loss of balance. During a fall, a person with myotonia congenita may experience partial or complete rigid paralysis that will quickly resolve once the event is over. However, a fall into cold water may render the person unable to move for the duration of submergence. As with [[Fainting goats|myotonic goats]], children are more prone to falling than adults, due to their impulsivity.\n\nThe two major types of myotonia congenita are distinguished by the severity of their symptoms and their patterns of inheritance. Becker disease usually appears later in childhood than Thomsen disease, and causes more severe myotonia, muscle stiffness and transient weakness.<ref name=\"R\u00fcdel 1988 202-11\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/mus.880110303 |pmid=3352655 |title=Transient weakness and altered membrane characteristic in recessive generalized myotonia (Becker) |year=1988 |last1=R\u00fcdel |first1=Reinhardt |last2=Ricker |first2=Kenneth |last3=Lehmann-Horn |first3=Frank |journal=Muscle & Nerve |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=202\u201311}}</ref> Although myotonia in itself is not normally associated with pain, cramps or myalgia may develop.<ref name=\"R\u00fcdel 1988 202-11\"/> People with Becker disease often experience temporary attacks of muscle weakness, particularly in the arms and hands, brought on by movement after periods of rest.

Severity of symptoms can vary greatly between individuals and throughout the lives of the individuals themselves. This may be partly because there are over 130 currently known different mutations that can cause the disorder, each with their own specifics, and also because myotonia congenita is an ion channel disorder, and ion channels are sensitive to internal and external environmental factors.

If the person is sedentary and then decides to walk up a set of stairs, by the third or fourth step their leg muscles begin to stiffen significantly, requiring them to slow down almost to a complete stop. But as the muscles loosen up, a few steps later, they can once again begin to climb the steps at a normal pace. If this person plays any kind of a sport, a good warm-up is mandatory. Otherwise if they need to quickly and intensively use their muscles, such as in a sprint race or a basketball game, their muscles will freeze up, causing them to slow down or almost come to a complete stop. But once the muscles are warmed up, they can once again function normally. This can happen in various muscles, even in muscles such as the tongue. For example, if a person has not spoken for awhile and then wants to speak, their tongue may be stiff at first causing the words to come out a little garbled, but after a few seconds of trying to speak, the tongue muscle will loosen up and then they can speak normally for the remainder of the time that they are conversing.\n\nPatients report that repeated contraction of muscle alleviates present myotonia with each contraction, such that myotonia is almost absent after a few contractions of the same muscle.

J Neurol 254(2):257-258</ref> Like chloride channel mutations, patients with sodium channel mutations may have a very varied phenotype, making a diagnosis more difficult.\n\n==Mechanisms==\nMyotonia congenita is caused in humans by loss-of-function mutations in the gene ''[[CLCN1]]''.  This is the gene encoding the protein [[CLCN1]], that forms the ClC-1 chloride channel, critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. This gene is also associated with the condition in horses and goats.\n\nIn short, in lack of sufficient functional chloride channels, the muscle fiber membrane becomes hyper-excitable and continues to be electrically active (firing [[action potentials]]) when stimulated, for longer periods of time, than a normal muscle fiber. This results in prolonged contraction/delayed relaxation of the muscle.\n\nThe dysfunctional Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channels are located in the muscle fiber membrane and do not affect the [[motor nerve]] innervating the muscle. However, many studies have shown that denervation of muscle fibers alter the resting membrane conductance, but whether this affects myotonia in the muscle has been subject to heavy debate, and results from experiments are inconclusive.<ref name=\"Missingor\">{{cite journal |pmid=2580324 |year=1985 |last1=R\u00fcdel |first1=R |last2=Lehmann-Horn |first2=F |title=Membrane changes in cells from myotonia patients |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=310\u201356 |journal=Physiological Reviews|doi=10.1152/physrev.1985.65.2.310 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[skeletal muscle]] fibers, a large [[transverse tubule]] system with a high surface-area to volume ratio exists. The onset of skeletal muscle activity is associated with the initiation and propagation of [[action potentials]] again associated with an efflux of K<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular fluid and transverse tubule system. When many action potentials are elicited subsequently more K<sup>+</sup> is expelled from the cell into the transverse tubular system. As K<sup>+</sup> accumulates in the transverse tubular system the [[equilibrium potential]] for K<sup>+</sup> (E<sub>K<sup>+</sup></sub>) normally around -80 mV, becomes more depolarized ([[depolarization]]), according to the [[Nernst equation]]. In skeletal muscle fibers the equilibrium potential for Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is around -80 mV, equal to that of K<sup>+</sup> at rest. Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> moves towards its equilibrium potential around -80 mV, while potassium moves towards its equilibrium potential more depolarized than -80 mV during activity. This results in a slightly more depolarized [[membrane potential]] of the fiber during repeated action potentials, see [[Goldman equation]]. The Na<sup>+</sup> conductance is only elevated shortly compared to the K<sup>+</sup> conductance during each action potential, which is why K<sup>+</sup> largely determines the membrane potential (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is passively distributed during rest).\nIn the case of myotonia congenita, the chloride channels that allow Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> to move across the membrane towards its equilibrium potential are defective, thus K<sup>+</sup> is the only ion determining the membrane potential, and as more and more K<sup>+</sup> accumulates in the transverse tubular system with each subsequent action potential the fiber depolarizes until the membrane potential comes close enough to the [[action potential threshold]] for spontaneous activity to ensue<ref name=\"pmid1119960\">{{cite journal |pmid=1119960 |year=1975 |last1=Barchi |first1=RL |title=Myotonia.

The condition is sometimes referred to as '''fainting goat syndrome''', as it is responsible for the eponymous 'fainting' seen in [[fainting goats]] when presented with a sudden stimulus. Of note, myotonia congenita has no association with malignant hyperthermia (MH).\n\n==Symptoms and signs==\nThe prolonged muscle contractions, which occur most commonly in the leg muscles in recessive mutations, and more commonly in the hands, face, and eyelids in dominant mutations,<ref name=\"Lossin 2008 25-55\"/> are often enhanced by inactivity, and in some forms are relieved by repetitive movement known as \"the warm-up effect\". This effect often diminishes quickly with rest. Some individuals with myotonia congenita are prone to falling as a result of hasty movements or an inability to stabilize themselves after a loss of balance. During a fall, a person with myotonia congenita may experience partial or complete rigid paralysis that will quickly resolve once the event is over. However, a fall into cold water may render the person unable to move for the duration of submergence. As with [[Fainting goats|myotonic goats]], children are more prone to falling than adults, due to their impulsivity.\n\nThe two major types of myotonia congenita are distinguished by the severity of their symptoms and their patterns of inheritance.

If the person is sedentary and then decides to walk up a set of stairs, by the third or fourth step their leg muscles begin to stiffen significantly, requiring them to slow down almost to a complete stop. But as the muscles loosen up, a few steps later, they can once again begin to climb the steps at a normal pace. If this person plays any kind of a sport, a good warm-up is mandatory. Otherwise if they need to quickly and intensively use their muscles, such as in a sprint race or a basketball game, their muscles will freeze up, causing them to slow down or almost come to a complete stop. But once the muscles are warmed up, they can once again function normally. This can happen in various muscles, even in muscles such as the tongue. For example, if a person has not spoken for awhile and then wants to speak, their tongue may be stiff at first causing the words to come out a little garbled, but after a few seconds of trying to speak, the tongue muscle will loosen up and then they can speak normally for the remainder of the time that they are conversing.\n\nPatients report that repeated contraction of muscle alleviates present myotonia with each contraction, such that myotonia is almost absent after a few contractions of the same muscle.

J Neurol 254(2):257-258</ref> Like chloride channel mutations, patients with sodium channel mutations may have a very varied phenotype, making a diagnosis more difficult.\n\n==Mechanisms==\nMyotonia congenita is caused in humans by loss-of-function mutations in the gene ''[[CLCN1]]''.  This is the gene encoding the protein [[CLCN1]], that forms the ClC-1 chloride channel, critical for the normal function of skeletal muscle cells. This gene is also associated with the condition in horses and goats.\n\nIn short, in lack of sufficient functional chloride channels, the muscle fiber membrane becomes hyper-excitable and continues to be electrically active (firing [[action potentials]]) when stimulated, for longer periods of time, than a normal muscle fiber. This results in prolonged contraction/delayed relaxation of the muscle.\n\nThe dysfunctional Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channels are located in the muscle fiber membrane and do not affect the [[motor nerve]] innervating the muscle. However, many studies have shown that denervation of muscle fibers alter the resting membrane conductance, but whether this affects myotonia in the muscle has been subject to heavy debate, and results from experiments are inconclusive.<ref name=\"Missingor\">{{cite journal |pmid=2580324 |year=1985 |last1=R\u00fcdel |first1=R |last2=Lehmann-Horn |first2=F |title=Membrane changes in cells from myotonia patients |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=310\u201356 |journal=Physiological Reviews|doi=10.1152/physrev.1985.65.2.310 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[skeletal muscle]] fibers, a large [[transverse tubule]] system with a high surface-area to volume ratio exists. The onset of skeletal muscle activity is associated with the initiation and propagation of [[action potentials]] again associated with an efflux of K<sup>+</sup> to the extracellular fluid and transverse tubule system. When many action potentials are elicited subsequently more K<sup>+</sup> is expelled from the cell into the transverse tubular system. As K<sup>+</sup> accumulates in the transverse tubular system the [[equilibrium potential]] for K<sup>+</sup> (E<sub>K<sup>+</sup></sub>) normally around -80 mV, becomes more depolarized ([[depolarization]]), according to the [[Nernst equation]]. In skeletal muscle fibers the equilibrium potential for Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is around -80 mV, equal to that of K<sup>+</sup> at rest. Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> moves towards its equilibrium potential around -80 mV, while potassium moves towards its equilibrium potential more depolarized than -80 mV during activity. This results in a slightly more depolarized [[membrane potential]] of the fiber during repeated action potentials, see [[Goldman equation]]. The Na<sup>+</sup> conductance is only elevated shortly compared to the K<sup>+</sup> conductance during each action potential, which is why K<sup>+</sup> largely determines the membrane potential (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is passively distributed during rest).\nIn the case of myotonia congenita, the chloride channels that allow Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> to move across the membrane towards its equilibrium potential are defective, thus K<sup>+</sup> is the only ion determining the membrane potential, and as more and more K<sup>+</sup> accumulates in the transverse tubular system with each subsequent action potential the fiber depolarizes until the membrane potential comes close enough to the [[action potential threshold]] for spontaneous activity to ensue<ref name=\"pmid1119960\">{{cite journal |pmid=1119960 |year=1975 |last1=Barchi |first1=RL |title=Myotonia.

Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita ([[OMIM]] #160800) is also called Thomsen disease, after Danish/German physician Asmus Julius Thomas Thomsen (1815\u20131896), who himself had the disease and who wrote the first description of it in the [[medical literature]] (in 1876).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02164912 |title=Tonische Kr\u00e4mpfe in willk\u00fcrlich beweglichen Muskeln in Folge von ererbter psychischer Disposition |year=1876 |last1=Thomsen |first1=J. |journal=Archiv f\u00fcr Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=702\u201318|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1428396 }}</ref> Autosomal recessive myotonia congenita (OMIM #255700) is also called generalized myotonia, recessive generalized myotonia (RGM), Becker disease, and Becker myotonia, after the German professor [[Peter Emil Becker]], who discovered its recessive nature.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-92920-5_32 |chapter=Zur Genetik der Myotonien |title=Progressive Muskeldystrophie Myotonie \u00b7 Myasthenie |year=1966 |last1=Becker |first1=P.

The reason for this is not known.\n\nBecause [[#Pathophysiology|several CLCN1 mutations can cause either Becker disease or Thomsen disease]], doctors usually rely on characteristic signs and symptoms to distinguish the two forms of myotonia congenita. However, myotonia caused by CLCN1 mutations can occasionally be clinically indistinguishable from myotonia caused by sodium channel mutations ([[SCN4A]] mutations) resulting in the similar disease [[paramyotonia congenita]].\n\nA so-called [[Finnish heritage disease]], congenital myotonia is more common in [[Finland]] and among ethnic [[Finns]].  A molecular study of the CLCN1 gene in 24 families in northern Finland, including 46 affected individuals, showed that although the inheritance appeared to be dominant (Thomsen type), in fact it is recessive (Becker type).<ref name=\"pmid10430417\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/WNL.53.2.297 |title=Founder mutations and the high prevalence of myotonia congenita in northern Finland |year=1999 |last1=Papponen |first1=H. |last2=Toppinen |first2=T. |last3=Baumann |first3=P. |last4=Myllyl\u00e4 |first4=V. |last5=Leisti |first5=J. |last6=Kuivaniemi |first6=H. |last7=Tromp |first7=G. |last8=Myllyl\u00e4 |first8=R. |journal=Neurology |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=297\u2013302 |pmid=10430417}}</ref>\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\n'''Sodium channel myotonias ([[SCN4A]])'''\n* [[Potassium-aggravated myotonia]] (acetazolamide responsive myotonia)\n* [[Paramyotonia congenita]]\n* [[Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis]]\n\n'''Dystrophies'''\n* [[Myotonic dystrophy]] (myotonic muscular dystrophy: Type 1 and Type 2)\n\n'''Potassium channel disorders ([[KCNJ2]])'''\n* [[Andersen-Tawil syndrome]]\n\n'''Other disorders'''\n* Thyroid disorders\n* [[Neuromyotonia]] (Isaacs Syndrome)\n* [[Schwartz\u2013Jampel syndrome]]\n* [[Stiff person syndrome]]\n* [[Brody myopathy]] (Brody Disease, Brody's Disease, Brody's Myopathy)\n\n==Treatment==\nSome cases of myotonia congenita do not require treatment, or it is determined that the risks of the medication outweigh the benefits.

Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''. The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick.

Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]]. The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n| num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n| opentheme = \n| website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]].

The program also featured matches from the [[Ladies Major League Wrestling|Wild Women of Wrestling]] promotion. Reruns of the program, along with sporadic new episodes, continued airing on the network through 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match.

Its legacy is largely intertwined with that of its founder, [[Herb Abrams]].\n\nA Season 2 episode of ''[[Dark Side of the Ring]]'' focused on the promotion will air in May 2020.<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/927543/dark-side-of-the-ring-season-2-premiere-chris-benoit/</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Herb Abrams]] founded the UWF in 1990 to try and challenge [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Federation]] on a national level. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''. The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991. Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]]. The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n| num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n| opentheme = \n| website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and ran until 1993. The program also featured matches from the [[Ladies Major League Wrestling|Wild Women of Wrestling]] promotion.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

The drooping may be worse after being awake longer when the individual's muscles are tired. This condition is sometimes called \"lazy eye\", but that term normally refers to the condition [[amblyopia]]. If severe enough and left untreated, the drooping eyelid can cause other conditions, such as amblyopia or [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]]. This is why it is especially important for this disorder to be treated in children at a young age, before it can interfere with vision development.\n\nThe term is from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} \u2013 \"a fall, falling\".\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns and symptoms that are typically seen in this condition include in the following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eyeinstitute.co.nz/about-eyes/a-to-z-of-eyes/conditions/ptosis-of-the-eyelid|title=Ptosis Of The Eyelid: Symptoms, Causes, Treatments|website=www.eyeinstitute.co.nz|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n* The person eyelid/s may appear to be drooping.\n* Ptosis can also cause a person to appear tired from the droopy eyelids.\n* Dry eyes is another symptoms due to the eyelid's inability to function effectively keeping the eyes from drying out.\n* Obstruct vision may occur due to the sagging of the upper eyelids result which partially block the person's vision.\n* A person tilts their head back to speak\n* tiredness and aching around the eyes\n* eyebrows are constantly being lifted to see properly\n\nSome of the risk factors that increase the chance of the patient experiencing ptosis include the following:\n\n* eye tumor\n* diabetes\n* history of stroke\n* cancer\n* neurological disorders\n* Older people (as a person ages their eye muscles get weaker, increasing the chances of their eyelids becoming droopy).\n\n==Causes==\n[[Image:Botulism1and2.JPG|thumb|left|Neurotoxic ptosis caused by [[botulinum toxin]]: a 14-year-old [[botulism]] patient with bilateral total [[ophthalmoplegia]] with ptosis (left image) and dilated, fixed pupils (right image).

It can affect one eye or both eyes and is more common in the elderly, as muscles in the eyelids may begin to deteriorate. One can, however, be born with ptosis. This is due to improper development of the infant's levator muscle while still in the mother's womb. Congenital ptosis is hereditary in three main forms.<ref>{{cite web|title= Congenital Ptosis|url=http://www.medigle.de/rw/diagnoses/kongenitaler+Ptosis|publisher=MEDgle|accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> Causes of congenital ptosis remain unknown. Ptosis may be caused by damage to the muscle which raises the eyelid, damage to the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion or damage to the [[nerve]] (3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve)) which controls this muscle. Such damage could be a sign or symptom of an underlying disease such as [[diabetes mellitus]], a [[brain tumor]], a [[pancoast tumor]] (apex of lung) and diseases which may cause weakness in muscles or nerve damage, such as [[myasthenia gravis]] or [[oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy]]. Exposure to the toxins in some snake venoms, such as that of the [[black mamba]], may also cause this effect.\n\nPtosis can be caused by the aponeurosis of the [[Levator palpebrae superioris muscle|levator muscle]], nerve abnormalities, [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[inflammation]] or lesions of the lid or orbit.<ref name=r1>{{EMedicine|article|1212082|Adult Ptosis}}</ref> Dysfunctions of the levators may occur as a result of autoimmune antibodies attacking and eliminating the [[neurotransmitter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeptosis.com/| title=Eye Ptosis Congenital|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref>\n\nPtosis may be due to a [[myogenic]], [[neurogenic]], [[aponeurotic]], mechanical or traumatic cause, and it usually occurs isolated, but may be associated with various other conditions, like immunological, degenerative, or hereditary disorders, [[tumor]]s or infections.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Ptosis: causes, presentation, and management| journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery| volume=27| issue=3| pages=193\u2013204| pmid=12925861| year=2003| last1=Finsterer| first1=J| doi=10.1007/s00266-003-0127-5}}</ref>\n\nAcquired ptosis is most commonly caused by aponeurotic ptosis. This can occur as a result of senescence, dehiscence or disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis. Moreover, chronic inflammation or intraocular surgery can lead to the same effect. Also, wearing [[contact lenses]] for long periods of time is thought to have a certain impact on the development of this condition.\n\nCongenital neurogenic ptosis is believed to be caused by [[Horner's syndrome]].<ref name=r1/> In this case, a mild ptosis may be associated with ipsilateral ptosis, [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and areola hypopigmentation and anhidrosis due to paresis of the [[superior tarsal muscle]]. Acquired Horner syndrome may result after trauma, neoplastic insult, or even [[vascular disease]].\n\nPtosis due to trauma can ensue after an eyelid laceration with transection of the upper eyelid elevators or disruption of the neural input.<ref name=r1/>\n\nOther causes of ptosis include eyelid neoplasms, [[neurofibromas]] or the [[wound healing|cicatrization]] after inflammation or surgery. Mild ptosis may occur with aging.\nA drooping eyelid can be one of the first signals of a third nerve palsy due to a cerebral aneurysm, that otherwise is asymptomatic and referred to as an oculomotor nerve palsy.\n\n===Drugs===\nUse of high doses of [[opioid]] drugs such as [[morphine]], [[oxycodone]], [[heroin]], or [[hydrocodone]] can cause ptosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iqbal N |title=Ptosis, convergence disorder and heroin |journal=[[Annals of Saudi Medicine]] |volume=22 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=369\u201371 |year=2002 |url=http://www.kfshrc.edu.sa/annals/Old/225_226/02-103.pdf |pmid=17146268|doi=10.5144/0256-4947.2002.369 }}</ref> [[Pregabalin]], an anticonvulsant drug, has also been known to cause mild ptosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglib.com/adverse-reactions_side-effects/lyrica/| title=Lyrica (Pregabalin) \u2013 Reports of Side Effects & Adverse Reactions|date=|publisher=DrugLib.com|accessdate= 2010-07-12}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism and Pathophysiology ==\nDifferent trauma can cause and induce many of different mechanisms. For example, myogenic ptosis is when there's a direct injury to the levator muscle and/or M\u00fcller's muscle. On the other hand, neurogenic ptosis occur during closed head injuries, traumatically-introduced neurotoxin (wasp/bee/snake venom) and botulinum toxin, which is caused by the effect those factors had in the CNNIII or the sympathetic pathway. Mechanical ptosis can also occur due to scarring tissue restricting the patient's eyelid excursion or it could have potentially created a mass that are weighing down the patient's lid. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Sarah Mireles|last2=Tyring|first2=Ariel J.|last3=Amadi|first3=Arash J.|date=2018|title=Traumatic Ptosis: Evaluation of Etiology, Management and Prognosis|journal=Journal of Ophthalmic & Vision Research|volume=13|issue=4|pages=447\u2013452|doi=10.4103/jovr.jovr_148_17|issn=2008-2010|pmc=6210876|pmid=30479715}}</ref> Another mechanism can be explained due to the disturbance of the oculomotor nerve causing the levator palpebrae to weaken results in the eyelid being droopy. Ptosis can also occur in a patient with brain tumors due to the pressure of the third nerve or also known as the sympathetic nerve on the brain stem, causing the eyelid to droop.   \n\n==Pathology==\n[[Myasthenia gravis]] is a common neurogenic ptosis which could be also classified as neuromuscular ptosis because the site of pathology is at the neuromuscular junction. Studies have shown that up to 70% of myasthenia gravis patients present with ptosis, and 90% of these patients will eventually develop ptosis.<ref name=\"fmshk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fmshk.org/article/621.pdf| title=Ptosis|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref> In this case, ptosis can be unilateral or bilateral and its severity tends to be oscillating during the day, because of factors such as [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] or drug effect. This particular type of ptosis is distinguished from the others with the help of a [[Tensilon test]] and [[blood tests]]. Also, specific to myasthenia gravis is the fact that coldness inhibits the activity of [[cholinesterase]], which makes possible differentiating this type of ptosis by applying [[ice]] onto the eyelids. Patients with myasthenic ptosis are very likely to still experience a variation of the drooping of the eyelid at different hours of the day.\n\nThe ptosis caused by the oculomotor palsy can be unilateral or bilateral, as the subnucleus to the levator muscle is a shared, midline structure in the brainstem. In cases in which the palsy is caused by the compression of the [[nerve]] by a tumor or aneurysm, it is highly likely to result in an abnormal ipsilateral papillary response and a larger pupil. Surgical third nerve palsy is characterized by a sudden onset of unilateral ptosis and an enlarged or sluggish pupil to the light. In this case, imaging tests such as CTs or MRIs should be considered. Medical third nerve palsy, contrary to surgical third nerve palsy, usually does not affect the pupil and it tends to slowly improve in several weeks. Surgery to correct ptosis due to medical third nerve palsy is normally considered only if the improvement of ptosis and ocular motility are unsatisfactory after half a year. Patients with third nerve palsy tend to have diminished or absent function of the levator.\n\nWhen caused by [[Horner's syndrome]], ptosis is usually accompanied by [[miosis]] and [[anhidrosis]]. In this case, the ptosis is due to the result of interruption innervations to the sympathetic, autonomic Muller's muscle rather than the somatic levator palpebrae superioris muscle.  The lid position and pupil size are typically affected by this condition and the ptosis is generally mild, no more than 2&nbsp;mm. The pupil might be smaller on the affected side. While 4% [[cocaine]] instilled to the eyes can confirm the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome, Hydroxyamphetamine eye drops can differentiate the location of the [[lesion]].<ref name=\"fmshk\" />\n\nChronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a systemic condition that occurs and which usually affects only the lid position and the external eye movement, without involving the movement of the pupil. This condition accounts for nearly 45% of myogenic ptosis cases. Most patients develop ptosis due to this disease in their [[adulthood]]. Characteristic to ptosis caused by this condition is the fact that the protective up rolling of the [[human eyeball|eyeball]] when the eyelids are closed is very poor.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe doctor will first perform a physical exam with questions asking about your medical history. This is to distinguish if the condition is hereditary or not. The doctor will then start with a slit lamp exam after you've explained how often your eyelids droop and how long each episode occurred. The slit lamp exam is done with the doctor uses a high-intensity light allowing them to take a closer look at the patient's eyes. The doctor can also perform a test known as the Tensilon test. The Tensilon test is when the doctor injects the drug Tensilon (edrophonium) into your vein. The doctor then monitors your eyelids to see signs of improvements with the drug.\n\nAnother comprehensive eye exam can be performed for the proper diagnosis is a visual field test. A visual field test may be performed to evaluates the superior vision assessing the quality of the patient's vision and how much is the ptosis affecting it. Since nerve damage is one of the causes for ptosis the ophthalmologist will check the patient's pupil for abnormalities. Along with checking the patient's pupil, the doctor will also check the patient's muscle function by having the patient look around.\n\nThe ophthalmologist may also measure the degree of the eyelid droop by measuring the marginal reflex distance. The marginal reflex distance is the distance between the center of the pupil and the edge of the upper lid. Along with the marginal reflex distance, the ophthalmologist may also examine the strength/ function of the patient's levator muscle. The ophthalmologist will do this test by holding the frontalis muscle (locates in the forehead). After holding the forehead the ophthalmologist will then measure how far the eyelid travels when the patient is gazing down.\n\nThrough these tests, the ophthalmologist will then diagnose if the patient has ptosis and what type of ptosis.

If the patient is under the recommended age for surgery, then the doctor will test if occlusion therapy can compensate for the patient's impeded vision. The reason for delaying the surgery until the patient is at least 4-5 years of age is due to the delay for the frontonasal and upper face to complete their complex growth. After this complex growth is complete, the doctors will be able to obtain a more accurate measurement of the conditions.   However, if the patient\u2019s vision impediment worsens or proves unresponsive to the occlusion therapy, then surgery will be needed sooner. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reviewofophthalmology.com/article/ptosis-diagnostic-tips-and-surgical-options|title=Ptosis: Diagnostic Tips & Surgical Options|last=City|first=Janice Liao, MD, New York|website=www.reviewofophthalmology.com|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>   \n\nSurgical procedures include:\n*Levator resection\n*[[Superior tarsal muscle|M\u00fcller muscle]] resection\n*Frontalis sling operation (preferred option for [[oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy]]) \n*Whitnall Sling \n\nThe Frontalis sling surgery can only be done if the patient\u2019s ptosis condition is due to diseased or stretched-out muscles.

The drooping may be worse after being awake longer when the individual's muscles are tired. This condition is sometimes called \"lazy eye\", but that term normally refers to the condition [[amblyopia]]. If severe enough and left untreated, the drooping eyelid can cause other conditions, such as amblyopia or [[astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]]. This is why it is especially important for this disorder to be treated in children at a young age, before it can interfere with vision development.\n\nThe term is from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} \u2013 \"a fall, falling\".\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns and symptoms that are typically seen in this condition include in the following.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eyeinstitute.co.nz/about-eyes/a-to-z-of-eyes/conditions/ptosis-of-the-eyelid|title=Ptosis Of The Eyelid: Symptoms, Causes, Treatments|website=www.eyeinstitute.co.nz|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n* The person eyelid/s may appear to be drooping.\n* Ptosis can also cause a person to appear tired from the droopy eyelids.\n* Dry eyes is another symptoms due to the eyelid's inability to function effectively keeping the eyes from drying out.\n* Obstruct vision may occur due to the sagging of the upper eyelids result which partially block the person's vision.\n* A person tilts their head back to speak\n* tiredness and aching around the eyes\n* eyebrows are constantly being lifted to see properly\n\nSome of the risk factors that increase the chance of the patient experiencing ptosis include the following:\n\n* eye tumor\n* diabetes\n* history of stroke\n* cancer\n* neurological disorders\n* Older people (as a person ages their eye muscles get weaker, increasing the chances of their eyelids becoming droopy).\n\n==Causes==\n[[Image:Botulism1and2.JPG|thumb|left|Neurotoxic ptosis caused by [[botulinum toxin]]: a 14-year-old [[botulism]] patient with bilateral total [[ophthalmoplegia]] with ptosis (left image) and dilated, fixed pupils (right image).

It can affect one eye or both eyes and is more common in the elderly, as muscles in the eyelids may begin to deteriorate. One can, however, be born with ptosis. This is due to improper development of the infant's levator muscle while still in the mother's womb. Congenital ptosis is hereditary in three main forms.<ref>{{cite web|title= Congenital Ptosis|url=http://www.medigle.de/rw/diagnoses/kongenitaler+Ptosis|publisher=MEDgle|accessdate=2008-10-20}}</ref> Causes of congenital ptosis remain unknown. Ptosis may be caused by damage to the muscle which raises the eyelid, damage to the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion or damage to the [[nerve]] (3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve)) which controls this muscle. Such damage could be a sign or symptom of an underlying disease such as [[diabetes mellitus]], a [[brain tumor]], a [[pancoast tumor]] (apex of lung) and diseases which may cause weakness in muscles or nerve damage, such as [[myasthenia gravis]] or [[oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy]]. Exposure to the toxins in some snake venoms, such as that of the [[black mamba]], may also cause this effect.\n\nPtosis can be caused by the aponeurosis of the [[Levator palpebrae superioris muscle|levator muscle]], nerve abnormalities, [[Physical trauma|trauma]], [[inflammation]] or lesions of the lid or orbit.<ref name=r1>{{EMedicine|article|1212082|Adult Ptosis}}</ref> Dysfunctions of the levators may occur as a result of autoimmune antibodies attacking and eliminating the [[neurotransmitter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeptosis.com/| title=Eye Ptosis Congenital|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref>\n\nPtosis may be due to a [[myogenic]], [[neurogenic]], [[aponeurotic]], mechanical or traumatic cause, and it usually occurs isolated, but may be associated with various other conditions, like immunological, degenerative, or hereditary disorders, [[tumor]]s or infections.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Ptosis: causes, presentation, and management| journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery| volume=27| issue=3| pages=193\u2013204| pmid=12925861| year=2003| last1=Finsterer| first1=J| doi=10.1007/s00266-003-0127-5}}</ref>\n\nAcquired ptosis is most commonly caused by aponeurotic ptosis. This can occur as a result of senescence, dehiscence or disinsertion of the levator aponeurosis. Moreover, chronic inflammation or intraocular surgery can lead to the same effect. Also, wearing [[contact lenses]] for long periods of time is thought to have a certain impact on the development of this condition.\n\nCongenital neurogenic ptosis is believed to be caused by [[Horner's syndrome]].<ref name=r1/> In this case, a mild ptosis may be associated with ipsilateral ptosis, [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and areola hypopigmentation and anhidrosis due to paresis of the [[superior tarsal muscle]]. Acquired Horner syndrome may result after trauma, neoplastic insult, or even [[vascular disease]].\n\nPtosis due to trauma can ensue after an eyelid laceration with transection of the upper eyelid elevators or disruption of the neural input.<ref name=r1/>\n\nOther causes of ptosis include eyelid neoplasms, [[neurofibromas]] or the [[wound healing|cicatrization]] after inflammation or surgery. Mild ptosis may occur with aging.\nA drooping eyelid can be one of the first signals of a third nerve palsy due to a cerebral aneurysm, that otherwise is asymptomatic and referred to as an oculomotor nerve palsy.\n\n===Drugs===\nUse of high doses of [[opioid]] drugs such as [[morphine]], [[oxycodone]], [[heroin]], or [[hydrocodone]] can cause ptosis.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Iqbal N |title=Ptosis, convergence disorder and heroin |journal=[[Annals of Saudi Medicine]] |volume=22 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=369\u201371 |year=2002 |url=http://www.kfshrc.edu.sa/annals/Old/225_226/02-103.pdf |pmid=17146268|doi=10.5144/0256-4947.2002.369 }}</ref> [[Pregabalin]], an anticonvulsant drug, has also been known to cause mild ptosis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglib.com/adverse-reactions_side-effects/lyrica/| title=Lyrica (Pregabalin) \u2013 Reports of Side Effects & Adverse Reactions|date=|publisher=DrugLib.com|accessdate= 2010-07-12}}</ref>\n\n== Mechanism and Pathophysiology ==\nDifferent trauma can cause and induce many of different mechanisms. For example, myogenic ptosis is when there's a direct injury to the levator muscle and/or M\u00fcller's muscle. On the other hand, neurogenic ptosis occur during closed head injuries, traumatically-introduced neurotoxin (wasp/bee/snake venom) and botulinum toxin, which is caused by the effect those factors had in the CNNIII or the sympathetic pathway. Mechanical ptosis can also occur due to scarring tissue restricting the patient's eyelid excursion or it could have potentially created a mass that are weighing down the patient's lid. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Sarah Mireles|last2=Tyring|first2=Ariel J.|last3=Amadi|first3=Arash J.|date=2018|title=Traumatic Ptosis: Evaluation of Etiology, Management and Prognosis|journal=Journal of Ophthalmic & Vision Research|volume=13|issue=4|pages=447\u2013452|doi=10.4103/jovr.jovr_148_17|issn=2008-2010|pmc=6210876|pmid=30479715}}</ref> Another mechanism can be explained due to the disturbance of the oculomotor nerve causing the levator palpebrae to weaken results in the eyelid being droopy. Ptosis can also occur in a patient with brain tumors due to the pressure of the third nerve or also known as the sympathetic nerve on the brain stem, causing the eyelid to droop.   \n\n==Pathology==\n[[Myasthenia gravis]] is a common neurogenic ptosis which could be also classified as neuromuscular ptosis because the site of pathology is at the neuromuscular junction. Studies have shown that up to 70% of myasthenia gravis patients present with ptosis, and 90% of these patients will eventually develop ptosis.<ref name=\"fmshk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fmshk.org/article/621.pdf| title=Ptosis|date=|accessdate= 2010-06-14}}</ref> In this case, ptosis can be unilateral or bilateral and its severity tends to be oscillating during the day, because of factors such as [[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] or drug effect. This particular type of ptosis is distinguished from the others with the help of a [[Tensilon test]] and [[blood tests]]. Also, specific to myasthenia gravis is the fact that coldness inhibits the activity of [[cholinesterase]], which makes possible differentiating this type of ptosis by applying [[ice]] onto the eyelids. Patients with myasthenic ptosis are very likely to still experience a variation of the drooping of the eyelid at different hours of the day.\n\nThe ptosis caused by the oculomotor palsy can be unilateral or bilateral, as the subnucleus to the levator muscle is a shared, midline structure in the brainstem. In cases in which the palsy is caused by the compression of the [[nerve]] by a tumor or aneurysm, it is highly likely to result in an abnormal ipsilateral papillary response and a larger pupil. Surgical third nerve palsy is characterized by a sudden onset of unilateral ptosis and an enlarged or sluggish pupil to the light. In this case, imaging tests such as CTs or MRIs should be considered. Medical third nerve palsy, contrary to surgical third nerve palsy, usually does not affect the pupil and it tends to slowly improve in several weeks. Surgery to correct ptosis due to medical third nerve palsy is normally considered only if the improvement of ptosis and ocular motility are unsatisfactory after half a year. Patients with third nerve palsy tend to have diminished or absent function of the levator.\n\nWhen caused by [[Horner's syndrome]], ptosis is usually accompanied by [[miosis]] and [[anhidrosis]]. In this case, the ptosis is due to the result of interruption innervations to the sympathetic, autonomic Muller's muscle rather than the somatic levator palpebrae superioris muscle.  The lid position and pupil size are typically affected by this condition and the ptosis is generally mild, no more than 2&nbsp;mm. The pupil might be smaller on the affected side. While 4% [[cocaine]] instilled to the eyes can confirm the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome, Hydroxyamphetamine eye drops can differentiate the location of the [[lesion]].<ref name=\"fmshk\" />\n\nChronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia is a systemic condition that occurs and which usually affects only the lid position and the external eye movement, without involving the movement of the pupil. This condition accounts for nearly 45% of myogenic ptosis cases. Most patients develop ptosis due to this disease in their [[adulthood]]. Characteristic to ptosis caused by this condition is the fact that the protective up rolling of the [[human eyeball|eyeball]] when the eyelids are closed is very poor.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe doctor will first perform a physical exam with questions asking about your medical history. This is to distinguish if the condition is hereditary or not. The doctor will then start with a slit lamp exam after you've explained how often your eyelids droop and how long each episode occurred. The slit lamp exam is done with the doctor uses a high-intensity light allowing them to take a closer look at the patient's eyes. The doctor can also perform a test known as the Tensilon test. The Tensilon test is when the doctor injects the drug Tensilon (edrophonium) into your vein. The doctor then monitors your eyelids to see signs of improvements with the drug.\n\nAnother comprehensive eye exam can be performed for the proper diagnosis is a visual field test. A visual field test may be performed to evaluates the superior vision assessing the quality of the patient's vision and how much is the ptosis affecting it. Since nerve damage is one of the causes for ptosis the ophthalmologist will check the patient's pupil for abnormalities. Along with checking the patient's pupil, the doctor will also check the patient's muscle function by having the patient look around.\n\nThe ophthalmologist may also measure the degree of the eyelid droop by measuring the marginal reflex distance. The marginal reflex distance is the distance between the center of the pupil and the edge of the upper lid. Along with the marginal reflex distance, the ophthalmologist may also examine the strength/ function of the patient's levator muscle. The ophthalmologist will do this test by holding the frontalis muscle (locates in the forehead). After holding the forehead the ophthalmologist will then measure how far the eyelid travels when the patient is gazing down.\n\nThrough these tests, the ophthalmologist will then diagnose if the patient has ptosis and what type of ptosis. After diagnosing the types of ptosis the ophthalmologist will then decides if the patient is a good candidate for surgery. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nyulangone.org/conditions/ptosis/diagnosis|title=Diagnosing Ptosis|website=nyulangone.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>\n\n===Classification===\n[[File:Congenitalptosis.JPG|thumb|Mild right eyelid ptosis]]\nDepending upon the cause it can be classified into:\n\n*''Neurogenic ptosis'' which includes [[oculomotor nerve palsy]], [[Horner's syndrome]], [[Marcus Gunn jaw winking syndrome]], third cranial nerve misdirection.\n*''Myogenic ptosis'' which includes [[oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy]], [[myasthenia gravis]], [[myotonic dystrophy]], ocular myopathy, simple congenital ptosis, [[blepharophimosis]] syndrome\n*''Aponeurotic ptosis'' which may be involutional or post-operative\n*''Mechanical ptosis'' which occurs due to edema or tumors of the upper lid\n* ''Neurotoxic ptosis'' which is a classic symptom of [[envenomation]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=The emerging syndrome of envenoming by the New Guinea small-eyed snake ''Micropechis ikaheka''|doi=10.1093/qjmed/89.7.523|journal=QJM : Monthly Journal of the Association of Physicians|volume=89|issue=7|pages=523\u201330|pmid=8759493|year=1996|last1=Warrell|first1=D.

Bilateral ptosis is usually accompanied by [[diplopia]], [[dysphagia]] and/or progressive muscular paralysis. Regardless, [[neurotoxic]] ptosis is a precursor to [[respiratory failure]] and eventual [[suffocation]] caused by complete [[paralysis]] of the [[thoracic diaphragm]]. It is therefore a [[medical emergency]] and immediate treatment is required. Similarly, ptosis may occur in victims of [[Botulism]] (caused by [[Botulinum toxin]]) and this is also regarded as a life-threatening symptom\n*''Pseudo ptosis'' due to: \n# Lack of lid support: empty socket or atrophic globe. \n# Higher lid position on the other side: as in lid retraction\n[[File:Forest Whitaker Cannes 2013 3.jpg|alt=Forest Whitaker|thumb|Hollywood actor [[Forest Whitaker]] has a left eye ptosis]]\n\n==Treatment==\nAponeurotic and congenital ptosis may require surgical correction if severe enough to interfere with the vision or if appearance is a concern.\nTreatment depends on the type of ptosis, and is usually performed by an ophthalmic plastic surgeon or a reconstructive surgeon who specializes in diseases and problems of the eyelid. \n\nIf the condition occurs in a child, then the doctor will delay the surgery until the patient is 4 or 5 years old. If the patient is under the recommended age for surgery, then the doctor will test if occlusion therapy can compensate for the patient's impeded vision. The reason for delaying the surgery until the patient is at least 4-5 years of age is due to the delay for the frontonasal and upper face to complete their complex growth. After this complex growth is complete, the doctors will be able to obtain a more accurate measurement of the conditions.   However, if the patient\u2019s vision impediment worsens or proves unresponsive to the occlusion therapy, then surgery will be needed sooner. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reviewofophthalmology.com/article/ptosis-diagnostic-tips-and-surgical-options|title=Ptosis: Diagnostic Tips & Surgical Options|last=City|first=Janice Liao, MD, New York|website=www.reviewofophthalmology.com|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>   \n\nSurgical procedures include:\n*Levator resection\n*[[Superior tarsal muscle|M\u00fcller muscle]] resection\n*Frontalis sling operation (preferred option for [[oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy]]) \n*Whitnall Sling \n\nThe Frontalis sling surgery can only be done if the patient\u2019s ptosis condition is due to diseased or stretched-out muscles. The stretching-out of muscle is due to age. The frontalis sling surgery is done to either tighten or shorten the affected muscles, thereby allowing the process to raise the patient\u2019s lid\u2019s resting position.

The surgeon will begin with an incision on the eyelid. Once the levator has been exposed, the surgeon either fold it or cut it off before suturing it to the tarsal plate. During this procedure, it is up to the surgeon to decide the height and the contour of the patient\u2019s eyelid, with input from the patient. \n\nThe Whitnall Sling procedure is done with an incision from the levator to the Whitnall ligament. Then the surgeon will suture the Whitnall\u2019s ligament connecting it to the superior tarsal edge. This procedure most likely is done if the patients are concerned about cosmetic appearance. The Whitnall Sling procedure is able to provide a better cosmetic result because the procedure is able to keep the Whitnall\u2019s ligament intact. This allows the support of the lacrimal gland and temporal eyelid to be maintained. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/cases-i/case114/Controversies.html|title=Treatment Controversies, Congenital Ptosis.

Indianized abugida scripts such as [[Kawi alphabet|Kawi]] and [[Baybayin]] was introduced via Sulawesi and Java, and the cultural icons of the [[sarong]] (known as [[malong]] or patadyong), the [[pudong]] [[turban]], [[silk]], and [[batik]] and [[ikat]] weaving and dyeing methods were introduced. Artifacts found from this era include the Golden [[kinnara]], Golden Tara, and the [[Ganesh]] pendant. These cultural traits passed from Mindanao into the [[Visayas]] and [[Luzon]], but were subsequently lost or heavily modified after the Spanish arrival in the 16th century.\n\nThe Hindu-Buddhist cultural revolution was strongest in the coastal areas of the island, but were incorporated into local [[animist]] beliefs and customs tribes that resided more inland. The [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], a fully Hindu kingdom mentioned in Chinese records as a tributary state in the 10th century, was concentrated along the northeastern coast of the island around [[Butuan]].<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2112795/|title=How Islam got to the Philippines|first=Brendan I.|last=Koerner|work=Slate|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The [[Darangen]] epic of the Maranao people harkens back to this era as the most complete local version of the [[Ramayana]].

The largest of the Muslim polities in mainland Mindanao was the Sultanate of Maguindanao, which controlled the southern floodplains of the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]] and most of the coastal area of the [[Illana Bay]] and the [[Moro Gulf]]. The name Mindanao was derived from this Sultanate. But most of Mindanao remained animist, especially the [[Lumad people]] in the interior. Most of the northern, eastern, and southern coastal regions inhabited by [[Visayans]] ([[Surigaonon people|Surigaonon]] and [[Butuanon people|Butuanon]]) and other groups were later converted to Christianity by the Spanish.\n\n===Colonization era===\n====Spanish Colonization and Christianity====\n[[File:Two Spanish missionaries baptise a Moro convert to Roman Catholic, circa 1890.jpg|thumb|Two Spanish missionaries [[baptism|baptizing]] a Moro convert to [[Roman Catholicism]], circa 1890.]]\n\nIn 1521 Antonio Pigafetta wrote an account of reaching 'Maingdano.'

Over time a number of tribes in Mindanao converted to Roman Catholicism and built settlements and forts throughout the coastal regions.

The island of Mindanao is larger than [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|125 countries]] worldwide, including the [[Netherlands]], [[South Korea]], [[Austria]], [[Portugal]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], and [[Ireland]]. The island is mountainous, and is home to [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain in the country. Mindanao is surrounded by four seas: the [[Sulu Sea]] to the west,<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulu_Sea?topic=49523 \"Sulu Sea\"]. ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. Eds. P. Saundry & C. J. Cleveland. Washington, D.C.</ref> the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, and the [[Celebes Sea]] to the south, and the [[Mindanao Sea]] to the north. Of all the islands of the [[Philippines]], Mindanao shows the greatest variety of physiographic development. High, rugged, faulted mountains; almost isolated volcanic peaks; high rolling plateaus; and broad, level, swampy plains are found there.\n\nThe Mindanao [[Island groups of the Philippines|island group]] is an arbitrary grouping of islands in southern Philippines which comprises the Mindanao mainland, the [[Sulu Archipelago]] (consisting of the islands of [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawitawi Island|Tawi-tawi]]), and the outlying islands of [[Camiguin]], [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]], [[Siargao]], and [[Samal, Davao del Norte|Samal]].\n[[Platycerium grande]] is endemic to the island{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n=== Mountains ===\nThe mountains of Mindanao can be grouped into ten ranges, including both complex structural mountains and volcanoes. The structural mountains on the extreme eastern and western portions of the [[island]] show broad exposures of Mesozoic rock, and Ultrabasic rocks at the surface in many places along the east coast. Other parts of the island consist mainly of [[Cenozoic]] and [[Quaternary]] volcanic or sedimentary rocks.\n\nIn the eastern portion of the island, from Bilas Point in [[Surigao del Norte]] to Cape San Agustin in [[Davao Oriental]], is a range of complex mountains known in their northern portion as the Diwata Mountains. This range is low and rolling in its central portion. A proposed road connecting Bislig on the east coast with the [[Agusan River]] would pass through {{Convert|16|km|sp=us}} of broad saddle across the mountains at a maximum elevation of less than {{Convert|250|m|sp=us}}; while the existing east\u2013west road from [[Lianga, Surigao del Sur|Lianga]], {{convert|48|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Bislig]], reaches a maximum elevation of only {{Convert|450|m|abbr=on}}. The Diwata Mountains, north of these low points, are considerably higher and more rugged, reaching an elevation of {{Convert|2012|m|abbr=on}} in Mount Hilong-Hilong, {{convert|17|mi|km}} along the eastern portion of [[Cabadbaran City]]. The southern portion of this range is broader and even more rugged than the northern section. In [[Davao Oriental]], several peaks rise above {{Convert|2600|m|abbr=on}} and one mountain rises to {{Convert|2910|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:MountApo1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mt. Apo]], the highest peak in the [[Philippines]]]]\n\nThe east-facing coastal regions of Davao and Surigao del Sur are marked by a series of small coastal lowlands separated from each other by rugged forelands which extend to the water's edge. Offshore are numerous [[coral reefs]] and tiny [[islets]]. This remote and forbidding coast is made doubly difficult to access during the months from October to March by the heavy surf driven before the northeast trade winds. A few miles offshore is found the [[Philippine Deep]]. This ocean trench, reaching measured depths of {{convert|34696|ft|m}}, is the third-deepest trench, (after the [[Mariana Trench]] and [[Tonga Trench]]) on the earth's surface.\n\nA second north\u2013south mountain range extends from [[Talisayan, Misamis Oriental|Talisayan]] in the north, to [[Tinaca Point]] in the southernmost point of Mindanao. This mountain range runs along the western borders of the [[Agusan del Norte]], [[Agusan del Sur]], and [[Davao Region|Davao]] provinces. This range is mainly structural in origin, but it also contains at least three active volcano peaks. The central and northern portions of this range contain several peaks between {{Convert|2000|and|2600|m|abbr=on}}, and here the belt of mountains is about {{convert|30|mi|km}} across.\n\nWest of [[Davao City]] stand two inactive volcanoes: [[Mount Talomo]] at {{Convert|2893|m|sp=us}}, and [[Mount Apo]] at {{Convert|2964|m|abbr=on}}. Mount Apo is the highest point in the Philippines. South of Mount Apo, this central mountain belt is somewhat lower than it is to the north, with peaks averaging only {{Convert|1100|to|1800|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn Western Mindanao, a range of complex structural mountains forms the long, hand-like [[Zamboanga Peninsula (geographical region)|Zamboanga Peninsula]]. These mountains, reaching heights of only {{convert|1200|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, are not as high as the other structural belts in Mindanao. There are several places in the Zamboanga Mountains where small inter-mountain basins have been created, with some potential for future agricultural development. The northeastern end of this range is marked by the twin peaks of the now-extinct volcano, [[Mount Malindang]], that towers over [[Ozamis City]] at a height of {{Convert|2425|m|abbr=on}}. Mount Dapia is the highest mountain in the Zamboanga Peninsula, reaching a height of {{convert|2617|m|abbr=on}}. [[Batorampon Point]] is the highest mountain of the southernmost end of the peninsula, reaching a height of only {{convert|1335|m|abbr=on}}; it is located in the boundary of [[Zamboanga City]].\n\nA series of volcanic mountains is located within the vicinity of [[Lake Lanao]] forming a broad arc through the [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Cotabato]] and [[Bukidnon]] provinces. At least six of the twenty odd peaks in this area are active and several stand in semi-isolation. The Butig Peaks, with their four crater lakes, are easily seen from [[Cotabato]]. [[Mount Ragang]], an active volcano cone reaching {{Convert|2815|m|abbr=on}}, is the most isolated, while the greatest height is reached by [[Mount Kitanglad]] at {{Convert|2889|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Philippinen mindanao boot ph06p73.jpg|thumb|250px|Mindanao coast]]\n\nIn [[South Cotabato]], is another range of volcanic mountains, this time paralleling the coast. These mountains have a maximum extent of {{convert|110|mi|km}} from northwest to southeast and measures some {{convert|30|mi|km}} across. One of the well-known mountains here is [[Mount Parker (Cotabato)|Mount Parker]], whose almost circular [[volcanic crater lake|crater lake]] measures a mile-and-a-quarter in diameter and lies {{Convert|300|m|abbr=on}} below its {{Convert|2040|m|abbr=on}} summit. [[Mount Matutum]] is a protected area and is considered as one of the major landmarks in the [[South Cotabato]] province.\n\n=== Plateaus ===\nAnother important physiographic division of Mindanao is the series of upland plateaus in the [[Bukidnon]] and [[Lanao del Sur]] provinces. These [[plateau]]s are rather extensive and almost surround several [[volcanoes]] in this area. The plateaus are made up of basaltic lava flows inter-bedded with volcanic ash and tuff. Near their edges, the plateaus are cut by deep [[canyons]], and at several points waterfalls drop down to the narrow coastal plain. These falls hold considerable promise for development of hydroelectric energy. Indeed, one such site at [[Maria Cristina Falls]] has already become a major producer. The rolling plateaus lie at an elevation averaging 700 meters above sea level, and offer relief from the often oppressive heat of the coastal lowlands.\n\n=== Lakes and waterfalls ===\n[[Lake Lanao]] occupies a large portion of one such plateau in [[Lanao del Sur]]. This lake is the largest lake in Mindanao and the second largest in the country; it is roughly triangular in shape with an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} base, having a surface at 780 meters above sea level, and is rimmed on the east, south, and west by a series of peaks reaching 2,300 meters.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[Marawi City]], at the northern tip of the lake, is bisected by the [[Agus River]], that feeds the [[Maria Cristina Falls]].\n\nAnother of Mindanao's waterfall sites is located in Malabang, {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of [[Lake Lanao]]. Here the Jose Abad Santos Falls present one of the nation's scenic wonders at the gateway to a 200-hectare national park development.\n\nThe Limunsudan Falls, with an approximate height of {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}}, is the highest waterfall in the Philippines; it is located in [[Iligan City]].\n\n=== Valleys, rivers, and plains ===\nMindanao contains two large lowland areas in the valleys of the [[Agusan River]] in Agusan, and the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]] in [[Cotabato City]].\n\nThere is some indication that the Agusan Valley occupies a broad syncline between the central mountains and the east-coast mountains. This valley measures {{convert|110|mi|km}} from south to north and varies from {{convert|20|to|30|mi|km}} in width. {{convert|35|mi|km}} north of the head of [[Davao Gulf]] lies the watershed between the Agusan and the tributaries of the Libuganon River, which flows to the Gulf. The elevation of this divide is well under {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}}, indicating the almost continuous nature of the lowland from the [[Mindanao Sea]] on the north to the [[Davao Gulf]].\n\nThe [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]] and its main tributaries, the Catisan and the [[Pulangi River|Pulangi]], form a valley with a maximum length of {{convert|120|mi|km}} and a width which varies from {{convert|12|mi|km}} at the river mouth to about {{convert|60|mi|km}} in central [[Cotabato]]. The southern extensions of this Cotabato Valley extend uninterrupted across a {{Convert|350|m|sp=us|adj=on}} [[drainage divide|watershed]] from [[Illana Bay]] on the northwest to [[Sarangani Bay]] on the southeast.\n\nOther lowlands of a coastal nature are to be found in various parts of Mindanao. Many of these are tiny isolated pockets, along the northwest coast of [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]]. In other areas such as the Davao Plain, these coastal lowlands are {{Convert|16|km|abbr=on}} wide and several times in length.\n\nFrom [[Dipolog City]] eastward along the northern coast of Mindanao approaching [[Butuan City]] extends a rolling coastal plain of varying width. In [[Misamis Occidental]], the now dormant [[Mount Malindang]] has created a lowland averaging {{Convert|13|km|abbr=on}} in width. Shallow [[Panquil Bay]] divides this province from [[Lanao del Norte]], and is bordered by low-lying, poorly drained lowlands and extensive mangroves. In [[Misamis Oriental]], the plain is narrower and in places whittle into rugged capes that reach the sea. East of [[Cagayan de Oro]], a rugged peninsula extends into the [[Mindanao Sea]].\n{{Back to contents}}\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of 2017, Mindanao had a population of over 25 million people. This comprises 22.1 percent of the entire population of the country.<ref name=honshu2>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false| p=16| title=The Philippine Archipelago|first=Yves |last=Boquet |publisher=Springer|year= 2017\n|isbn= 9783319519265}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnicity and culture===\n\n{{Main|Culture of the Philippines|Music of the Philippines|Kulintang}}\nAn American census conducted in the early 1900s noted that the island was inhabited by people \"greatly divided in origin, temperament and religion\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_Student's_Reference_Work/Mindanao|title=The New Student's Reference Work (1914)}}</ref> Evidence of the island's cultural diversity can be seen in the buildings and ruins of old Spanish settlements in the northwestern peninsula that span eastwards to the southern gulf coast, the site of the ancient [[Rajahnate of Butuan]] in the northeast region ([[Caraga]]), the Sultanates in the southwest ([[Sultanate of Sulu]], [[Confederation of sultanates in Lanao|Sultanate of Lanao]], [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]]), a number of Buddhist and Taoist temples, and the numerous indigenous tribes.\n\nToday around 25.8 percent of the household population in Mindanao classified themselves as Cebuanos. Other ethnic groups included Bisaya/Binisaya (18.4%), Hiligaynon/Ilonggo (8.2%), Maguindanaon (5.5%), and Maranao (5.4%). The remaining 36.6 percent belonged to other ethnic groups. Cebuano registered the highest proportion of ethnic group in Northern Mindanao and Davao Region with 35.59 percent and 37.76 percent, respectively. In SOCCSKSARGEN, it was Hiligaynon/Ilonggo (31.58%), Binisaya/Bisaya (33.10%) in Zamboanga Peninsula, Maranao (26.40%) in ARMM, and Surigaonon (25.67%) in Caraga.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/mindanao-comprised-about-24-percent-philippines-total-population|title=Mindanao Comprised About 24 Percent of the Philippines' Total Population|publisher=Philippine Statistics Authority|date=8 June 2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\nDozens of languages are spoken in Mindanao; among them, [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Surigaonon language|Surigaonon]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]], [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]], and [[Chavacano]] are most widely spoken. Of the seven aforementioned regional languages, Cebuano (often referred as Bisaya) has the highest number of speakers, being spoken throughout Northern Mindanao (except the southern parts of [[Lanao del Norte]]), the Davao region, the western half of the Caraga region (as well as the city of [[Bislig]] and the municipalities surrounding it in [[Surigao del Sur]]), the entirety of the Zamboanga Peninsula (with the exception of Zamboanga City), and southern SOCCSKSARGEN. Hiligaynon is the main language of SOCCSKSARGEN, where majority of the inhabitants are of ethnic Hiligaynon stock. Surigaonon is spoken in the eastern half of the Caraga region, mainly by the eponymous Surigaonons. Tausug is widely spoken in the western territories of the ARMM, specifically the Sulu Archipelago, which comprises the provinces of [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]], with a sizeable community of speakers residing in Zamboanga City.

Indianized abugida scripts such as [[Kawi alphabet|Kawi]] and [[Baybayin]] was introduced via Sulawesi and Java, and the cultural icons of the [[sarong]] (known as [[malong]] or patadyong), the [[pudong]] [[turban]], [[silk]], and [[batik]] and [[ikat]] weaving and dyeing methods were introduced. Artifacts found from this era include the Golden [[kinnara]], Golden Tara, and the [[Ganesh]] pendant. These cultural traits passed from Mindanao into the [[Visayas]] and [[Luzon]], but were subsequently lost or heavily modified after the Spanish arrival in the 16th century.\n\nThe Hindu-Buddhist cultural revolution was strongest in the coastal areas of the island, but were incorporated into local [[animist]] beliefs and customs tribes that resided more inland. The [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], a fully Hindu kingdom mentioned in Chinese records as a tributary state in the 10th century, was concentrated along the northeastern coast of the island around [[Butuan]].<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2112795/|title=How Islam got to the Philippines|first=Brendan I.|last=Koerner|work=Slate|date=28 January 2005|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The [[Darangen]] epic of the Maranao people harkens back to this era as the most complete local version of the [[Ramayana]].

The largest of the Muslim polities in mainland Mindanao was the Sultanate of Maguindanao, which controlled the southern floodplains of the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]] and most of the coastal area of the [[Illana Bay]] and the [[Moro Gulf]]. The name Mindanao was derived from this Sultanate. But most of Mindanao remained animist, especially the [[Lumad people]] in the interior. Most of the northern, eastern, and southern coastal regions inhabited by [[Visayans]] ([[Surigaonon people|Surigaonon]] and [[Butuanon people|Butuanon]]) and other groups were later converted to Christianity by the Spanish.\n\n===Colonization era===\n====Spanish Colonization and Christianity====\n[[File:Two Spanish missionaries baptise a Moro convert to Roman Catholic, circa 1890.jpg|thumb|Two Spanish missionaries [[baptism|baptizing]] a Moro convert to [[Roman Catholicism]], circa 1890.]]\n\nIn 1521 Antonio Pigafetta wrote an account of reaching 'Maingdano.'

These settlements endured despite attacks from neighboring Muslim Sultanates.

The island of Mindanao is larger than [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|125 countries]] worldwide, including the [[Netherlands]], [[South Korea]], [[Austria]], [[Portugal]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], and [[Ireland]]. The island is mountainous, and is home to [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain in the country. Mindanao is surrounded by four seas: the [[Sulu Sea]] to the west,<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sulu_Sea?topic=49523 \"Sulu Sea\"]. ''Encyclopedia of Earth''. Eds. P. Saundry & C. J. Cleveland. Washington, D.C.</ref> the [[Philippine Sea]] to the east, and the [[Celebes Sea]] to the south, and the [[Mindanao Sea]] to the north. Of all the islands of the [[Philippines]], Mindanao shows the greatest variety of physiographic development. High, rugged, faulted mountains; almost isolated volcanic peaks; high rolling plateaus; and broad, level, swampy plains are found there.\n\nThe Mindanao [[Island groups of the Philippines|island group]] is an arbitrary grouping of islands in southern Philippines which comprises the Mindanao mainland, the [[Sulu Archipelago]] (consisting of the islands of [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawitawi Island|Tawi-tawi]]), and the outlying islands of [[Camiguin]], [[Dinagat Island|Dinagat]], [[Siargao]], and [[Samal, Davao del Norte|Samal]].\n[[Platycerium grande]] is endemic to the island{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n=== Mountains ===\nThe mountains of Mindanao can be grouped into ten ranges, including both complex structural mountains and volcanoes. The structural mountains on the extreme eastern and western portions of the [[island]] show broad exposures of Mesozoic rock, and Ultrabasic rocks at the surface in many places along the east coast. Other parts of the island consist mainly of [[Cenozoic]] and [[Quaternary]] volcanic or sedimentary rocks.\n\nIn the eastern portion of the island, from Bilas Point in [[Surigao del Norte]] to Cape San Agustin in [[Davao Oriental]], is a range of complex mountains known in their northern portion as the Diwata Mountains. This range is low and rolling in its central portion. A proposed road connecting Bislig on the east coast with the [[Agusan River]] would pass through {{Convert|16|km|sp=us}} of broad saddle across the mountains at a maximum elevation of less than {{Convert|250|m|sp=us}}; while the existing east\u2013west road from [[Lianga, Surigao del Sur|Lianga]], {{convert|48|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Bislig]], reaches a maximum elevation of only {{Convert|450|m|abbr=on}}. The Diwata Mountains, north of these low points, are considerably higher and more rugged, reaching an elevation of {{Convert|2012|m|abbr=on}} in Mount Hilong-Hilong, {{convert|17|mi|km}} along the eastern portion of [[Cabadbaran City]]. The southern portion of this range is broader and even more rugged than the northern section. In [[Davao Oriental]], several peaks rise above {{Convert|2600|m|abbr=on}} and one mountain rises to {{Convert|2910|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:MountApo1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mt. Apo]], the highest peak in the [[Philippines]]]]\n\nThe east-facing coastal regions of Davao and Surigao del Sur are marked by a series of small coastal lowlands separated from each other by rugged forelands which extend to the water's edge. Offshore are numerous [[coral reefs]] and tiny [[islets]]. This remote and forbidding coast is made doubly difficult to access during the months from October to March by the heavy surf driven before the northeast trade winds. A few miles offshore is found the [[Philippine Deep]]. This ocean trench, reaching measured depths of {{convert|34696|ft|m}}, is the third-deepest trench, (after the [[Mariana Trench]] and [[Tonga Trench]]) on the earth's surface.\n\nA second north\u2013south mountain range extends from [[Talisayan, Misamis Oriental|Talisayan]] in the north, to [[Tinaca Point]] in the southernmost point of Mindanao. This mountain range runs along the western borders of the [[Agusan del Norte]], [[Agusan del Sur]], and [[Davao Region|Davao]] provinces. This range is mainly structural in origin, but it also contains at least three active volcano peaks. The central and northern portions of this range contain several peaks between {{Convert|2000|and|2600|m|abbr=on}}, and here the belt of mountains is about {{convert|30|mi|km}} across.\n\nWest of [[Davao City]] stand two inactive volcanoes: [[Mount Talomo]] at {{Convert|2893|m|sp=us}}, and [[Mount Apo]] at {{Convert|2964|m|abbr=on}}. Mount Apo is the highest point in the Philippines. South of Mount Apo, this central mountain belt is somewhat lower than it is to the north, with peaks averaging only {{Convert|1100|to|1800|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn Western Mindanao, a range of complex structural mountains forms the long, hand-like [[Zamboanga Peninsula (geographical region)|Zamboanga Peninsula]]. These mountains, reaching heights of only {{convert|1200|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, are not as high as the other structural belts in Mindanao. There are several places in the Zamboanga Mountains where small inter-mountain basins have been created, with some potential for future agricultural development. The northeastern end of this range is marked by the twin peaks of the now-extinct volcano, [[Mount Malindang]], that towers over [[Ozamis City]] at a height of {{Convert|2425|m|abbr=on}}. Mount Dapia is the highest mountain in the Zamboanga Peninsula, reaching a height of {{convert|2617|m|abbr=on}}. [[Batorampon Point]] is the highest mountain of the southernmost end of the peninsula, reaching a height of only {{convert|1335|m|abbr=on}}; it is located in the boundary of [[Zamboanga City]].\n\nA series of volcanic mountains is located within the vicinity of [[Lake Lanao]] forming a broad arc through the [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Cotabato]] and [[Bukidnon]] provinces. At least six of the twenty odd peaks in this area are active and several stand in semi-isolation. The Butig Peaks, with their four crater lakes, are easily seen from [[Cotabato]]. [[Mount Ragang]], an active volcano cone reaching {{Convert|2815|m|abbr=on}}, is the most isolated, while the greatest height is reached by [[Mount Kitanglad]] at {{Convert|2889|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Philippinen mindanao boot ph06p73.jpg|thumb|250px|Mindanao coast]]\n\nIn [[South Cotabato]], is another range of volcanic mountains, this time paralleling the coast. These mountains have a maximum extent of {{convert|110|mi|km}} from northwest to southeast and measures some {{convert|30|mi|km}} across. One of the well-known mountains here is [[Mount Parker (Cotabato)|Mount Parker]], whose almost circular [[volcanic crater lake|crater lake]] measures a mile-and-a-quarter in diameter and lies {{Convert|300|m|abbr=on}} below its {{Convert|2040|m|abbr=on}} summit. [[Mount Matutum]] is a protected area and is considered as one of the major landmarks in the [[South Cotabato]] province.\n\n=== Plateaus ===\nAnother important physiographic division of Mindanao is the series of upland plateaus in the [[Bukidnon]] and [[Lanao del Sur]] provinces. These [[plateau]]s are rather extensive and almost surround several [[volcanoes]] in this area. The plateaus are made up of basaltic lava flows inter-bedded with volcanic ash and tuff. Near their edges, the plateaus are cut by deep [[canyons]], and at several points waterfalls drop down to the narrow coastal plain. These falls hold considerable promise for development of hydroelectric energy. Indeed, one such site at [[Maria Cristina Falls]] has already become a major producer. The rolling plateaus lie at an elevation averaging 700 meters above sea level, and offer relief from the often oppressive heat of the coastal lowlands.\n\n=== Lakes and waterfalls ===\n[[Lake Lanao]] occupies a large portion of one such plateau in [[Lanao del Sur]]. This lake is the largest lake in Mindanao and the second largest in the country; it is roughly triangular in shape with an {{convert|18|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} base, having a surface at 780 meters above sea level, and is rimmed on the east, south, and west by a series of peaks reaching 2,300 meters.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[Marawi City]], at the northern tip of the lake, is bisected by the [[Agus River]], that feeds the [[Maria Cristina Falls]].\n\nAnother of Mindanao's waterfall sites is located in Malabang, {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of [[Lake Lanao]]. Here the Jose Abad Santos Falls present one of the nation's scenic wonders at the gateway to a 200-hectare national park development.\n\nThe Limunsudan Falls, with an approximate height of {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}}, is the highest waterfall in the Philippines; it is located in [[Iligan City]].\n\n=== Valleys, rivers, and plains ===\nMindanao contains two large lowland areas in the valleys of the [[Agusan River]] in Agusan, and the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]] in [[Cotabato City]].\n\nThere is some indication that the Agusan Valley occupies a broad syncline between the central mountains and the east-coast mountains. This valley measures {{convert|110|mi|km}} from south to north and varies from {{convert|20|to|30|mi|km}} in width. {{convert|35|mi|km}} north of the head of [[Davao Gulf]] lies the watershed between the Agusan and the tributaries of the Libuganon River, which flows to the Gulf. The elevation of this divide is well under {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}}, indicating the almost continuous nature of the lowland from the [[Mindanao Sea]] on the north to the [[Davao Gulf]].\n\nThe [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]] and its main tributaries, the Catisan and the [[Pulangi River|Pulangi]], form a valley with a maximum length of {{convert|120|mi|km}} and a width which varies from {{convert|12|mi|km}} at the river mouth to about {{convert|60|mi|km}} in central [[Cotabato]]. The southern extensions of this Cotabato Valley extend uninterrupted across a {{Convert|350|m|sp=us|adj=on}} [[drainage divide|watershed]] from [[Illana Bay]] on the northwest to [[Sarangani Bay]] on the southeast.\n\nOther lowlands of a coastal nature are to be found in various parts of Mindanao. Many of these are tiny isolated pockets, along the northwest coast of [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]]. In other areas such as the Davao Plain, these coastal lowlands are {{Convert|16|km|abbr=on}} wide and several times in length.\n\nFrom [[Dipolog City]] eastward along the northern coast of Mindanao approaching [[Butuan City]] extends a rolling coastal plain of varying width. In [[Misamis Occidental]], the now dormant [[Mount Malindang]] has created a lowland averaging {{Convert|13|km|abbr=on}} in width. Shallow [[Panquil Bay]] divides this province from [[Lanao del Norte]], and is bordered by low-lying, poorly drained lowlands and extensive mangroves. In [[Misamis Oriental]], the plain is narrower and in places whittle into rugged capes that reach the sea. East of [[Cagayan de Oro]], a rugged peninsula extends into the [[Mindanao Sea]].\n{{Back to contents}}\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of 2017, Mindanao had a population of over 25 million people.

Other ethnic groups included Bisaya/Binisaya (18.4%), Hiligaynon/Ilonggo (8.2%), Maguindanaon (5.5%), and Maranao (5.4%). The remaining 36.6 percent belonged to other ethnic groups. Cebuano registered the highest proportion of ethnic group in Northern Mindanao and Davao Region with 35.59 percent and 37.76 percent, respectively. In SOCCSKSARGEN, it was Hiligaynon/Ilonggo (31.58%), Binisaya/Bisaya (33.10%) in Zamboanga Peninsula, Maranao (26.40%) in ARMM, and Surigaonon (25.67%) in Caraga.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/mindanao-comprised-about-24-percent-philippines-total-population|title=Mindanao Comprised About 24 Percent of the Philippines' Total Population|publisher=Philippine Statistics Authority|date=8 June 2005}}</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\nDozens of languages are spoken in Mindanao; among them, [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], [[Surigaonon language|Surigaonon]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]], [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]], and [[Chavacano]] are most widely spoken. Of the seven aforementioned regional languages, Cebuano (often referred as Bisaya) has the highest number of speakers, being spoken throughout Northern Mindanao (except the southern parts of [[Lanao del Norte]]), the Davao region, the western half of the Caraga region (as well as the city of [[Bislig]] and the municipalities surrounding it in [[Surigao del Sur]]), the entirety of the Zamboanga Peninsula (with the exception of Zamboanga City), and southern SOCCSKSARGEN. Hiligaynon is the main language of SOCCSKSARGEN, where majority of the inhabitants are of ethnic Hiligaynon stock. Surigaonon is spoken in the eastern half of the Caraga region, mainly by the eponymous Surigaonons. Tausug is widely spoken in the western territories of the ARMM, specifically the Sulu Archipelago, which comprises the provinces of [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]], with a sizeable community of speakers residing in Zamboanga City. [[Maguindanaon|Maguindanao]] and [[Maranao language|Maranao]] are the dominant languages of the eastern territories of the ARMM, respectively, with the former being spoken in [[Lanao del Sur]] as well as the southern areas of Lanao del Norte, and the latter in the eponymous province of [[Maguindanao]] and also in adjacent areas which are part of SOCCSKSARGEN. Chavacano is the native language of Zamboanga City and is also the lingua franca of Basilan; it is also spoken in the southernmost fringes of [[Zamboanga Sibugay]]. It is also spoken, albeit as a minority language, in [[Cotabato City]] and Davao City, where dialects of it, respectively, exist, namely Cotabate\u00f1 and Castellano Abakay, both of which evolved from the variant of the language spoken in Zamboanga City.
