His photographic skill earned him a place on various Arctic expeditions, including the controversial 1913 [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]]-led Canadian Arctic Expedition.\n\n==World War I==\nIn 1917, Wilkins returned to his native Australia, joining the [[Australian Flying Corps]] in the rank of [[second lieutenant]]. Wilkins later transferred to the general list and in 1918 was appointed as an official war photographer. In June 1918 Wilkins was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his efforts to rescue wounded soldiers during the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]. He remains the only Australian official photographer from any war to have received a combat medal. The following month Wilkins was promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] and became officer commanding No.3 (Photographic) Sub-section of the Australian war records unit. \n\nWilkins' work frequently led him into the thick of the fighting and during the [[Battle of the Hindenburg Line]] he assumed command of a group of American soldiers who had lost their officers in an earlier attack, directing them until support arrived. Wilkins was subsequently awarded a bar to his Military Cross in the [[1919 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31370 |date= 3 June 1919|page=6823 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nWhen Sir John Monash was asked by the visiting American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]] (who had written ''[[With Lawrence in Arabia]]'' and made him an international hero) if Australia had a similar hero, Monash spoke of Wilkins:  \"Yes, there was one. He was a highly accomplished and absolutely fearless combat photographer. What happened to him is a story of epic proportions. Wounded many times ... he always came through. At times he brought in the wounded, at other times he supplied vital intelligence of enemy activity he observed. At one point he even rallied troops as a combat officer ... His record was unique.\"<ref>Thomas, Lowell, Sir Hubert Wilkins: his world of adventurer, Readers Book Club, London, 1961, p.1.</ref>\n\n==Early career and personal life==\n[[File:Wilkins arctic expedition 1926.jpg|thumb|Detroit Arctic Expedition, 1926]]\nAfter the war, Wilkins served in 1921\u201322 as an [[ornithologist]] aboard the ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]'' on the [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition]] to the [[Southern Ocean]] and adjacent islands.\n\nWilkins in 1923 began a two-year study for the [[British Museum]] of the bird life of Northern Australia. This ornithology project occupied his life until 1925.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\" /> His work was greatly acclaimed by the museum but derided by Australian authorities because of the sympathetic treatment afforded the Aborigines and criticisms of the ongoing environmental damage in the country.\n\nIn March 1927, Wilkins and pilot [[Carl Ben Eielson]] explored the drift ice north of Alaska, touching down upon it in Eielson's airplane in the first land-plane descent onto drift ice. Soundings taken at the landing site indicated a water depth of 16,000 feet, and Wilkins hypothesized from the experience that future Arctic expeditions would take advantage of the wide expanses of open ice to use aircraft in exploration.<ref>Althoff, William F.

He named the island of [[Hearst Land]] after his sponsor, and Hearst thanked Wilkins by giving him and his bride a flight aboard ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]''.\n\n==Preparations for the ''Nautilus'' expedition==\nIn 1930 Wilkins and his wife, Suzanne, were vacationing with a wealthy friend and colleague [[Lincoln Ellsworth]]. During this outing Wilkins and Ellsworth hammered out plans for a trans-Arctic expedition involving a [[submarine]]. Wilkins said the expedition was meant to conduct a \"comprehensive meteorology study\" and collect \"data of academic and economic interest\". He also anticipated Arctic weather stations and the potential to forecast Arctic weather \"several years in advance\". Wilkins believed a submarine could take a fully equipped laboratory into the Arctic.<ref name=\"library.osu.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/exhibits/nautilus/ |title=Under the North Pole: the Voyage of the Nautilus, The Ohio State University Libraries |publisher=Library.osu.edu |date=1931-06-04 |accessdate=2014-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107105356/http://library.osu.edu/sites/exhibits/nautilus/ |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nEllsworth contributed $70,000, plus a $20,000 loan.

Satisfied with the performance of both the machinery and the crew, Wilkins and his men left the relative safety of coastal waterways for the uncertainty of the North Atlantic on 4 June 1931.\n\nSoon after the commencement of the expedition the starboard engine broke down, and soon after that the port engine followed suit.

By 23 August they had left Norway and were only 600 miles from the North Pole. It was at this time that Wilkins uncovered another setback. His submarine was missing its diving planes. Without diving planes he would be unable to control the ''Nautilus'' while submerged.\n\nWilkins was determined to do what he could without the diving planes.

The following month Wilkins was promoted to [[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] and became officer commanding No.3 (Photographic) Sub-section of the Australian war records unit. \n\nWilkins' work frequently led him into the thick of the fighting and during the [[Battle of the Hindenburg Line]] he assumed command of a group of American soldiers who had lost their officers in an earlier attack, directing them until support arrived. Wilkins was subsequently awarded a bar to his Military Cross in the [[1919 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31370 |date= 3 June 1919|page=6823 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nWhen Sir John Monash was asked by the visiting American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]] (who had written ''[[With Lawrence in Arabia|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' and made him an international hero) if Australia had a similar hero, Monash spoke of Wilkins:  \"Yes, there was one. He was a highly accomplished and absolutely fearless combat photographer. What happened to him is a story of epic proportions. Wounded many times ... he always came through. At times he brought in the wounded, at other times he supplied vital intelligence of enemy activity he observed. At one point he even rallied troops as a combat officer ... His record was unique.\"<ref>Thomas, Lowell, Sir Hubert Wilkins: his world of adventurer, Readers Book Club, London, 1961, p.1.</ref>\n\n==Early career and personal life==\n[[File:Wilkins arctic expedition 1926.jpg|thumb|Detroit Arctic Expedition, 1926]]\nAfter the war, Wilkins served in 1921\u201322 as an [[ornithologist]] aboard the ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]'' on the [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition]] to the [[Southern Ocean]] and adjacent islands.\n\nWilkins in 1923 began a two-year study for the [[British Museum]] of the bird life of Northern Australia. This ornithology project occupied his life until 1925.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\" /> His work was greatly acclaimed by the museum but derided by Australian authorities because of the sympathetic treatment afforded the Aborigines and criticisms of the ongoing environmental damage in the country.\n\nIn March 1927, Wilkins and pilot [[Carl Ben Eielson]] explored the drift ice north of Alaska, touching down upon it in Eielson's airplane in the first land-plane descent onto drift ice. Soundings taken at the landing site indicated a water depth of 16,000 feet, and Wilkins hypothesized from the experience that future Arctic expeditions would take advantage of the wide expanses of open ice to use aircraft in exploration.<ref>Althoff, William F.

He named the island of [[Hearst Land]] after his sponsor, and Hearst thanked Wilkins by giving him and his bride a flight aboard ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]''.\n\n==Preparations for the ''Nautilus'' expedition==\nIn 1930 Wilkins and his wife, Suzanne, were vacationing with a wealthy friend and colleague [[Lincoln Ellsworth]]. During this outing Wilkins and Ellsworth hammered out plans for a trans-Arctic expedition involving a [[submarine]]. Wilkins said the expedition was meant to conduct a \"comprehensive meteorology study\" and collect \"data of academic and economic interest\". He also anticipated Arctic weather stations and the potential to forecast Arctic weather \"several years in advance\".

Some parents may be [[Adoption|adoptive]] parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child.

The term is generally only used if there is a need to distinguish an individual's parents from their biological parents,  For example, an individual whose father has remarried may call the father's new wife their [[stepmother]] and continue to refer to their mother normally, though someone who has had little or no contact with their biological mother may address their [[foster parent]] as their mother, and their biological mother as such, or perhaps by her first name.,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Mother ===\n{{main article|Mother}}\nA mother is a female who has a maternal connection with another individual, whether arising from [[Pregnancy|conception]], by giving [[Childbirth|birth]] to, or [[Parenting|raising]] the individual in the role of a parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-mother.html |title=Definition from |publisher=Allwords.com |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> More than one female may have such connections with an individual. Because of the complexity and differences of a mother's social, cultural, and religious definitions and roles, it is challenging to define a mother to suit a universally accepted definition. The utilization of a surrogate mother may result in explication of there being two biological mothers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bromham|first1=David|title=Philosophical Ethics in Reproductive Medicine|date=1990|page=57}}</ref>\n\n=== Father ===\n{{main article|Father}}\nA father is a male parent of any type of offspring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/father |title=TheFreeDictionary |accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> It may be the person who shares in the raising of a child or who has provided the biological material, the [[sperm]], which results in the birth of the child.\n\n=== Grandparent ===\n{{main article|Grandparent}}\nGrandparents are the parents of a person's own parent, whether that be a father or a mother. Every sexually reproducing creature who is not a [[genetic chimera]] has a maximum of four [[gene]]tic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents and so on. Rarely, such as in the case of sibling or half-sibling [[incest]], these [[pedigree collapse|numbers are lower]].\n\n== Paternity issues ==\n{{Main article|DNA paternity testing}}\nA paternity test is conducted to prove paternity, that is, whether a male is the biological father of another individual. This may be relevant in view of [[Fathers' rights movement|rights]] and duties of the father. Similarly, a maternity test can be carried out. This is less common, because at least during [[childbirth]] and [[pregnancy]], except in the case of a pregnancy involving [[embryo transfer]] or [[egg donation]], it is obvious who the [[mother]] is. However, it is used in a number of events such as legal battles where a person's maternity is challenged, where the mother is uncertain because she has not seen her child for an extended period of time, or where deceased persons need to be identified.\n\nAlthough not constituting completely reliable evidence, several [[List of Mendelian traits in humans|congenital traits]] such as attached [[earlobe]]s, the [[widow's peak]], or the [[cleft chin]], may serve as tentative indicators of (non-) parenthood as they are readily observable and inherited via [[Dominance relationship|autosomal-dominant]] genes.\n\nA more reliable way to ascertain parenthood is via DNA analysis (known as [[genetic fingerprinting]] of individuals, although older methods have included [[blood type|ABO blood group typing]], analysis of various other [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s, or using [[human leukocyte antigen]]s. The current techniques for paternity testing are using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP). For the most part, however, genetic fingerprinting has all but taken over all the other forms of testing.\n\n== Roles and responsibilities ==\n\n=== Guardianship ===\n{{Main article|Legal guardian}}\n\nA legal guardian is a person who has the legal authority (and the corresponding duty) to care for the personal and property interests of another person, called a ward. Guardians are typically used in three situations: guardianship for an incapacitated senior (due to old age or infirmity), guardianship for a minor, and guardianship for developmentally disabled adults.\n\nMost countries and states have laws that provide that the parents of a minor child are the legal guardians of that child, and that the parents can designate who shall become the child's legal guardian in the event of death, subject to the approval of the court. Some jurisdictions allow a parent of a child to exercise the authority of a legal guardian without a formal court appointment. In such circumstances the parent acting in that capacity is called the natural guardian of that parent's child.\n\n=== Parenting ===\n{{Main article|Parenting}}\n\n[[Parenting]] or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the [[physical fitness|physical]], [[emotion]]al, [[Social change|social]], financial, and [[intellectual development]] of a [[child]] from [[infant|infancy]] to [[adult]]hood.

Biological parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet. A [[female]] can also become a parent through [[surrogacy]]. Some parents may be [[Adoption|adoptive]] parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child. [[Orphan]]s without adoptive parents can be raised by their [[grandparent]]s or other [[family member]]s.\n\nA parent can also be elaborated as an [[ancestor]] removed one [[generation]].

The term is generally only used if there is a need to distinguish an individual's parents from their biological parents,  For example, an individual whose father has remarried may call the father's new wife their [[stepmother]] and continue to refer to their mother normally, though someone who has had little or no contact with their biological mother may address their [[foster parent]] as their mother, and their biological mother as such, or perhaps by her first name.,{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Mother ===\n{{main article|Mother}}\nA mother is a female who has a maternal connection with another individual, whether arising from [[Pregnancy|conception]], by giving [[Childbirth|birth]] to, or [[Parenting|raising]] the individual in the role of a parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-mother.html |title=Definition from |publisher=Allwords.com |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> More than one female may have such connections with an individual. Because of the complexity and differences of a mother's social, cultural, and religious definitions and roles, it is challenging to define a mother to suit a universally accepted definition. The utilization of a surrogate mother may result in explication of there being two biological mothers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bromham|first1=David|title=Philosophical Ethics in Reproductive Medicine|date=1990|page=57}}</ref>\n\n=== Father ===\n{{main article|Father}}\nA father is a male parent of any type of offspring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/father |title=TheFreeDictionary |accessdate=2014-10-07}}</ref> It may be the person who shares in the raising of a child or who has provided the biological material, the [[sperm]], which results in the birth of the child.\n\n=== Grandparent ===\n{{main article|Grandparent}}\nGrandparents are the parents of a person's own parent, whether that be a father or a mother. Every sexually reproducing creature who is not a [[genetic chimera]] has a maximum of four [[gene]]tic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents and so on. Rarely, such as in the case of sibling or half-sibling [[incest]], these [[pedigree collapse|numbers are lower]].\n\n== Paternity issues ==\n{{Main article|DNA paternity testing}}\nA paternity test is conducted to prove paternity, that is, whether a male is the biological father of another individual. This may be relevant in view of [[Fathers' rights movement|rights]] and duties of the father. Similarly, a maternity test can be carried out. This is less common, because at least during [[childbirth]] and [[pregnancy]], except in the case of a pregnancy involving [[embryo transfer]] or [[egg donation]], it is obvious who the [[mother]] is. However, it is used in a number of events such as legal battles where a person's maternity is challenged, where the mother is uncertain because she has not seen her child for an extended period of time, or where deceased persons need to be identified.\n\nAlthough not constituting completely reliable evidence, several [[List of Mendelian traits in humans|congenital traits]] such as attached [[earlobe]]s, the [[widow's peak]], or the [[cleft chin]], may serve as tentative indicators of (non-) parenthood as they are readily observable and inherited via [[Dominance relationship|autosomal-dominant]] genes.\n\nA more reliable way to ascertain parenthood is via DNA analysis (known as [[genetic fingerprinting]] of individuals, although older methods have included [[blood type|ABO blood group typing]], analysis of various other [[protein]]s and [[enzyme]]s, or using [[human leukocyte antigen]]s. The current techniques for paternity testing are using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP). For the most part, however, genetic fingerprinting has all but taken over all the other forms of testing.\n\n== Roles and responsibilities ==\n\n=== Guardianship ===\n{{Main article|Legal guardian}}\n\nA legal guardian is a person who has the legal authority (and the corresponding duty) to care for the personal and property interests of another person, called a ward. Guardians are typically used in three situations: guardianship for an incapacitated senior (due to old age or infirmity), guardianship for a minor, and guardianship for developmentally disabled adults.\n\nMost countries and states have laws that provide that the parents of a minor child are the legal guardians of that child, and that the parents can designate who shall become the child's legal guardian in the event of death, subject to the approval of the court. Some jurisdictions allow a parent of a child to exercise the authority of a legal guardian without a formal court appointment. In such circumstances the parent acting in that capacity is called the natural guardian of that parent's child.\n\n=== Parenting ===\n{{Main article|Parenting}}\n\n[[Parenting]] or child rearing is the process of promoting and supporting the [[physical fitness|physical]], [[emotion]]al, [[Social change|social]], financial, and [[intellectual development]] of a [[child]] from [[infant|infancy]] to [[adult]]hood.

The pre-incan towns of Laraos are: Wanllapata, Waqramarka, Wayawmarka and Callawarqui. Sinchimarka is an incan citadel.\n\nIn 1586, being viceroy Don Fernando de Torres of Portugal, the first mayor of Yauyos, Don Diego D\u00e1vila Brice\u00f1o, made the territorial demarcation and formed four parishes or curatos with more than four towns each one, entrusted at the service of the Dominican priests.

In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.\n\nInland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.\n\n== Biodiversity ==\n{{Main|Biodiversity of Albania|Protected areas of Albania|l1=Biodiversity}} \n{{Hatnote|[[File:commons-logo.svg|12px|link=|alt=]] See also: [[commons:Category:Biodiversity of Albania|Biodiversity of Albania]] and [[commons:Category:Protected areas of Albania|Protected areas of Albania]] at [[Wikimedia Commons]]}}\n\n[[File:Butrint Panorama.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Butrint National Park]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]]]\n\n[[Phytogeographically]], Albania is part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] specifically, part of the [[Illyrian Provinces|Illyrian]] province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom|Boreal kingdom]].

In the 10th century, the Tsar Samuil built the fortress and church of [[Achillius of Larissa|St. Achillius]] on an island called Agios Achillios in the Small Prespa Lake, on the Greek side of the border. The biggest island in the Great Prespa Lake, on the side of North Macedonia, is called [[Golem Grad]] (\"Large Town\"), and Snake Island (Zmiski Ostrov). The other island [[Mal Grad]] (\"Small Town\", in Albania) is the site of a ruined 14th century monastery dedicated to [[St. Peter]]. Today, both islands are uninhabited.\n\nBecause Great Prespa Lake sits about 150m above [[Lake Ohrid]], which lies only about {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} (6 miles) to the west, its waters run through underground channels in the [[karst]] and emerge from [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] which feed streams running into Lake Ohrid.<ref>Thomas Wilke, Risto V\u00e4inol\u00e4, Frank Riedel (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqRToWKR8xkC&pg=PA107&dq=prespa+topography&hl=cs&ei=xzB2Tc-HMeXo0gHF-YjqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=prespa%20topography&f=false ''Patterns and Processes of Speciation in Ancient Lakes: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Berlin, Germany, September 4\u20138, 2006 (Developments in Hydrobiology)]'', p. 107, Springer, {{ISBN|1-4020-9581-3}}</ref>\n\nFor many years, the Greek part of the Prespa Lakes region was an underpopulated, military sensitive area which required special permission for outsiders to visit. It saw fierce fighting during the [[Greek Civil War]] and much of the local population subsequently emigrated to escape endemic poverty and political strife. The region remained little developed until the 1970s, when it began to be promoted as a tourist destination. With an abundance of rare fauna and flora, the area was declared a Transnational Park in 2000.  In 1999 the Society for the Protection of Prespa received the [[Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award]] for its conservation efforts regarding the Lake Prespa [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site, and was eventually included on 3 July 2013.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0433\u0440\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440 -17.06.2018, \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0430- (42853678821).jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Zoran Zaev]] and [[Alexis Tsipras]] in [[Ote\u0161evo]], [[North Macedonia]] after signing the Prespa agreement]]\nIn 2018, Great Prespa Lake was the setting for the signing of the [[Prespa Agreement]], intended to resolve the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] by renaming the Republic of Macedonia to [[North Macedonia]].<ref name=\"2018FinalAgreement\">{{cite document|url=http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/symfwnia-aggliko-keimeno.pdf|title=FINAL AGREEMENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DIFFERENCES AS DESCRIBED IN THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 817 (1993) AND 845 (1993), THE TERMINATION OF THE INTERIM ACCORD OF 1995, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES |work=Kathimerini|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>.

The majority of foreign tourism has been clustered around the sister lake, Ohrid, where there are abundant overnight accommodations, restaurants and a lively town center in the summer months. Lake Prespa has subsequently remained somewhat isolated and pastoral, bringing its own special attraction in current times. The area remains pristine, without the hustle and bustle of a tourist town and a distinct lack of concrete and pollution which usually comes with developing tourism. Waterfront developments with sophisticated cafes serving food and drinks such as \"Connect Beach\" in the village of Slivnica, however, are providing a way for visitors to spend the day on the lake in luxury, without impacting on the environment. Companies such ''Prespa Panorama'' based in North Macedonia are leading the development of overnight lodging for the region with a concept of low environmental impact, low volume accommodations in the region. The municipality of Resen has begun construction of a paved walking and biking path that will link the individual villages providing access for a walking or biking tour of the numerous villages that are scattered around the lake. The completed concept will allow individuals to explore the entire south western corner of North Macedonia including Pelister and Galicica, two of the most beautiful and scenic mountain peaks of the region on foot or by bicycle. A descent from Galicica on the western face brings the cyclist or hiker down to the most scenic part of Lake Ohrid, which is separated from Lake Prespa by its massif. Once on the Lake Ohrid side, the springs where the waters of Lake Prespa emerge from under the mountain and drain into Lake Ohrid can be enjoyed.\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Prespa, Lake\".

In the 10th century, the Tsar Samuil built the fortress and church of [[Achillius of Larissa|St. Achillius]] on an island called Agios Achillios in the Small Prespa Lake, on the Greek side of the border. The biggest island in the Great Prespa Lake, on the side of North Macedonia, is called [[Golem Grad]] (\"Large Town\"), and Snake Island (Zmiski Ostrov). The other island [[Mal Grad]] (\"Small Town\", in Albania) is the site of a ruined 14th century monastery dedicated to [[St. Peter]]. Today, both islands are uninhabited.\n\nBecause Great Prespa Lake sits about 150m above [[Lake Ohrid]], which lies only about {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} (6 miles) to the west, its waters run through underground channels in the [[karst]] and emerge from [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] which feed streams running into Lake Ohrid.<ref>Thomas Wilke, Risto V\u00e4inol\u00e4, Frank Riedel (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqRToWKR8xkC&pg=PA107&dq=prespa+topography&hl=cs&ei=xzB2Tc-HMeXo0gHF-YjqBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=prespa%20topography&f=false ''Patterns and Processes of Speciation in Ancient Lakes: Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Speciation in Ancient Lakes, Berlin, Germany, September 4\u20138, 2006 (Developments in Hydrobiology)]'', p. 107, Springer, {{ISBN|1-4020-9581-3}}</ref>\n\nFor many years, the Greek part of the Prespa Lakes region was an underpopulated, military sensitive area which required special permission for outsiders to visit. It saw fierce fighting during the [[Greek Civil War]] and much of the local population subsequently emigrated to escape endemic poverty and political strife. The region remained little developed until the 1970s, when it began to be promoted as a tourist destination. With an abundance of rare fauna and flora, the area was declared a Transnational Park in 2000.  In 1999 the Society for the Protection of Prespa received the [[Ramsar Wetland Conservation Award]] for its conservation efforts regarding the Lake Prespa [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site, and was eventually included on 3 July 2013.\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0433\u0440\u0447\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440 -17.06.2018, \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0430- (42853678821).jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Zoran Zaev]] and [[Alexis Tsipras]] in [[Ote\u0161evo]], [[North Macedonia]] after signing the Prespa agreement]]\nIn 2018, Great Prespa Lake was the setting for the signing of the [[Prespa Agreement]], intended to resolve the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] by renaming the Republic of Macedonia to [[North Macedonia]].<ref name=\"2018FinalAgreement\">{{cite document|url=http://s.kathimerini.gr/resources/article-files/symfwnia-aggliko-keimeno.pdf|title=FINAL AGREEMENT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE DIFFERENCES AS DESCRIBED IN THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 817 (1993) AND 845 (1993), THE TERMINATION OF THE INTERIM ACCORD OF 1995, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES |work=Kathimerini|accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref>.

The majority of foreign tourism has been clustered around the sister lake, Ohrid, where there are abundant overnight accommodations, restaurants and a lively town center in the summer months. Lake Prespa has subsequently remained somewhat isolated and pastoral, bringing its own special attraction in current times. The area remains pristine, without the hustle and bustle of a tourist town and a distinct lack of concrete and pollution which usually comes with developing tourism. Waterfront developments with sophisticated cafes serving food and drinks such as \"Connect Beach\" in the village of Slivnica, however, are providing a way for visitors to spend the day on the lake in luxury, without impacting on the environment. Companies such ''Prespa Panorama'' based in North Macedonia are leading the development of overnight lodging for the region with a concept of low environmental impact, low volume accommodations in the region. The municipality of Resen has begun construction of a paved walking and biking path that will link the individual villages providing access for a walking or biking tour of the numerous villages that are scattered around the lake. The completed concept will allow individuals to explore the entire south western corner of North Macedonia including Pelister and Galicica, two of the most beautiful and scenic mountain peaks of the region on foot or by bicycle. A descent from Galicica on the western face brings the cyclist or hiker down to the most scenic part of Lake Ohrid, which is separated from Lake Prespa by its massif. Once on the Lake Ohrid side, the springs where the waters of Lake Prespa emerge from under the mountain and drain into Lake Ohrid can be enjoyed.\n\n==Sources==\n* \"Prespa, Lake\".

The [[castle]]s and [[fort]]s of the country constitute treasures and legacy of the historic past of Albania. From the early antiquity to the medieval period, they were originally made of earth and wood and later of stone and comes in many styles of architecture and design. The majority of forts have been renovated throughout history and different epochs with changing rule and adaptations to war technology development.\n\n[[Rozafa Castle]] is an ancient castle and one of the most prominent sites in [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. The castle is associated with a famous legend about a woman who was buried in the foundation of the castle. It stretches on a rocky hill and is trapped on three sides by the rivers of [[Bojana (river)|Buna]], Kir and [[Drin (river)|Drin]]. Shkod\u00ebr served in the 4th century BC as the royal capital of the [[Illyrian tribe]]s of the [[Ardiaean Kingdom|Ardiaei]] and [[Labeates]]. During that period, the castle was an Illyrian stronghold until it was captured by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 167 BC. Its current name, Rozafa, appeared for the first time in the early [[Middle Ages]]. Later when the [[Ottomans]] conquered the [[Balkans]] the castle then was turned into a mosque.\n\n[[File:Kalaja e Petreles 02.jpg|210px|thumb|left|[[Petrel\u00eb Castle]] offers views over the [[Erzen river|Erzen Valley]].]]\n\n[[Petrel\u00eb Castle]] is a medieval castle close to [[Tirana]] located on a hilltop overlooking [[Petrel\u00eb]] and [[Erzen river|Erzen Valley]].
