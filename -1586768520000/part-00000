The main problem found is that the sites themselves are evolutionary in nature, in that each successive temple brought with it further refinement to architectural development.\n\nFurthermore, in some cases, later Bronze Age peoples built their own sites over the Neolithic temples, thus adding an element of confusion to early researchers who did not have modern dating technology. [[Themistocles Zammit|Sir Temi \u017bammit]], an eminent Maltese archaeologist of the late nineteenth century, had dated the Neolithic temples to 2800 BC and the Tarxien [[Bronze Age]] culture to 2000 BC.<ref>{{citation| last = Evans | title = Malta.

The first evidence of human habitation in the Neolithic occurred in the G\u0127ar Dalam phase, in c. 5000 BC. The Temple period, from c. 4100 BC to roughly 2500 BC, produced the most notable monumental remains. This period is split into five phases;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} however, the first two of these left mostly pottery shards. The next three phases, starting from the \u0120gantija phase, begins in c. 3600 BC, and the last, the Tarxien phase, ends in c. 2500 BC.\n\n====\u0120gantija phase (3600\u20133200 BC)====\n\nThe [[\u0120gantija phase]] is named after the [[\u0120gantija]] site in [[Gozo]]. It represents an important development in the cultural evolution of neolithic man on the islands. To this date belong the earliest datable temples and the first two, if not three, of the stages of development in their ground plan: the lobed or kidney-shaped plan found in [[M\u0121arr]] east, the trefoil plan evident in Skorba, Kordin and various minor sites, and the five-apsed plan \u0120gantija South, Tarxien East.<ref>{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia| title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 55}}</ref>\n\n====Saflieni phase (3300\u20133000 BC)====\n\nThe [[Saflieni phase]] constitutes a transitional phase between two major periods of development.<ref>{{citation| last = Bonanno | title = An illustrated guide to prehistoric Gozo |page = 14}}</ref> Its name derives from the site of the [[\u0126al-Saflieni Hypogeum|Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni]].This period carried forward the same characteristics of the \u0120gantija pottery shapes, but it also introduces new biconical bowls.<ref>{{citation | last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |pages = 223\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n====Tarxien phase (3150\u20132500 BC)====\n[[File:Malta Hal Tarxien BW 2011-10-04 12-42-32.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|An altar in the [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien temple complex]] ]]\nThe [[Tarxien phase]] marks the peak of the temple civilisation. This phase is named after the temple-complex at Tarxien, a couple of kilometres inland from the [[Grand Harbour]]. To it belong the last two stages in the development of the temple plan. The western temple at \u0120gantija represents, along with other units in Tarxien, \u0126a\u0121ar Qim and L-Imnajdra, the penultimate stage in development, that is, the introduction of a shallow niche instead of an apse at the far end of the temple. The final stage is testified in only one temple, the central unit at Tarxien, with its three symmetrical pairs of apses.<ref>{{citation | last = Bonanno | title = An illustrated guide to prehistoric Gozo |pages = 14\u201315}}</ref> The Temple culture reached its climax in this period, both in terms of the craftsmanship of pottery, as well as in sculptural decoration, both free-standing and in relief.<ref>{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 72}}</ref>\n\nSpiral reliefs resembling those at Tarxien once adorned the \u0120gantija temples, but have faded to a level where they are only clearly recognisable in a series of drawings made by the artist [[Charles de Brochtorff]] in 1829, immediately after the temples' excavation.<ref>{{citation| last = Bonanno | title = An illustrated guide to prehistoric Gozo |page = 15}}</ref> The Tarxien phase is characterised by a rich variety of [[pottery]] forms and decorative techniques. Most shapes tend to be angular, with almost no handles or lugs. The [[clay]] tends to be well prepared and fired very hard, while the surface of the scratched ware is also highly polished. This scratched decoration remains standard, but it becomes more elaborate and elegant, the most popular motif being a kind of [[volute]].<ref>{{citation | last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |pages = 226\u2013232}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture and construction==\n[[File:Kordin III Temple Malta.png|thumb|Part of the Kordin III Temple site, with a two-apse design]]\n\nThe Maltese temple complexes were built in different locations, and over a wide span of years; while each individual site has its unique characteristics, they all share a common architecture. The approach to the temples lies on an oval [[forecourt]], levelled by terracing if the terrain is sloping. The forecourt is bounded on one side by the temples' own [[Facade|fa\u00e7ades]], which faces south or south-east. The monuments' fa\u00e7ades and internal walls are made up of [[orthostat]]s, a row of large stone slabs laid on end.<ref>{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 69}}</ref>\n\nThe centre of the fa\u00e7ades is usually interrupted by an entrance doorway forming a ''[[trilithon]]'', a pair of orthostats surmounted by a massive [[lintel]] slab.<ref name=\"autogenerated58\">{{citation| last = \u017bammit, Mayrhofer| title = The Prehistoric Temples of Malta and Gozo |page = 58}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Malta |url=http://www.sacredsites.com/europe/malta/temples_malta.html |accessdate=2008-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214103128/http://www.sacredsites.com/europe/malta/temples_malta.html |archivedate=2006-12-14 }}</ref> Further trilithons form a passage, which is always paved in stone. This in turn opens onto an open space, which then gives way to the next element, a pair of D-shaped chambers, usually referred to as '[[apse]]s', opening on both sides of the passage. The space between the apses' walls and the external boundary wall is usually filled with loose stones and earth, sometimes containing cultural debris including [[pottery]] shards.<ref name=\"autogenerated71\">{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 71}}</ref>\n\nThe main variation in the temples lies in the number of apses found; this may vary to three, four, five or six. If three, they open directly from the central court in a [[trefoil]] fashion.<ref>{{citation| last = \u017bammit, Mayrhofer| title = The Prehistoric Temples of Malta and Gozo |page = 52}}</ref> In cases of more complex temples, a second axial passage is built, using the same trilithon construction, leading from the first set of apses into another later pair, and either a fifth central or a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] giving the four or five apsial form. In one case, at the Tarxien central temple, the fifth apse or niche is replaced by a further passage, leading to a final pair of apses, making six in all.<ref>{{citation| last = \u017bammit, Mayrhofer| title = The Prehistoric Temples of Malta and Gozo |page = 99}}</ref> With the standard temple plan, found in some thirty temples across the islands, there is a certain amount of variation both in the number of apses, and in the overall length\u2014ranging from 6.5m in the Mnajdra east temple to 23m in the six-apsed Tarxien central temple.\n\nThe external walls were usually built of [[coralline limestone]], which is harder than the globigerina limestone used in the internal sections of the temples.<ref name=\"autogenerated71\"/><ref>Cassar, Joann (2010).

The main problem found is that the sites themselves are evolutionary in nature, in that each successive temple brought with it further refinement to architectural development.\n\nFurthermore, in some cases, later Bronze Age peoples built their own sites over the Neolithic temples, thus adding an element of confusion to early researchers who did not have modern dating technology. [[Themistocles Zammit|Sir Temi \u017bammit]], an eminent Maltese archaeologist of the late nineteenth century, had dated the Neolithic temples to 2800 BC and the Tarxien [[Bronze Age]] culture to 2000 BC.<ref>{{citation| last = Evans | title = Malta.

The first evidence of human habitation in the Neolithic occurred in the G\u0127ar Dalam phase, in c. 5000 BC. The Temple period, from c. 4100 BC to roughly 2500 BC, produced the most notable monumental remains. This period is split into five phases;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} however, the first two of these left mostly pottery shards. The next three phases, starting from the \u0120gantija phase, begins in c. 3600 BC, and the last, the Tarxien phase, ends in c. 2500 BC.\n\n====\u0120gantija phase (3600\u20133200 BC)====\n\nThe [[\u0120gantija phase]] is named after the [[\u0120gantija]] site in [[Gozo]]. It represents an important development in the cultural evolution of neolithic man on the islands. To this date belong the earliest datable temples and the first two, if not three, of the stages of development in their ground plan: the lobed or kidney-shaped plan found in [[M\u0121arr]] east, the trefoil plan evident in Skorba, Kordin and various minor sites, and the five-apsed plan \u0120gantija South, Tarxien East.<ref>{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia| title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 55}}</ref>\n\n====Saflieni phase (3300\u20133000 BC)====\n\nThe [[Saflieni phase]] constitutes a transitional phase between two major periods of development.<ref>{{citation| last = Bonanno | title = An illustrated guide to prehistoric Gozo |page = 14}}</ref> Its name derives from the site of the [[\u0126al-Saflieni Hypogeum|Hypogeum of \u0126al-Saflieni]].This period carried forward the same characteristics of the \u0120gantija pottery shapes, but it also introduces new biconical bowls.<ref>{{citation | last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |pages = 223\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n====Tarxien phase (3150\u20132500 BC)====\n[[File:Malta Hal Tarxien BW 2011-10-04 12-42-32.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|An altar in the [[Tarxien Temples|Tarxien temple complex]] ]]\nThe [[Tarxien phase]] marks the peak of the temple civilisation. This phase is named after the temple-complex at Tarxien, a couple of kilometres inland from the [[Grand Harbour]]. To it belong the last two stages in the development of the temple plan. The western temple at \u0120gantija represents, along with other units in Tarxien, \u0126a\u0121ar Qim and L-Imnajdra, the penultimate stage in development, that is, the introduction of a shallow niche instead of an apse at the far end of the temple. The final stage is testified in only one temple, the central unit at Tarxien, with its three symmetrical pairs of apses.<ref>{{citation | last = Bonanno | title = An illustrated guide to prehistoric Gozo |pages = 14\u201315}}</ref> The Temple culture reached its climax in this period, both in terms of the craftsmanship of pottery, as well as in sculptural decoration, both free-standing and in relief.<ref>{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 72}}</ref>\n\nSpiral reliefs resembling those at Tarxien once adorned the \u0120gantija temples, but have faded to a level where they are only clearly recognisable in a series of drawings made by the artist [[Charles de Brochtorff]] in 1829, immediately after the temples' excavation.<ref>{{citation| last = Bonanno | title = An illustrated guide to prehistoric Gozo |page = 15}}</ref> The Tarxien phase is characterised by a rich variety of [[pottery]] forms and decorative techniques. Most shapes tend to be angular, with almost no handles or lugs. The [[clay]] tends to be well prepared and fired very hard, while the surface of the scratched ware is also highly polished. This scratched decoration remains standard, but it becomes more elaborate and elegant, the most popular motif being a kind of [[volute]].<ref>{{citation | last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |pages = 226\u2013232}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture and construction==\n[[File:Kordin III Temple Malta.png|thumb|Part of the Kordin III Temple site, with a two-apse design]]\n\nThe Maltese temple complexes were built in different locations, and over a wide span of years; while each individual site has its unique characteristics, they all share a common architecture. The approach to the temples lies on an oval [[forecourt]], levelled by terracing if the terrain is sloping. The forecourt is bounded on one side by the temples' own [[Facade|fa\u00e7ades]], which faces south or south-east. The monuments' fa\u00e7ades and internal walls are made up of [[orthostat]]s, a row of large stone slabs laid on end.<ref>{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 69}}</ref>\n\nThe centre of the fa\u00e7ades is usually interrupted by an entrance doorway forming a ''[[trilithon]]'', a pair of orthostats surmounted by a massive [[lintel]] slab.<ref name=\"autogenerated58\">{{citation| last = \u017bammit, Mayrhofer| title = The Prehistoric Temples of Malta and Gozo |page = 58}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Malta |url=http://www.sacredsites.com/europe/malta/temples_malta.html |accessdate=2008-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214103128/http://www.sacredsites.com/europe/malta/temples_malta.html |archivedate=2006-12-14 }}</ref> Further trilithons form a passage, which is always paved in stone. This in turn opens onto an open space, which then gives way to the next element, a pair of D-shaped chambers, usually referred to as '[[apse]]s', opening on both sides of the passage. The space between the apses' walls and the external boundary wall is usually filled with loose stones and earth, sometimes containing cultural debris including [[pottery]] shards.<ref name=\"autogenerated71\">{{citation| last = Trump, Cilia | title = Malta Prehistory and Temples |page = 71}}</ref>\n\nThe main variation in the temples lies in the number of apses found; this may vary to three, four, five or six. If three, they open directly from the central court in a [[trefoil]] fashion.<ref>{{citation| last = \u017bammit, Mayrhofer| title = The Prehistoric Temples of Malta and Gozo |page = 52}}</ref> In cases of more complex temples, a second axial passage is built, using the same trilithon construction, leading from the first set of apses into another later pair, and either a fifth central or a [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] giving the four or five apsial form. In one case, at the Tarxien central temple, the fifth apse or niche is replaced by a further passage, leading to a final pair of apses, making six in all.<ref>{{citation| last = \u017bammit, Mayrhofer| title = The Prehistoric Temples of Malta and Gozo |page = 99}}</ref> With the standard temple plan, found in some thirty temples across the islands, there is a certain amount of variation both in the number of apses, and in the overall length\u2014ranging from 6.5m in the Mnajdra east temple to 23m in the six-apsed Tarxien central temple.\n\nThe external walls were usually built of [[coralline limestone]], which is harder than the globigerina limestone used in the internal sections of the temples.<ref name=\"autogenerated71\"/><ref>Cassar, Joann (2010).

The last part is designed to create a deterrent against future voting rights violations. Under the new formula states with five violations of federal law to their voting changes over the past fifteen years will have to submit future election changes for federal approval. Local jurisdictions would be covered if they commit three or more violations or have one violation and \"persistent, extremely low minority turnout\" over the past fifteen years. While Voter ID laws can still be blocked by the Department of Justice in the new states covered under Section 4, objections to voter ID laws by the department will not count as a new violation.\n# Section 3 of the bill makes it possible that a court may order jurisdictions not covered by Section 4 to have future changes to its election laws preapproved by the federal government after plaintiffs file a corresponding application with the court. Plaintiffs have to show evidence of intentional voting discrimination to enable such a bail-in.

Under the law, Texas voters must show a photo ID to vote. While there are some exemptions, such as for voters with disabilities, most are required to produce a Texas driver's license or state ID card. Other forms of acceptable ID include concealed handgun licenses, military ID, U.S. citizenship papers with photo and a U.S. passport.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Langford|first1=Terri|title=Criminal Appeals Court Judge Files Suit Over Voter ID |url=http://www.texastribune.org/2014/10/02/criminal-appeals-court-judge-files-voter-id-lawsui/|accessdate=2 July 2015|work=The Texas Tribune|date=October 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIf the voter does not possess one of the forms of acceptable photo ID and cannot reasonably obtain one, the voter may present one of the following, after which he or she must execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration:<ref>http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/pol-sub/reasonable-impediment-declaration.pdf</ref> a copy or original of a government document that shows the voter's name and an address, including the voter's voter registration certificate; a current utility bill; a bank statement; a government check; a paycheck; or (a) a certified domestic (from a U.S. state or territory) birth certificate or (b) a document confirming birth admissible in a court of law which establishes the voter's identity (which may include a foreign birth document).<ref>http://www.votetexas.gov/register-to-vote/need-id.html|Required Identification for Voting in Person</ref>\n\nCritics of the law{{who?|date=September 2018}} charge that it is unconstitutional.

The last part is designed to create a deterrent against future voting rights violations. Under the new formula states with five violations of federal law to their voting changes over the past fifteen years will have to submit future election changes for federal approval. Local jurisdictions would be covered if they commit three or more violations or have one violation and \"persistent, extremely low minority turnout\" over the past fifteen years. While Voter ID laws can still be blocked by the Department of Justice in the new states covered under Section 4, objections to voter ID laws by the department will not count as a new violation.\n# Section 3 of the bill makes it possible that a court may order jurisdictions not covered by Section 4 to have future changes to its election laws preapproved by the federal government after plaintiffs file a corresponding application with the court. Plaintiffs have to show evidence of intentional voting discrimination to enable such a bail-in. Any violation of the VRA or of federal voting rights law\u2014whether intentional or not\u2014can be under the new section 3 proposal grounds for a bail-in, but court objections to voter ID laws that are not found to be intentionally discriminatory cannot be used as grounds for \"bail-in\" under Section 3.\n# Jurisdictions in all U.S. states have to provide notice in the local media and online of any election procedures related to redistricting, changes within 180 days of a federal election and the moving of a polling place. Citizens can thus easier identify potentially harmful voting changes in states not subject to Sections 4 and 5 of the VRA.\n# Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction against a potentially discriminatory voting law must only show that the hardship to them outweighs the hardship to the state if a law is blocked in court pending a full trial.\n# Affirming the attorney general's authority to send federal observers in states subject to Section 4 to monitor elections in these states the proposal expands the attorney general's authority to send observers to jurisdictions with a history of discriminating against language minority groups.\n\nAs of June 2014 the proposed Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2014 was in limbo because there is no widespread support to amend the Voting Rights Act as it was by its re-authorization in 2006 by Congress.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fuller|first1=Jaime|title=Republicans used to unanimously back the Voting Rights Act.
