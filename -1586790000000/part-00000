Edo was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[\u014cta D\u014dkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |last=McClain, James|first=James |year=1994 |page=13 |isbn=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> But Edo was Tokugawa's home and was not [[capital of Japan]].

During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the ''Pax Tokugawa'', and in the presence of such peace, Edo adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |pages=33, 55 |isbn=}}</ref> The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city. However, this prolonged period of seclusion came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] and [[Hakodate]], leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History|last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |pages=182\u2013183 |isbn=}}</ref> Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |page=186 |isbn=}}</ref> Meanwhile, supporters of the Meiji Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'', Yoshinobu, in 1867.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |page=188 |isbn=}}</ref> After 265 years, the ''Pax Tokugawa'' came to an end. {{wide image|'Kidai Shoran', Japanese handscroll c. 1805.jpg|4000px|{{Nihongo|Kidai Sh\u014dran|\u7188\u4ee3\u52dd\u89a7}}, 1805.

Edo was first fortified by the [[Edo clan]], in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[\u014cta D\u014dkan]] built [[Edo Castle]]. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was transferred from [[Mikawa Province]] (his lifelong base) to [[Kant\u014d region]]. When he became ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent [[Edo period]], Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |last=McClain, James|first=James |year=1994 |page=13 |isbn=|display-authors=etal}}</ref> But Edo was Tokugawa's home and was not [[capital of Japan]].

During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the ''Pax Tokugawa'', and in the presence of such peace, Edo adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |pages=33, 55 |isbn=}}</ref> The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city. However, this prolonged period of seclusion came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] and [[Hakodate]], leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History|last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |pages=182\u2013183 |isbn=}}</ref> Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |page=186 |isbn=}}</ref> Meanwhile, supporters of the Meiji Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa ''sh\u014dgun'', Yoshinobu, in 1867.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Nait\u014d |first=Akira |year=2003 |page=188 |isbn=}}</ref> After 265 years, the ''Pax Tokugawa'' came to an end. {{wide image|'Kidai Shoran', Japanese handscroll c. 1805.jpg|4000px|{{Nihongo|Kidai Sh\u014dran|\u7188\u4ee3\u52dd\u89a7}}, 1805.

To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.<ref>\n[http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm The Structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208194646/http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview06.htm |date=December 8, 2014 }}  (Tokyo government webpage)\n</ref>\n\nThe special wards of Tokyo are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"810px\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | Special Wards of Tokyo\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Place Name\n!\n!Map of the Special Wards\n|-\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Romanization of Japanese|R\u014dmaji]]\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Kanji]]\n!Color\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" \"width: 20px;\" | 1\n|[[Adachi, Tokyo|Adachi]]\n|\u8db3\u7acb\u533a\n|Red\n| rowspan=\"23\" |[[File:Tokyo special wards map.svg|alt=|border|center|399x399px|A map of Tokyo's Special Wards]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2\n|[[Arakawa, Tokyo|Arakawa]]\n| \u8352\u5ddd\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|[[Bunky\u014d|Bunkyo]]\n| \u6587\u4eac\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 4\n|[[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]]\n| \u5343\u4ee3\u7530\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 5\n|[[Ch\u016b\u014d, Tokyo|Ch\u016b\u014d]]\n| \u4e2d\u592e\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 6\n|[[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa]]\n| \u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|[[Itabashi]]\n| \u677f\u6a4b\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 8\n|[[Katsushika]]\n| \u845b\u98fe\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9\n|[[Kita, Tokyo|Kita]]\n|\u5317\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 10\n|[[K\u014dt\u014d]]\n|\u6c5f\u6771\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|11\n|[[Meguro]]\n|\u76ee\u9ed2\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n|12\n|[[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]\n|\u6e2f\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|13\n|[[Nakano, Tokyo|Nakano]]\n|\u4e2d\u91ce\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|14\n|[[Nerima]]\n|\u7df4\u99ac\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|15\n|[[\u014cta, Tokyo|\u014cta]]\n|\u5927\u7530\u533a\n|Yellow\n|-\n|16\n|[[Setagaya]]\n|\u4e16\u7530\u8c37\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|17\n|[[Shibuya]]\n|\u6e0b\u8c37\u533a\n|Red\n|-\n|18\n|[[Shinagawa]]\n|\u54c1\u5ddd\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|19\n|[[Shinjuku]]\n|\u65b0\u5bbf\u533a\n|Green\n|-\n|20\n|[[Suginami]]\n|\u6749\u4e26\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n|21\n|[[Sumida, Tokyo|Sumida]]\n|\u58a8\u7530\u533a\n|Orange\n|-\n|22\n|[[Tait\u014d]]\n|\u53f0\u6771\u533a\n|Red\n|-\n|23\n|[[Toshima]]\n|\u8c4a\u5cf6\u533a\n|Red\n|}\n\n\nThe \"three central wards\" of Tokyo \u2013 Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d and Minato \u2013 are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.<ref>[http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview03.htm The Population of Tokyo \u2013 Tokyo Metropolitan Government] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223114634/http://www.metro.tokyo.jp/ENGLISH/PROFILE/overview03.htm |date=December 23, 2008}} (Retrieved on July 4, 2009)</ref> Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former [[Tokyo City]], yet is one of the least populated wards.

While it is true that the company has neither lost a [[Jet aircraft|jet airliner]] nor had any jet fatalities, it had eight fatal accidents and an aircraft shot down between 1927 and 1945, with the loss of 63&nbsp;people. Half of these accidents and the shoot-down occurred during World War&nbsp;II, when the Qantas aircraft were operating on behalf of Allied military forces. Post-war, it lost another four aircraft (one was owned by BOAC and operated by Qantas in a pooling arrangement) with a total of 21 people killed.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor. Construction began in June 2013 and was completed in December 2017.\n\n===Timeline of service expansion===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Segment description\n!Date opened\n!Station(s)\n!# of new stations\n!Length (km)\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 1\n|{{date|2004-7-28}}\n|Zongguan \u2014 Huangpu Road\n|10{{NoteTag|in which Taipingyang Station was postponed to open on {{date|2006-4-8}}.}}\n|9.769\n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 1\n|{{date|2010-7-29}}\n| Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Zongguan;<br> Huangpu Road \u2014 Dijiao\n|16{{NoteTag|in which Zhuyehai Station was postponed to open on {{date|2014-9-17}}.<ref>[http://qzgh.qiaokou.gov.cn/qkxw/bmdt/201409/t20140917_139172.shtml \u8f7b\u8f68\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9\u5b9c\u5bb6\u8054\u5eca\u6865\u6295\u5165\u4f7f\u7528 (Zhuyehai station opened)]</ref>}}\n|18.494\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 2\n|{{date|2012-12-28}}\n| Jinyintan \u2014 Optics Valley Square\n|21\n|27.152\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 4<ref>[http://cjweek.cjn.cn/html/2013-12/27/content_5269051.htm Section one of Metro Line 4 opens]</ref>\n|{{date|2013-12-28}}\n| Wuchang Railway Station \u2014 Wuhan Railway Station\n|15\n|17.974\n|-\n|Hankou North extension of Line 1\n|{{date|2014-5-28}}\n|  Dijiao \u2014 Hankou North\n|3\n|5.555 \n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 4\n|{{date|2014-12-28}}\n| Huangjinkou \u2014 Wuchang Railway Station\n|13\n|15.429\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 3<ref name=\"Line 3\">{{cite news|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5373\u5c06\u5730\u94c1\u6210\u73af \"\u73af\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\"\u91cd\u6784\u5546\u4e1a\u5730\u7406  |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/house/wh/2015-12/24/c_1117562445.htm |work=\u957f\u6c5f\u65e5\u62a5 |language=Chinese |date=2015-12-24 |accessdate=2015-12-24 }}</ref>\n|{{date|2015-12-28}}\n|Zhuanyang Boulevard \u2014 Hongtu Boulevard\t\n|24\n|29.660\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 6\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2016-12-28}}<ref name=\"\u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\">[http://tech.cnr.cn/techgd/20161228/t20161228_523405232.shtml  \u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6]</ref>\n|Jinyinhu Park \u2014 Dongfeng Motor Corporation\t\n|27\n|35.512\n|-\n|Northern extension of Line 2{{NoteTag|also known as Airport Line }}\n|Tianhe International Airport \u2014 Jinyintan\t\n|7\n|19.957\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 8\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{date|2017-12-26}}\n|Jintan Road \u2014 Liyuan\t\n|12\n|16.204\n|-\n|Yangluo Line\n|Houhu Boulevard \u2014 Jintai\n|16\n|34.575\n|-\n|Jinghe extension of Line 1\n|Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Jinghe\n|3\n|4.118\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 7\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2018-10-1}}<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20181001/003195.htm#p=1|website=www.xinhuanet.com|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u957f\u6c5f\u516c\u94c1\u96a7\u9053\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a 7\u53f7\u7ebf\u300111\u53f7\u7ebf\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>\n|Garden Expo North \u2014 Yezhihu\n|19\n|30.413\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 11\n|Optics Valley Railway Station \u2014 Zuoling\n|13\n|18.744\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 7\n|{{date|2018-12-28}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Qinglongshan Ditiexiaozhen\n|7\n|16.550\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 2\n|{{date|2019-2-19}}\n|Optics Valley Square \u2014 Fozuling\n|10\n|13.195\n|-\n|Wsetern extension of Line 4<ref name=cjn201909>{{cite web|url=http://news.cjn.cn/sywh/201909/t3460424.htm|title=\u5b9a\u4e86\uff01\u5730\u94c1\u8521\u7538\u7ebf25\u65e5\u4e0a\u53489\u65f6\u5f00\u901a|date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-9-25}}\n|Bailin \u2014 Huangjinkou\n|9\n|16.288\n|-\n|Phase \u2162 of Line 8<ref name=Wuhan8-3>{{cite web|url=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3LnB6Rl_lBp71IWU5fBITA|title=\u660e\u65e59\u70b9\uff0c\u6b66\u6c49\u8f68\u9053\u4ea4\u901a8\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e09\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f00\u901a\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|work=Wuhan Metro Operation|date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-11-6}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Military Athletes' Village\n|3\n|4.832\n|}\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==Lines==\n{{center|[[File:Wuhan Metro System Map.svg|750px]]}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"100\" style=\"width:450px; \"|Current system\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"text\"|Line Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\"|Termini\n!

He is widely considered as one of the greatest players of all time. His dark [[widow's peak]] and sharp-toothed grin earned him the nickname \"[[Dracula]]\".\n\nReardon was world champion in [[1970 World Snooker Championship|1970]], [[1973 World Snooker Championship|1973]], [[1974 World Snooker Championship|1974]], [[1975 World Snooker Championship|1975]], [[1976 World Snooker Championship|1976]] and [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]], and was world runner-up in [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. In 1969 he became the inaugural winner of [[Pot Black]]. Reardon was snooker's first dominant force of the modern era and was the first number one ranked player, when rankings were introduced in the [[Snooker world rankings 1976/1977|1976/77]] season \u2014 holding that spot for the next five years. His dominance during the 1970s prefigured that of [[Steve Davis]] in the 1980s and [[Stephen Hendry]] in 1990s. He regained the number one ranking in [[Snooker world rankings 1982/1983|1982]], but thereafter his form declined, and he dropped out of the elite top-16 ranked players after the [[Snooker season 1986/1987|1986/87]] season. He retired from the professional game in 1992. \n\nReardon remained one of snooker's top players into his 50s, and thus set a number of records which still stand. He is snooker's oldest world champion (in 1978, aged 45 years and 203 days), the oldest player to win a ranking event (in 1982, 50 years and 14 days), and the oldest player to hold the number one ranking (1982, 50 years old). Reardon also worked with [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] in a coaching role, helping him to win the [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004 World Championship]] title.\n\n==Early life==\nReardon was born on 8 October 1932, in the [[coal mining]] community of [[Tredegar]] in Monmouthshire.<ref name=\"then and now\"/> Wanting to play snooker, he turned down a place at a [[grammar School]] to become a miner at Ty Trist Colliery, aged 14, following in the footsteps of his father. After a rockfall in which he was buried for three hours, he quit mining and became a [[police officer]] when his family moved to [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]].<ref>http://www.rileys.co.uk/blog/from-tredegar-to-the-green-baize-ray-reardon/</ref><ref>http://www.bioeddie.co.uk/ebbw-vale/famousperson.php?recordID=30</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nAged 15, Reardon beat fellow Welshman Jack Cowey in the British youth championship. Having won the Welsh amateur title from 1950\u20131955, Reardon failed to win the English title when he entered the event in 1956 and 1957. Finally upon re-entering the 1964 event, he won the English Amateur title, defeating [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] 11\u20138 in the final. This victory led to an invitation to tour [[South Africa]]. This proved to be so successful that Reardon was offered the chance to tour it again as a professional. On the back of this, Reardon resigned as a policeman and turned professional in 1967.<ref>Reardon, Ray., Enjoying Snooker, St Michael Press, 1986, p15.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nReardon's first appearance at the World Championship was in [[World Snooker Championship 1969|1969]], and he won his first title the [[World Snooker Championship 1970|following year]], beating [[John Pulman]] 37\u201333 in London. After winning the title, Reardon was in big demand for exhibitions and on the holiday camp circuit. Winning the first ever ''[[Pot Black]]'' in 1969 made him instantly recognisable; Reardon and John Spencer were the first to capitalise on the snooker boom in the early 1970s.<ref>https://www.rkgsnooker.com/player/player-profile/ray-reardon/token-292</ref>\n\n== Entertainer ==\nReardon also became popular because he added a touch of humour and entertainment to his game. Considered a deadly long potter and tactician in his prime, he played seventeen World Championship matches without defeat and won the title four years in succession. He won his second in [[World Snooker Championship 1973|1973]] in [[Manchester]] when he beat Eddie Charlton 38\u201332, after defeating John Spencer 23\u201322 in the semi-finals.\n\nReardon beat [[Graham Miles]] the [[World Snooker Championship 1974|following year]], and in [[World Snooker Championship 1975|1975]], when it was held in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], he had a tough quarter-final with Spencer which he won 19\u201317. He then beat [[Alex Higgins]] 19\u201314 before meeting local hero [[Eddie Charlton]] in the final. Reardon initially trailed by 29 frames to 23, putting Charlton two frames away from the title, but Reardon then won seven consecutive frames to lead 30\u201329. Charlton took the sixtieth frame to tie the match but Reardon took the vital sixty-first and won his fourth title.\n\nIn January 1976, Reardon appeared on ''[[This is Your Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/ray_reardon.html |title=Ray Reardon |publisher=Bigredbook.info |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref> He had been suggested as a candidate for the programme by ''Snooker Scene'' editor, [[Clive Everton]]. The snooker playing fraternity was represented by Alex Higgins, John Pulman, [[Jackie Rea]], Graham Miles, John Spencer, Eddie Charlton, Cliff Thorburn and female professional [[Joyce Gardner]].<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, February 1976, pp16-17.</ref>\n\nReardon won his fifth title the [[World Snooker Championship 1976|next year]] in Manchester, beating Alex Higgins 27\u201316. Earlier that year, he had won the [[1976 Masters (snooker)|Benson and Hedges Masters]] in London, his second snooker title after the World Championship. In this event Reardon defeated John Pulman in the quarter-final 4\u20131, in a match where the highest break was only 22 (by Pulman). Reardon improved his form in the semi-final to defeat Eddie Charlton 5\u20134 and Graham Miles 7\u20133 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.), Snooker Scene, March 1976, pp16-17.</ref> Reardon would never win the event again but defeated Rex Williams 4\u20131 and Graham Miles 5\u20132 in the 1977 event only to lose 7\u20136 to Doug Mountjoy in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, March 1977, pp17-19.</ref>\n\nReardon's unbeaten run at the World Championship ended at the first Crucible championship in [[World Snooker Championship 1977|1977]], when he lost to John Spencer in the quarter-finals 6\u201313, his first defeat since [[Rex Williams]] in [[World Snooker Championship 1972|1972]].\n\nReardon regained the title in [[World Snooker Championship 1978|1978]] winning it for the sixth and final time by beating [[Doug Mountjoy]] 13\u20139 (after trailing 7\u20132), [[Bill Werbeniuk]] 13\u20136, [[Eddie Charlton]] 18\u201314 and finally [[Perrie Mans]] 25\u201318 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1978, pp9, 11, 16/17.</ref> Reardon remains the oldest winner of the World Championship at the age of 45 years and 6 months. Straight after this Reardon regained the [[Pontins Professional]] title, defeating John Spencer 7\u20132 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1978, p20. Reardon won \u00a31500.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of 1978 Reardon beat [[Patsy Fagan]] 6\u20131 and Alex Higgins 11\u20139 in a high quality final to win the one-off 'Champion of Champions' event sponsored by the [[Daily Mirror]] and held at the Wembley Conference Centre.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, December 1978, p7.</ref>\n\n1979 saw Reardon regain his ''Pot Black'' title by defeating [[Doug Mountjoy]] 2\u20131 in the final. It was Reardon's first win since he won the inaugural event in 1969, although he was runner up in 1970, 1972 and 1980.<ref>Perrin, Reg., Pot Black, BBC Books, 1983, pp21/22.</ref> That same year Reardon joined Mountjoy and then World Champion Terry Griffiths, to win the first 'World Challenge Cup' for Wales, defeating England (Fred Davis, John Spencer and Graham Miles) easily 14\u20133 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, December 1979, p9.</ref>\n\n== Indian summer ==\nAfter Reardon's sixth world title he remained one of the world's best players for some years. He lost to [[Dennis Taylor]] in the 1979 quarter-final, and by [[David Taylor (snooker player)|David Taylor]] at the same stage in 1980. He went a step further in 1981, beating John Spencer 13\u201311 and Bill Werbeniuk 13\u201310 before being surprisingly beaten by fellow Welshman Doug Mountjoy in the semi-finals in what was Mountjoy's best ever World Championship performance. Mountjoy scored a championship record break of 145 during the match, which he won 16\u201310.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1981, pp10/11, 13 & 15.</ref>\n\nIt was the rise of Steve Davis in 1980\u201381 that saw Reardon and his generation lose their grip on the game. However, despite Davis' domination between late 1980 and the spring of 1982, Reardon remained a major force in the game. At 49, he reached the World final in [[World Snooker Championship 1982|1982]], losing to Alex Higgins 15\u201318.\n\nFor the 1982/3 season Reardon returned to number one in the world rankings, which in those days were based only on performances at the World Championships over previous years. His career went through an [[Indian summer]]. He won the Players Professional Tournament in late 1982, beating Jimmy White 10\u20135 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, November 1982, p22.</ref>, reached the final of the [[Masters (snooker)|Benson & Hedges Masters]], losing 7\u20139 to [[Cliff Thorburn]], and went on to win the [[1983 International Masters]], where he beat Steve Davis 2\u20131 in the semi-final group stages, before defeating [[Jimmy White]] 9\u20136 in the final, having trailed 5\u20133.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.) Snooker Scene, April 1983, p9.</ref> Reardon also regained the [[1983 Welsh Professional Championship|Welsh Professional Title]], hammering Terry Griffiths 9\u20134 and Doug Mountjoy 9\u20131 in the semi final and final respectively.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, April 1983, p 12/13.</ref> This led him to be fancied in some quarters for that year's World Championship, but he suffered his earliest ever defeat in the competition, losing 13\u201312 in a high-quality second round match to [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]].\n\nReardon also whitewashed Steve Davis twice during the latter's prime; firstly, 6\u20130 in the [[1982 Highland Masters]] semi-final (an event Reardon went on to win)<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, pp29 and 33. Reardon replaced Cliff Thorburn as world number one, Steve Davis was ranked fourth that year.</ref> and secondly in 1988 (see below). Reardon reached the semi-finals of the World Championships once more, in 1985 (losing 16\u20135 to Davis). He last played at the Crucible in [[World Snooker Championship 1987|1987]], losing to Steve Davis again in the second round.\n\n== World Number One ==\nWhen the [[snooker world rankings]] were introduced in 1976, Reardon was the first number one, retaining that position until [[Snooker world rankings 1981/1982|1981/1982]].<ref name=\"then and now\"/> His win in the 1982 [[Totesport Grand Prix|Professional Players Tournament]] at the age of 50 led to his recapturing the world number one position in the first set of rankings to be calculated on tournaments other than the World Championship.\n\nReardon remains the oldest player, at 50, ever to win a ranking tournament.  He has also won the [[World Cup (snooker)|State Express World Team Classic]] for [[Wales]] during the first two years of the tournament in 1979 and 1980 with Mountjoy and [[Terry Griffiths]]. He also won the [[Welsh Professional Championship]] in [[1981 Welsh Professional Championship|1981]] and [[1983 Welsh Professional Championship|1983]]. His last final was the 1985 [[World Doubles Championship (snooker)|World Doubles]] when he partnered Tony Jones and lost to [[Steve Davis]] and [[Tony Meo]] 5\u201312. He was awarded the MBE in the same year.\n\n==Retirement and later years==\nReardon developed eyesight problems and started wearing '[[Dennis Taylor]]-style' glasses later on in his career. He went out of the top 16 in 1987 but whitewashed Steve Davis 5\u20130 in the third round of the 1988 [[British Open (snooker)|British Open]]. The victory was achieved with Reardon using his old cue with which he had won his world titles, having been encouraged to rebuild it, by Steve Davis. However, in the next round, played under TV lighting, Reardon suffered a drying of contact lenses and lost 5\u20132 to [[David Roe]], having led 2\u20131.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, April 1988, pp9 & 13.</ref>\n\nReardon played his last competitive ranking match in the 1991 World Championship qualifying second round. He lost 10\u20135 to [[Jason Prince]] (losing three frames on the black). Upon this loss, Reardon announced that 'there was no bitterness on his part' but he would not be returning. Having slipped to 127th in the provisional ranking and now aged 58, Reardon called a halt to his formal playing career.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, May 1991, p5.</ref> Reardon's last formal appearance in an event came in the 2000 Seniors event where he lost his opening one-frame match 69\u201346 to Graham Miles.<ref>Dee, John (Ed), CueSport Magazine, October 2000, p26.</ref>\n\nReardon maintains an active interest in the game. He also advised [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] on his way to his [[World Snooker Championship 2004|2004 World Championship]] victory, giving him psychological and tactical help.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/3677833.stm 'Magic' Ronnie wows Reardon]\", BBC Sport, 2 May 2004.

He is widely considered as one of the greatest players of all time. His dark [[widow's peak]] and sharp-toothed grin earned him the nickname \"[[Dracula]]\".\n\nReardon was world champion in [[1970 World Snooker Championship|1970]], [[1973 World Snooker Championship|1973]], [[1974 World Snooker Championship|1974]], [[1975 World Snooker Championship|1975]], [[1976 World Snooker Championship|1976]] and [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]], and was world runner-up in [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. In 1969 he became the inaugural winner of [[Pot Black]]. Reardon was snooker's first dominant force of the modern era and was the first number one ranked player, when rankings were introduced in the [[Snooker world rankings 1976/1977|1976/77]] season \u2014 holding that spot for the next five years. His dominance during the 1970s prefigured that of [[Steve Davis]] in the 1980s and [[Stephen Hendry]] in 1990s. He regained the number one ranking in [[Snooker world rankings 1982/1983|1982]], but thereafter his form declined, and he dropped out of the elite top-16 ranked players after the [[Snooker season 1986/1987|1986/87]] season. He retired from the professional game in 1992. \n\nReardon remained one of snooker's top players into his 50s, and thus set a number of records which still stand. He is snooker's oldest world champion (in 1978, aged 45 years and 203 days), the oldest player to win a ranking event (in 1982, 50 years and 14 days), and the oldest player to hold the number one ranking (1982, 50 years old). Reardon also worked with [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] in a coaching role, helping him to win the [[2004 World Snooker Championship|2004 World Championship]] title.\n\n==Early life==\nReardon was born on 8 October 1932, in the [[coal mining]] community of [[Tredegar]] in Monmouthshire.<ref name=\"then and now\"/> Wanting to play snooker, he turned down a place at a [[grammar School]] to become a miner at Ty Trist Colliery, aged 14, following in the footsteps of his father. After a rockfall in which he was buried for three hours, he quit mining and became a [[police officer]] when his family moved to [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Staffordshire]].<ref>http://www.rileys.co.uk/blog/from-tredegar-to-the-green-baize-ray-reardon/</ref><ref>http://www.bioeddie.co.uk/ebbw-vale/famousperson.php?recordID=30</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nAged 15, Reardon beat fellow Welshman Jack Cowey in the British youth championship. Having won the Welsh amateur title from 1950\u20131955, Reardon failed to win the English title when he entered the event in 1956 and 1957. Finally upon re-entering the 1964 event, he won the English Amateur title, defeating [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] 11\u20138 in the final. This victory led to an invitation to tour [[South Africa]]. This proved to be so successful that Reardon was offered the chance to tour it again as a professional. On the back of this, Reardon resigned as a policeman and turned professional in 1967.<ref>Reardon, Ray., Enjoying Snooker, St Michael Press, 1986, p15.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nReardon's first appearance at the World Championship was in [[World Snooker Championship 1969|1969]], and he won his first title the [[World Snooker Championship 1970|following year]], beating [[John Pulman]] 37\u201333 in London. After winning the title, Reardon was in big demand for exhibitions and on the holiday camp circuit. Winning the first ever ''[[Pot Black]]'' in 1969 made him instantly recognisable; Reardon and John Spencer were the first to capitalise on the snooker boom in the early 1970s.<ref>https://www.rkgsnooker.com/player/player-profile/ray-reardon/token-292</ref>\n\n== Entertainer ==\nReardon also became popular because he added a touch of humour and entertainment to his game. Considered a deadly long potter and tactician in his prime, he played seventeen World Championship matches without defeat and won the title four years in succession. He won his second in [[World Snooker Championship 1973|1973]] in [[Manchester]] when he beat Eddie Charlton 38\u201332, after defeating John Spencer 23\u201322 in the semi-finals.\n\nReardon beat [[Graham Miles]] the [[World Snooker Championship 1974|following year]], and in [[World Snooker Championship 1975|1975]], when it was held in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], he had a tough quarter-final with Spencer which he won 19\u201317. He then beat [[Alex Higgins]] 19\u201314 before meeting local hero [[Eddie Charlton]] in the final. Reardon initially trailed by 29 frames to 23, putting Charlton two frames away from the title, but Reardon then won seven consecutive frames to lead 30\u201329. Charlton took the sixtieth frame to tie the match but Reardon took the vital sixty-first and won his fourth title.\n\nIn January 1976, Reardon appeared on ''[[This is Your Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/ray_reardon.html |title=Ray Reardon |publisher=Bigredbook.info |accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref> He had been suggested as a candidate for the programme by ''Snooker Scene'' editor, [[Clive Everton]]. The snooker playing fraternity was represented by Alex Higgins, John Pulman, [[Jackie Rea]], Graham Miles, John Spencer, Eddie Charlton, Cliff Thorburn and female professional [[Joyce Gardner]].<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, February 1976, pp16-17.</ref>\n\nReardon won his fifth title the [[World Snooker Championship 1976|next year]] in Manchester, beating Alex Higgins 27\u201316. Earlier that year, he had won the [[1976 Masters (snooker)|Benson and Hedges Masters]] in London, his second snooker title after the World Championship. In this event Reardon defeated John Pulman in the quarter-final 4\u20131, in a match where the highest break was only 22 (by Pulman). Reardon improved his form in the semi-final to defeat Eddie Charlton 5\u20134 and Graham Miles 7\u20133 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.), Snooker Scene, March 1976, pp16-17.</ref> Reardon would never win the event again but defeated Rex Williams 4\u20131 and Graham Miles 5\u20132 in the 1977 event only to lose 7\u20136 to Doug Mountjoy in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, March 1977, pp17-19.</ref>\n\nReardon's unbeaten run at the World Championship ended at the first Crucible championship in [[World Snooker Championship 1977|1977]], when he lost to John Spencer in the quarter-finals 6\u201313, his first defeat since [[Rex Williams]] in [[World Snooker Championship 1972|1972]].\n\nReardon regained the title in [[World Snooker Championship 1978|1978]] winning it for the sixth and final time by beating [[Doug Mountjoy]] 13\u20139 (after trailing 7\u20132), [[Bill Werbeniuk]] 13\u20136, [[Eddie Charlton]] 18\u201314 and finally [[Perrie Mans]] 25\u201318 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1978, pp9, 11, 16/17.</ref> Reardon remains the oldest winner of the World Championship at the age of 45 years and 6 months. Straight after this Reardon regained the [[Pontins Professional]] title, defeating John Spencer 7\u20132 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1978, p20. Reardon won \u00a31500.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of 1978 Reardon beat [[Patsy Fagan]] 6\u20131 and Alex Higgins 11\u20139 in a high quality final to win the one-off 'Champion of Champions' event sponsored by the [[Daily Mirror]] and held at the Wembley Conference Centre.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, December 1978, p7.</ref>\n\n1979 saw Reardon regain his ''Pot Black'' title by defeating [[Doug Mountjoy]] 2\u20131 in the final. It was Reardon's first win since he won the inaugural event in 1969, although he was runner up in 1970, 1972 and 1980.<ref>Perrin, Reg., Pot Black, BBC Books, 1983, pp21/22.</ref> That same year Reardon joined Mountjoy and then World Champion Terry Griffiths, to win the first 'World Challenge Cup' for Wales, defeating England (Fred Davis, John Spencer and Graham Miles) easily 14\u20133 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, December 1979, p9.</ref>\n\n== Indian summer ==\nAfter Reardon's sixth world title he remained one of the world's best players for some years. He lost to [[Dennis Taylor]] in the 1979 quarter-final, and by [[David Taylor (snooker player)|David Taylor]] at the same stage in 1980. He went a step further in 1981, beating John Spencer 13\u201311 and Bill Werbeniuk 13\u201310 before being surprisingly beaten by fellow Welshman Doug Mountjoy in the semi-finals in what was Mountjoy's best ever World Championship performance. Mountjoy scored a championship record break of 145 during the match, which he won 16\u201310.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, June 1981, pp10/11, 13 & 15.</ref>\n\nIt was the rise of Steve Davis in 1980\u201381 that saw Reardon and his generation lose their grip on the game. However, despite Davis' domination between late 1980 and the spring of 1982, Reardon remained a major force in the game. At 49, he reached the World final in [[World Snooker Championship 1982|1982]], losing to Alex Higgins 15\u201318.\n\nFor the 1982/3 season Reardon returned to number one in the world rankings, which in those days were based only on performances at the World Championships over previous years. His career went through an [[Indian summer]]. He won the Players Professional Tournament in late 1982, beating Jimmy White 10\u20135 in the final.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, November 1982, p22.</ref>, reached the final of the [[Masters (snooker)|Benson & Hedges Masters]], losing 7\u20139 to [[Cliff Thorburn]], and went on to win the [[1983 International Masters]], where he beat Steve Davis 2\u20131 in the semi-final group stages, before defeating [[Jimmy White]] 9\u20136 in the final, having trailed 5\u20133.<ref>Everton, Clive (ed.) Snooker Scene, April 1983, p9.</ref> Reardon also regained the [[1983 Welsh Professional Championship|Welsh Professional Title]], hammering Terry Griffiths 9\u20134 and Doug Mountjoy 9\u20131 in the semi final and final respectively.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, April 1983, p 12/13.</ref> This led him to be fancied in some quarters for that year's World Championship, but he suffered his earliest ever defeat in the competition, losing 13\u201312 in a high-quality second round match to [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]].\n\nReardon also whitewashed Steve Davis twice during the latter's prime; firstly, 6\u20130 in the [[1982 Highland Masters]] semi-final (an event Reardon went on to win)<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, pp29 and 33. Reardon replaced Cliff Thorburn as world number one, Steve Davis was ranked fourth that year.</ref> and secondly in 1988 (see below). Reardon reached the semi-finals of the World Championships once more, in 1985 (losing 16\u20135 to Davis). He last played at the Crucible in [[World Snooker Championship 1987|1987]], losing to Steve Davis again in the second round.\n\n== World Number One ==\nWhen the [[snooker world rankings]] were introduced in 1976, Reardon was the first number one, retaining that position until [[Snooker world rankings 1981/1982|1981/1982]].<ref name=\"then and now\"/> His win in the 1982 [[Totesport Grand Prix|Professional Players Tournament]] at the age of 50 led to his recapturing the world number one position in the first set of rankings to be calculated on tournaments other than the World Championship.\n\nReardon remains the oldest player, at 50, ever to win a ranking tournament.  He has also won the [[World Cup (snooker)|State Express World Team Classic]] for [[Wales]] during the first two years of the tournament in 1979 and 1980 with Mountjoy and [[Terry Griffiths]]. He also won the [[Welsh Professional Championship]] in [[1981 Welsh Professional Championship|1981]] and [[1983 Welsh Professional Championship|1983]]. His last final was the 1985 [[World Doubles Championship (snooker)|World Doubles]] when he partnered Tony Jones and lost to [[Steve Davis]] and [[Tony Meo]] 5\u201312. He was awarded the MBE in the same year.\n\n==Retirement and later years==\nReardon developed eyesight problems and started wearing '[[Dennis Taylor]]-style' glasses later on in his career. He went out of the top 16 in 1987 but whitewashed Steve Davis 5\u20130 in the third round of the 1988 [[British Open (snooker)|British Open]]. The victory was achieved with Reardon using his old cue with which he had won his world titles, having been encouraged to rebuild it, by Steve Davis. However, in the next round, played under TV lighting, Reardon suffered a drying of contact lenses and lost 5\u20132 to [[David Roe]], having led 2\u20131.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, April 1988, pp9 & 13.</ref>\n\nReardon played his last competitive ranking match in the 1991 World Championship qualifying second round. He lost 10\u20135 to [[Jason Prince]] (losing three frames on the black). Upon this loss, Reardon announced that 'there was no bitterness on his part' but he would not be returning. Having slipped to 127th in the provisional ranking and now aged 58, Reardon called a halt to his formal playing career.<ref>Everton, Clive (Ed.) Snooker Scene, May 1991, p5.</ref> Reardon's last formal appearance in an event came in the 2000 Seniors event where he lost his opening one-frame match 69\u201346 to Graham Miles.<ref>Dee, John (Ed), CueSport Magazine, October 2000, p26.</ref>\n\nReardon maintains an active interest in the game. He also advised [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] on his way to his [[World Snooker Championship 2004|2004 World Championship]] victory, giving him psychological and tactical help.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/3677833.stm 'Magic' Ronnie wows Reardon]\", BBC Sport, 2 May 2004.

In 1946 General Arnold directed Dr. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] the [[RAND Corporation]] to determine the feasibility of a satellite for strategic reconnaissance. In 1946 this study identified nearly all current space mission areas, including intelligence, weather forecasting, communications, and navigation.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/01/2001329745/-1/-1/0/AFD-101001-060.pdf|title=The U.S. Air Force in Space 1945 to the Twenty-first Century|publisher=USAF History and Museums Program, United States Air Force|place=Washington, D.C.|date=1998}}</ref>\n\n[[File:General Bernard A Schriever.jpg|thumb|General [[Bernard Schriever]] was the father of the military space program.]]\nAfter the [[United States Air Force]] gained its independence in 1947, General [[Bernard Schriever]] was appointed to head the [[Western Development Division]], made responsible for the Air Force's space and intercontinental ballistic missile programs. It was responsible for developing the Advanced Reconnaissance System, which would have been the Air Force's first satellite constellation. On 4 October 1957 the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik 1]], which was the world's first satellite. This event transformed space development overnight, helping the national security establishment understand the importance of the space domain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEarly military space development was marked by strong interservice rivalry, with each developing their own proposals for satellites and launch vehicles. The first American satellite was the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]]'s [[Explorer 1]] which was launched on the [[Naval Research Laboratory]]'s [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard]] rocket. The Air Force still continued military space development amidst this competition from the Army and Navy. In 1958 the newly formed [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] assumed control over all military space programs, but this centralization was short lived and in gave control back to the services in September 1959. The creation of [[NASA]] in 1958 significantly hampered the Army and Navy's space programs, absorbing the Army's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] and Navy's [[Project Vanguard]] and [[Minitrack]] satellite tracking network, but only absorbed the Air Force's [[Man in Space Soonest]] program, merging it with [[Project Mercury]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDevelopment of Air Force space systems continued with the [[Missile Defense Alarm System]] (MIDAS) and [[Strategic Air Command]]'s [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]] reconnaissance satellites, as well as the [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]], [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], and [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] space launch vehicles. The Air Force and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] also jointly developed and operated the [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] reconnaissance satellite. The development of reconnaissance satellites became a national priority after an American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] reconnaissance plane was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] over the Soviet Union, making aerial reconnaissance impractical. In 1961 the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] was created as a joint Air Force\u2013CIA activity to manage all spy satellites.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote=\"Space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own.

The relationship between the Air Force space program and NASA continued to grow closer, with agreements being reached to share information and personnel. The Air Force also began development on the crewed [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]] spaceplane and [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]], both of which were later canceled as their functions could be carried out by uncrewed systems. General Schriever's advocacy for military space led to the 1961 establishment of [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC), which included a dedicated Space Systems Directorate to centralize all space development, separating it from the missile program. Prior to Air Force Systems Command's creation, spacecraft design, acquisitions, and launch was split between [[Air Material Command]] and Air Force Research and Development Command, however, the new command centralized all of these activities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Air Force provided space support to forces during the [[Vietnam War]], with a focus on providing space\u2013based weather and communications capabilities. In the 1970s development began on the [[Global Positioning System]], [[Defense Satellite Communications System]], and [[Defense Support Program]] missile warning satellites. The [[Space Shuttle]] also began development, with significant Air Force input. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, Air Force space operations were centralized in [[Aerospace Defense Command]], but it was disestablished in 1980, transferring its space surveillance and missile warning systems to Strategic Air Command. In 1979, Air Force doctrine recognized space as a mission area for the first time, and led to the creation of a space division on the [[Air Staff (United States)|Air Staff]]. Air Force Systems Command also established a deputy commander for space operations.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air Force Space Command (1982\u20132019)===\n[[File:Air Force Space Command.png|thumb|[[Air Force Space Command]] shield]]\n\nTowards the 1980s, the Air Force began to realize that it was insufficiently organized for military space operations, with assets and responsibilities split across Strategic Air Command, Air Force Systems Command, the [[Aerospace Defense Center]], and the Air Staff. In 1979, the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]] concluded that \"currently, the Air Force is inadequately organized for operational exploitation of space and has placed insufficient emphasis on inclusion of space systems in an integrated force study.\" In 1981, the Air Force took a measure to address this discontinuity, establishing the consolidated space operations center in Colorado Springs and began discussing the creation of a space command to centralize its space activities. On 1 September 1982, [[Air Force Space Command]] (AFSPC) was created as an Air Force [[List of major commands of the United States Air Force|major command]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Air Force Space Command centralized all space operations, including missile warning, launch operations, satellite control, space domain awareness, and satellite communications.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAir Force Space Command was absolutely critical during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], which would later be described as the first space war by Air Force Chief of Staff General [[Merrill McPeak]]. Specifically, its GPS support enabled the left hook across the Iraq desert.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Defense Meteorological Support Program satellites provided a significant amount of weather data and over 90% of communications were provided by satellite systems. The Defense Support Program early-warning satellites provided indications of SCUD launches to fielded forces.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, AFSPC led the development of the [[Milstar|MILSTAR]] communications satellite constellation and completed the GPS constellation.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In accordance with the recommendations of the 2001 Space Commission, the [[Space and Missile Systems Center]] was transferred from [[Air Force Material Command]] to Air Force Space Command, becoming its integral research and acquisitions arm.

The 2001 Space Commission, chaired by former secretary of defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and composed of a number of military, space, and intelligence professionals, was set up to examine the national security space organization of the United States. The commission itself concluded that the military needed to develop space\u2013specific doctrine, operations concepts, and capabilities \u2013 including the development and deployment of space\u2013based weapons. The Space Commission came to the conclusion that the Air Force treated space operations as a secondary mission in comparison to air operations, and recommended the creation of a space corps within the Department of the Air Force, and in the long term, creating a military department for space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aerospace.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/RumsfeldCommission.pdf|title=Report to the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization|last=U.S. Government|date=10 January 2001|website=csis.org|access-date=11 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:President Trump Signs the 2020 NDAA (49259748917).jpg|thumb|right|President [[Donald Trump]] signs the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which established the Space Force, in Hangar 6 at [[Joint Base Andrews]], December 20, 2019.

In 1946 General Arnold directed Dr. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] the [[RAND Corporation]] to determine the feasibility of a satellite for strategic reconnaissance. In 1946 this study identified nearly all current space mission areas, including intelligence, weather forecasting, communications, and navigation.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Oct/01/2001329745/-1/-1/0/AFD-101001-060.pdf|title=The U.S. Air Force in Space 1945 to the Twenty-first Century|publisher=USAF History and Museums Program, United States Air Force|place=Washington, D.C.|date=1998}}</ref>\n\n[[File:General Bernard A Schriever.jpg|thumb|General [[Bernard Schriever]] was the father of the military space program.]]\nAfter the [[United States Air Force]] gained its independence in 1947, General [[Bernard Schriever]] was appointed to head the [[Western Development Division]], made responsible for the Air Force's space and intercontinental ballistic missile programs. It was responsible for developing the Advanced Reconnaissance System, which would have been the Air Force's first satellite constellation. On 4 October 1957 the [[Soviet Union]] launched [[Sputnik 1]], which was the world's first satellite. This event transformed space development overnight, helping the national security establishment understand the importance of the space domain.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nEarly military space development was marked by strong interservice rivalry, with each developing their own proposals for satellites and launch vehicles. The first American satellite was the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]]'s [[Explorer 1]] which was launched on the [[Naval Research Laboratory]]'s [[Vanguard (rocket)|Vanguard]] rocket. The Air Force still continued military space development amidst this competition from the Army and Navy. In 1958 the newly formed [[DARPA|Advanced Research Projects Agency]] assumed control over all military space programs, but this centralization was short lived and in gave control back to the services in September 1959. The creation of [[NASA]] in 1958 significantly hampered the Army and Navy's space programs, absorbing the Army's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] and Navy's [[Project Vanguard]] and [[Minitrack]] satellite tracking network, but only absorbed the Air Force's [[Man in Space Soonest]] program, merging it with [[Project Mercury]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nDevelopment of Air Force space systems continued with the [[Missile Defense Alarm System]] (MIDAS) and [[Strategic Air Command]]'s [[Samos (satellite)|SAMOS]] reconnaissance satellites, as well as the [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor]], [[Atlas (rocket family)|Atlas]], and [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] space launch vehicles. The Air Force and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] also jointly developed and operated the [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]] reconnaissance satellite. The development of reconnaissance satellites became a national priority after an American [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] reconnaissance plane was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] over the Soviet Union, making aerial reconnaissance impractical. In 1961 the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] was created as a joint Air Force\u2013CIA activity to manage all spy satellites.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote=\"Space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own.

The relationship between the Air Force space program and NASA continued to grow closer, with agreements being reached to share information and personnel. The Air Force also began development on the crewed [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]] spaceplane and [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]], both of which were later canceled as their functions could be carried out by uncrewed systems. General Schriever's advocacy for military space led to the 1961 establishment of [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC), which included a dedicated Space Systems Directorate to centralize all space development, separating it from the missile program. Prior to Air Force Systems Command's creation, spacecraft design, acquisitions, and launch was split between [[Air Material Command]] and Air Force Research and Development Command, however, the new command centralized all of these activities.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Air Force provided space support to forces during the [[Vietnam War]], with a focus on providing space\u2013based weather and communications capabilities. In the 1970s development began on the [[Global Positioning System]], [[Defense Satellite Communications System]], and [[Defense Support Program]] missile warning satellites. The [[Space Shuttle]] also began development, with significant Air Force input. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, Air Force space operations were centralized in [[Aerospace Defense Command]], but it was disestablished in 1980, transferring its space surveillance and missile warning systems to Strategic Air Command. In 1979, Air Force doctrine recognized space as a mission area for the first time, and led to the creation of a space division on the [[Air Staff (United States)|Air Staff]]. Air Force Systems Command also established a deputy commander for space operations.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Air Force Space Command (1982\u20132019)===\n[[File:Air Force Space Command.png|thumb|[[Air Force Space Command]] shield]]\n\nTowards the 1980s, the Air Force began to realize that it was insufficiently organized for military space operations, with assets and responsibilities split across Strategic Air Command, Air Force Systems Command, the [[Aerospace Defense Center]], and the Air Staff. In 1979, the [[United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board|Air Force Scientific Advisory Board]] concluded that \"currently, the Air Force is inadequately organized for operational exploitation of space and has placed insufficient emphasis on inclusion of space systems in an integrated force study.\" In 1981, the Air Force took a measure to address this discontinuity, establishing the consolidated space operations center in Colorado Springs and began discussing the creation of a space command to centralize its space activities. On 1 September 1982, [[Air Force Space Command]] (AFSPC) was created as an Air Force [[List of major commands of the United States Air Force|major command]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Air Force Space Command centralized all space operations, including missile warning, launch operations, satellite control, space domain awareness, and satellite communications.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nAir Force Space Command was absolutely critical during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], which would later be described as the first space war by Air Force Chief of Staff General [[Merrill McPeak]]. Specifically, its GPS support enabled the left hook across the Iraq desert.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Defense Meteorological Support Program satellites provided a significant amount of weather data and over 90% of communications were provided by satellite systems. The Defense Support Program early-warning satellites provided indications of SCUD launches to fielded forces.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s, AFSPC led the development of the [[Milstar|MILSTAR]] communications satellite constellation and completed the GPS constellation.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> In accordance with the recommendations of the 2001 Space Commission, the [[Space and Missile Systems Center]] was transferred from [[Air Force Material Command]] to Air Force Space Command, becoming its integral research and acquisitions arm. In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Air Force Space Command provided space support as part of the [[War on terror|global war on terrorism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afspc.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/249014/air-force-space-command/|title=Air Force Space Command|website=Air Force Space Command}}</ref>\n\n===Independence (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Space Force.jpg|thumb|U.S. Space Force logo used from 20 December 2019 on public social media accounts<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/USSpaceForceDoD/photos/a.446560887073/10158006856727074/?type=3|title=United States Space Force|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/spaceforcedod?lang=en|title=United States Space Force (@SpaceForceDoD) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>]]\nThe idea of an independent service for U.S. military space operations had been under consideration by 2001. The 2001 Space Commission, chaired by former secretary of defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and composed of a number of military, space, and intelligence professionals, was set up to examine the national security space organization of the United States. The commission itself concluded that the military needed to develop space\u2013specific doctrine, operations concepts, and capabilities \u2013 including the development and deployment of space\u2013based weapons. The Space Commission came to the conclusion that the Air Force treated space operations as a secondary mission in comparison to air operations, and recommended the creation of a space corps within the Department of the Air Force, and in the long term, creating a military department for space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aerospace.csis.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/RumsfeldCommission.pdf|title=Report to the Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management and Organization|last=U.S. Government|date=10 January 2001|website=csis.org|access-date=11 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:President Trump Signs the 2020 NDAA (49259748917).jpg|thumb|right|President [[Donald Trump]] signs the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which established the Space Force, in Hangar 6 at [[Joint Base Andrews]], December 20, 2019.

Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]].

In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors.

'''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Barbara Ahr, V\u00e9ronique Robert-Hebmann, Christian Devaux & Martine Biard-Piechaczyk | title=Apoptosis of uninfected cells induced by HIV envelope glycoproteins | journal=[[Retrovirology]] | volume=12 | year=2004 | url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-1-12 }}  </ref> However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits.

Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]].

In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.

In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Barbara Ahr, V\u00e9ronique Robert-Hebmann, Christian Devaux & Martine Biard-Piechaczyk | title=Apoptosis of uninfected cells induced by HIV envelope glycoproteins | journal=[[Retrovirology]] | volume=12 | year=2004 | url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-1-12 }}  </ref> However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits.

Robert was an   author, [[playwright]] and deputy manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Dublin]], who is best remembered for his book ''An Historical View of the Irish Stage''. Sarah Hitchcock  like  her daughter was a very popular actress on the Dublin stage.<ref>Published by R. Marchbank, Dame Street, Dublin 1788</ref> Richard  graduated from the [[University of Dublin]], where he was auditor of the [[College Historical Society]].  He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] in 1814 and became [[King's Counsel]] in 1830.\n\nAs a young [[barrister]]  he attended (without a [[brief (law)|brief]])  the hearing of ''R. v  Waller O'Grady'', a much publicised case of  [[quo warranto]]  concerning  the  power  of  [[patronage]]  of  [[Standish O'Grady, 1st Viscount Guillamore|Standish O'Grady]],  the [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]],   who  had sought to  appoint  his younger son  Waller  to the office of  Clerk of the Pleas in the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)|Court of Exchequer]]. Greene  co-wrote  an account of the case  which he published and which  gained him some  favourable attention.<ref>Greene, Richard Wilson  ''Report of the  proceedings...at the suit of the King v Walter O'Grady''   Dublin 1816</ref>\n\nIn 1831 he was the first person to be appointed to the new position of [[Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]],<ref>Casey, James  ''The Irish Law Officers''  Round Hall Sweet and Maxwell 1996</ref> which ranked  below the two senior law officers, but was nonetheless a very onerous Crown office. The choice of Greene for the position was an interesting one since he   was  generally regarded as  a  political opponent of the Government of the day.<ref>Hart, A.R.  The History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland''  Four Courts Press 2000</ref>\n\nHe became [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]] in 1842 and was [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] briefly in 1846. He was raised to the Bench as Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] in 1852 and served on that Court until shortly before his death in 1861.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Wilson, daughter of Thomas Wilson  of [[Fulford, North Yorkshire]] in 1819, and took her surname as well as his own.\n\nHe made his reputation as an advocate with an impressive closing speech for the Crown at the trial of [[Daniel O'Connell]] in 1844.  According to Elrington Ball his appointment to the Bench was due to the personal regard which  [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], the Prime Minister, had for him.<ref>Ball, F.
