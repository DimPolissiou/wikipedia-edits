Evolutionary psychology often assumes that human evolution occurred in a uniform environment, and critics suggest that we know so little about the environment (or probably multiple environments) in which homo sapiens evolved, that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative.<ref name=\"Plotkin, Henry p.149\">Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History. Blackwell. p.149.</ref>\n\nThe evolutionary psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides state that research is confined to certainties about the past, such as pregnancies only occurring in women, and that humans lived in groups. They argue that there are many environmental features that are known regarding our species' evolutionary history. They argue that our [[hunter-gatherer]] ancestors dealt with predators and prey, [[foraging|food acquisition]] and sharing, mate choice, child rearing, interpersonal aggression, interpersonal assistance, diseases and a host of other fairly predictable challenges that constituted significant selection pressures. Knowledge also include things such as nomadic, kin-based lifestyle in small groups, long life for mammals, low fertility for mammals, long female pregnancy and lactation, cooperative hunting and aggression, tool use, and sexual division of labor.<ref>The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (2005), David M. Buss, Chapter 1, pp. 5-67, Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides</ref> Tooby and Cosmides thus argue that enough can be known about the EEA to make hypotheses and predictions.<ref>Tooby, John, and Leda Cosmides. \"Letter to the Editor of The New York Review of Books on Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s \u2018Darwinian Fundamentalism\u2019(June 12, 1997) and \u2018Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism\u2019(June 26, 1997).\" Verf\u00fcgbar unter: http://cogweb. ucla. edu/Debate/CEP_Gould. html [Datum des Zugriffs: 12.02. 2009] (1997).</ref>\n\nDavid Buss also argued that the EEA could be sufficiently known to make predictions in evolutionary psychology. Buss argued that aspects of the environment are known - the Earth's gravity was the same, as was its atmosphere. Dinosaurs and giant Carboniferous insects were extinct and humans still lived in groups, while there were two sexes. Groups consisted of old and young members, healthy and sick, varying degrees of relatedness and so on. Bus notes that while some critics agree that the general environment is known, the specific selection pressures might never be understood due to being highly context sensitive. David Buller, a who advanced such a criticism, used an analogy to birds, observing that while all male birds must attract all female birds, they do so in different ways; Buller alleges that the evidence is simply not available to be able to determine which the specific mate-attraction problems for humans. However, Buss argues that this can be solved by proposing different evolutionary psychology hypotheses and uses data, confirmation strategies and discovery heuristics to determine which ones can be advanced. Furthermore, Buss argues this criticism is selectively sceptical - Buss notes that Buller had no problem writing confidently about the evolved mate functions of bird species, of whom there is even less knowledge about selective pressures, so it is not clear why Buller is willing to infer the mating strategies of ancestral birds by analysing living ones yet is unwilling to infer the mating strategies of ancient humans by analysing living humans.<ref>Buss, David M., ed. The handbook of evolutionary psychology. John Wiley & Sons, 2005, pp.147-149</ref>\n\nJohn Alcock argues that the fact that many traits in humans are presently adaptive is suggestive that they originally developed as adaptions. This is because if an organism diverges too much from its original environment, it is unlikely that it's traits will be adaptive to the new, changed environment and it is at risk of going extinct. Thus evolutionary psychologists doubt that the modern world is largely novel compared to that of the EEA.<ref>Maryanski, Alexandra, Richard Machalek, and Jonathan H. Turner.

Pinker argues that the evidence indicates that the ancestral environment lacked \"agriculture, contraception, high-tech medicine, mass media, mass-produced goods, money, police, armies, communities of strangers, and other modern features\", which Pinker argues all have profound implications for minds that evolved in such an environment.<ref>Kalant, Harold, Steven Pinker, and Werner Kalow. \"Evolutionary psychology: an exchange.\" Exchange 44, no. 15 (1997).

They developed a fitness cost/benefit mathematical model and populated it with estimates of certain parameters (some parameter estimates were based on studies of the [[Ach\u00e9 people|Ach\u00e9]] in Paraguay). Their model suggested that, on average, the costs of rape for a typical 25-year-old male outweigh benefits by a factor of ten to one. On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men. They also find that rape from raiding other tribes has lower costs but does not offer net fitness benefits, making it also unlikely that was an adaptation.<ref name=\"SEM\">{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Eric |last2=Mulde |first2=Monique|last3=Hill|first3=Kim |year=2001 |title=Controversies in the evolutionary social sciences: a guide for the perplexed|journal=[[Trends in Ecology & Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=128\u201335 |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Smith2001.pdf|accessdate=July 1, 2013 |doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)02077-2 |pmid=11179576}}</ref>\n\nBeckerman et al.

There are important constraints on evolutionary explanation. More to the point, every decent evolutionary explanation has testable predictions about the design of the trait. For example, the hypothesis that pregnancy sickness is a byproduct of prenatal hormones predicts different patterns of food aversions than the hypothesis that it is an adaptation that evolved to protect the [[fetus]] from pathogens and plant toxins in food at the point in embryogenesis when the fetus is most vulnerable \u2013 during the first trimester.

A hypothesis is made about the evolutionary cause of a psychological phenomenon or phenomena. Then the researcher makes predictions that can be tested. This involves predicting that the evolutionary cause will have caused other effects than the ones already discovered and known. Then these predictions are tested.

Stewart-Williams argues that if evolutionary psychology hypotheses can't be falsified, then neither could competing explanations, because if alternative explanations (e.g sociocultural hypotheses) were proven true, this would automatically falsify the competing evolutionary psychology hypothesis, so  for competing explanations to be true, then evolutionary psychology hypothesis must be false and thus falsifiable.<ref>Stewart-Williams, Steve. The ape that understood the universe: How the mind and culture evolve. Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp-287-288</ref>\n\nEdward Hagen observes that critics of evolutionary psychology often argue that because a trait could have evolved as an adaptation or a by-product, it is impossible to determine which it is since it evolved in a past environment and thus evolutionary psychology hypotheses about a traits origin are untestable. According to Hagen, critics using this argument have a flawed understanding of science; Hagen argues that science is fundamentally an abductivist methodology e.g inference to the best explanation. Hagen argues that hypotheses compete to provide the best explanation of a phenomenon, where \"best\" is measured via criteria like predicting new and surprising observations, parsimony, coherence and so on. Abduction does not require scientist to provide direct evidence for ever single prediction. Evolutionary psychology hypotheses make predictions and thus compete with other hypotheses to explain traits.<ref>Edward Hagen, [https://evolution-institute.org/is-evolutionary-psychology-impossible/ ''Is Evolutionary Psychology Impossible?''], The Evolution Institute, 28/01/2020</ref>\n\nDominic Murphy explains that one of the most common objections to evolutionary psychology is the \"time machine\" argument. This is the argument that while evolutionary psychology can make predictions about things we should see in the modern world if the evolutionary psychology hypothesis is true, there are too many alternate explanations for the origin of a trait which would also predict this phenomena e.g a trait evolving as a by-product could predict the same evidence as the same trait evolving as an adaptation. Therefore, a potentially infinite number of alternative historical explanations are possible. Thus without a time machine, it is impossible to determine which possible explanation for the evidence seen in the modern day is correct. Murphy argues this argument is flawed on multiple grounds. Firstly, if an explanation for a trait is forwarded and a prediction for what we would see in the modern day is made based on that explanation, then one cannot just propose alternative explanations. Instead, these alternative explanations require testable predictions of their own to be forwarded, preferably multiple different predictions. In addition, not all explanations may predict the same evidence, thus Murphy argues that if one explanation predicts a great deal of evidence for modern day observations and alternative explanations struggle to explain this, then it is reasonable to have confidence in the former explanation. In addition, Murphy argues that if the \"time machine\" argument was applied to other sciences, it would lead to absurd results - Murphy observes that cosmologists have confirmed predictions about the Big Bang by studying available astronomical evidence and current understanding of particle physics, with no need for a time machine to travel back to the beginning of the universe. Similarly, geologists and physicists investigating the hypothesis that it was an asteroid impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs did so by looking for modern day evidence. Murphy thus concludes that the onus is on the sceptics to prove why evolutionary psychology is allegedly untestable on \"time machine\" grounds if other historical sciences are not, as \"methods should be judged across the board, not singled out for ridicule in one context.\"<ref>Murphy, Dominic. \"Adaptationism and psychological explanation.\" In Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 161-184. Springer, Boston, MA, 2003.</ref> A similar argument was made by Andrew Goldfinch, who argued that this entire criticism is due to the issue of underdetermination - many rival explanations can accommodate a phenomenon. Furthermore, one can also challenge the interpretation of the results, revise an explanation to accommodate a novel fact or even question the reliability of the experiments conducted. However, Goldfinch argues that this is a ubiquitous problem in science and not unique to evolutionary psychology, so it is not clear why this is seen as a criticism of the field if it would be dismissed elsewhere. Lastly, Goldfinch argues that one way to distinguish between competing explanations is to make a distinction between programmes that makes new predictions and discovers novel facts and those programmes that simply accommodate the fresh discoveries of other programmes. Those programmes which are actually making and testing predictions should be favoured over those simply accommodating the discoveries of others.<ref>Goldfinch, Andrew.

Many critics have pointed out that many traits considered universal at some stage or another by evolutionary psychologists often turn out to be dependent on cultural and particular historical circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Paulson |first1=William R. |authorlink1=|title=Literary Culture in a World Transformed: A Future for the Humanities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFH-A8VQoxwC&pg=PA83 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca |isbn=978-0-8014-8730-9 |page=83 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}</ref><ref name=\"Lancaster 2003\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520236202|title=The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture|last=Lancaster|first=Roger|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520236202|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Davies (philosopher) |title=The Artful Species: Aesthetics, Art, and Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rbn9pkAfjEC&pg=PA142 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-965854-1 |page=142 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}</ref> Critics allege that evolutionary psychologists tend to assume that their own current cultural context represents a universal human nature. For example, [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Susan McKinnon argues that evolutionary theories of [[kinship]] rest on [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] presuppositions. Evolutionary psychologists assert that the degree of genetic relatedness determines the extent of kinship (e.g., solidarity, nurturance, and altruism) because in order to maximize their own reproductive success, people \"invest\" only in their own genetic children or closely related kin. [[Steven Pinker]], for instance, stated \"You're either someone's mother or you aren't\". McKinnon argues that such biologically centered constructions of relatedness result from a specific cultural context: the kinship category \"mother\" is relatively self-evident in Anglo-American cultures where biology is privileged but not in other societies where rank and marital status, not biology, determine who counts as a mother or where mother's sisters are also considered mothers and one's mother's brother is understood as the \"male mother\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKinnon |first1=Susan |authorlink1=|editor1-first=Susan |editor1-last=McKinnon |editor2-first=Sydel |editor2-last=Silverman |title=Complexities: Beyond Nature and Nurture |year=2005 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chacago |isbn=978-0-226-50023-2 |pages=106\u2013131 |chapter=On Kinship and Marriage: A Critique of the Genetic and Gender Calculus of Evolutionary Psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QR-LfboRTwUC&pg=PA106 }}</ref>\n\nIn a review of Pinker's book on evolutionary psychology (''[[The Blank Slate]]''), [[Louis Menand]] wrote: \"''In general, the views that Pinker derives from 'the new sciences of human nature' are mainstream Clinton-era views: incarceration is regrettable but necessary; sexism is unacceptable, but men and women will always have different attitudes toward sex; dialogue is preferable to threats of force in defusing ethnic and nationalist conflicts; most group stereotypes are roughly correct, but we should never judge an individual by group stereotypes; rectitude is all very well, but 'noble guys tend to finish last'; and so on.''\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Menand |first=Louis |title=What Comes Naturally |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=November 22, 2002 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/11/25/021125crbo_books |accessdate=March 26, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, evolutionary psychologists{{who|date=July 2011}} point out that their research actually focuses on commonalities between people of different cultures to help to identify \"human psychological nature\" and [[cultural universals]].

Evolutionary psychologists assume that genes contain instructions for building and operating an organism and that these instructions are passed from one generation to the next via genes.<ref name=\"Lickliter&Honeycutt1\"/>\n\nLickliter and Honeycutt (2003) have argued that evolutionary psychology is a predeterministic and [[Preformationism|preformationistic]] approach that assumes that physical and psychological traits are predetermined and programmed while virtually ignoring non-genetic factors involved in human development. Even when evolutionary psychologists acknowledge the influence of the environment, they reduce its role to that of an activator or trigger of the predetermined developmental instructions presumed to be encoded in a person's genes. Lickliter and Honeycutt have stated that the assumption of genetic determinism is most evident in the theory that learning and reasoning are governed by innate, domain-specific modules. Evolutionary psychologists assume that modules preexist individual development and lie dormant in the structure of the organism, awaiting activation by some (usually unspecified) experiential events. Lickliter and Honeycutt have opposed this view and suggested that it is the entire developmental system, including the specific features of the environment a person actually encounters and interacts with (and not the environments of distant ancestors) that brings about any modularity of cognitive function.<ref name=\"Lickliter&Honeycutt1\"/>\n\nCritics argue that a reductionist analysis of the relationship between genes and behavior results in a flawed research program and a restricted interpretation of the evidence, creating problems for the creation of models attempting to explain behavior. Lewontin, Rose & Kamin instead advocate a [[dialectical]] interpretation of behavior in which \"it is not just that wholes are more than the sum of their parts, it is that parts become qualitatively new by being parts of the whole\". They argue that reductionist explanations such as the hierarchical reductionism proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]] will cause the researcher to miss dialectical ones.<ref name=\"Lewontin, R.C. 1984\"/> Similarly, [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] criticizes evolutionary psychologists' explanations of [[child abuse]] as excessively reductionist. As an example she cites [[Martin Daly (professor)|Martin Daly]] and Margot Wilson's theory that stepfathers are more abusive because they lack the nurturing instinct of natural parents and can increase their reproductive success in this way. According to Rose this does not explain why most stepfathers do not abuse their children and why some biological fathers do. She also argues that cultural pressures can override the genetic predisposition to nurture as in the case of sex-selective [[infanticide]] prevalent in some cultures where male offspring are favored over female offspring.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Hilary |authorlink1= |editor1-first=Steven |editor1-last=Rose |editor1-link= |editor2-first=Hilary |editor2-last=Rose |title=Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments against Evolutionary Psychology |year=200 |publisher=Harmony Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-609-60513-4 |pages=127\u201353 |chapter=Colonizing the Social Sciences? |chapterurl= |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/alaspoordarwin00hila }}</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists Workman and Reader reply that while reductionism may be a \"dirty word\" to some it is actually an important scientific principle. They argue it is at the root of discoveries such as the world being made up of atoms and complex life being the result of evolution. At the same time they emphasize that it is important to look at all \"levels\" of explanations, e.g. both psychologists looking at environmental causes of depression and neuroscientists looking the brain contribute to different aspects of our knowledge of depression. Workman and Reader also deny the accusation of genetic determinism, asserting that genes usually do not cause behaviors absolutely but predispose to certain behaviors that are affected by factors such as culture and an individual's life history.<ref>Evolutionary psychology: an introduction, Lance Workman, Will Reader, Cambridge University Press; 2004, p25-26</ref>\n\n== Alternative explanations ==\n\n=== Adaptive explanations vs. environmental, cultural, social, and dialectical explanations ===\nA common critique is that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases.<ref name=\"EBO instinct\">\"instinct.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Some studies have been criticized for their tendency to attribute to evolutionary processes elements of human cognition that may be attributable to social processes (e.g. preference for particular physical features in mates), cultural artifacts (e.g. patriarchy and the roles of women in society), or dialectical considerations (e.g. behaviours in which biology interacts with society, as when a biologically determined skin colour determines how one is treated). Evolutionary psychologists are frequently criticized for ignoring the vast bodies of literature in psychology, philosophy, politics and social studies. Both sides of the debate stress that statements such as \"biology vs. environment\" and \"genes vs. culture\" amount to [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]], and outspoken critics of [[sociobiology]] such as [[Richard Lewontin]], Steven Rose and [[Leon Kamin]] helped to popularise a \"dialectical\" approach to questions of human behaviour, where biology and environment interact in complex ways to produce what we see.<ref>Lewontin, Rose & Kamin (1984) \"Biology, Ideology and Human Nature: Not In Our Genes\", Chapter 10</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists respond that their discipline is not primarily concerned with explaining the behavior of specific individuals, but rather broad categories of human behaviors across societies and cultures. It is the search for species-wide psychological adaptations (or \"human nature\") that distinguishes evolutionary psychology from purely cultural or social explanations. These psychological adaptations include cognitive decision rules that respond to different environmental, cultural, and social circumstances in ways that are (on average) adaptive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nEvolutionary psychologists Confer et al. argue that evolutionary psychology fully accepts nature-nurture interactionism, and that it is possible to test the theories in order to distinguish between different explanations.<ref name=AmPs2010/>\n\n=== Adaptive explanations vs. other evolutionary mechanisms ===\n\nCritics point out that within evolutionary biology there are many other non-adaptive pathways along which evolution can move to produce the behaviors seen in humans today. Natural selection is not the only evolutionary process that can change gene frequencies and produce novel traits. [[Genetic drift]] is caused by chance variation in the genes, environment, or development. Evolutionary by-products are traits that were not specially designed for an adaptive function, although they may also be species-typical and may also confer benefits on the organism. A \"[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]\" is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] and Lewontin (1979a) for traits which confer no adaptive advantage to an organism, but are 'carried along' by an adaptive trait. Gould advocates the hypothesis that cognition in humans came about as a spandrel: \"Natural selection made the human brain big, but most of our mental properties and potentials may be spandrels \u2013 that is, nonadaptive side consequences of building a device with such structural complexity\".<ref>Quote from Stephen Jay Gould, ''The Pleasures of Pluralism'', p.11</ref> Once a trait acquired by some other mechanism confers an adaptive advantage, it may be open to further selection as an \"[[exaptation]]\".<ref name=\"Gould1982\">{{cite journal | last1=Gould | first1=S.

Hagen argues that most organisms do not survive to reproduce and that is only through adaptations that organisms can hope to do so; alternate explanations like genetic drift are only relevant if an organism can survive and reproduce in the first place and it is the fact that organisms do manage survive and reproduce, despite the odds against such a thing occurring, that evolutionary psychologists are interested in.<ref>Hagen, Edward H.

The New York Review of Books</ref> Hagen also argues that a way to distinguish spandrels from adaptations is that adaptations have evidence of design (that is to say they did not simply arise by pure chance but were selected for). While Hagen agrees that one can risk over-attributing adaptation, he observes that one can also risk under-attributing it as well. Hagen argues that tonsils can become infected and it needs to be known whether or not it is safe to remove them. Insisting that tonsils could just be spandrels is not helpful, whereas hypothesising that they may be adapations allows one to make predictions about them to see if they do have a function and thus whether or not it is safe to remove them.<ref>Hagen, Edward H. \"Controversial issues in evolutionary psychology.\" The handbook of evolutionary psychology (2005): 145-173.</ref>  Conversely, Steve Stewart-Williams argues that it is not true that evolutionary psychologists do not consider non-adaptive explanations, arguing that evolutionary psychologists have suggested alternate explanations such as byproducts, observing that the hypothesis that obesity is caused by a mismatch between ancestral and modern environments is one of the most famous cases of a byproduct explanation in evolutionary psychology.<ref>Stewart-Williams, Steve.

Rather, to show something is an adaptation it must be shown that it exhibits special design. Special design is when a trait performs a function (function meaning it increases the reproductive fitness of the organism) effectively and it is difficult to conceive of an alternative scenario where the trait would have evolved. Gangstead observes that the eye is an extreme example, as it is highly effective at the function of seeing, yet it is difficult to conceive of a scenario through which it would have evolved other than one where it was selected for its optical properties and thereby its function of sight. Evolutionary psychologists have also argued that a lack of special design is evidence of a trait being a byproduct rather than an adaptation; for example, it has been found that men find women's scent more attractive when they are fertile phase than their infertile luteal phase. While men finding this scent more attractive may be an adaptation, there is no evidence that women possess the adaptation to smell better when fertile, instead it is likely a byproduct of changing hormone levels, which men have been selected to detect and differently evaluate.<ref>Deaux, Kay, and Mark Snyder, eds. The Oxford handbook of personality and social psychology. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp.154-156</ref> Evolutionary psychologists consider evidence that a trait is an adaptation if it has many features that are improbably well suited to solving an ancestral adaptive problem, that the phenotypic properties are unlikely to have arisen by chance alone and that the trait is not better explained as a  byproduct or the consequence of some other adaptive problem. To show a trait is a byproduct, it must be shown that something else is an adaptation and then that the trait in question is a side effect of that adaptation.<ref>Tooby, John, and Leda Cosmides. \"Conceptual foundations of evolutionary psychology.\" The handbook of evolutionary psychology (2005): 5-67, p.28</ref> Co-opted exaptationist and spandrel hypotheses have an additional evidentiary burden compared to adaptationist hypotheses, as they must identify both the later co-opted functionality and the original adaptational functionality; it is not sufficient simply to propose an alternative exaptationist or spandrel hypotheses to the adaptationist one, rather these evidentiary burdens must be met.<ref>Buss, David M., Martie G.

Wakefield. \"Adaptations, exaptations, and spandrels.\" American psychologist 53, no. 5 (1998): 533, p.546</ref> Leda Cosmides argues that raising the objection that a trait could be a spandrel is meaningless because an organism contains a potentially infinite number of spandrels. Instead, one must demonstrate what the trait is a spandrel of, rather than simply just suggesting it could be a spandrel.<ref>The Dissenter, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjL-13L6quE #35 Leda Cosmides: Everything You've Ever Wanted to Know About Evolutionary Psychology] YouTube, 47:40-48:50</ref>\n\nDurrant et al agree that alternative explanations to adaptation have to be considered. The authors argue that an issue with adaptationist explanations is [[underdetermination]]. A theory is underdetermined when the evidence used to support it could be equally used to support one or more other competing theories. Underdetermination is an issue in science due to the [[problem of induction]]; in the great majority of cases, the truth of the data does not deductively entail the truth of the hypothesis.<ref>Lipton, Peter. Inference to the best explanation. Routledge, 2003.</ref> While this is an issue in general in science, sciences which deal with unobserved entities and processes, which evolutionary psychology does, are particularly vulnerable. Even if the theory can make predictions, these predictions do not necessarily confirm the hypothesis, as competing theory could also predict it; the authors argue that the prediction of novel facts does not necessarily mean acceptance of the theory, historically speaking, observing that while Einstein's theory of general relativity is famously held as being accepted because it predicted light would bend around black holes (which was unknown at the time), neither Einstein nor many of his contemporaries regarded it as a strong confirmation of his theory. Durrant et al thus propose that the problem of underdetermination can be solved by judging competing theories on a range of criteria to determine which one best explains phenomena by having the best explanatory coherence; criteria suggested include explanatory breadth (which theory explains the great range of facts), simplicity (which theory requires the fewest special assumptions) and analogy (the theory is supported by analogy to theories scientists already find credible). Thus any criticism of adaptationist theories must demonstrate that an alternative theory offers greater explanatory coherence than the adaptationist one.<ref>Durrant, Russil & Haig, Brian. (2001).

That is, the inability to correctly choose, from a number of possible answers to the question: \"what is the function of a given mechanism?\"<ref name=Bradley2005/>\n\nThe ''disjunction problem''<ref name=Bradley2005/><ref>Fodor, Jerry (1991). Reply to Millikan. In B. Loewer & G. Rey (Eds.), Meaning in mind. Fodor and his critic. Oxford, England: Blackwell.</ref> occurs when a mechanism appears to respond to one thing (''F''), but is also correlated with another (''G''). Whenever ''F'' is present, ''G'' is also present, and the mechanism seems to respond to both ''F'' and ''G''. The difficulty thus involves deciding whether to characterize the mechanism's adaptive function as being related to ''F'', ''G'', or ''both''. \"For example, a frogs pre-catching mechanism responds to flies, bees, food pellets, etc.; so is its adaptation attuned to flies, bees, fleebees, pellets, all of these, or just some?\"<ref name=Bradley2005/>\n\nThe ''grain problem''<ref name=Bradley2005/><ref>Sterelny, K., & Griffiths, P. E. (1999). Sex and death: An Introduction to Philosophy of Biology. London: University of Chicago Press.</ref> refers to the challenge in knowing what kind of environmental 'problem' an adaptive mental mechanism might have solved. As summarized by Sterenly & Griffiths (1999): \"What are the problems 'out there' in the environment? Is the problem of mate choice a single problem or a mosaic of many distinct problems? These problems might include: When should I be unfaithful to my usual partner? When should I desert my old partner? When should I help my sibs find a partner? When and how should I punish infidelity?\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sterelny | first1 = K. | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = P.

Franks states that \"if both adaptive problems and adaptive solutions are indeterminate, what chance is there for evolutionary psychology?\"<ref name=Bradley2005/>\n\nFranks also states that \"The arguments in no sense count against a general evolutionary explanation of psychology.\" and that by relaxing assumptions the problems may be avoided, although this may reduce the ability to make detailed models.<ref name=Bradley2005/>\n\n== Behaviors that reduce reproductive success ==\n\"Maladaptive\" behaviors such as [[homosexuality]] and [[suicide]] seem to reduce reproductive success and pose a challenge for evolutionary psychology.

It was the basis for Social Darwinism, the belief that helping the poor and sick would get in the way of evolution, which depends on the survival of the fittest. Today, biologists denounce the Naturalistic Fallacy because they want to describe the natural world honestly, without people deriving morals about how we ought to behave -- as in: If birds and beasts engage in adultery, infanticide, cannibalism, it must be OK. The [[moralistic fallacy]] is that what is good is found in nature. It lies behind the bad science in nature-documentary voiceovers: lions are mercy-killers of the weak and sick, mice feel no pain when cats eat them, dung beetles recycle dung to benefit the ecosystem and so on. It also lies behind the romantic belief that humans cannot harbor desires to kill, rape, lie, or steal because that would be too depressing or reactionary.<ref>Q&A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate', United Press International, 10/30/2002, http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilarly, the authors of ''A Natural History of Rape'', Thornhill and Palmer, as well as McKibbin et al. respond to allegations that evolutionary psychologists legitimizes rape by arguing that their critics' reasoning is a naturalistic fallacy in the same way it would be a fallacy to accuse the scientists doing research on the causes of [[cancer]] of justifying cancer.

(2003) have stated that evolutionary psychologists are themselves confused about the naturalistic fallacy and misuse it to forestall legitimate ethical discussions. The authors have argued that a factual statement must be combined with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion. Thus, \"ought\" cannot be described ''exclusively'' from \"is\". They have suggested that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer's theory that rape increases the fitness of a woman's offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. have stated: \"Any critic who objects to Thornhill and Palmer's evolutionary interpretation of rape on ethical grounds is dismissed with the phrase 'naturalistic fallacy' like a child stupid enough to write 2+2=5, stifling any meaningful discussion of the ethical issues surrounding the subject of rape. Yet, it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way.\" However, in the same article these authors also note that \"...we want to stress that we are sympathetic with the goals of evolutionary psychology and think that research should proceed on all fronts, including the possibility that unethical behaviors such as rape evolved by natural selection\".<ref name=\"wilson2003\"/>\n\n== Political stance ==\n\nPart of the controversy has consisted in each side accusing the other of holding or supporting extreme political viewpoints: evolutionary psychology has often been accused of supporting right-wing politics, whereas critics have been accused of being motivated by [[Marxism|Marxist]] view points.<ref name=\"Plotkin, Henry p.149\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Segerstr\u00e5le, Ullica Christina Olofsdotter |title=Defenders of the truth : the battle for science in the sociobiology debate and beyond |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages=|isbn=978-0-19-850505-1 |oclc=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nLinguist and activist [[Noam Chomsky]] has said that evolutionary psychologists often ignore evidence that might harm the political status quo:\n\n{{quote|The founder of what is now called \"sociobiology\" or \"evolutionary psychology\"-the natural historian and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]-concluded from his investigations of animals and human life and society that \"mutual aid\" was a primary factor in evolution, which tended naturally toward [[Anarchist communism|communist anarchism]]...Of course, Kropotkin is not considered the founding figure of the field and is usually dismissed if mentioned at all, because his quasi-Darwinian speculations led to unwanted conclusions.<ref name=\"ChomskyBook\">{{cite book |last1=Bricmont|first1=Jean|last2=Franck|first2=Julie|year=2010|title=Chomsky Notebook}}</ref>}}\n\nChomsky has also said that not enough is known about human nature to point to any political conclusions.<ref name=\"ChomskyBook\"/>\n\nEvolutionary psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] argues that \"promoting recognition of the true power and role of instincts is not the same as advocating the total abandonment of social restraint\".<ref>Wilson, G.D.

Evolutionary psychology often assumes that human evolution occurred in a uniform environment, and critics suggest that we know so little about the environment (or probably multiple environments) in which homo sapiens evolved, that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative.<ref name=\"Plotkin, Henry p.149\">Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History. Blackwell. p.149.</ref>\n\nThe evolutionary psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides state that research is confined to certainties about the past, such as pregnancies only occurring in women, and that humans lived in groups. They argue that there are many environmental features that are known regarding our species' evolutionary history. They argue that our [[hunter-gatherer]] ancestors dealt with predators and prey, [[foraging|food acquisition]] and sharing, mate choice, child rearing, interpersonal aggression, interpersonal assistance, diseases and a host of other fairly predictable challenges that constituted significant selection pressures. Knowledge also include things such as nomadic, kin-based lifestyle in small groups, long life for mammals, low fertility for mammals, long female pregnancy and lactation, cooperative hunting and aggression, tool use, and sexual division of labor.<ref>The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology (2005), David M. Buss, Chapter 1, pp. 5-67, Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides</ref> Tooby and Cosmides thus argue that enough can be known about the EEA to make hypotheses and predictions.<ref>Tooby, John, and Leda Cosmides. \"Letter to the Editor of The New York Review of Books on Stephen Jay Gould\u2019s \u2018Darwinian Fundamentalism\u2019(June 12, 1997) and \u2018Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism\u2019(June 26, 1997).\" Verf\u00fcgbar unter: http://cogweb. ucla. edu/Debate/CEP_Gould. html [Datum des Zugriffs: 12.02. 2009] (1997).</ref>\n\nDavid Buss also argued that the EEA could be sufficiently known to make predictions in evolutionary psychology. Buss argued that aspects of the environment are known - the Earth's gravity was the same, as was its atmosphere. Dinosaurs and giant Carboniferous insects were extinct and humans still lived in groups, while there were two sexes. Groups consisted of old and young members, healthy and sick, varying degrees of relatedness and so on. Bus notes that while some critics agree that the general environment is known, the specific selection pressures might never be understood due to being highly context sensitive. David Buller, a who advanced such a criticism, used an analogy to birds, observing that while all male birds must attract all female birds, they do so in different ways; Buller alleges that the evidence is simply not available to be able to determine which the specific mate-attraction problems for humans. However, Buss argues that this can be solved by proposing different evolutionary psychology hypotheses and uses data, confirmation strategies and discovery heuristics to determine which ones can be advanced. Furthermore, Buss argues this criticism is selectively sceptical - Buss notes that Buller had no problem writing confidently about the evolved mate functions of bird species, of whom there is even less knowledge about selective pressures, so it is not clear why Buller is willing to infer the mating strategies of ancestral birds by analysing living ones yet is unwilling to infer the mating strategies of ancient humans by analysing living humans.<ref>Buss, David M., ed. The handbook of evolutionary psychology. John Wiley & Sons, 2005, pp.147-149</ref>\n\nJohn Alcock argues that the fact that many traits in humans are presently adaptive is suggestive that they originally developed as adaptions. This is because if an organism diverges too much from its original environment, it is unlikely that it's traits will be adaptive to the new, changed environment and it is at risk of going extinct. Thus evolutionary psychologists doubt that the modern world is largely novel compared to that of the EEA.<ref>Maryanski, Alexandra, Richard Machalek, and Jonathan H. Turner.

Pinker argues that the evidence indicates that the ancestral environment lacked \"agriculture, contraception, high-tech medicine, mass media, mass-produced goods, money, police, armies, communities of strangers, and other modern features\", which Pinker argues all have profound implications for minds that evolved in such an environment.<ref>Kalant, Harold, Steven Pinker, and Werner Kalow. \"Evolutionary psychology: an exchange.\" Exchange 44, no. 15 (1997).

Their model suggested that, on average, the costs of rape for a typical 25-year-old male outweigh benefits by a factor of ten to one. On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men.

Stewart-Williams argues that if evolutionary psychology hypotheses can't be falsified, then neither could competing explanations, because if alternative explanations (e.g sociocultural hypotheses) were proven true, this would automatically falsify the competing evolutionary psychology hypothesis, so  for competing explanations to be true, then evolutionary psychology hypothesis must be false and thus falsifiable.<ref>Stewart-Williams, Steve.

Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp-287-288</ref>\n\nEdward Hagen observes that critics of evolutionary psychology often argue that because a trait could have evolved as an adaptation or a by-product, it is impossible to determine which it is since it evolved in a past environment and thus evolutionary psychology hypotheses about a traits origin are untestable. According to Hagen, critics using this argument have a flawed understanding of science; Hagen argues that science is fundamentally an abductivist methodology e.g inference to the best explanation. Hagen argues that hypotheses compete to provide the best explanation of a phenomenon, where \"best\" is measured via criteria like predicting new and surprising observations, parsimony, coherence and so on. Abduction does not require scientist to provide direct evidence for ever single prediction. Evolutionary psychology hypotheses make predictions and thus compete with other hypotheses to explain traits.<ref>Edward Hagen, [https://evolution-institute.org/is-evolutionary-psychology-impossible/ ''Is Evolutionary Psychology Impossible?''], The Evolution Institute, 28/01/2020</ref>\n\nDominic Murphy explains that one of the most common objections to evolutionary psychology is the \"time machine\" argument. This is the argument that while evolutionary psychology can make predictions about things we should see in the modern world if the evolutionary psychology hypothesis is true, there are too many alternate explanations for the origin of a trait which would also predict this phenomena e.g a trait evolving as a by-product could predict the same evidence as the same trait evolving as an adaptation. Therefore, a potentially infinite number of alternative historical explanations are possible. Thus without a time machine, it is impossible to determine which possible explanation for the evidence seen in the modern day is correct. Murphy argues this argument is flawed on multiple grounds. Firstly, if an explanation for a trait is forwarded and a prediction for what we would see in the modern day is made based on that explanation, then one cannot just propose alternative explanations. Instead, these alternative explanations require testable predictions of their own to be forwarded, preferably multiple different predictions. In addition, not all explanations may predict the same evidence, thus Murphy argues that if one explanation predicts a great deal of evidence for modern day observations and alternative explanations struggle to explain this, then it is reasonable to have confidence in the former explanation. In addition, Murphy argues that if the \"time machine\" argument was applied to other sciences, it would lead to absurd results - Murphy observes that cosmologists have confirmed predictions about the Big Bang by studying available astronomical evidence and current understanding of particle physics, with no need for a time machine to travel back to the beginning of the universe. Similarly, geologists and physicists investigating the hypothesis that it was an asteroid impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs did so by looking for modern day evidence. Murphy thus concludes that the onus is on the sceptics to prove why evolutionary psychology is allegedly untestable on \"time machine\" grounds if other historical sciences are not, as \"methods should be judged across the board, not singled out for ridicule in one context.\"<ref>Murphy, Dominic. \"Adaptationism and psychological explanation.\" In Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 161-184. Springer, Boston, MA, 2003.</ref> A similar argument was made by Andrew Goldfinch, who argued that this entire criticism is due to the issue of underdetermination - many rival explanations can accommodate a phenomenon. Furthermore, one can also challenge the interpretation of the results, revise an explanation to accommodate a novel fact or even question the reliability of the experiments conducted. However, Goldfinch argues that this is a ubiquitous problem in science and not unique to evolutionary psychology, so it is not clear why this is seen as a criticism of the field if it would be dismissed elsewhere. Lastly, Goldfinch argues that one way to distinguish between competing explanations is to make a distinction between programmes that makes new predictions and discovers novel facts and those programmes that simply accommodate the fresh discoveries of other programmes. Those programmes which are actually making and testing predictions should be favoured over those simply accommodating the discoveries of others.<ref>Goldfinch, Andrew.

Many critics have pointed out that many traits considered universal at some stage or another by evolutionary psychologists often turn out to be dependent on cultural and particular historical circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Paulson |first1=William R. |authorlink1=|title=Literary Culture in a World Transformed: A Future for the Humanities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFH-A8VQoxwC&pg=PA83 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |location=Ithaca |isbn=978-0-8014-8730-9 |page=83 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}</ref><ref name=\"Lancaster 2003\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520236202|title=The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture|last=Lancaster|first=Roger|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520236202|location=Berkeley|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=Stephen |authorlink1=Stephen Davies (philosopher) |title=The Artful Species: Aesthetics, Art, and Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rbn9pkAfjEC&pg=PA142 |year=2012 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-965854-1 |page=142 |chapter=|chapterurl=}}</ref> Critics allege that evolutionary psychologists tend to assume that their own current cultural context represents a universal human nature. For example, [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] Susan McKinnon argues that evolutionary theories of [[kinship]] rest on [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] presuppositions. Evolutionary psychologists assert that the degree of genetic relatedness determines the extent of kinship (e.g., solidarity, nurturance, and altruism) because in order to maximize their own reproductive success, people \"invest\" only in their own genetic children or closely related kin. [[Steven Pinker]], for instance, stated \"You're either someone's mother or you aren't\". McKinnon argues that such biologically centered constructions of relatedness result from a specific cultural context: the kinship category \"mother\" is relatively self-evident in Anglo-American cultures where biology is privileged but not in other societies where rank and marital status, not biology, determine who counts as a mother or where mother's sisters are also considered mothers and one's mother's brother is understood as the \"male mother\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKinnon |first1=Susan |authorlink1=|editor1-first=Susan |editor1-last=McKinnon |editor2-first=Sydel |editor2-last=Silverman |title=Complexities: Beyond Nature and Nurture |year=2005 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chacago |isbn=978-0-226-50023-2 |pages=106\u2013131 |chapter=On Kinship and Marriage: A Critique of the Genetic and Gender Calculus of Evolutionary Psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QR-LfboRTwUC&pg=PA106 }}</ref>\n\nIn a review of Pinker's book on evolutionary psychology (''[[The Blank Slate]]''), [[Louis Menand]] wrote: \"''In general, the views that Pinker derives from 'the new sciences of human nature' are mainstream Clinton-era views: incarceration is regrettable but necessary; sexism is unacceptable, but men and women will always have different attitudes toward sex; dialogue is preferable to threats of force in defusing ethnic and nationalist conflicts; most group stereotypes are roughly correct, but we should never judge an individual by group stereotypes; rectitude is all very well, but 'noble guys tend to finish last'; and so on.''\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Menand |first=Louis |title=What Comes Naturally |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=November 22, 2002 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/11/25/021125crbo_books |accessdate=March 26, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, evolutionary psychologists{{who|date=July 2011}} point out that their research actually focuses on commonalities between people of different cultures to help to identify \"human psychological nature\" and [[cultural universals]].

Evolutionary psychologists assume that genes contain instructions for building and operating an organism and that these instructions are passed from one generation to the next via genes.<ref name=\"Lickliter&Honeycutt1\"/>\n\nLickliter and Honeycutt (2003) have argued that evolutionary psychology is a predeterministic and [[Preformationism|preformationistic]] approach that assumes that physical and psychological traits are predetermined and programmed while virtually ignoring non-genetic factors involved in human development. Even when evolutionary psychologists acknowledge the influence of the environment, they reduce its role to that of an activator or trigger of the predetermined developmental instructions presumed to be encoded in a person's genes. Lickliter and Honeycutt have stated that the assumption of genetic determinism is most evident in the theory that learning and reasoning are governed by innate, domain-specific modules. Evolutionary psychologists assume that modules preexist individual development and lie dormant in the structure of the organism, awaiting activation by some (usually unspecified) experiential events. Lickliter and Honeycutt have opposed this view and suggested that it is the entire developmental system, including the specific features of the environment a person actually encounters and interacts with (and not the environments of distant ancestors) that brings about any modularity of cognitive function.<ref name=\"Lickliter&Honeycutt1\"/>\n\nCritics argue that a reductionist analysis of the relationship between genes and behavior results in a flawed research program and a restricted interpretation of the evidence, creating problems for the creation of models attempting to explain behavior. Lewontin, Rose & Kamin instead advocate a [[dialectical]] interpretation of behavior in which \"it is not just that wholes are more than the sum of their parts, it is that parts become qualitatively new by being parts of the whole\". They argue that reductionist explanations such as the hierarchical reductionism proposed by [[Richard Dawkins]] will cause the researcher to miss dialectical ones.<ref name=\"Lewontin, R.C. 1984\"/> Similarly, [[Hilary Rose (sociologist)|Hilary Rose]] criticizes evolutionary psychologists' explanations of [[child abuse]] as excessively reductionist. As an example she cites [[Martin Daly (professor)|Martin Daly]] and Margot Wilson's theory that stepfathers are more abusive because they lack the nurturing instinct of natural parents and can increase their reproductive success in this way. According to Rose this does not explain why most stepfathers do not abuse their children and why some biological fathers do. She also argues that cultural pressures can override the genetic predisposition to nurture as in the case of sex-selective [[infanticide]] prevalent in some cultures where male offspring are favored over female offspring.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rose |first1=Hilary |authorlink1= |editor1-first=Steven |editor1-last=Rose |editor1-link= |editor2-first=Hilary |editor2-last=Rose |title=Alas, Poor Darwin: Arguments against Evolutionary Psychology |year=200 |publisher=Harmony Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-609-60513-4 |pages=127\u201353 |chapter=Colonizing the Social Sciences? |chapterurl= |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/alaspoordarwin00hila }}</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists Workman and Reader reply that while reductionism may be a \"dirty word\" to some it is actually an important scientific principle. They argue it is at the root of discoveries such as the world being made up of atoms and complex life being the result of evolution. At the same time they emphasize that it is important to look at all \"levels\" of explanations, e.g. both psychologists looking at environmental causes of depression and neuroscientists looking the brain contribute to different aspects of our knowledge of depression. Workman and Reader also deny the accusation of genetic determinism, asserting that genes usually do not cause behaviors absolutely but predispose to certain behaviors that are affected by factors such as culture and an individual's life history.<ref>Evolutionary psychology: an introduction, Lance Workman, Will Reader, Cambridge University Press; 2004, p25-26</ref>\n\n== Alternative explanations ==\n\n=== Adaptive explanations vs. environmental, cultural, social, and dialectical explanations ===\nA common critique is that evolutionary psychology does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases.<ref name=\"EBO instinct\">\"instinct.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Some studies have been criticized for their tendency to attribute to evolutionary processes elements of human cognition that may be attributable to social processes (e.g. preference for particular physical features in mates), cultural artifacts (e.g. patriarchy and the roles of women in society), or dialectical considerations (e.g. behaviours in which biology interacts with society, as when a biologically determined skin colour determines how one is treated). Evolutionary psychologists are frequently criticized for ignoring the vast bodies of literature in psychology, philosophy, politics and social studies. Both sides of the debate stress that statements such as \"biology vs. environment\" and \"genes vs. culture\" amount to [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]], and outspoken critics of [[sociobiology]] such as [[Richard Lewontin]], Steven Rose and [[Leon Kamin]] helped to popularise a \"dialectical\" approach to questions of human behaviour, where biology and environment interact in complex ways to produce what we see.<ref>Lewontin, Rose & Kamin (1984) \"Biology, Ideology and Human Nature: Not In Our Genes\", Chapter 10</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists respond that their discipline is not primarily concerned with explaining the behavior of specific individuals, but rather broad categories of human behaviors across societies and cultures. It is the search for species-wide psychological adaptations (or \"human nature\") that distinguishes evolutionary psychology from purely cultural or social explanations. These psychological adaptations include cognitive decision rules that respond to different environmental, cultural, and social circumstances in ways that are (on average) adaptive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nEvolutionary psychologists Confer et al. argue that evolutionary psychology fully accepts nature-nurture interactionism, and that it is possible to test the theories in order to distinguish between different explanations.<ref name=AmPs2010/>\n\n=== Adaptive explanations vs. other evolutionary mechanisms ===\n\nCritics point out that within evolutionary biology there are many other non-adaptive pathways along which evolution can move to produce the behaviors seen in humans today. Natural selection is not the only evolutionary process that can change gene frequencies and produce novel traits. [[Genetic drift]] is caused by chance variation in the genes, environment, or development. Evolutionary by-products are traits that were not specially designed for an adaptive function, although they may also be species-typical and may also confer benefits on the organism. A \"[[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]\" is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould]] and Lewontin (1979a) for traits which confer no adaptive advantage to an organism, but are 'carried along' by an adaptive trait. Gould advocates the hypothesis that cognition in humans came about as a spandrel: \"Natural selection made the human brain big, but most of our mental properties and potentials may be spandrels \u2013 that is, nonadaptive side consequences of building a device with such structural complexity\".<ref>Quote from Stephen Jay Gould, ''The Pleasures of Pluralism'', p.11</ref> Once a trait acquired by some other mechanism confers an adaptive advantage, it may be open to further selection as an \"[[exaptation]]\".<ref name=\"Gould1982\">{{cite journal | last1=Gould | first1=S.

Hagen argues that most organisms do not survive to reproduce and that is only through adaptations that organisms can hope to do so; alternate explanations like genetic drift are only relevant if an organism can survive and reproduce in the first place and it is the fact that organisms do manage survive and reproduce, despite the odds against such a thing occurring, that evolutionary psychologists are interested in.<ref>Hagen, Edward H. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c0a/00542025db83139099e0ce4f3c17b8369ab6.pdf ''Invariant world, invariant mind. Evolutionary psychology and its critics''.] (2014).</ref> Similarly, Steven Pinker argues that complex organs like eyes require many precise parts in exacting arrangements, which indicates they evolved via selective pressure, as it would be extremely improbable for such an arrangement to arise fortuitously out of genetic drift or as a byproduct of another trait.<ref>Kalant, Harold, Steven Pinker, and Werner Kalow. \"Evolutionary psychology: an exchange.\" Exchange 44, no. 15 (1997). The New York Review of Books</ref> Hagen also argues that a way to distinguish spandrels from adaptations is that adaptations have evidence of design (that is to say they did not simply arise by pure chance but were selected for). While Hagen agrees that one can risk over-attributing adaptation, he observes that one can also risk under-attributing it as well. Hagen argues that tonsils can become infected and it needs to be known whether or not it is safe to remove them. Insisting that tonsils could just be spandrels is not helpful, whereas hypothesising that they may be adapations allows one to make predictions about them to see if they do have a function and thus whether or not it is safe to remove them.<ref>Hagen, Edward H. \"Controversial issues in evolutionary psychology.\" The handbook of evolutionary psychology (2005): 145-173.</ref>  Conversely, Steve Stewart-Williams argues that it is not true that evolutionary psychologists do not consider non-adaptive explanations, arguing that evolutionary psychologists have suggested alternate explanations such as byproducts, observing that the hypothesis that obesity is caused by a mismatch between ancestral and modern environments is one of the most famous cases of a byproduct explanation in evolutionary psychology.<ref>Stewart-Williams, Steve. The ape that understood the universe: How the mind and culture evolve. Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp-290-291</ref> Pinker makes a similar argument, arguing that evolutionary psychology has long held the view that things such as art, music, science, religion and dreams are probably byproducts or spandrels of other mental traits.<ref>Kalant, Harold, Steven Pinker, and Werner Kalow. \"Evolutionary psychology: an exchange.\" Exchange 44, no. 15 (1997). The New York Review of Books</ref> \n\nLaith Al-Shawaf argues that evolutionary psychologists use adaptations as a starting point for research - if the evidence in favour of the adaptation hypothesis fails to materialise, evolutionary psychologists will abandon it, so it is untrue to claim that evolutionary psychologists do not consider alternate hypotheses.<ref>Al-Shawaf, Laith [https://areomagazine.com/2019/08/20/seven-key-misconceptions-about-evolutionary-psychology/ \"Seven Key Misconceptions about Evolutionary Psychology], Aero Magazine, 20.8.2019</ref> Sven Walter observes that while critics of adaptationist hypotheses argue that alternative evolutionary explanations could exist, what these alternative explanations are and how they lead to the kind of traits evolutionary psychologists study is not always elaborated upon (for example, if a trait is proposed to be a byproduct rather than an adaptation, it is not always clear what it is supposed to be a byproduct of).<ref>[[Bo Winegard]], Critics of Evolutionary Psychology Say It\u2019s All Just Storytelling. Here\u2019s Why They\u2019re Wrong, Arc Digital Media, 03.04.2018.</ref>. Thus Walter argues that if there is no reasonably plausible alternative hypothesis, if the adaptationist hypotheses is logically plausible and if empirical evidence exists to support it, then there is thus reasonable support for the evolutionary psychologist's adaptationist hypothesis.<ref>Sven Walter, Review: Robert C.

Rather, to show something is an adaptation it must be shown that it exhibits special design. Special design is when a trait performs a function (function meaning it increases the reproductive fitness of the organism) effectively and it is difficult to conceive of an alternative scenario where the trait would have evolved. Gangstead observes that the eye is an extreme example, as it is highly effective at the function of seeing, yet it is difficult to conceive of a scenario through which it would have evolved other than one where it was selected for its optical properties and thereby its function of sight. Evolutionary psychologists have also argued that a lack of special design is evidence of a trait being a byproduct rather than an adaptation; for example, it has been found that men find women's scent more attractive when they are fertile phase than their infertile luteal phase. While men finding this scent more attractive may be an adaptation, there is no evidence that women possess the adaptation to smell better when fertile, instead it is likely a byproduct of changing hormone levels, which men have been selected to detect and differently evaluate.<ref>Deaux, Kay, and Mark Snyder, eds. The Oxford handbook of personality and social psychology. Oxford University Press, 2012, pp.154-156</ref> Evolutionary psychologists consider evidence that a trait is an adaptation if it has many features that are improbably well suited to solving an ancestral adaptive problem, that the phenotypic properties are unlikely to have arisen by chance alone and that the trait is not better explained as a  byproduct or the consequence of some other adaptive problem. To show a trait is a byproduct, it must be shown that something else is an adaptation and then that the trait in question is a side effect of that adaptation.<ref>Tooby, John, and Leda Cosmides. \"Conceptual foundations of evolutionary psychology.\" The handbook of evolutionary psychology (2005): 5-67, p.28</ref> Co-opted exaptationist and spandrel hypotheses have an additional evidentiary burden compared to adaptationist hypotheses, as they must identify both the later co-opted functionality and the original adaptational functionality; it is not sufficient simply to propose an alternative exaptationist or spandrel hypotheses to the adaptationist one, rather these evidentiary burdens must be met.<ref>Buss, David M., Martie G. Haselton, Todd K. Shackelford, April L. Bleske, and Jerome C. Wakefield. \"Adaptations, exaptations, and spandrels.\" American psychologist 53, no. 5 (1998): 533, p.546</ref> Leda Cosmides argues that raising the objection that a trait could be a spandrel is meaningless because an organism contains a potentially infinite number of spandrels. Instead, one must demonstrate what the trait is a spandrel of, rather than simply just suggesting it could be a spandrel.<ref>The Dissenter, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjL-13L6quE #35 Leda Cosmides: Everything You've Ever Wanted to Know About Evolutionary Psychology] YouTube, 47:40-48:50</ref>\n\nDurrant et al agree that alternative explanations to adaptation have to be considered. The authors argue that an issue with adaptationist explanations is [[underdetermination]]. A theory is underdetermined when the evidence used to support it could be equally used to support one or more other competing theories. Underdetermination is an issue in science due to the [[problem of induction]]; in the great majority of cases, the truth of the data does not deductively entail the truth of the hypothesis.<ref>Lipton, Peter. Inference to the best explanation. Routledge, 2003.</ref> While this is an issue in general in science, sciences which deal with unobserved entities and processes, which evolutionary psychology does, are particularly vulnerable. Even if the theory can make predictions, these predictions do not necessarily confirm the hypothesis, as competing theory could also predict it; the authors argue that the prediction of novel facts does not necessarily mean acceptance of the theory, historically speaking, observing that while Einstein's theory of general relativity is famously held as being accepted because it predicted light would bend around black holes (which was unknown at the time), neither Einstein nor many of his contemporaries regarded it as a strong confirmation of his theory. Durrant et al thus propose that the problem of underdetermination can be solved by judging competing theories on a range of criteria to determine which one best explains phenomena by having the best explanatory coherence; criteria suggested include explanatory breadth (which theory explains the great range of facts), simplicity (which theory requires the fewest special assumptions) and analogy (the theory is supported by analogy to theories scientists already find credible). Thus any criticism of adaptationist theories must demonstrate that an alternative theory offers greater explanatory coherence than the adaptationist one.<ref>Durrant, Russil & Haig, Brian. (2001).

Whenever ''F'' is present, ''G'' is also present, and the mechanism seems to respond to both ''F'' and ''G''. The difficulty thus involves deciding whether to characterize the mechanism's adaptive function as being related to ''F'', ''G'', or ''both''. \"For example, a frogs pre-catching mechanism responds to flies, bees, food pellets, etc.; so is its adaptation attuned to flies, bees, fleebees, pellets, all of these, or just some?\"<ref name=Bradley2005/>\n\nThe ''grain problem''<ref name=Bradley2005/><ref>Sterelny, K., & Griffiths, P.

It was the basis for Social Darwinism, the belief that helping the poor and sick would get in the way of evolution, which depends on the survival of the fittest. Today, biologists denounce the Naturalistic Fallacy because they want to describe the natural world honestly, without people deriving morals about how we ought to behave -- as in: If birds and beasts engage in adultery, infanticide, cannibalism, it must be OK. The [[moralistic fallacy]] is that what is good is found in nature. It lies behind the bad science in nature-documentary voiceovers: lions are mercy-killers of the weak and sick, mice feel no pain when cats eat them, dung beetles recycle dung to benefit the ecosystem and so on. It also lies behind the romantic belief that humans cannot harbor desires to kill, rape, lie, or steal because that would be too depressing or reactionary.<ref>Q&A: Steven Pinker of 'Blank Slate', United Press International, 10/30/2002, http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/media_articles/2002_10_30_upi.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilarly, the authors of ''A Natural History of Rape'', Thornhill and Palmer, as well as McKibbin et al. respond to allegations that evolutionary psychologists legitimizes rape by arguing that their critics' reasoning is a naturalistic fallacy in the same way it would be a fallacy to accuse the scientists doing research on the causes of [[cancer]] of justifying cancer.

(2003) have stated that evolutionary psychologists are themselves confused about the naturalistic fallacy and misuse it to forestall legitimate ethical discussions. The authors have argued that a factual statement must be combined with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion. Thus, \"ought\" cannot be described ''exclusively'' from \"is\". They have suggested that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer's theory that rape increases the fitness of a woman's offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. have stated: \"Any critic who objects to Thornhill and Palmer's evolutionary interpretation of rape on ethical grounds is dismissed with the phrase 'naturalistic fallacy' like a child stupid enough to write 2+2=5, stifling any meaningful discussion of the ethical issues surrounding the subject of rape. Yet, it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way.\" However, in the same article these authors also note that \"...we want to stress that we are sympathetic with the goals of evolutionary psychology and think that research should proceed on all fronts, including the possibility that unethical behaviors such as rape evolved by natural selection\".<ref name=\"wilson2003\"/>\n\n== Political stance ==\n\nPart of the controversy has consisted in each side accusing the other of holding or supporting extreme political viewpoints: evolutionary psychology has often been accused of supporting right-wing politics, whereas critics have been accused of being motivated by [[Marxism|Marxist]] view points.<ref name=\"Plotkin, Henry p.149\"/><ref>{{cite book |author=Segerstr\u00e5le, Ullica Christina Olofsdotter |title=Defenders of the truth : the battle for science in the sociobiology debate and beyond |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2000 |pages=|isbn=978-0-19-850505-1 |oclc=|doi=}}</ref>\n\nLinguist and activist [[Noam Chomsky]] has said that evolutionary psychologists often ignore evidence that might harm the political status quo:\n\n{{quote|The founder of what is now called \"sociobiology\" or \"evolutionary psychology\"-the natural historian and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]-concluded from his investigations of animals and human life and society that \"mutual aid\" was a primary factor in evolution, which tended naturally toward [[Anarchist communism|communist anarchism]]....Of course, Kropotkin is not considered the founding figure of the field and is usually dismissed if mentioned at all, because his quasi-Darwinian speculations led to unwanted conclusions.<ref name=\"ChomskyBook\">{{cite book |last1=Bricmont|first1=Jean|last2=Franck|first2=Julie|year=2010|title=Chomsky Notebook}}</ref>}}\n\nChomsky has also said that not enough is known about human nature to point to any political conclusions.<ref name=\"ChomskyBook\"/>\n\nEvolutionary psychologist [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]] argues that \"promoting recognition of the true power and role of instincts is not the same as advocating the total abandonment of social restraint\".<ref>Wilson, G.D.

Evolutionary psychologists conducted a 2007 study investigating the views of a sample of 168 United States [[PhD]] psychology students. The authors concluded that those who self-identified as [[Adaptationism|adaptationists]] were much less conservative than the general population average.
