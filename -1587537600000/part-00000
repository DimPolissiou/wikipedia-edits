Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. However, that was not the end of Yasin's ordeal, as he was charged with raping Poon and brought back to court. At the trial, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the abundant forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimony given by Harun (who became the prosecution's chief witness) against him. At the end of the trial, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and this jail sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death, making Yasin having to spend a total of 10 years in prison. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. However, that was not the end for Yasin's ordeal, as he was charged with raping Poon and brought back to court. At the trial, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the abundant forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimony given by Harun (who became the prosecution's chief witness) against him. At the end of the trial, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and this jail sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death, making Yasin having to spend a total of 10 years in prison. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

The crew abandoned the approach due to technical difficulties and the aircraft circled to attempt a second approach.
