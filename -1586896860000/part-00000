Ideally, adults should limit their screen time similar to children and only use screens for about two hours a day.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scripps.org/news_items/6626-how-much-screen-time-is-too-much|title=How Much Screen Time is Too Much?|last=February 22|last2=2019|date=2019-02-08|website=Scripps Health|access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref> However, many adults spend up to 11 hours a day looking at a screen. Adults many times work jobs that require viewing screens which leads to the high screen time usage.<ref name=\":4\" /> Adults obligated to view screens for a means of work may not be able to use screen time less than two hours, but there are other recommendations that help mitigate negative health effects. For example, breaking up continuous blocks of screen time usage by stretching, maintaining good posture, and intermittently focusing on a distant object for 20 seconds.<ref name=\":4\" /> Furthermore, to mitigate the behavioral effects, adults are encouraged not to eat in front of a screen to avoid habit formation and to keep track of their screen use every day.<ref name=\":4\" /> Specialists also recommend that adults analyze their daily screen time usage and replace some of the unnecessary usage with a physical activity or social event.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Children ===\nScreen time has been shown to affect children more than adults.

They suggest that infants younger than 18 months should not be exposed to any screens (apart from video chats).<ref name=\":4\" /> Kids around 18\u201324 months old should furthermore be limited to high-quality media sources and supervised by adults while doing so. Once kids reach ages 2\u20135, the amount of screen time increases to up to an hour a day on any device total.<ref name=\":4\" /> There is no formal recommendation beyond the age of 5. The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes the role of parents in controlling screen time after the age of 5.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAn ongoing study reported from the National Institutes of Health concluded that preteens who spent over 7 hours on screens a day and children who spend less than 7 hours a day had noticeably different development of their cerebral cortex. This part of the brain usually thins as people mature but the accelerated decrease could potentially be linked to amounts spent on screens.<ref name=\":4\" /> Long-lasting effects like this should be considered when trying to implement limitations for children. Parents should be involved in monitoring their child\u2019s screen usage and try to implement better and healthier practices by encouraging better bedtime routines, educating youth about the lasting effects, and limiting the number of available screens in the environment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=LeBourgeois |first1=Monique K. |last2=Hale |first2=Lauren |last3=Chang |first3=Anne-Marie |last4=Akacem |first4=Lameese D. |last5=Montgomery-Downs |first5=Hawley E. |last6=Buxton |first6=Orfeu M. |title=Digital Media and Sleep in Childhood and Adolescence |journal=Pediatrics |date=1 November 2017 |volume=140 |issue=Supplement 2 |pages=S92\u2013S96 |doi=10.1542/peds.2016-1758J |pmid=29093040 |pmc=5658795 }}</ref>\n\n=== Legal ===\nSome countries have begun implementing regulations on-screen time to protect their citizens.

Each puppet was controlled using a single carpet thread. [[Gerry Anderson]] and [[Arthur Provis]], the founders of APF, wanted to make ''Twizzle'' in the style of a feature film, with dynamic shooting and lighting. To this end, three-dimensional sets were used instead of traditional [[Flat (theatre)|flat backgrounds]] and puppeteers [[Christine Glanville]] and her colleagues operated the marionettes not from the studio floor, but from a bridge about {{Convert|6|ft|m|spell=in}} above it.<ref>La Rivi\u00e8re, pp.&nbsp;15\u201316.</ref> Speech was indicated by continually nodding the puppets' heads. The puppeteers' movements were guided by a rudimentary form of [[video assist]]: a TV camera mounted directly behind the film camera, which relayed footage to various monitors around the studio.<ref>Rogers et al., pp.&nbsp;11-12.</ref>\n\nThe puppets of the follow-up series, ''[[Torchy the Battery Boy]]'', were made of [[plastic wood]].

Lip-syncing was a key step in the development of Supermarionation and made it easier for the puppeteers to operate the marionettes in time with their dialogue, since it was no longer necessary to learn the characters' lines.<ref name=\"Hirsch61\"/><ref name=\"Rogers13\"/> Anderson also reflected that since exaggerated head movements were no longer required, the puppets \"were at last able to speak without their heads lolling about a like a broken toy.\"<ref name=\"Rogers13\"/>\n\nThe term \"Supermarionation\" was coined during the production of APF's fourth series, ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', whose final 13 episodes were the first to be credited as being \"filmed in Supermarionation\".<ref name=\"LaRivi\u00e8re67\"/>\n\n===Overview===\nSupermarionation used marionettes that were suspended and controlled using {{Convert|0.005|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[tungsten steel]] wires,<ref name=\"Hirsch61\"/><ref name=\"LaRivi\u00e8re28\">La Rivi\u00e8re, p&nbsp;28.</ref> replacing the carpet thread and [[twine]] strings that had been used prior to ''[[Four Feather Falls]]''.<ref name=\"Sellers92\">Sellers, p,&nbsp;92.</ref> To make the wires non-reflective, APF initially painted them black; this had the effect of thickening them and making them more visible to the camera, so the manufacturer, Ormiston Wire, devised a method of blackening them chemically to maintain their thinness.<ref name=\"LaRivi\u00e8re28\"/><ref name=\"Sellers92\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ormiston-wire.co.uk/case-studies/thunderbirds.php|title=''Thunderbirds'' Puppets Case Study|work=ormiston-wire.co.uk|publisher=Ormiston Wire|location=Isleworth, UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229043237/http://www.ormiston-wire.co.uk/case-studies/thunderbirds.php|archive-date=29 December 2016|url-status=live|access-date=16 September 2019}}</ref> During filming, the wires often needed to be concealed further by being sprayed with \"antiflare\" (grease mist) or painted various colours to blend in with the sets and backgrounds.<ref name=\"Holliss45\"/><ref name=\"Garland70\">Garland, p.&nbsp;70.</ref>\n\nPuppets and sets were built to {{Fraction|1|3}} scale, the former being roughly {{Convert|22|in|ft cm}} tall.<ref>Hirsch, pp.&nbsp;61 and 63.</ref> Balancing the weight was crucial: if a puppet was too light it would be too difficult to control; too heavy and the wires would not support it.<ref>Rogers et al., p.&nbsp;168.</ref> The puppets' eyes were moved by [[radio control]].<ref>Peel, p.&nbsp;18.</ref> Close-ups of [[Live action|live actors]] were used to show complex actions that the puppets could not perform, such as operating machinery.<ref name=\"Hirsch64\">Hirsch, p.&nbsp;64.</ref> Many of the special effects shots were filmed at a rate of 120 [[frames per second]] with lighting five times as strong as that normally used on a live-action production.<ref name=\"Hirsch64\"/> As sets were built to scale, it was often difficult to maintain a realistic sense of depth.<ref name=\"O'NeillGosnell4\"/><ref>Rogers et al., p.&nbsp;162.</ref>\n\nThe puppets' distinguishing features were their fibreglass heads and the internal [[solenoid]]s that powered the automatic mouth movement.<ref name=\"Percy\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/the-work-and-legacy-of-gerry-anderson/|title=The Life and Work of Gerry Anderson: Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour!|date=5 April 2017|last1=Percy|first1=Carolyn|journal=[[Wales Arts Review]]|editor1-last=Raymond|editor1-first=Gary|editor2-last=Morris|editor2-first=Phil|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006075259/http://www.walesartsreview.org/the-work-and-legacy-of-gerry-anderson/|archive-date=6 October 2017|url-status=live|access-date=1 July 2018}}</ref> Each episode's dialogue was pre-recorded on two tapes.<ref name=\"Hirsch61\"/><ref name=\"Holliss45\">Holliss, p.&nbsp;45.</ref><ref name=\"Peel17\">Peel, p.&nbsp;17.</ref> One would form the basis of the episode's soundtrack and be played during filming to guide the puppeteers;<ref name=\"Holliss45\"/><ref name=\"Peel17\"/> the sounds on the other would be converted into electrical signals.<ref name=\"Hirsch61\"/><ref name=\"Holliss45\"/><ref name=\"Peel17\"/> Two of each puppet's tungsten wires were electrified and conducted the signals into the puppet's head; there, the signals worked a solenoid that caused the puppet's lower lip to open and close with each syllable.<ref name=\"Hirsch61\"/><ref name=\"Peel17\"/><ref>La Rivi\u00e8re, p.&nbsp;29.</ref>\n\nTo accommodate the solenoids, the puppets' heads were made as hollow shells.

And I think it was that that drove me on to bring in all the improvements and techniques.\"<ref name=\"Sellers105\"/> Thom believes that the re-design reflected Anderson's desire for greater \"realism and spectacle\".<ref name=\"Thom\"/> Not all of Anderson's colleagues welcomed the change; puppet sculptor and operator John Blundall negatively referred to the new puppets as \"little humans\", stating that they had less personality than the pre-''Captain Scarlet'' versions and that the increased emphasis on realism inhibited the puppeteers' creativity.<ref name=\"Garland64\"/> According to director [[Desmond Saunders]], APF was trying \"anything to get [the puppets] to look like ordinary human beings. But they are not ordinary human beings! ... There seemed to be a problem about enjoying puppetry ... I often wonder it if would have been better to make them ''more'' like puppets, not less like puppets.\"<ref name=\"LaRivi\u00e8re151\"/> One disadvantage of the new design was that the smaller heads upset the weight distribution, making the puppets harder to operate.<ref name=\"Garland64\"/>\n\n====Puppet movement====\nIn all the Anderson puppet series, a major limitation of the marionettes was their inability to walk convincingly.<ref name=\"Thom\"/><ref name=\"Peel16\">Peel, p.&nbsp;16.</ref><ref name=\"O'NeillGosnell13\">O'Neill and Gosnell, p.&nbsp;13.</ref> This was due to their low weight and the fact that the legs of each puppet were controlled by only two strings, which made complex articulation impossible.<ref name=\"Peel19\">Peel, p.&nbsp;19.</ref> According to [[Sylvia Anderson]], the late-1960s re-design exacerbated the puppets' core deficiencies: \"The more realistic our puppets became, the more problems we had with them ... It was just possible to get away with the awkward moments in ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' because the proportions of the characters were still caricature.

On the preparations for ''Supercar'', APF's first science-fiction production, he remembered \"[thinking] that if we set the story in the future, there would be [[moving walkway]]s and the puppets would be riding around in the car for much of the time, so it would be much easier to make them convincing.\" According to interviewer [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], this \"moving into the future\" for greater realism \"almost accidentally\" ensured that all of APF's later series were science fiction.<ref name=\"O'NeillGosnell13\"/> In 2006, Anderson stated that the transition to this genre \"wasn't a conscious move at all\", but rather a natural progression given the deficiencies of the puppets. Sylvia said that the reasons were budgetary, due to the fact that APF could not yet afford to work with live actors: \"... we were picking subjects that we could easily do in miniature scale.\"<ref name=\"Sellers83\"/>\n\nDavid Garland calls character movement Gerry Anderson's \"[[Wikt:b\u00eate noire|b\u00eate noire]]\" and states that the puppets' limited mobility resulted in \"vehicle-heavy science fiction [becoming] Anderson's preferred genre\".<ref name=\"Garland70\"/> He considers the use of marionettes \u2013 the kind of puppet \"perhaps most unsuited\" to an action format \u2013 to be \"one of the most striking paradoxes\" of the Anderson productions.<ref>Garland, pp.&nbsp;70\u201371.</ref> Carolyn Percy of ''[[Wales Arts Review]]'' comments that the inclusion of \"futuristic vehicles\" like ''Supercar'' allowed APF to devise \"more exciting and imaginative scenarios\" and \"work around the limitations of the puppets ... to give their 'acting' the integrity to match the material.\"<ref name=\"Percy\"/>\n\nThe final Supermarionation series, ''[[The Secret Service]]'', used footage of live actors to such an extent that according to Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re, the result was \"half-way between live action and Supermarionation\". Its main character, Stanley Unwin, was modelled on the [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|comedian of the same name]], who both voiced the puppet character and served as its human [[body double]] in [[long shot]]s and other sequences where the puppet could not be used. Anderson explained that this was another way of circumventing the puppets' lack of mobility, commenting: \"I came up with the idea of getting Stanley Unwin to do all the walking shots, and driving shots in this [[Ford Model T|Model Ford T]] {{sic}} [the character] had. If, for example, you had a sequence where Stanley Unwin would arrive at a building in his model T, he would ... get out, walk down the path, and as soon as he opened the door, you'd cut to the [[reverse angle]] and that would be the ''puppet'' of Stanley Unwin ...

The characters of this series were realised as latex [[hand puppet]]s, operated from the studio floor in a process known as \"Supermacromation\".<ref name=\"Garland70\"/> This was similar to the techniques employed by American puppeteer [[Jim Henson]].<ref name=\"Percy\"/>\n\n===Hypermarionation===\nIn 2004, Anderson created a ''Captain Scarlet'' remake titled ''[[New Captain Scarlet]]'', which was produced using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) and [[motion-capture]] techniques.<ref name=\"Garland71\">Garland, p.&nbsp;71.</ref> Motion capture was used heavily for action sequences as it provided more convincing character movement.<ref>Garland, pp.&nbsp;71\u201372.</ref> As a nod to Supermarionation, the series was credited as being \"created in Hypermarionation\".<ref name=\"Garland72\">Garland, p.&nbsp;72.</ref> According to Anderson, Hypermarionation was not simply animation, but a \"photo-real\" production method combining CGI, [[High-definition video|high-definition]] picture and surround sound.<ref name=\"Garland71\"/> Garland suggests that through Hypermarionation, Anderson sought to achieve a \"hyperreal simulation of his live-action film utopia\".<ref name=\"Garland72\"/>\n\n===Ultramarionation===\nIn 2014, a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched to fund a remake of the anime series ''[[Firestorm (anime)|Firestorm]]'', to be produced using a technique called \"Ultramarionation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/firestorm-aims-to-be-21st-century-thunderbirds-with-next-gen-puppets/|title=''Firestorm'' Aims to be 21st-Century ''Thunderbirds'' with Next-Gen Puppets|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|location=San Francisco, California|work=[[CNET]]|access-date=23 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305074856/https://www.cnet.com/news/firestorm-aims-to-be-21st-century-thunderbirds-with-next-gen-puppets/|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\nPercy notes that Gerry Anderson would have preferred to make [[live-action]] productions rather than puppet series and argues that his style of filming was developed to \"make the puppet film as 'respectable' as possible\".

To this end, three-dimensional sets were used instead of traditional [[Flat (theatre)|flat backgrounds]] and puppeteers [[Christine Glanville]] and her colleagues operated the marionettes not from the studio floor, but from a bridge about {{Convert|6|ft|m|spell=in}} above it.<ref>La Rivi\u00e8re, pp.&nbsp;15\u201316.</ref> Speech was indicated by continually nodding the puppets' heads.

But they are not ordinary human beings! ... There seemed to be a problem about enjoying puppetry ... I often wonder it if would have been better to make them ''more'' like puppets, not less like puppets.\"<ref name=\"LaRivi\u00e8re151\"/> One disadvantage of the new design was that the smaller heads upset the weight distribution, making the puppets harder to operate.<ref name=\"Garland64\"/>\n\n====Puppet movement====\nIn all the Anderson puppet series, a major limitation of the marionettes was their inability to walk convincingly.<ref name=\"Thom\"/><ref name=\"Peel16\">Peel, p.&nbsp;16.</ref><ref name=\"O'NeillGosnell13\">O'Neill and Gosnell, p.&nbsp;13.</ref> This was due to their low weight and the fact that the legs of each puppet were controlled by only two strings, which made complex articulation impossible.<ref name=\"Peel19\">Peel, p.&nbsp;19.</ref> According to [[Sylvia Anderson]], the late-1960s re-design exacerbated the puppets' core deficiencies: \"The more realistic our puppets became, the more problems we had with them ... It was just possible to get away with the awkward moments in ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' because the proportions of the characters were still caricature.

On the preparations for ''Supercar'', APF's first science-fiction production, he remembered \"[thinking] that if we set the story in the future, there would be [[moving walkway]]s and the puppets would be riding around in the car for much of the time, so it would be much easier to make them convincing.\" According to interviewer [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], this \"moving into the future\" for greater realism \"almost accidentally\" ensured that all of APF's later series were science fiction.<ref name=\"O'NeillGosnell13\"/> In 2006, Anderson stated that the transition to this genre \"wasn't a conscious move at all\", but rather a natural progression given the deficiencies of the puppets. Sylvia said that the reasons were budgetary, due to the fact that APF could not yet afford to work with live actors: \"... we were picking subjects that we could easily do in miniature scale.\"<ref name=\"Sellers83\"/>\n\nDavid Garland calls character movement Gerry Anderson's \"[[Wikt:b\u00eate noire|b\u00eate noire]]\" and states that the puppets' limited mobility resulted in \"vehicle-heavy science fiction [becoming] Anderson's preferred genre\".<ref name=\"Garland70\"/> He considers the use of marionettes \u2013 the kind of puppet \"perhaps most unsuited\" to an action format \u2013 to be \"one of the most striking paradoxes\" of the Anderson productions.<ref>Garland, pp.&nbsp;70\u201371.</ref> Carolyn Percy of ''[[Wales Arts Review]]'' comments that the inclusion of \"futuristic vehicles\" like ''Supercar'' allowed APF to devise \"more exciting and imaginative scenarios\" and \"work around the limitations of the puppets ... to give their 'acting' the integrity to match the material.\"<ref name=\"Percy\"/>\n\nThe final Supermarionation series, ''[[The Secret Service]]'', used footage of live actors to such an extent that according to Stephen La Rivi\u00e8re, the result was \"half-way between live action and Supermarionation\". Its main character, Stanley Unwin, was modelled on the [[Stanley Unwin (comedian)|comedian of the same name]], who both voiced the puppet character and served as its human [[body double]] in [[long shot]]s and other sequences where the puppet could not be used. Anderson explained that this was another way of circumventing the puppets' lack of mobility, commenting: \"I came up with the idea of getting Stanley Unwin to do all the walking shots, and driving shots in this [[Ford Model T|Model Ford T]] {{sic}} [the character] had. If, for example, you had a sequence where Stanley Unwin would arrive at a building in his model T, he would ... get out, walk down the path, and as soon as he opened the door, you'd cut to the [[reverse angle]] and that would be the ''puppet'' of Stanley Unwin ...

Wigan F.C. played on Folly Field, near Upper Dicconson Street.\n\nThe first match took place on 30 November when members played against each other in a practice match at Folly Field. After a series of trial and practice matches, they travelled to [[Warrington]] to play their first competitive match on 18 January 1873. The game ended in a draw.\n\nFinancial problems and an inability to recruit quality players led to the club amalgamating with Upholland F.C. in 1876. The club became Wigan & District F.C. The club moved and played its home games at the then Wigan Cricket Club at Prescott Street just off Frog Lane. It is unlikely that the club fulfilled its fixtures in 1877 before finally disbanding at the end of the 1879 cricket season.\n\nOn 22 September 1879, the club was reformed as Wigan Wasps by many ex-members of the original Wigan Football Club, following a meeting in the Dicconson Arms. The club moved away from Prescott Street back to Folly Field.\n\nIn 1884, Wigan won its first trophy, the West Lancashire Cup. The club initially played in blue and white hooped jerseys before changing in 1886 to cherry and white hoops.<ref>[http://www.wiganwarriors.com/MidContent.asp?cid=22 Wigan Warriors \u2013 The Official Website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821083852/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/MidContent.asp?cid=22 |date=21 August 2006 }}</ref> In 1888 they hosted and beat a touring New Zealand side.\n\nWigan were suspended by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] for breaking the strict amateur code despite their argument that broken-time payments were necessary to avoid undue hardship for their working class players. In 1895 Wigan joined with other clubs from [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]] to found the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] which led eventually to the sport of [[rugby league]]. This was a result of the breakaway from the [[Rugby Football Union]]. This was when the \"Wasps\" tag was dropped and the club simply became known as Wigan.\n\nThe County Championship was introduced in October 1895 with Cheshire entertaining Lancashire. The Red Rose side contained three players from Wigan: Winstanley (full back) and Unsworth and Brown (forwards).\n\nIn 1896\u201397 due to the increased number of Northern Union teams the Northern League was abandoned in favour of two County Senior leagues. The second half of the season saw the introduction of the Northern Union Cup (later known as the Rugby League Cup). Wigan reached the third round before being knocked out by St. Helens.\n\n===1900s===\n[[File:Wigan fc team c1900.jpg|thumb|250px|Team of Wigan FC, c. 1900]]\nIn 1904, fourteen clubs resigned from the two county leagues to form a new Northern Rugby League for season 1901\u201302. Wigan however remained in the Lancashire Senior Competition.\n\nWigan became sub-tenants of Springfield Park, which they shared with Wigan United AFC, playing their first game there on 14 September 1901. A crowd of 4,000 saw them beat Morecambe 12\u20130. During this season Wigan won the Lancashire Senior Competition.\n\nWigan's record crowd at Springfield was 10,000 when they beat Widnes on 19 March 1902. The last game was on 28 April 1902 when Wigan beat the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition. Two meetings were held by Wigan members during the season to discuss the possibility of turning the club into a Limited Company but the idea did not take off.\n\nOn 6 September 1902, Wigan played at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] for the first time in the opening match of the newly formed First Division. An estimated crowd of 9,000 spectators saw Wigan beat [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 14\u20138.\n\nIn the 1905\u201306 season they won their first cup, in rugby league, the [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]]. Between 1906 and 1923 Wigan won the Lancashire League another seven times and the Lancashire Cup another four times. Wigan were the first winners of the Lancashire cup.\n\nWigan played New Zealand on 9 November 1907 and ran out winners by 12 points to 8 in front of a crowd of around 30,000.\nGreat Britain, then known as the Northern Union, played their first ever test against New Zealand on 25 January 1908. [[Jim Leytham|James \"Jim\" Leytham]], [[Bert Jenkins]], and [[Johnny Thomas (rugby)|John \"Johnny\" Thomas]] of Wigan were in the home side and [[Jim Leytham|James \"Jim\" Leytham]] scored a try. [[Bert Jenkins]], and [[Johnny Thomas (rugby)|John \"Johnny\" Thomas]] had previously played in the first Welsh game against New Zealand on 1 January 1908.\n\nOn Saturday 28 October 1911, Wigan played a match against the Australasian team which visited England on the [[1911\u201312 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] and won.\n\nOn 12 May 1921, Wigan became a limited company.\n\nIn June 1922 [[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] joined Wigan from Cardiff RFC when he was only 17. His cash value was put at \u00a3750, which was a staggering signing-on fee for an adolescent who had not yet played 13-a-side rugby (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately \u00a3137,700 in 2015).<ref name=\"Measuring Worth - Relative Value of UK Pounds\">{{cite web|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|title=Measuring Worth \u2013 Relative Value of UK Pounds|publisher=Measuring Worth|date=31 December 2014|accessdate=1 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218073541/https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|archive-date=18 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> His first game was at home against Widnes on 27 August 1921, and he scored ten points in a 21\u20130 win. Almost inevitably, Jim Sullivan scored the first points in the first Challenge Cup Final to be played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], kicking a penalty after only three minutes of the inaugural Challenge Cup Final against Dewsbury in 1929 in which he led Wigan to a 13\u20132 victory. Sullivan became player-coach in 1932.\n\nWigan won their first [[Challenge Cup]] in the [[1923\u201324 Northern Rugby Football League season|1923\u201324 season]] when they beat [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 21\u20134 in [[Rochdale]].\n\nIn 1933 the [[Prince of Wales]] attended [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], becoming the first royal to watch a rugby league match.\n\nOn 25 October 1938 Australian [[Harry Sunderland]] arrived in Wigan to take up the duties of Secretary-Manager at Central Park. On 28 September the following year, Sunderland's contract was terminated and he and the club parted company.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II disrupted the [[Rugby Football League Championship]] but Wigan continued to play in the Lancashire War League and the Emergency War League.\n\nDuring the war years the club went through the 1940\u201341 season unbeaten although they lost the Championship final. They lost the 1944 Challenge Cup Final over two games to [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] 8\u20133 but made up for it beating Dewsbury in the Championship Final.\n\n===Post war===\nJim Sullivan's last game, as a player, for Wigan was at [[Mount Pleasant, Batley|Mount Pleasant]], [[Batley]], on 23 February 1946. He remained at Central Park for another six seasons as coach.\n\nIn 1948 Wigan took part in the first televised rugby league match when their 8\u20133 Challenge Cup Final victory over [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] was broadcast to the Midlands. In another first this was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, [[King George VI]], who presented the trophy.\n\nOn Saturday 27 October 1951, 33,230 spectators saw Wigan beat Leigh 14\u20136 in the final of the Lancashire Cup at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]]. In 1952 Wigan won their sixth consecutive Lancashire Cup.\n\nWigan were also featured in the first league match to be broadcast, a clash with [[Wakefield Trinity]] at Central Park on 12 January 1952.\n\nIn 1953 Wigan signed [[Billy Boston]] for \u00a3150. 8,000 fans saw Billy Boston d\u00e9but for Wigan in the 'A' team. He later became one of the most successful and famous Wigan players of all time. [[Eric Ashton]] signed for Wigan for \u00a3150 in 1955. Wigan went to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] six times in the Boston / Ashton era and won three times.\n\nThe visit of [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] on 27 March 1959 produced Central Park's all-time record attendance of 47,747 which is still a record for any rugby league game in [[Lancashire]]. Wigan went on to win the game 19\u201314 after holding off a Saints comeback. [[Mick Sullivan]] moved to Wigan for a then record \u00a39,500 fee in 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-3525519/Rugby-League-Hall-Famer-Mick-Sullivan-dies-hospital-aged-82.html|title=Rugby League Hall of Famer Sullivan dies in hospital aged 82|date=6 April 2016|website=Mail Online|accessdate=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415122717/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/rugbyleague/article-3525519/Rugby-League-Hall-Famer-Mick-Sullivan-dies-hospital-aged-82.html|archive-date=15 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Joe Egan (rugby league)|Joe Egan]] returned to coach Wigan and during his time they won the Championship play-off final in 1960 defeating [[Wakefield Trinity]] 21\u20135, the Challenge Cup in 1958, 1959, 13\u20139 against [[Workington Town]] and 30\u201313 against [[Hull F.C.]] respectively before losing in 12\u20136 to St. Helens in 1961 which was to be his last game in charge.\n\nWigan continued to have regular success in both league and cup competitions until 1974 when Wigan went 8 seasons without winning any leagues or cups.\n\nEric Ashton coached Wigan from 1963 to 1973. In 1966, Wigan locked television cameras out of their ground in the belief that they affected attendances. They were fined \u00a3500 by the [[Rugby Football League]]. Wigan beat [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 16\u201313 in the 1966 Lancashire Cup Final. Billy Boston played his last match in the cherry and white, against [[Wakefield Trinity]] at the end of April 1968.\n\nWigan celebrated the centenary year of the club in November 1972, with a match against Australia at Central Park, on Saturday 17 November, the result finished as an 18\u201318 draw.\n\nWigan pulled off a surprise victory 19\u20139 over [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] in the Lancashire Cup Final which was played at [[Wilderspool Stadium|Wilderspool]], [[Warrington]] on Saturday 13 October 1973. Cup holders Salford had lost only one match prior to the final, against the touring Australians.\n\nTed Toohey became coach of Wigan in May 1974 before being sacked in January 1975, this would set the pattern of coaches lasting one or two seasons before being replaced. Star coach, Joe Coan then took control until he resigned in September 1976, the board accepted his decision \"with reluctance\". [[Vince Karalius]] then took over but was sacked in September 1979, he was replaced by [[Kel Coslett]].\n\n===The 1980s onwards===\nIn 1980, Wigan were relegated from the top flight for the first time in their history and Coslett was replaced by [[George Fairbairn (rugby league)|George Fairbairn]] as player-coach. During the second division season they recorded a record average attendance for the division of 8,198. Wigan won promotion back to the top flight the following season but Fairbairn lasted no longer than May 1981 before moving to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. [[Maurice Bamford]] took over as coach of Wigan before being sacked in May 1982 and was replaced by [[Alex Murphy (rugby league)|Alex Murphy]].\n\n[[Maurice Lindsay (rugby league)|Maurice Lindsay]] came to Wigan in the early 1980s to join directors Jack Robinson, Tom Rathbone and ex-player Jack Hilton. Wigan became one of the first teams to go full-time professional in the league, this led to an upsurge in the fortunes of the club.\n\nBetween February and October 1987, under new coach, former [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] coach [[Graham Lowe]], Wigan won a record 29 games in a row as follows: 20 Division One matches, 3 Premiership Trophy matches, 4 Lancashire Cup matches, 1 Charity Shield final, 1 [[World Club Challenge]] Final. Wigan defeated Australian club [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] 8\u20132 in front of a crowd of 36,895 at Central Park for an unofficial World Club Championship (though many who were at Central Park still claim the attendance was closer to 50,000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-club-challenge-1987/wigan-vs-manly-warringah.html|title=World Club Challenge 1987 - Rugby League Project|website=www.rugbyleagueproject.org|accessdate=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325202440/http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-club-challenge-1987/wigan-vs-manly-warringah.html|archive-date=25 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was the first time an English club side had beaten a team of Australians at rugby league since the [[1978 Kangaroo tour]]. After Lowe left in 1989, Australian [[John Monie]], a former [[1986 NSWRL season|premiership winning]] coach with the [[Parramatta Eels]], continued the success at Central Park. From 1988 to 1995 Wigan won the Challenge Cup 8 seasons in a row including their 27\u20130 win over St Helens in 1989, the first time any team had been held scoreless in a Cup Final at Wembley; this period was Wigan's most successful period to date. They also won the Championship seven times, League Cup four times, Premiership Trophy three times, Charity Shield twice and three World Club Championships.\n\nIn February 1990, Wigan announced a record \u00a3280,000 profit but by 1993 this had become a loss of \u00a3300,000 on a turnover of \u00a33 million, in no small way to the cost of the Whitbread Stand that had been built at the clubhouse end of Central Park in 1991\u201392 at an estimated cost of \u00a31.3 million.

In 1997, the club was renamed Wigan Warriors. Wigan's dominance came under threat with the new league now fully professional and the introduction of the salary cap and the 20/20 rule. After going out of the [[Challenge Cup]] to [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] in 1996 and St Helens in 1997, they returned to Wembley for the final time in 1998. Still undefeated in the league and the fact coach [[John Monie]] - in his second spell at Wigan - had never lost a cup tie meant Wigan were huge favourites against the unfancied [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|Sheffield Eagles]]. But on 2 May 1998 the Eagles would go down in rugby league history causing the biggest upset in the competition's history with a 17\u20138 win.\n\nWigan won the Minor Premiership and the first [[1998 Super League Grand Final|Super League Grand Final]] in 1998 with a 10\u20134 victory over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] at [[Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]].\n\nIn November 1999, coach [[Andy Goodway]] was sacked by Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay after the Warriors' failure to win a trophy for the first time in 15 years. After a buy-out by [[Dave Whelan]], both the Warriors and the town's football team, [[Wigan Athletic]], moved to the [[JJB Stadium]]. As part of the rugby league's \"on the road\" scheme Wigan Warriors met [[Gateshead Thunder (1999)|Gateshead Thunder]] at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]], [[Edinburgh]]. Maurice Lindsay also returned as director. On an emotional day of high drama Wigan's final game at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] was against arch rivals St Helens on Sunday 5 September 1999 . Wigan legend [[Ellery Hanley]] returned as St Helens coach but a [[Jason Robinson (rugby player)|Jason Robinson]] virtuoso try meant the game was won by Wigan 28\u201320.

Wigan won the Challenge Cup Final in his second season, beating Hull 16\u20130 at Wembley. Wigan extended their record to 30 Challenge Cup Finals, winning 19 of them.\nWane then guided his team to the League and Cup double, by defeating Warringtion 30\u201316 in the Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford. The achievement marked the first time that a team had finished fourth and gone on to win the title. After Grand Final losses to St Helens in 2014 and Leeds Rhinos in 2015, the Warriors reached the Grand Final again in 2016 despite injury problems ruling out several star players throughout the season. Wigan defeated the Warrington Wolves 12-6 in a hard fought rematch of their 2013 contest to win their fourth Super League championship. Wigan became World Champions for a record fourth time in 2017 as they defeated NRL champions [[Cronulla Sharks]] 22-6.\n\nWorld Club Challenge victory aside, 2017 was a tumultuous year for Wigan as they finished outside the play-off positions for the first time since 2006. Due in part to a raft of mid-season injuries (including a humiliating 24-50 defeat at the hands of local rivals [[Leigh Centurions]] who would go on to be relegated at the end of the season), they could not rally in time to make the coveted top 4 spots.\n\n2018 was a much brighter year for the Warriors. The year began with a trip to Australia in week 2 to play [[Hull F.C.]] in the first-ever Super League game to be played outside of Europe. Wigan were victorious at [[St George-Illawarra Dragons]] [[WIN Stadium]], defeating Hull FC 24-10. A first win in 9 years for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in the annual Good Friday derby was the catalyst for an 8 game winning streak in April and May, with only the [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] stopping Wigan after the former had been knocked out of the Challenge Cup by the Warriors two weeks prior. Wigan's own Challenge Cup journey would come to a somewhat humiliating ending at the hands of [[Warrington Wolves]] in a 0-23 reverse at the [[Halliwell Jones Stadium]] televised live by the BBC. Wigan would get their first of many revenges over Warrington at the beginning of June with a last minute [[Josh Woods]] drop goal completing a 13-12 victory over the Wolves at the DW Stadium.\n\nInto the Super 8s stage of the season, Wigan won an unprecedented 7 out of 7 matches including revenge for the Good Friday defeat by soundly beating arch rivals St Helens 30-10 at the [[Totally Wicked Stadium]]. Wigan's defence was imperious as the season drew to its climax, conceding only 8.4 points per game. A 14-0 victory over Castleford Tigers set up an [[Old Trafford]] meeting between Wigan and Warrington for the 3rd Grand Final in 6 years. Wigan went into the game as slight favourites having finished in 2nd place in the league season and Warrington finishing in 4th. The game was a tight affair, with both defences fulfilling their pre-match billing. Former Wigan player [[Josh Charnley]] opened the scoring early in the game, only to be cancelled out by [[Dominic Manfredi]]'s try midway through the first half. [[Tom Davies (rugby league)|Tom Davies]] got the nod from the video referee to give Wigan an 8-4 lead at half time. As the players left the field a push from Warrington's [[Bryson Goodwin]] on Wigan's [[Morgan Escare]] sparked a fracas in the tunnel mirroring the fiery first half. In the second half, both teams went toe-to-toe with neither side able to score the try that would put their side in the driving seat. However, with 3 minutes to go, Manfredi's second try of the game capped an amazing comeback for the Wigan winger, who considered giving up rugby league for a job as a HGV driver during a 2 year absence through a serious knee injury. Wigan's victory capped a glorious year for the Cherry & Whites and gave departing players [[Sam Tomkins]], [[John Bateman (rugby league)|John Bateman]] and [[Ryan Sutton]] plus coach [[Shaun Wane]] a perfect send off. Wane in particular brought his 30-year association with the club to an end after this match, becoming Wigan's longest-serving Summer era coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/45800241|title=Super League Grand Final: Wigan claim fifth title with victory over Warrington|date=13 October 2018|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017125140/https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/45800241|archive-date=17 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Colours and badge==\n===Colours===\nUntil 1886, the Wigan team played in blue and white hooped jerseys before changing the colours to cherry and white hoops. The colours red and white are synonymous with the club. From then, the home kits have consisted of the colours red and white in different variations, usually hoops, but still consisting of red and white.<ref>[http://www.dwstadium.com/the-teams The Teams, DW Stadium, DW Stadium<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726010410/http://www.dwstadium.com/the-teams |date=26 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe Away or Alternate kit colours have usually been blue and white. Some fans assume this is because Wigan originally played in these colours before the switch to the red and white hooped kits and it would therefore be appropriate that these colours became the club's secondary kit colours. The Away kits have been in different shades of blue over the years, royal blue, navy blue and light blue with varied designs. These designs have sometimes been hooped, one irregular hoop or just a block colour of blue. There have been a few exceptions, with a black and white alternative kit being used in 2001, a black kit with red piping in 2007, a black and gold kit in 2012 and a purple and black hooped kit in 2013.\n\n===Badge===\nWigan, like most teams, originally used the council's coat of arms as their club badge until the Super League era when many clubs rebranded. Wigan became known as the Wigan Warriors and had a new club crest with the words Warriors and a warrior on it. Eventually the club reverted to an updated design of Wigan Council coat of arms.\n\n==Kit manufacturers and sponsors==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em\"\n|-\n!

The club played at Prescott Street until the club disbanded. With the reformation of the Club as Wigan Wasps Football Club, the club returned to Folly Field from 1879 to 1886 when it moved its matches back to Prescott Street.\n\nWigan played their home games at Wigan Cricket Club on Prescott Street until 1901 when they moved to Springfield Park which they shared with the town's association soccer club Wigan United A.F.C. The first rugby match at Springfield Park was played on 14 September 1901 and was between Wigan and Morecambe in front of 4,000 spectators. The record rugby attendance for the ground was 10,000 achieved on 19 March 1902 when Wigan beat Widnes.

During the 2006 season, in which the team was struggling to avoid relegation, the attendances were increasing as fans came to support the club and offer vocal support, many of whom may have not attended on a regular basis previously.\n\nThe club averaged 16,016 per home game in 2007. In 2010 Wigan were officially the best supported club in Super League with a higher average attendance than nearest rivals [[Leeds Rhinos]]. The club have now been confirmed as the best supported club for the last three seasons of 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wigan Warriors Official Website |title=Wigan Top Attendance Charts |url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/WContent.aspx?id=7534&type=news |accessdate=17 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010062335/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/WContent.aspx?id=7534&type=news |archivedate=10 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs a gesture of thanks, the 2008 season saw the Wigan fans have the squad number 18 dedicated to them, a practice which has since continued each season. [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] commented ''\"This is a new practice for clubs who recognise the extra special support which loyal fans can provide to their team in both good and bad times. It is particularly apt for Wigan fans\".''<ref>{{cite web|title=Warriors Fans the 18th Man |url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=3463 |publisher=www.wiganwarriors.com |date=3 December 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219180421/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=3463 |archivedate=19 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nFrom early 2008, the Wigan fans have often chanted to the tune of [[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]. One of the beginning lines of this particular chant is \"We're the Greatest Club in the World\".\n\nThe fans have their own supporters club, The Riversiders, who meet monthly and often have special guests at the meetings including past and present players, coaching staff and members of the Rugby Football League.\n\nIn 2010 some supporters set up a group to improve the atmosphere at both home and away games, known as the Wigan Brigantes, Brigantes being the name of the tribe that inhabited this and other large parts of northern England before and during the Roman era. The group started by erecting flags across the South Stand gantry at the DW Stadium, beginning with 12 at the start of the 2010 season and grew steadily from there. The group's banner had the phrase \"Long After Tonight Is All Over\" as a nod to the [[Jimmy Radcliffe]] song that was a staple of the [[Wigan Casino]] club during the [[Northern Soul]] era, and to show their rivals that their support would continue well after the final whistle had sounded. This was particularly true of some of Wigan's away games during the 2011 season where their fans often stayed well over half an hour after the final hooter singing to the tune of \"[[Dale Cavese]]\".\n\nThere is also a regular fans' forum meeting with chairman [[Ian Lenagan]] and the current head coach to discuss the latest issues concerning the club and the work that is being done behind the scenes.

Matches, between the two teams are played traditionally on Good Friday and in previous seasons on Boxing Day. The clubs are often described as archenemies such is the history of the rivalry. The matches between the two clubs are said to have bragging rights at stake and banter between the fans of both clubs is commonplace. The rivalry is so fierce that matches between the two teams are one of only two sporting events to officially be given the title of The Derby.\n\n[[Leigh Centurions]] are traditional rivals of the club and similarly matches between the two clubs are local derbies. The rivalry between these two clubs however has been muted due to the fact that the two clubs compete in different competitions and therefore do not play each other regularly (during the Super League era, Wigan and Leigh have only been together in Super League for two seasons, in 2005 and 2017).\n\nThe club has forged a more recent fierce rivalry with [[Warrington Wolves]] following a resurgence in the club's success and Warrington's emergence as one of the most competitive teams in the Super League.\n\nA more notable rivalry is one with the [[Leeds Rhinos]] because when the 2 teams meet there is usually something at stake as the two teams are labelled as super league giants and have met 11 times in Super League play offs Wigan edging that head to head record 6\u20135 plus both teams have played each other in Challenge Cup Finals, Semi Finals & Quarter Finals and it is always fiercely competitive when they meet. Leeds and Wigan dominated Super League from the late 2000s and through the 2010s, with either Leeds or Wigan winning Super League every year, aside from 2014, between 2007 and 2018 (strangely enough during this period, Wigan and Leeds have only met in the Grand Final once, in 2015).\n\n==In the community==\nWigan confirmed via the official website that they had been granted charitable status on Wednesday 29 April 2009 via the \"charitable arm\" of the club the Wigan Warriors Community Foundation. Wigan Warriors carry out extensive community work that stretches from Amateur Rugby League Football clubs to Schools as well as running highly successful community training camps for young people. A part of the community work is visiting primary schools to deliver a programme specifically designed for young people entitled 'Lessons for Life'. The programme is delivered via a geographic family of schools approach and results in each school receiving two hours of Rugby League coaching per week for a six-week period. Additionally every school is offered the opportunity to start an extra curricular club and take part in a \"Warriors Tag Festival\". The club will now be able to deliver an even more extensive community programme via the [https://web.archive.org/web/20181116085947/https://www.careerstructure.com/job/community-coordinator/wigan-warriors-community-foundation-job83995773?v=1542333885236 Wigan Warriors Community Foundation]\n\nWigan became the first club in the country to receive Sport England's Clubmark Gold Award.<ref name=\"Wigan Warriors clubmark gold award\">{{cite news|title=Clubmark Gold Award |url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=4702 |publisher=Wigan Warriors Official Website |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\nThe Gold award, only available from 1 April 2009, shows the clubs commitment to Duty of Care and Child Protection, Coaching and Competition, Sports Equity and Ethics and Club Management. The Gold award not only meets the minimum standards in all areas, but surpasses them and meets additional criteria too.\n\nCombined with education provider ProCo, Wigan have established a work based learning academy in the town to provide opportunities to young people whilst also providing a permanent base for its scholarship and academy squads.

Wigan F.C. played on Folly Field, near Upper Dicconson Street.\n\nThe first match took place on 30 November when members played against each other in a practice match at Folly Field. After a series of trial and practice matches, they travelled to [[Warrington]] to play their first competitive match on 18 January 1873. The game ended in a draw.\n\nFinancial problems and an inability to recruit quality players led to the club amalgamating with Upholland F.C. in 1876. The club became Wigan & District F.C. The club moved and played its home games at the then Wigan Cricket Club at Prescott Street just off Frog Lane. It is unlikely that the club fulfilled its fixtures in 1877 before finally disbanding at the end of the 1879 cricket season.\n\nOn 22 September 1879, the club was reformed as Wigan Wasps by many ex-members of the original Wigan Football Club, following a meeting in the Dicconson Arms. The club moved away from Prescott Street back to Folly Field.\n\nIn 1884, Wigan won its first trophy, the West Lancashire Cup. The club initially played in blue and white hooped jerseys before changing in 1886 to cherry and white hoops.<ref>[http://www.wiganwarriors.com/MidContent.asp?cid=22 Wigan Warriors \u2013 The Official Website<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821083852/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/MidContent.asp?cid=22 |date=21 August 2006 }}</ref> In 1888 they hosted and beat a touring New Zealand side.\n\nWigan were suspended by the [[Rugby Football Union|RFU]] for breaking the strict amateur code despite their argument that broken-time payments were necessary to avoid undue hardship for their working class players. In 1895 Wigan joined with other clubs from [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]] to found the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] which led eventually to the sport of [[rugby league]]. This was a result of the breakaway from the [[Rugby Football Union]]. This was when the \"Wasps\" tag was dropped and the club simply became known as Wigan.\n\nThe County Championship was introduced in October 1895 with Cheshire entertaining Lancashire. The Red Rose side contained three players from Wigan: Winstanley (full back) and Unsworth and Brown (forwards).\n\nIn 1896\u201397 due to the increased number of Northern Union teams the Northern League was abandoned in favour of two County Senior leagues. The second half of the season saw the introduction of the Northern Union Cup (later known as the Rugby League Cup). Wigan reached the third round before being knocked out by St. Helens.\n\n===1900s===\n[[File:Wigan fc team c1900.jpg|thumb|250px|Team of Wigan FC, c. 1900]]\nIn 1904, fourteen clubs resigned from the two county leagues to form a new Northern Rugby League for season 1901\u201302. Wigan however remained in the Lancashire Senior Competition.\n\nWigan became sub-tenants of Springfield Park, which they shared with Wigan United AFC, playing their first game there on 14 September 1901. A crowd of 4,000 saw them beat Morecambe 12\u20130. During this season Wigan won the Lancashire Senior Competition.\n\nWigan's record crowd at Springfield was 10,000 when they beat Widnes on 19 March 1902. The last game was on 28 April 1902 when Wigan beat the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition. Two meetings were held by Wigan members during the season to discuss the possibility of turning the club into a Limited Company but the idea did not take off.\n\nOn 6 September 1902, Wigan played at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] for the first time in the opening match of the newly formed First Division. An estimated crowd of 9,000 spectators saw Wigan beat [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] 14\u20138.\n\nIn the 1905\u201306 season they won their first cup, in rugby league, the [[RFL Lancashire Cup|Lancashire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]]. Between 1906 and 1923 Wigan won the Lancashire League another seven times and the Lancashire Cup another four times. Wigan were the first winners of the Lancashire cup.\n\nWigan played New Zealand on 9 November 1907 and ran out winners by 12 points to 8 in front of a crowd of around 30,000.\nGreat Britain, then known as the Northern Union, played their first ever test against New Zealand on 25 January 1908. [[Jim Leytham|James \"Jim\" Leytham]], [[Bert Jenkins]], and [[Johnny Thomas (rugby)|John \"Johnny\" Thomas]] of Wigan were in the home side and [[Jim Leytham|James \"Jim\" Leytham]] scored a try.

His cash value was put at \u00a3750, which was a staggering signing-on fee for an adolescent who had not yet played 13-a-side rugby (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately \u00a3137,700 in 2015).<ref name=\"Measuring Worth - Relative Value of UK Pounds\">{{cite web|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|title=Measuring Worth \u2013 Relative Value of UK Pounds|publisher=Measuring Worth|date=31 December 2014|accessdate=1 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171218073541/https://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/|archive-date=18 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> His first game was at home against Widnes on 27 August 1921, and he scored ten points in a 21\u20130 win. Almost inevitably, Jim Sullivan scored the first points in the first Challenge Cup Final to be played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], kicking a penalty after only three minutes of the inaugural Challenge Cup Final against Dewsbury in 1929 in which he led Wigan to a 13\u20132 victory. Sullivan became player-coach in 1932.\n\nWigan won their first [[Challenge Cup]] in the [[1923\u201324 Northern Rugby Football League season|1923\u201324 season]] when they beat [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 21\u20134 in [[Rochdale]].\n\nIn 1933 the [[Prince of Wales]] attended [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], becoming the first royal to watch a rugby league match.\n\nOn 25 October 1938 Australian [[Harry Sunderland]] arrived in Wigan to take up the duties of Secretary-Manager at Central Park. On 28 September the following year, Sunderland's contract was terminated and he and the club parted company.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II disrupted the [[Rugby Football League Championship]] but Wigan continued to play in the Lancashire War League and the Emergency War League.\n\nDuring the war years the club went through the 1940\u201341 season unbeaten although they lost the Championship final. They lost the 1944 Challenge Cup Final over two games to [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] 8\u20133 but made up for it beating Dewsbury in the Championship Final.\n\n===Post war===\nJim Sullivan's last game, as a player, for Wigan was at [[Mount Pleasant, Batley|Mount Pleasant]], [[Batley]], on 23 February 1946. He remained at Central Park for another six seasons as coach.\n\nIn 1948 Wigan took part in the first televised rugby league match when their 8\u20133 Challenge Cup Final victory over [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]] was broadcast to the Midlands. In another first this was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, [[King George VI]], who presented the trophy.\n\nOn Saturday 27 October 1951, 33,230 spectators saw Wigan beat Leigh 14\u20136 in the final of the Lancashire Cup at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]].

He later became one of the most successful and famous Wigan players of all time. [[Eric Ashton]] signed for Wigan for \u00a3150 in 1955. Wigan went to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] six times in the Boston / Ashton era and won three times.\n\nThe visit of [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] on 27 March 1959 produced Central Park's all-time record attendance of 47,747 which is still a record for any rugby league game in [[Lancashire]]. Wigan went on to win the game 19\u201314 after holding off a Saints comeback.

In 1966, Wigan locked television cameras out of their ground in the belief that they affected attendances. They were fined \u00a3500 by the [[Rugby Football League]]. Wigan beat [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]] 16\u201313 in the 1966 Lancashire Cup Final. Billy Boston played his last match in the cherry and white, against [[Wakefield Trinity]] at the end of April 1968.\n\nWigan celebrated the centenary year of the club in November 1972, with a match against Australia at Central Park, on Saturday 17 November, the result finished as an 18\u201318 draw.\n\nWigan pulled off a surprise victory 19\u20139 over [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] in the Lancashire Cup Final which was played at [[Wilderspool Stadium|Wilderspool]], [[Warrington]] on Saturday 13 October 1973. Cup holders Salford had lost only one match prior to the final, against the touring Australians.\n\nTed Toohey became coach of Wigan in May 1974 before being sacked in January 1975, this would set the pattern of coaches lasting one or two seasons before being replaced. Star coach, Joe Coan then took control until he resigned in September 1976, the board accepted his decision \"with reluctance\". [[Vince Karalius]] then took over but was sacked in September 1979, he was replaced by [[Kel Coslett]].\n\n===The 1980s onwards===\nIn 1980, Wigan were relegated from the top flight for the first time in their history and Coslett was replaced by [[George Fairbairn (rugby league)|George Fairbairn]] as player-coach. During the second division season they recorded a record average attendance for the division of 8,198. Wigan won promotion back to the top flight the following season but Fairbairn lasted no longer than May 1981 before moving to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. [[Maurice Bamford]] took over as coach of Wigan before being sacked in May 1982 and was replaced by [[Alex Murphy (rugby league)|Alex Murphy]].\n\n[[Maurice Lindsay (rugby league)|Maurice Lindsay]] came to Wigan in the early 1980s to join directors Jack Robinson, Tom Rathbone and ex-player Jack Hilton. Wigan became one of the first teams to go full-time professional in the league, this led to an upsurge in the fortunes of the club.\n\nBetween February and October 1987, under new coach, former [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] coach [[Graham Lowe]], Wigan won a record 29 games in a row as follows: 20 Division One matches, 3 Premiership Trophy matches, 4 Lancashire Cup matches, 1 Charity Shield final, 1 [[World Club Challenge]] Final. Wigan defeated Australian club [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] 8\u20132 in front of a crowd of 36,895 at Central Park for an unofficial World Club Championship (though many who were at Central Park still claim the attendance was closer to 50,000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-club-challenge-1987/wigan-vs-manly-warringah.html|title=World Club Challenge 1987 - Rugby League Project|website=www.rugbyleagueproject.org|accessdate=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325202440/http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-club-challenge-1987/wigan-vs-manly-warringah.html|archive-date=25 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was the first time an English club side had beaten a team of Australians at rugby league since the [[1978 Kangaroo tour]]. After Lowe left in 1989, Australian [[John Monie]], a former [[1986 NSWRL season|premiership winning]] coach with the [[Parramatta Eels]], continued the success at Central Park. From 1988 to 1995 Wigan won the Challenge Cup 8 seasons in a row including their 27\u20130 win over St Helens in 1989, the first time any team had been held scoreless in a Cup Final at Wembley; this period was Wigan's most successful period to date. They also won the Championship seven times, League Cup four times, Premiership Trophy three times, Charity Shield twice and three World Club Championships.\n\nIn February 1990, Wigan announced a record \u00a3280,000 profit but by 1993 this had become a loss of \u00a3300,000 on a turnover of \u00a33 million, in no small way to the cost of the Whitbread Stand that had been built at the clubhouse end of Central Park in 1991\u201392 at an estimated cost of \u00a31.3 million. By March 1994 Wigan's wage bill topped \u00a32 million a year.\n\n[[John Dorahy]] became coach for the 1993 season.

In 1997, the club was renamed Wigan Warriors. Wigan's dominance came under threat with the new league now fully professional and the introduction of the salary cap and the 20/20 rule. After going out of the [[Challenge Cup]] to [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]] in 1996 and St Helens in 1997, they returned to Wembley for the final time in 1998. Still undefeated in the league and the fact coach [[John Monie]] - in his second spell at Wigan - had never lost a cup tie meant Wigan were huge favourites against the unfancied [[Sheffield Eagles (1984)|Sheffield Eagles]]. But on 2 May 1998 the Eagles would go down in rugby league history causing the biggest upset in the competition's history with a 17\u20138 win.\n\nWigan won the Minor Premiership and the first [[1998 Super League Grand Final|Super League Grand Final]] in 1998 with a 10\u20134 victory over [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] at [[Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]].\n\nIn November 1999, coach [[Andy Goodway]] was sacked by Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay after the Warriors' failure to win a trophy for the first time in 15 years.

Wigan defeated the Warrington Wolves 12-6 in a hard fought rematch of their 2013 contest to win their fourth Super League championship. Wigan became World Champions for a record fourth time in 2017 as they defeated NRL champions [[Cronulla Sharks]] 22-6.\n\nWorld Club Challenge victory aside, 2017 was a tumultuous year for Wigan as they finished outside the play-off positions for the first time since 2006. Due in part to a raft of mid-season injuries (including a humiliating 24-50 defeat at the hands of local rivals [[Leigh Centurions]] who would go on to be relegated at the end of the season), they could not rally in time to make the coveted top 4 spots.\n\n2018 was a much brighter year for the Warriors. The year began with a trip to Australia in week 2 to play [[Hull F.C.]] in the first-ever Super League game to be played outside of Europe. Wigan were victorious at [[St George-Illawarra Dragons]] [[WIN Stadium]], defeating Hull FC 24-10. A first win in 9 years for [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] in the annual Good Friday derby was the catalyst for an 8 game winning streak in April and May, with only the [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] stopping Wigan after the former had been knocked out of the Challenge Cup by the Warriors two weeks prior. Wigan's own Challenge Cup journey would come to a somewhat humiliating ending at the hands of [[Warrington Wolves]] in a 0-23 reverse at the [[Halliwell Jones Stadium]] televised live by the BBC. Wigan would get their first of many revenges over Warrington at the beginning of June with a last minute [[Josh Woods]] drop goal completing a 13-12 victory over the Wolves at the DW Stadium.\n\nInto the Super 8s stage of the season, Wigan won an unprecedented 7 out of 7 matches including revenge for the Good Friday defeat by soundly beating arch rivals St Helens 30-10 at the [[Totally Wicked Stadium]]. Wigan's defence was imperious as the season drew to its climax, conceding only 8.4 points per game. A 14-0 victory over Castleford Tigers set up an [[Old Trafford]] meeting between Wigan and Warrington for the 3rd Grand Final in 6 years. Wigan went into the game as slight favourites having finished in 2nd place in the league season and Warrington finishing in 4th. The game was a tight affair, with both defences fulfilling their pre-match billing. Former Wigan player [[Josh Charnley]] opened the scoring early in the game, only to be cancelled out by [[Dominic Manfredi]]'s try midway through the first half. [[Tom Davies (rugby league)|Tom Davies]] got the nod from the video referee to give Wigan an 8-4 lead at half time. As the players left the field a push from Warrington's [[Bryson Goodwin]] on Wigan's [[Morgan Escare]] sparked a fracas in the tunnel mirroring the fiery first half. In the second half, both teams went toe-to-toe with neither side able to score the try that would put their side in the driving seat. However, with 3 minutes to go, Manfredi's second try of the game capped an amazing comeback for the Wigan winger, who considered giving up rugby league for a job as a HGV driver during a 2 year absence through a serious knee injury. Wigan's victory capped a glorious year for the Cherry & Whites and gave departing players [[Sam Tomkins]], [[John Bateman (rugby league)|John Bateman]] and [[Ryan Sutton]] plus coach [[Shaun Wane]] a perfect send off. Wane in particular brought his 30-year association with the club to an end after this match, becoming Wigan's longest-serving Summer era coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/45800241|title=Super League Grand Final: Wigan claim fifth title with victory over Warrington|date=13 October 2018|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181017125140/https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-league/45800241|archive-date=17 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Colours and badge==\n===Colours===\nUntil 1886, the Wigan team played in blue and white hooped jerseys before changing the colours to cherry and white hoops. The colours red and white are synonymous with the club. From then, the home kits have consisted of the colours red and white in different variations, usually hoops, but still consisting of red and white.<ref>[http://www.dwstadium.com/the-teams The Teams, DW Stadium, DW Stadium<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726010410/http://www.dwstadium.com/the-teams |date=26 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe Away or Alternate kit colours have usually been blue and white. Some fans assume this is because Wigan originally played in these colours before the switch to the red and white hooped kits and it would therefore be appropriate that these colours became the club's secondary kit colours. The Away kits have been in different shades of blue over the years, royal blue, navy blue and light blue with varied designs. These designs have sometimes been hooped, one irregular hoop or just a block colour of blue. There have been a few exceptions, with a black and white alternative kit being used in 2001, a black kit with red piping in 2007, a black and gold kit in 2012 and a purple and black hooped kit in 2013.\n\n===Badge===\nWigan, like most teams, originally used the council's coat of arms as their club badge until the Super League era when many clubs rebranded. Wigan became known as the Wigan Warriors and had a new club crest with the words Warriors and a warrior on it. Eventually the club reverted to an updated design of Wigan Council coat of arms.\n\n==Kit manufacturers and sponsors==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em\"\n|-\n!

The club played its first match at Folly Field on 30 November 1872 and remained at the ground for four years. Wigan Football Club went on to become Wigan & District Football Club, the newly named Wigan & District Football Club played its matches at Prescott Street (The West End Grounds). The club played at Prescott Street until the club disbanded. With the reformation of the Club as Wigan Wasps Football Club, the club returned to Folly Field from 1879 to 1886 when it moved its matches back to Prescott Street.\n\nWigan played their home games at Wigan Cricket Club on Prescott Street until 1901 when they moved to Springfield Park which they shared with the town's association soccer club Wigan United A.F.C. The first rugby match at Springfield Park was played on 14 September 1901 and was between Wigan and Morecambe in front of 4,000 spectators. The record rugby attendance for the ground was 10,000 achieved on 19 March 1902 when Wigan beat Widnes. Forty days later Wigan played their last game at Springfield Park when they defeated the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition.\n\n===1902\u20131999: Central Park===\n{{Main|Central Park (Wigan)}}\n[[File:Central park kop.jpg|thumb|right]]\nIn 1902 Wigan moved to their purpose-built rugby ground called [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]]. Wigan played their first game at Central Park against [[Batley Bulldogs|Batley]] on 6 September 1902, which Wigan won 14\u20138. Central Park would be the home of Wigan Rugby League until 1999, when they moved to the newly built [[JJB Stadium]]. The last match at Central Park was against St Helens on 5 September 1999, a game which Wigan won 28\u201320 in front of 18,179 supporters. As Wigan developed into one of the most famous rugby league clubs in the world, [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]] also became one of the most famous grounds.\n\nWigan won the [[1987 World Club Challenge]] match against [[1987 NSWRL season|1987]] Sydney ([[New South Wales Rugby League]]) Premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] at Central Park played on 7 October.

During the 2006 season, in which the team was struggling to avoid relegation, the attendances were increasing as fans came to support the club and offer vocal support, many of whom may have not attended on a regular basis previously.\n\nThe club averaged 16,016 per home game in 2007. In 2010 Wigan were officially the best supported club in Super League with a higher average attendance than nearest rivals [[Leeds Rhinos]]. The club have now been confirmed as the best supported club for the last three seasons of 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wigan Warriors Official Website |title=Wigan Top Attendance Charts |url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/WContent.aspx?id=7534&type=news |accessdate=17 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010062335/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/WContent.aspx?id=7534&type=news |archivedate=10 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs a gesture of thanks, the 2008 season saw the Wigan fans have the squad number 18 dedicated to them, a practice which has since continued each season. [[Joe Lydon (rugby)|Joe Lydon]] commented ''\"This is a new practice for clubs who recognise the extra special support which loyal fans can provide to their team in both good and bad times. It is particularly apt for Wigan fans\".''<ref>{{cite web|title=Warriors Fans the 18th Man |url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=3463 |publisher=www.wiganwarriors.com |date=3 December 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219180421/http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=3463 |archivedate=19 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nFrom early 2008, the Wigan fans have often chanted to the tune of [[The Entertainer (rag)|The Entertainer]]. One of the beginning lines of this particular chant is \"We're the Greatest Club in the World\".\n\nThe fans have their own supporters club, The Riversiders, who meet monthly and often have special guests at the meetings including past and present players, coaching staff and members of the Rugby Football League.\n\nIn 2010 some supporters set up a group to improve the atmosphere at both home and away games, known as the Wigan Brigantes, Brigantes being the name of the tribe that inhabited this and other large parts of northern England before and during the Roman era. The group started by erecting flags across the South Stand gantry at the DW Stadium, beginning with 12 at the start of the 2010 season and grew steadily from there. The group's banner had the phrase \"Long After Tonight Is All Over\" as a nod to the [[Jimmy Radcliffe]] song that was a staple of the [[Wigan Casino]] club during the [[Northern Soul]] era, and to show their rivals that their support would continue well after the final whistle had sounded. This was particularly true of some of Wigan's away games during the 2011 season where their fans often stayed well over half an hour after the final hooter singing to the tune of \"[[Dale Cavese]]\".\n\nThere is also a regular fans' forum meeting with chairman [[Ian Lenagan]] and the current head coach to discuss the latest issues concerning the club and the work that is being done behind the scenes. So far every meeting has been a sell out.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wigan Warriors to hold Fans Forum |url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=3437|publisher=www.wiganwarriors.com |date=22 November 2007 |accessdate=19 December 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nWigan's fans and Wigan people in general are known as 'pie eaters' or 'pies' which is reference to the 1926 General Strike, when Wigan miners were forced to eat 'humble pie' and return to work before miners in other towns, even though they had been on strike before the other towns joined in.<ref>[http://www.plattbridger.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/wigan/his2ry.htm Wigan History \u2013 1800 To Now<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230041923/http://www.plattbridger.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/wigan/his2ry.htm |date=30 December 2005 }}</ref> Since then the word 'pie' has come to mean the pastry rather than the metaphor 'Humble Pie'.

Matches, between the two teams are played traditionally on Good Friday and in previous seasons on Boxing Day. The clubs are often described as archenemies such is the history of the rivalry. The matches between the two clubs are said to have bragging rights at stake and banter between the fans of both clubs is commonplace. The rivalry is so fierce that matches between the two teams are one of only two sporting events to officially be given the title of The Derby.\n\n[[Leigh Centurions]] are traditional rivals of the club and similarly matches between the two clubs are local derbies. The rivalry between these two clubs however has been muted due to the fact that the two clubs compete in different competitions and therefore do not play each other regularly (during the Super League era, Wigan and Leigh have only been together in Super League for two seasons, in 2005 and 2017).\n\nThe club has forged a more recent fierce rivalry with [[Warrington Wolves]] following a resurgence in the club's success and Warrington's emergence as one of the most competitive teams in the Super League.\n\nA more notable rivalry is one with the [[Leeds Rhinos]] because when the 2 teams meet there is usually something at stake as the two teams are labelled as super league giants and have met 11 times in Super League play offs Wigan edging that head to head record 6\u20135 plus both teams have played each other in Challenge Cup Finals, Semi Finals & Quarter Finals and it is always fiercely competitive when they meet. Leeds and Wigan dominated Super League from the late 2000s and through the 2010s, with either Leeds or Wigan winning Super League every year, aside from 2014, between 2007 and 2018 (strangely enough during this period, Wigan and Leeds have only met in the Grand Final once, in 2015).\n\n==In the community==\nWigan confirmed via the official website that they had been granted charitable status on Wednesday 29 April 2009 via the \"charitable arm\" of the club the Wigan Warriors Community Foundation. Wigan Warriors carry out extensive community work that stretches from Amateur Rugby League Football clubs to Schools as well as running highly successful community training camps for young people. A part of the community work is visiting primary schools to deliver a programme specifically designed for young people entitled 'Lessons for Life'. The programme is delivered via a geographic family of schools approach and results in each school receiving two hours of Rugby League coaching per week for a six-week period. Additionally every school is offered the opportunity to start an extra curricular club and take part in a \"Warriors Tag Festival\". The club will now be able to deliver an even more extensive community programme via the [https://web.archive.org/web/20181116085947/https://www.careerstructure.com/job/community-coordinator/wigan-warriors-community-foundation-job83995773?v=1542333885236 Wigan Warriors Community Foundation]\n\nWigan became the first club in the country to receive Sport England's Clubmark Gold Award.<ref name=\"Wigan Warriors clubmark gold award\">{{cite news|title=Clubmark Gold Award |url=http://www.wiganwarriors.com/news_full.asp?newsid=4702 |publisher=Wigan Warriors Official Website |date=18 April 2009 |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\nThe Gold award, only available from 1 April 2009, shows the clubs commitment to Duty of Care and Child Protection, Coaching and Competition, Sports Equity and Ethics and Club Management.
