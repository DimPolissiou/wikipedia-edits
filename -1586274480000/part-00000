Research suggests that the first settlers (probably hunters) came from the [[Po River|Padana Plain]] and the [[Veneto|Venetian]] Prealps, after the first glaciers began melting at the end of the [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]]s.\n\nFindings (in particular, burials) from the [[Mesolithic]] period have been found in several parts of the province. These include the ''comuni'' of [[Zambana]] and [[Mezzocorona]]. A large area of a hunting-based settlement from the [[Neolithic]] period has been found  near the lakes of Colbric\u00f2n, not far from the [[Rolle Pass]].\n\nAround 500 BC, the [[Raeti]]ans appeared in the Trentine area, coming from the Central and Eastern [[Alps]] area. They settled in several valleys and brought new skills on top of the traditional hunting: agriculture (grapes, vegetables, [[cereal]]s), breeding ([[ovine]]s, goats, bovines and horses). During the Roman Age, part of the current Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol region made up the province of [[Raetia]].\n\nThis region was totally conquered by the Romans in the 1st century BC. The definitive defeat of the Rhaetians, near [[Bolzano]], occurred during the military campaigns in the Alps of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]] (16-17 BC). Trento became a Roman ''[[municipium]]'' in the 40s BC. During the reign of Emperor [[Claudius]] (41-54 AD) Trentino was integrated in the Imperial roadnet with the construction of the Via Claudia Augusta Padana (from [[Ostiglia]] to the [[Reschen Pass|Resia]] Pass) and the Via Augusta Altinate (from [[Treviso]] to Trento, passing through the [[Valsugana]]). Claudius also issued an Edict, contained in the ''[[Tabula clesiana]]'', which extended Roman citizenship to the residents of this region. By the fourth century the area was fully [[Romanization (cultural)|latinisated]].\n\n== Bishopric of Trent ==\n[[File:Castello Buonconsiglio.jpg|thumb|The Prince-Bishops of Trent ruled the region from Buonconsiglio Castle since the 13th century]]\n{{main|Bishopric of Trent}}\n\nDuring the Late Antiquity, in the 5th century AD, Trentino was invaded several times, from North and East: first by the [[Ostrogoth]]s, then by the [[Bavarians]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and finally by the [[Lombards]]. With the latter's domination an idea of territorial identity of the province began to shape (''Tridentinum territorium''). In the same century the region became largely Christianized. In 774  Trentino was conquered by the [[Franks]] and became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]], a sometimes vague entity included in what was to become the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe first territorial unity of Trentino dates back to 1027, when emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] officially gave the rule of the area to the [[Bishopric of Trent]]. This entity survived for some eight centuries and granted Trentino a certain autonomy, first from the Holy Roman Empire and then from the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\n== Part of Austria ==\nIn the early 19th century some of the Trentine people participated actively in the resistance, led by the Tyrolean [[Andreas Hofer]], against the [[Napoleonic Wars|French invasion]]. \n[[File:Alto Adige in history.png|thumb|left|300px|Trentino (green area) was part of the \"Alto Adige Department\" under Napoleon]]\n\nNapoleon created in 1810 the [[Department of Alto Adige]] that included most of actual Trentino and the area around [[Bolzano]] in [[South Tyrol|Alto Adige]]<ref>[https://lu1960.blogspot.com/2019/07/research-on-italian-alto-adige.html Research on Italian Alto Adige (and Trentino)]</ref>. It was part of Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (1805-1814)|Kingdom of Italy]] for some years. \n\nAfter the end of the Napoleonic era (1815), the Bishopric of Trent was dissolved and Trentino became part of the [[County of Tyrol]], in which the majority of the population was [[German language|German]] speaking. Though relatively well administered, and despite the presence of Trentine representatives in the [[Diet (assembly)|Diets]] of [[Innsbruck]] and [[Vienna]], in the second half of the 19th century a movement (part of the general movement called [[Italian irredentism]]) arose with the aim of annexing all the region (south of the Alps watershed) to the [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]]: this, however, was largely put forward by intellectuals like [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] and [[Fabio Filzi]], and met some support by the predominantly rural population.\n\nGiven the area's strategic importance in the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Italy, the Austro-Hungarians strengthened their troop levels there and fortified the area in the early twentieth century. Under the authority of the Austro-Hungarian chief of staff [[Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], modern, armored fortifications were built in the areas around [[Lavarone]] and [[Folgaria]]; their dual purpose was to protect against an Italian attack and to secure the area as a staging ground for an Austrian assault on [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 163.</ref>\n\nAfter Italy entered the [[First World War]] in 1915, the Trentine territory was a main fronts between Italy and [[Austria-Hungary]], and suffered heavy destruction. After the call to arms summoned by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] on July 31, 1914, more than 55,000 Trentini fought for Austria, first against [[Russia]] and [[Serbia]] and, starting from 1915, also against Italians. Despite they were foughting againts italian soldiers (trentini soldiers spoke italian language) desertion cases has been extremely low <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bundesheer.at/sk/lask/brigaden/jgbrig6/baon/pdf/folder_kaiserjaeger_jgb24.pdf|title=Bundesheer|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. More than 10,000 of them died, and many others were wounded or made prisoners.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = The Trentino Campaign of 1916\n | work = historicaleye.com\n | url = http://www.historicaleye.com/trentino.html\n | accessdate = 2011-04-05}}</ref> Further, hundreds of thousands of civilians were forced to abandon their native area when they were too near to the front lines. Many of them, captured by the Italian Army, were later transferred to Southern Italy as colonists.\n\n==Union to Italy ==\nWith the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] (1919), Trentino was united to Italy, together with the new Province of Bolzano/Bozen (South Tyrol), as part of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol|Venezia Tridentina]]. The centralization process brought on by the [[Fascism|Fascists]] reduced the autonomy that cities like Trento or [[Rovereto]] had enjoyed under the preceding Liberal governments, while many of the smaller ''comuni'' were united, reducing their number from the 366 under the Habsburg to 127.\n\n== Autonomy ==\n[[Image:Tirol-Suedtirol-Trentino.png|thumb|Detailed map of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino, formed by the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino.]]\nAfter [[World War II]], the treaty signed by the Italian and Austrian Ministers of Foreign affairs, [[Alcide De Gasperi]] and [[Karl Gruber]], the autonomous Region of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]] was created (see [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]]). \n\nIn the following decades the main party in Trentino was the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], while autonomistic instances found their voice in the Partito Popolare Trentino Tirolese (Trentine-Tyrolese Popular Party). In 1957 strife between Trentino and the largely German-speaking South Tyrol led to the popularity of the slogan ''Los von Trient'' (\"Away from Trento\"). In 1972 the regional administration was handed over to the two provinces. \n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s Trentino witnessed strong economic development, spurred mainly by the tourism sector and by the new autonomy. It is currently one of the richest and best developed Italian provinces.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] was formed between the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. The boundaries of the association correspond to the old County of Tyrol. The aim is to promote regional peace, understanding and cooperation in many areas. The region's assemblies meet together as one on various occasions and have set up a common liaison office to the [[European Union]] in Brussels.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commonscat|History of Trentino}}\n\n[[Category:History of Trentino| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Battisti - Il Trentino, cenni geografici, storici, economici, 1915 63.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Trentino in early 1900s]]\nThe '''History of [[Trentino]]''' begins in the mid-[[Stone Age]] and continues to the actual century when the Trentino is part of the [[Republic of Italy]].<ref>[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/trentino/ Treccani: Trentino]</ref>\n\n== Ancient history ==\n\nDuring the Stone age the valleys of what is now Trentino were already inhabited by humans, the main settlements being in the valley of the [[Adige]] River, thanks to its milder climate.

During the reign of Emperor [[Claudius]] (41-54 AD) Trentino was integrated in the Imperial roadnet with the construction of the Via Claudia Augusta Padana (from [[Ostiglia]] to the [[Reschen Pass|Resia]] Pass) and the Via Augusta Altinate (from [[Treviso]] to Trento, passing through the [[Valsugana]]). Claudius also issued an Edict, contained in the ''[[Tabula clesiana]]'', which extended Roman citizenship to the residents of this region. By the fourth century the area was fully [[Romanization (cultural)|latinisated]].\n\n== Bishopric of Trent ==\n[[File:Castello Buonconsiglio.jpg|thumb|The Prince-Bishops of Trent ruled the region from Buonconsiglio Castle since the 13th century]]\n{{main|Bishopric of Trent}}\n\nDuring the Late Antiquity, in the 5th century AD, Trentino was invaded several times, from North and East: first by the [[Ostrogoth]]s, then by the [[Bavarians]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and finally by the [[Lombards]]. With the latter's domination an idea of territorial identity of the province began to shape (''Tridentinum territorium''). In the same century the region became largely Christianized. In 774  Trentino was conquered by the [[Franks]] and became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]], a sometimes vague entity included in what was to become the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe first territorial unity of Trentino dates back to 1027, when emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] officially gave the rule of the area to the [[Bishopric of Trent]]. This entity survived for some eight centuries and granted Trentino a certain autonomy, first from the Holy Roman Empire and then from the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\n== Part of Austria ==\nIn the early 19th century some of the Trentine people participated actively in the resistance, led by the Tyrolean [[Andreas Hofer]], against the [[Napoleonic Wars|French invasion]]. \n[[File:Alto Adige in history.png|thumb|left|300px|Trentino (green area) was part of the \"Alto Adige Department\" under Napoleon]]\n\nNapoleon created in 1810 the [[Department of Alto Adige]] that included most of actual Trentino and the area around [[Bolzano]] in [[South Tyrol|Alto Adige]]<ref>[https://lu1960.blogspot.com/2019/07/research-on-italian-alto-adige.html Research on Italian Alto Adige (and Trentino)]</ref>. It was part of Napoleon's [[Kingdom of Italy (1805-1814)|Kingdom of Italy]] for some years. \n\nAfter the end of the Napoleonic era (1815), the Bishopric of Trent was dissolved and Trentino became part of the [[County of Tyrol]], in which the majority of the population was [[German language|German]] speaking. Though relatively well administered, and despite the presence of Trentine representatives in the [[Diet (assembly)|Diets]] of [[Innsbruck]] and [[Vienna]], in the second half of the 19th century a movement (part of the general movement called [[Italian irredentism]]) arose with the aim of annexing all the region (south of the Alps watershed) to the [[unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]]: this, however, was largely put forward by intellectuals like [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] and [[Fabio Filzi]], and met some support by the predominantly rural population.\n\nGiven the area's strategic importance in the event of a war between Austria-Hungary and Italy, the Austro-Hungarians strengthened their troop levels there and fortified the area in the early twentieth century. Under the authority of the Austro-Hungarian chief of staff [[Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]], modern, armored fortifications were built in the areas around [[Lavarone]] and [[Folgaria]]; their dual purpose was to protect against an Italian attack and to secure the area as a staging ground for an Austrian assault on [[Northern Italy]].<ref>Rothenburg, G. ''The Army of Francis Joseph''. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 163.</ref>\n\nAfter Italy entered the [[First World War]] in 1915, the Trentine territory was a main fronts between Italy and [[Austria-Hungary]], and suffered heavy destruction. After the call to arms summoned by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] on July 31, 1914, more than 55,000 Trentini fought for Austria, first against [[Russia]] and [[Serbia]] and, starting from 1915, also against Italians.

Many of them, captured by the Italian Army, were later transferred to Southern Italy as colonists.\n\n==Union to Italy ==\nWith the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] (1919), Trentino was united to Italy, together with the new Province of Bolzano/Bozen (South Tyrol), as part of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol|Venezia Tridentina]]. The centralization process brought on by the [[Fascism|Fascists]] reduced the autonomy that cities like Trento or [[Rovereto]] had enjoyed under the preceding Liberal governments, while many of the smaller ''comuni'' were united, reducing their number from the 366 under the Habsburg to 127.\n\n== Autonomy ==\n[[Image:Tirol-Suedtirol-Trentino.png|thumb|Detailed map of the Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino, formed by the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian autonomous provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino.]]\nAfter [[World War II]], the treaty signed by the Italian and Austrian Ministers of Foreign affairs, [[Alcide De Gasperi]] and [[Karl Gruber]], the autonomous Region of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]] was created (see [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]]). \n\nIn the following decades the main party in Trentino was the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]], while autonomistic instances found their voice in the Partito Popolare Trentino Tirolese (Trentine-Tyrolese Popular Party). In 1957 strife between Trentino and the largely German-speaking South Tyrol led to the popularity of the slogan ''Los von Trient'' (\"Away from Trento\"). In 1972 the regional administration was handed over to the two provinces. \n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s Trentino witnessed strong economic development, spurred mainly by the tourism sector and by the new autonomy. It is currently one of the richest and best developed Italian provinces.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino]] was formed between the Austrian state of Tyrol and the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Trentino. The boundaries of the association correspond to the old County of Tyrol. The aim is to promote regional peace, understanding and cooperation in many areas. The region's assemblies meet together as one on various occasions and have set up a common liaison office to the [[European Union]] in Brussels.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commonscat|History of Trentino}}\n\n[[Category:History of Trentino| ]]\n", "name_user": "Sevenspeed7710", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Trentino"}

''Strider'' is a [[hack and slash]] [[Platform game|platformer]] set in a [[dystopian]] future in the year 2048 and features a wide range of settings that dramatically affect gameplay.\n\n''Strider'' marked the video game debut of [[Strider Hiryu|Hiryu]], a member of a secret group of ninjas known as the \u201cStriders\u201d shortly after the character's 1988 debut as the main character in a [[manga]] titled ''Strider Hiryu''.\n\nHiryu went on to become the main protagonist of a long-running series of video games and one of Capcom's most popular characters.\nThe arcade game is part of a three-way cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher [[Moto Kikaku]], which also includes a manga book and an [[NES]] [[Strider (NES video game)|video game]].\n\n[[Porting|Ports]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC compatibles]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were developed by [[Tiertex]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1989.\n\n[[Sega]] ported ''Strider'' to its own [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in 1990 to wide acclaim. Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the 1990 Video Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' and being featured in the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''. ''Strider'''s innovative, fast-paced gameplay is cited as a major influence on several popular video game franchises such as ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' and ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]''. It became one of Capcom's early big hits prior to ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', hailed for its innovative gameplay, diverse and unique music, and multilingual voice samples.\n\n==Gameplay== <!-- Please Note: Continues are allowed by default, but they can also be denied with a DIP switch setting.-->\n[[Image:Strider.png|thumb|left|The Kazakh SSR stage]]\n\nThe controls of ''Strider'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player controls the protagonist [[Strider Hiryu]], whose main weapon is a [[tonfa]]-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.\n\nNumerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the [[kanji]] used to write Hiryu's name: [[wiktionary:\u98db|\u98db]] and \u98db\u7adc), a max health extension (represented by the kanji [[wiktionary:\u7adc|\u7adc]], the second character in Hiryu's name), an [[extra life]], and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.<ref name=psmanualp17>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 17}}</ref> Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two [[mushroom]]-like droids, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed robo tiger]] and a robot [[hawk]], known individually as Options A, B and C respectively.<ref name=psmanualp18>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 18}}</ref>\n\nThe game has five stages: the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (called \"[[St. Petersburg]]\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the [[Siberia]]n Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog, the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian Jungle]], and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions). Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It is [[Game Over]] when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.\n\n==Plot== <!-- Please note: This page is for the original arcade game Strider.

Kouichi Yotsui, director of the coin-op ''Strider'' (who is credited as Isuke in the game), was chosen for his experience with the [[CP System]] hardware while working as a background designer on ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts]]''.

Elements from the soundtrack have also been used in other Capcom games where Hiryu has appeared.

The U.S. Gold versions have the order of the third and fourth stages swapped (the order of the [[cut-scene]]s were kept the same, causing a continuity error), and the final battle with the Grandmaster missing (the last stages end with the battle against the giant robot gorilla Mecha Pong). As a result, the ending was changed to reveal that the events of the game were a simulation that the player was going through. All five versions featured downgraded graphics, less music and missing enemies compared to the arcade version. Additionally, the controls were modified so that the game would be compatible with one-button joystick controllers. Despite these changes, all of the U.S. Gold releases received high review scores by computer game magazines of the time. Later, in 1992, the assets of the Amiga versions were used for the conversion on the [[Sega Master System]], also made by Tiertex. A final fight with the Grandmaster was added in this version, but the ending credits continue to say that all was just a simulation.\n\n[[Sega]] produced their home version of ''Strider'' for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], which was released in Japan on September 29, 1990, with subsequent releases in North America and the [[PAL region]]. It was advertised as one of the first 8-Megabit cartridges for the system, and went on to be a bestseller.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140615174929/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue110/Pages/CVG11000078.jpg]</ref> <!-- Game of the year and best graphics status is mentioned in the Reception section --> This version was also re-released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on November 15, 2011 and in North America on February 16, 2012. The Genesis/Mega Drive version contains a different ending from the arcade game. This ending shows the destruction of the final stage as the game's protagonist makes his escape. This is then followed by the main credit sequence that sees Hiryu flying his glider in space and reminiscing about the various encounters he had during his mission as he heads back to earth. The ending theme was an edited combination of two separate pieces of music planned for the arcade game, but replaced with a repeat of the first level music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTxZ-uwcf04#t=2785 |title=Capcom Game Syndrome (Laserdisc) |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Computer magazine [[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] considered the previous Amiga conversion to be \"as good as this one\".<ref name=\"ace\"/>\n\nCapcom separately produced a version for the [[Sharp X68000]] computer in 1991, releasing it exclusively in Japan.

It features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor [[Kaneto Shiozawa]] as the voice of Hiryu and [[K\u014dji Totani]] as the Grand Master.

''Strider'' is a [[hack and slash]] [[Platform game|platformer]] set in a [[dystopian]] future in the year 2048 and features a wide range of settings that dramatically affect gameplay.\n\n''Strider'' marked the video game debut of [[Strider Hiryu|Hiryu]], a member of a secret group of ninjas known as the \u201cStriders\u201d shortly after the character's 1988 debut as the main character in a [[manga]] titled ''Strider Hiryu''.\n\nHiryu went on to become the main protagonist of a long-running series of video games and one of Capcom's most popular characters.\nThe arcade game is part of a three-way cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher [[Moto Kikaku]], which also includes a manga book and an [[NES]] [[Strider (NES video game)|video game]].\n\n[[Porting|Ports]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC compatibles]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were developed by [[Tiertex]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1989.\n\n[[Sega]] ported ''Strider'' to its own [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in 1990 to wide acclaim. Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the 1990 Video Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' and being featured in the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''. ''Strider'''s innovative, fast-paced gameplay is cited as a major influence on several popular video game franchises such as ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' and ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]''. It became one of Capcom's early big hits prior to ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', hailed for its innovative gameplay, diverse and unique music, and multilingual voice samples.\n\n==Gameplay== <!-- Please Note: Continues are allowed by default, but they can also be denied with a DIP switch setting.-->\n[[Image:Strider.png|thumb|left|The Kazakh SSR stage]]\n\nThe controls of ''Strider'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player controls the protagonist [[Strider Hiryu]], whose main weapon is a [[tonfa]]-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.\n\nNumerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the [[kanji]] used to write Hiryu's name: [[wiktionary:\u98db|\u98db]] and \u98db\u7adc), a max health extension (represented by the kanji [[wiktionary:\u7adc|\u7adc]], the second character in Hiryu's name), an [[extra life]], and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.<ref name=psmanualp17>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 17}}</ref> Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two [[mushroom]]-like droids, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed robo tiger]] and a robot [[hawk]], known individually as Options A, B and C respectively.<ref name=psmanualp18>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 18}}</ref>\n\nThe game has five stages: the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (called \"[[St. Petersburg]]\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the [[Siberia]]n Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog, the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian Jungle]], and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions). Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It is [[Game Over]] when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.\n\n==Plot== <!-- Please note: This page is for the original arcade game Strider.

Kouichi Yotsui, director of the coin-op ''Strider'' (who is credited as Isuke in the game), was chosen for his experience with the [[CP System]] hardware while working as a background designer on ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts]]''. The three projects were developed independently of each other.<ref name=Gameside>{{Cite journal|last1=Tane|first1=Kiyofume|last2=Gaijin Punch (translation)|title=The Father of Strider Who Made the Game World Explode: Kouichi Yotsui Discography|journal=Gameside|issue=16|date=February 2009|url=http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|access-date=30 Dec 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000306/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|archive-date=2014-12-22|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe original arcade game soundtrack was composed entirely by female video game music composer Junko Tamiya, who was not credited for her work in the arcade version but was mentioned as part of the original arcade staff in some console adaptations. Early revisions of the arcade game were missing the unique music for the Aerial Battleship and Third Moon stages. In this version the music from the first stage of the game was repeated here instead.<ref name=\"Tamiya\"/>\n\n''Strider'' contains many different styles of themes that change dynamically throughout the game according to the stages and the situations on screen. These range from [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[art rock|progressive]] futuristic [[sci-fi]] action themes to [[baroque music|baroque]], [[indigenous music|tribal]] and [[classical music|classical]] music pieces. Elements from the soundtrack have also been used in other Capcom games where Hiryu has appeared. These include the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series as well as other ''Strider'' related games.<ref name=\"Tamiya\"/>\n\n==Home versions==\nPorts of ''Strider'' for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were published by [[U.S. Gold]] and developed by [[Tiertex]] in 1989. The U.S. Gold versions have the order of the third and fourth stages swapped (the order of the [[cut-scene]]s were kept the same, causing a continuity error), and the final battle with the Grandmaster missing (the last stages end with the battle against the giant robot gorilla Mecha Pong). As a result, the ending was changed to reveal that the events of the game were a simulation that the player was going through. All five versions featured downgraded graphics, less music and missing enemies compared to the arcade version. Additionally, the controls were modified so that the game would be compatible with one-button joystick controllers. Despite these changes, all of the U.S. Gold releases received high review scores by computer game magazines of the time. Later, in 1992, the assets of the Amiga versions were used for the conversion on the [[Sega Master System]], also made by Tiertex. A final fight with the Grandmaster was added in this version, but the ending credits continue to say that all was just a simulation.\n\n[[Sega]] produced their home version of ''Strider'' for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], which was released in Japan on September 29, 1990, with subsequent releases in North America and the [[PAL region]]. It was advertised as one of the first 8-Megabit cartridges for the system, and went on to be a bestseller.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140615174929/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue110/Pages/CVG11000078.jpg]</ref> <!-- Game of the year and best graphics status is mentioned in the Reception section --> This version was also re-released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on November 15, 2011 and in North America on February 16, 2012. The Genesis/Mega Drive version contains a different ending from the arcade game. This ending shows the destruction of the final stage as the game's protagonist makes his escape. This is then followed by the main credit sequence that sees Hiryu flying his glider in space and reminiscing about the various encounters he had during his mission as he heads back to earth. The ending theme was an edited combination of two separate pieces of music planned for the arcade game, but replaced with a repeat of the first level music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTxZ-uwcf04#t=2785 |title=Capcom Game Syndrome (Laserdisc) |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Computer magazine [[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] considered the previous Amiga conversion to be \"as good as this one\".<ref name=\"ace\"/>\n\nCapcom separately produced a version for the [[Sharp X68000]] computer in 1991, releasing it exclusively in Japan. It is a very close reproduction of the arcade original, with minimal changes.\n\n[[NEC|NEC Avenue]] produced a [[PC Engine CD]] version of ''Strider Hiryu'', which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994 as a [[CD-ROM]]\u00b2 title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. It features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor [[Kaneto Shiozawa]] as the voice of Hiryu and [[K\u014dji Totani]] as the Grand Master. The PC Engine CD version had a long development process, having been planned in various formats, including the [[SuperGrafx]] at one point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lscmainframe.net/features/supergrafx/|title=The Rumored SuperGrafx Conversion|publisher=LSCM 4.0|accessdate=21 Dec 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723193203/http://www.lscmainframe.net/features/supergrafx/ |archivedate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Strider'' was first released by Capcom in 2000 as a second disc which came packaged with the PlayStation version of ''[[Strider 2]]''.

Its backgrounds were brilliantly designed and featured an array of exotic locations, while its sprite design was superb. There was a uniqueness to ''Strider'' art design that gave it a distinctive look back in 1989 and still makes it stand out brilliantly today. It's a mysterious mish-mash of different cultures that ensured it stood out from its arcade peers.\" Jones also praised the game's \"stunning animation\", gameplay, and controls, as well as its \"superbly atmospheric\" soundtrack.<ref name=ug>\"Ultimate Guide: Strider\" in ''Retro Gamer'' 121.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===NES game===\n{{Main|Strider (NES video game)}}\n\n[[Strider (NES video game)|''Strider'']] was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] exclusively in North America a few months after the arcade version's release. This version was produced alongside the arcade game but follows the plot of [[Moto Kikaku]]'s tie-in manga. A [[Famicom]] version of the same game was planned for release in Japan, but never made it to the shelves.\n\n===Sequels===\n{{Main|Strider II|Strider 2}}\n\nUnder license from Capcom U.S.A., [[U.S. Gold]] and [[Tiertex]] produced a ''Strider'' sequel in Europe titled ''[[Strider II]]'' (released in North America as ''Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns'') for various computer platforms, as well as the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Game Gear]], and [[Master System]] home consoles. This European-produced sequel was not released in Japan. Like the previous conversions of the original game, the quality of this one was very low. Capcom later produced another sequel, unrelated to the Tiertex-produced ''Strider Returns'', titled ''[[Strider 2]]'', which was released for the arcades and the [[PlayStation]] in 2000.\n\n===Reboot===\n{{Main|Strider (2014 video game)}}\n\nAn untitled ''Strider'' reboot game was being developed by [[Grin (company)|Grin]] in 2009, before being canceled by [[Capcom]], soon after ''[[Bionic Commando (2009 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'' was released.<ref name=\"euro\">{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-21-bionic-commando-dev-grin-worked-on-strider-reboot-streets-of-rage-remake |title=Bionic Commando dev Grin worked on Strider reboot, Streets of Rage remake News |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref> An all-new ''[[Strider (2014 video game)|Strider]]'' remake was developed by [[Double Helix Games]] and released on [[PlayStation Network]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox Live Arcade]] for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]], and [[Steam (software)|Steam]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://magx01.blogspot.ca/2013/07/new-strider-game-announced.html |title=New Strider Game Announced!!! ~ The Thoughtful Gamers |publisher=Magx01.blogspot.ca |date=2013-07-18 |accessdate=2013-07-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefreaks.co.nz/2013/07/19/capcom-unveils-next-gen-strider-game-san-diego-comiccon/ |title=Capcom reveals new Strider game at Comic-Con, developed by Double Helix |publisher=Gamefreaks |date=2013-07-19 |access-date=2013-07-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113202710/http://www.gamefreaks.co.nz/2013/07/19/capcom-unveils-next-gen-strider-game-san-diego-comiccon/ |archive-date=2014-01-13 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\n{{Main|Strider Hiryu}}\n\nStrider Hiryu also appears as a playable character in the 1998 fighting game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'', which was followed by ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' in 2000.

A conglomerate of two villages (Puduppattinam and Sadurangappatinam) and a [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|DAE]] township, it is about {{convert|55|km|mi}} from [[Thiruvanmiyur]] and {{convert|85|km|mi}} from [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]. This costal town is rather humid, since it is very close to the sea.Summers here prevail from early March till\nlate May.Temperatures in the Summer vary from 32 degree celsius and can go upto 41 degree celsius. There is no particular Monsoon season for Kalpakkam as rains are unpredictable here, although there is heavy rainfall in the months of October and November,Usually turning into a storm.Coolest months are December and January. A study by the Madras Atomic Power Station(MAPS) revealed that the pollution in Kalpakkam is very low, which when compared to the neighbouring city [[Chennai]] is 50 times less.\n \nKalpakkam is famous for its [[nuclear plant]]s and affiliated research installations. These include the [[Madras Atomic Power Station]] (MAPS), one of India's nuclear power plants, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research ([[IGCAR]]), an affiliate of the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]] (DAE) and [[ Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC). Eminent scientists from various different fields of science work here for research and development in nuclear science and engineering. Kalpakkam hosts the only nuclear plant in India with a Fast Breeder Test Reactor(FBTR) and a Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor(PHWR).\n\nDue to increasing congestion in Kalpakkam arising from the need to accommodate more employees, a new township of Anupuram/Amaipakkam, {{convert|8|km}} from Kalpakkam, was inaugurated in 1998.\n\nOne of the most tragic events in the history of Kalpakkam took place on 26 December 2004 on a Sunday. Kalpakkam was held in a panic which led to chaos and a lot of people evacuating the town.The [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] generated widespread damage and resulted in 200 deaths in and around Kalpakkam. There is a tsunami memorial having a white oval plaque engraved with the names of 39 people who lost their lives in the tsunami.\n\n==Facilities==\nKalpakkam is a well built and planned township.There is peace and serenity throught. The backwaters add beauty to the township where fishermen cast their nets. There is greenery everywhere The schools present in the township are Atomic Energy Central School (AECS 1 and 2), [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]-1, [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]-2, Govt Hr. Secondary School and Infant Jesus Matric Hr. Sec. School on Pudupattinam, with [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]]-2 being the best among all. The township is split into two sides: the [[Sadras]] and [[Pudupattinam, Kanchipuram|Pudupattinam]] sides. Both sides have similar facilities and also good facilities for sports, but Pudupattinam has more complete and bigger facilities, such as the hospital and the General Services Organization (GSO). The two sides are separated by two bridges over the canal which joins the sea nearby and well over the backwater with thousands of jellyfish moving underneath. Also, the backwater is a visiting place by many migratory birds especially the rarely seen [[Siberian crane]] in the depths of winter. The backwater can be clearly seen through the compound walls of K.V-2 in Sadras.\n\n==Recreation==\n[[File:Wall in kalpakkam.JPG|thumb|Tsunami wall in Kalpakkam]]\nUntil a few years ago, the beach at Kalpakkam used to be lined with [[casuarina]] trees and only a few weeds. Nowadays, to avoid the widespread damage in case of a tsunami again, weed growth is starting to dominate, which the locals are fighting to keep in check. Also, a tsunami wall has been built across the seashore in case of another tsunami. The relatively calm waters are free of sharks.\n\nKalpakkam is also very close to [[Mamallapuram]] \u2013 one of the famous tourist destinations near Chennai. The environment within the township has been maintained for over 30 years. The township contains numerous trees and various parks, and various outlets for recreation, including tennis courts, music, dance, swimming academies and other sport activities.\n\n==NESCO==\nNESCO (Nuclear Employee Sports and Cultural Organisation), previously KRC (Kalpakkam Recreation Centre) is governed by an elected employee council. It offers various facilities for members: Swimming, [[Movies]], [[Basketball]], [[Volleyball]], [[Football (soccer)|Football]], [[Badminton]], [[Carrom]], [[Chess]], [[Table tennis|Table Tennis]] and a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gym]]. There is also a tennis court and Swimming pool where competitions are held annually.\n\n==Bus routes==\nThe township is well connected by road and [[Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation|TNSTC]] operates buses from [[Chennai]], [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], [[Bangalore]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Trichy]], [[Nagercoil]], [[Tirupati (city)|Tirupathi]], [[Vellore]], [[Tiruvannamalai]] [[Chittoor]], [[Tindivanam]] and [[Kanchipuram]].

Early in the 3rd century, the [[Alemanni]] drove the Romans beyond the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]], but they in turn succumbed to the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], the decisive battle taking place in 496. The area later became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe history of Baden as a state began in the 12th century, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. As a fairly inconsequential [[margraviate]] that was divided between various branches of the ruling family for much of its history, it gained both status and territory during the [[Napoleon]]ic era, when it was also raised to the status of [[grand duchy]]. In 1871, it became one of the founder states of the [[German Empire]]. The monarchy came to an end with the end of the First World War, but Baden itself continued in existence as a state of Germany until the end of the Second World War.\n\nW\u00fcrttemberg, often spelled \"Wirtemberg\" or \"Wurtemberg\" in English, developed as a political entity in southwest Germany, with the core established around [[Stuttgart]] by [[Conrad I, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Count Conrad]] (died 1110). His descendants expanded W\u00fcrttemberg while surviving Germany's [[religious war]]s, changes in [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] policy, and invasions from France. The state had a basic parliamentary system that changed to [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] in the 18th century. Recognised as a kingdom in 1806\u20131918, its territory now forms part of the [[States of Germany|modern German state]] of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], one of the 16 states of Germany, a relatively young [[Federation|federal state]] that has only existed since 1952. The coat of arms represents the state's several historical component parts, of which Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg are the most important.\n\n== Celts, Romans and Alemani ==\n\nThe origin of the name \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" remains obscure. Scholars have universally rejected the once-popular derivation from \"Wirth am Berg\". Some authorities derive it from a proper name: \"Wiruto\" or \"Wirtino,\" others from a Celtic place-name, \"Virolunum\" or \"Verdunum\". In any event, from serving as the name of a castle near the [[Stuttgart]] city district of [[Rotenberg (Stuttgart)|Rotenberg]], the name extended over the surrounding country and, as the lords of this district increased their possessions, so the name covered an ever-widening area, until it reached its present extent. Early forms included ''Wirtenberg'', ''Wirtembenc'' and ''Wirtenberc''. ''Wirtemberg'' was long accepted, and in the latter part of the 16th century ''W\u00fcrtemberg'' and ''Wurttemberg'' appeared. In 1806, ''W\u00fcrttemberg'' became the official spelling, though ''Wurtemberg'' also appears frequently and occurs sometimes in official documents, and even on coins issued after that date.\n\nW\u00fcrttemberg's first known inhabitants, the [[Celts]], preceded the arrival of the [[Suebi]]. In the first century AD, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the land and defended their position there by constructing a [[defensive wall|rampart]] (''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]''). Early in the third century, the [[Alemanni]] drove the Romans beyond the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]], but they in turn succumbed to the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]], the decisive battle taking place in 496. For about 400 years, the district was part of the Frankish empire and was administered by counts until it was [[wikt:subsumption|subsumed]] in the ninth century by the German [[Duke of Swabia|Duchy of Swabia]].\n\n== Duchy of Swabia ==\n{{Main|Duchy of Swabia}}\n\n[[File:JH Renz - Burg Wirtemberg um 1600 (Lithographie ca.1840).jpg|thumb|The former [[Burg Wirtemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg Castle]] in an 18th-century print]]\n\nThe Duchy of [[Swabia]] is to a large degree comparable to the territory of the [[Alemanni]]. The [[Suevi]] (Sueben or Swabians) belonged to the tribe of the Alemanni, reshaped in the 3rd century. The name of Swabia is also derived from them. From the 9th century on, in place of the area designation \"[[Alemania]],\" came the name \"[[Schwaben]]\" (Swabia).<ref name=\"pantel-web.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw292_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 The Duchy of Swabia|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> Swabia was one of the five [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] of the [[East Francia|medieval Kingdom of the East Franks]], and its dukes were thus among the most powerful magnates of Germany. The most notable family to hold Swabia were the [[Hohenstaufen]], who held it, with a brief interruption, from 1079 until 1268. For much of this period, the Hohenstaufen were also [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. With the death of [[Conradin]], the last Hohenstaufen duke, the duchy itself disintegrated although King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] attempted to revive it for his [[Habsburg]] family in the late 13th century.\n\nWith the decline of [[East Francia]] power, the [[House of Z\u00e4hringen]] appeared to be ready as the local successor of the power in southwestern Germany and in the northwest in the [[Kingdom of Arles]]. Duke [[Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen|Berthold V]] of [[Duchy of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] founded the city of [[Bern]] in 1191, which became one of the House of Z\u00e4hringen power centers. East of the [[Jura Mountains]] and west of the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] was described as [[Upper Burgundy]], and Bern was part of the [[Landgraviate of Burgundy]], which was situated on both sides of the [[Aar]], between [[Thun]] and [[Solothurn]]. However Berthold died without an heir in 1218 and Bern was declared a [[Free imperial city]] by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Berthold's death without heirs meant the complete disintegration of southwest Germany and led to the development of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. Bern joined Switzerland in the year 1353.\n\nSwabia takes its name from the tribe of the Suebi, and the name was often used interchangeably with ''[[Alemannia]]'' during the existence of the stem-duchy in the [[High Middle Ages]]. Even [[Alsace]] belonged to it. Swabia was otherwise of great importance in securing the pass route to Italy. After the fall of the Staufers there was never again a Duchy of Swabia. The Habsburgs and the W\u00fcrttembergers endeavored in vain to resurrect it.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de\" />\n\n== Hohenstaufen, Welf and Z\u00e4hringen ==\n{{Main|House of Hohenstaufen|House of Welf|House of Z\u00e4hringen}}\n\n[[File:GrafschaftW\u00fcrttemberg.jpg|thumb|Arms of the counts of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n\nThree of the noble families of the southwest attained a special importance: the Hohenstaufen, the Welf and the Z\u00e4hringen. The most successful appear from the view of that time to be the Hohenstaufen, who, as dukes of Swabia from 1079 and as Frankish kings and emperors from 1138 to 1268, attained the greatest influence in Swabia.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw298_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 Staufer, Welfen, Z\u00e4hringer|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], various counts ruled the territory that now forms [[Baden, Germany|Baden]], among whom the counts and duchy of [[House of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] figure prominently. In 1112, [[Herman II, Margrave of Baden|Hermann]], son of [[Herman I, Margrave of Baden|Hermann]], Margrave of [[March of Verona|Verona]] (died 1074) and grandson of Duke [[Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia|Berthold II]] of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and the Count of [[County of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]], having inherited some of the German estates of his family, called himself Margrave of [[Margraviate of Baden|Baden]]. The separate history of Baden dates from this time. Hermann appears to have called himself \"[[margrave]]\" rather than \"[[count]],\" because of the family connection to the margrave of Verona.\n\nHis son and grandson, both called Hermann, added to their territories, which were then divided, and the lines of Baden-Baden and Baden-Hochberg were founded, the latter of which divided about a century later into Baden-Hochberg and [[Baden-Sausenberg]]. The family of Baden-Baden was very successful in increasing the area of its holdings.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen family controlled the duchy of Swabia until the death of Conradin in 1268, when a considerable part of its lands fell to the representative of a family first mentioned in about 1080, the count of W\u00fcrttemberg, [[Conrad I, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Conrad von Beutelsbach]], who took the name from his [[W\u00fcrttemberg (hill)|ancestral castle of W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n\nThe earliest historical details of a Count of W\u00fcrttemberg relate to one [[Ulrich I, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who ruled from 1241 to 1265. He served as marshal of Swabia and advocate of the town of [[Ulm]], had large possessions in the valleys of the [[Neckar]] and the [[Rems (river)|Rems]], and acquired [[Bad Urach|Urach]] in 1260. Under his sons, [[Ulrich II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Ulrich II]] and [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard I]], and their successors, the power of the family grew steadily. The charcoal-burner gave him some of his treasure, and was elevated to Duke of [[Duchy of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]]. To the Z\u00e4hringer sphere of influence originally belonged [[Freiburg]] and [[Offenburg]], [[Rottweil]] and [[Villingen]], and, in modern Switzerland, [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Bern]]. The three prominent noble families were in vigorous competition with one another, even though they were linked by kinship. The mother of the Stauffer King Friedrich Barbarossa (Red beard) was Judith Welfen. The Staufers, as well as the Z\u00e4hringers, based their claims of rule on ties with the family of the Frankish kings from the House of Salier.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de1\" />\n\n== Further Austria and the Palatinate ==\n{{Main|Further Austria|Palatinate (region)}}\n\nOther than the Margraviate of Baden and the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, Further Austria and the Palatinate lay on the edge of the southwestern area.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw300_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 Anterior Austria and the Electorate of Palatinate|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> '''Further Austria''' (in German: '''Vorder\u00f6sterreich''' or ''die '''Vorlande''''') was the collective name for the old possessions of the [[Habsburgs]] in south-western Germany ([[Swabia]]), the [[Alsace]], and in [[Vorarlberg]] after the focus of the Habsburgs had moved to Austria.\n\nFurther Austria comprised the [[Sundgau]] (southern Alsace) and the [[Breisgau]] east of the [[Rhine]] (including [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] after 1386) and included some scattered territories throughout Swabia, the largest being the [[margravate]] [[Burgau]] in the area of [[Augsburg]] and [[Ulm]]. Some territories in Vorarlberg that belonged to the Habsburgs were also considered part of Further Austria. The original homelands of the Habsburgs, the [[Aargau]] and much of the other original Habsburg possessions south of the Rhine and [[Lake Constance]] were lost in the 14th century to the expanding [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] after the battles of [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]] (1315) and [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]] (1386) and were never considered part of Further Austria, except the [[Fricktal]], which remained a Habsburg property until 1805.\n\nFurther Austria was ruled by the Duke of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]] until 1379. After that, the regent of Further Austria was the Duke of [[Duchy of Tyrol|Tyrol]].\n\nThe Palatinate arose as the '''County Palatine of the Rhine''', a large feudal state lying on both banks of the Rhine, which seems to have come into existence in the 10th century. The territory fell to the [[Wittelsbach]] Dukes of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in the early 13th century, and during a later division of territory among the heirs of Duke Louis II of [[Duchy of Upper Bavaria|Upper Bavaria]] in 1294, the elder branch of the Wittelsbachs came into possession not only of the Rhenish Palatinate, but also of that part of Upper Bavaria itself which was north of the Danube, and which came to be called the '''Upper Palatinate''' (''Oberpfalz''), in contrast to the '''Lower Palatinate''' along the Rhine. In the [[Golden Bull]] of 1356, the Palatinate was made one of the secular [[Holy Roman Empire elector|electorates]], and given the hereditary offices of '''Archsteward''' of the Empire and '''Imperial Vicar''' of the western half of Germany. From this time forth, the Count Palatine of the Rhine was usually known as the '''Elector Palatine'''.\n\nDue to the practice of division of territories among different branches of the family, by the early 16th century junior lines of the Palatine Wittelsbachs came to rule in [[Simmern]], [[Kaiserslautern]], and [[Zweibr\u00fccken]] in the Lower Palatinate, and in Neuburg and Sulzbach in the Upper Palatinate. The Elector Palatine, now based in Heidelberg, converted to Lutheranism in the 1530s.\n\nWhen the senior branch of the family died out in 1559, the Electorate passed to Frederick III of Simmern, a staunch [[Calvinist]], and the Palatinate became one of the major centers of Calvinism in Europe, supporting Calvinist rebellions in both the Netherlands and France. Frederick&nbsp;III's grandson, Frederick&nbsp;IV, and his adviser, [[Christian of Anhalt]], founded the [[Protestant Union|Evangelical Union]] of Protestant states in 1608, and in 1619 Elector Frederick&nbsp;V (the son-in-law of King [[James I of England|James I]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]]) accepted the throne of [[Bohemia]] from rebellious Protestant noblemen. He was soon defeated by the forces of [[Emperor Ferdinand II]] at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, and Spanish and Bavarian troops soon occupied the Palatinate itself. In 1623, Frederick was put under the ban of the Empire, and his territories and Electoral dignity granted to the Duke (now Elector) of Bavaria, [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I]].\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, the Sundgau became part of France, and in the 18th century, the Habsburgs acquired a few minor new territories in southern Germany such as [[Tettnang]]. In the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] of 1805, Further Austria was dissolved and the formerly Habsburg territories were assigned to [[Bavaria]], [[Baden]], and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], and the Fricktal to Switzerland.\n\nBy the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, Frederick&nbsp;V's son, Charles Louis, was restored to the Lower Palatinate, and given a new electoral title, but the Upper Palatinate and the senior electoral title remained with the Bavarian line. In 1685, the Simmern line died out, and the Palatinate was inherited by the Count Palatine of Neuburg (who was also Duke of [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich]] and [[Berg, Upper Palatinate|Berg]]), a Catholic. The Neuburg line, which moved the capital to Mannheim, lasted until 1742, when it, too, became extinct, and the Palatinate was inherited by the Duke Karl Theodor of [[Duchy of Sulzbach|Sulzbach]]. The childless Karl Theodor also inherited Bavaria when its electoral line became extinct in 1777, and all the Wittelsbach lands save Zweibr\u00fccken on the French border (whose Duke was, in fact, Karl Theodor's presumptive heir) were now under a single ruler. The Palatinate was destroyed in the Wars of the French Revolution&nbsp;\u2013 first its left bank territories were occupied, and then annexed, by France starting in 1795, and then, in 1803, its right bank territories were taken by the Margrave of Baden. The provincial government in Alsace was alternately administered by the Palatinate (1408\u20131504, 1530\u20131558) and by the Habsburgs (13th and 14th centuries, 1504\u20131530). Only the margraves of Baden and the counts and dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg included both homelands within their territories. With the political reordering of the southwest after 1800, Further Austria and the Electorate Palatine disappeared from history.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de2\" />\n\n== Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg before the Reformation ==\n{{Main|Margraviate of Baden|County of W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\n[[File:Hans Baldung - Count Christoph I of Baden - WGA01215.jpg|thumb|''Christoph I of Baden'', by [[Hans Baldung Grien]], 1515]]\n\n[[File:900-49 Ratssitzung Eberhard der Milde.jpg|thumb|Eberhard III in Council]]\n\nThe lords of W\u00fcrttemberg were first named in 1092.

Bernard, a soldier of some renown, continued the work of his predecessors and obtained other districts, including Baden-Hochberg, the ruling family of which died out in 1418.\n\nDuring the 15th century, a war with the [[Frederick I, Elector Palatine|Count Palatine of the Rhine]] deprived the Margrave [[Charles I of Baden|Charles I]] (died 1475) of a part of his territories, but these losses were more than recovered by his son and successor, [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Christoph I of Baden]] (''illustration, right''). In 1503, the family Baden-Sausenberg became extinct, and the whole of Baden was united by Christophe.\n\nUnder his sons, [[Ulrich II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Ulrich II]] and [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard I]], and their successors, the power of the family grew steadily. Eberhard&nbsp;I (died 1325) opposed, sometimes successfully, three Holy Roman emperors. He doubled the area of his county and transferred his residence from W\u00fcrttemberg Castle to the [[Old Castle (Stuttgart)|\"Old Castle\"]] in today's city centre of [[Stuttgart]].\n\nHis successors were not as prominent, but all added something to the land area of W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1381, the [[Duchy of Teck]] was bought, and marriage to an heiress added [[Montb\u00e9liard]] in 1397. The family divided its lands among collateral branches several times but, in 1482, the [[Treaty of M\u00fcnsingen]] reunited the territory, declared it indivisible, and united it under Count [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard V]], called ''im Bart'' (The Bearded). This arrangement received the sanction of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], in 1495.\n\nUnusually for Germany, from 1457 W\u00fcrttemberg had a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]], the ''[[Landtag]]'', known otherwise as the \"diet\" or [[Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg|\"Estates\" of W\u00fcrttemberg]], that had to approve new taxation.\n\nIn 1477, [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Count Eberhard]] founded the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] and expelled the Jews. At Eberhard's death in 1496, his cousin, Duke [[Eberhard II, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard II]], succeeded for a short reign of two years, terminated by a [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]].\n \nEberhard V proved one of the most energetic rulers that W\u00fcrttemberg ever had, and, in 1495, his [[county]] became a [[duchy]]. Eberhard was now Duke [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard I]] of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]].<ref>This type of sovereign royal duke was known in Germany as a ''[[Herzog]]''.</ref> W\u00fcrttemberg, after the partition from 1442 to 1482, had no further land partitions to endure and remained a relatively closed country.

Religious differences increased the family's rivalry. During the period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] some of the rulers of Baden remained [[Catholic]] and some became [[Protestant]]s. One of Christoph's sons died childless in 1533. In 1535, his remaining sons Bernard and Ernest, having shared their brother's territories, made a fresh division and founded the lines of Baden-Baden and Baden-Pforzheim, called [[Baden-Durlach]] after 1565. Further divisions followed, and the weakness caused by these partitions was accentuated by a rivalry between the two main branches of the family, culminating in open warfare.\n\nThe long reign (1498\u20131550) of Duke [[Ulrich, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Ulrich]], who succeeded to the duchy while still a child, proved a most eventful period for the country, and many traditions cluster round the name of this gifted, unscrupulous and ambitious man. Duke Ulrich of W\u00fcrttemberg had been living in his County of M\u00f6mpelgard since 1519. He had been exiled from his duchy by his own fault and controversial encroachments into non-W\u00fcrttembergish possessions. In Basel, Duke Ulrich came into contact with the Reformation.\n\nAided by [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philip]], landgrave of [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Hesse]], and other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] princes, he fought a victorious battle against Ferdinand's troops at [[Lauffen am Neckar|Lauffen]] in May 1534. Then, by the treaty of Cadan, he again became duke, but perforce duke of the duchy as an Austrian fief. He subsequently introduced the reformed religious doctrines, endowed Protestant churches and schools throughout his land, and founded the [[T\u00fcbinger Stift]] seminary in 1536. Ulrich's connection with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] led to another expulsion but, in 1547, Charles&nbsp;V reinstated him, albeit on somewhat onerous terms.\n\nThe total population during the 16th century was between 300,000 and 400,000. Ulrich's son and successor, [[Christoph, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Christoph]] (1515\u20131568), completed the work of converting his subjects to the reformed faith. He introduced a system of church government, the Grosse [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Kirchenordnung]], which endured in part into the 20th century. In this reign, a standing commission started to superintend the finances, and the members of this body, all of whom belonged to the upper classes, gained considerable power in the state, mainly at the expense of the towns, by means of the [[Oberamt]]ure and later, in addition, the [[Landkreis]].\n\nChristopher's son [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Louis]], the founder of the Collegium illustre in [[T\u00fcbingen]], died childless in 1593. A kinsman, [[Frederick I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick I]] (1557\u20131608) succeeded to the duchy. This energetic prince disregarded the limits placed on his authority by the rudimentary constitution. By paying a large sum of money, he induced the emperor [[Rudolph II]] in 1599 to free the duchy from the [[suzerainty]] of Austria. Austria still controlled large areas around the duchy, known as \"[[Further Austria]]\". Thus, once again, W\u00fcrttemberg became a [[Imperial immediacy|direct fief]] of the empire, securing its independence. Even the [[Margraviate of Baden-Baden]] went over to Lutheranism that same year, but indeed only for a short time. Likewise, after the Peace of Augsburg the Reformation was carried out in the County of Hohenlohe. At the same time, however, the Counter-Reformation began. It was persistently supported by the Emperor and the clerical princes.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de4\" />\n\n== Peasants' War ==\n{{Main|German Peasants' War}}\n\nThe living conditions of the peasants in the German southwest at the beginning of the 16th century were quite modest, but an increase in taxes and several bad harvests, with no improvement in sight, led to crisis. Under the sign of the sandal (''Bundschuh''), that is, the farmer's shoe that tied up with laces, rebellions broke out on the Upper Rhine, in the [[Bishopric of Speyer]], in the Black Forest and in the upper Neckar valley at the end of the 15th century.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw308_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 The Peasants' War|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> The [[extortion]]s by which he sought to raise money for his extravagant pleasures excited an uprising known as the ''arme Konrad'' ([[Poor Conrad]]), not unlike the rebellion in England led by [[Wat Tyler]]. The authorities soon restored order, and, in 1514, by the Treaty of [[T\u00fcbingen]], the people undertook to pay the duke's debts in return for various political privileges, which in effect laid the foundation of the constitutional liberties of the country. A few years later, Ulrich quarrelled with the [[Swabian League]], and its forces (helped by Duke [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria|William IV]] of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], angered by the treatment meted out by Ulrich to his wife [[Sabina of Bavaria|Sabina]], a Bavarian princess), invaded W\u00fcrttemberg, expelled the duke and sold his duchy to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], for 220,000 [[Baden gulden|gulden]].\n\nCharles handed W\u00fcrttemberg over to his brother, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who served as nominal ruler for a few years. Soon, however, the discontent caused by the oppressive Austrian rule, the disturbances in Germany leading to the [[German Peasants' War]] and the commotions aroused by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] gave Ulrich an opportunity to recover his duchy. Thus Marx Sittich of Hohenems went against the Hegenau and Klettgau rebels. On 4 November 1525 he struck down a last attempt by the peasants in that same countryside where the peasants' unrest had begun a year before.

During his reign, which ended in July 1628, W\u00fcrttemberg suffered severely from the [[Thirty Years' War]] although the duke himself took no part in it. His son and successor [[Eberhard III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard III]] (1628\u20131674), however, plunged into it as an ally of France and Sweden as soon as he came of age in 1633, but after the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|battle of Nordlingen]] in 1634, Imperial troops occupied the duchy and the duke himself went into exile for some years. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] restored him, but to a depopulated and impoverished country, and he spent his remaining years in efforts to repair the disasters of the lengthy war. W\u00fcrttemberg was a central battlefield of the war. Its population fell by 57% between 1634 and 1655, primarily because of death and disease, declining birthrates, and the mass migration of terrified [[peasant]]s.<ref>Peter Wilson, ''The Thirty Years' War: Europe's tragedy''  (2009) p 789</ref>\n\nFrom 1584 to 1622, [[Baden-Baden]] was in the possession of one of the princes of [[Principality of Baden-Durlach|Baden-Durlach]]. The house was similarly divided during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Baden suffered severely during this struggle, and both branches of the family were exiled in turn. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 restored the [[status quo]], and the family rivalry gradually died out. For one part of the southwest, a peace of 150 years began. On the [[Middle Neckar]], in the whole [[Upper Rhine]] area and especially in the Electorate Palatine, the wars waged by the French [[King Louis XIV]] from 1674 to 1714 caused further terrible destruction. The [[Kingdom of France]] penetrated through acquired possessions in [[Alsace]] to the [[Rhine]] border. Switzerland separated from the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"pantel-web.de7\" />\n\n== Swabian Circle until the French Revolution ==\n{{Main|Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|Swabian Circle}}\n\n[[File:Residenzschloss Ludwigsburg.jpg|thumb|[[Ludwigsburg Palace]] and Baroque Gardens, near Stuttgart]]\n\n[[File:Stuttgart NeuesSchloss.JPG|thumb|The New Castle, Stuttgart]]\n\n[[File:W\u00fcrttembergische K\u00f6nigskrone-MFr-3.jpg|thumb|The royal crown of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n\n[[File:Flagge K\u00f6nigreich W\u00fcrttemberg.svg|thumb|Flag of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n\nThe duchy survived mainly because it was larger than its immediate neighbours. However, it was often under pressure during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] from the Catholic Holy Roman Empire, and from repeated French invasions in the 17th and 18th centuries. W\u00fcrttemberg happened to be in the path of French and Austrian armies engaged in the long rivalry between the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] and [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] dynasties.\n\nDuring the wars of the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]], the margravate was ravaged by French troops and the towns of [[Pforzheim]], [[Durlach]], and Baden were destroyed. [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] (died 1707), figured prominently among the soldiers who resisted the aggressions of France.\n\nIt was the life's work of [[Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick of Baden-Durlach]] to give territorial unity to his country. Beginning his reign in 1738, and coming of age in 1746, this prince is the most notable of the rulers of Baden. He was interested in the development of agriculture and commerce, sought to improve education and the administration of justice, and proved in general to be a wise and liberal ruler in the Age of [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nIn 1771, [[Augustus George, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Augustus George of Baden-Baden]] died without sons, and his territories passed to Charles Frederick, who thus finally became ruler of the whole of Baden. Although Baden was united under a single ruler, the territory was not united in its customs and tolls, tax structure, laws or government. Baden did not form a compact territory. Rather, a number of separate districts lay on both banks of the upper [[Rhine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoeckmann.de/germany/map-bwsouth.htm|title=Historical Map of Baden-Wurttemberg 1789 \u2013 Southern Part|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> His opportunity for territorial aggrandisement came during the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Louis]] (1676\u20131733), who succeeded as a one-year-old when his father Duke [[William Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|William Louis]] died in 1677, W\u00fcrttemberg had to face another destructive enemy, [[Louis XIV of France]]. In 1688, 1703 and 1707, the French entered the duchy and inflicted brutalities and suffering upon the inhabitants. The sparsely populated country afforded a welcome to fugitive [[Waldensians|Waldenses]], who did something to restore it to prosperity, but the extravagance of the duke, anxious to provide for the expensive tastes of his mistress, Christiana Wilhelmina von Gr\u00e4venitz, undermined this benefit.\n\nIn 1704, Eberhard Ludwig started to build [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] to the north of Stuttgart, in imitation of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].\n\n[[Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Charles Alexander]], who became duke in 1733, had become a [[Roman Catholic]] while an officer in the Austrian service. His favourite adviser was the Jew [[Joseph S\u00fc\u00df Oppenheimer]], and suspicions arose that master and servant were aiming at the suppression of the [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] (the local parliament) and the introduction of Roman Catholicism. However, the sudden death of Charles Alexander in March 1737 put an abrupt end to any such plans, and the regent, Duke [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt|Carl Rudolf]] of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt|W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt]], had Oppenheimer hanged.\n\n[[Charles Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Charles Eugene]] (1728\u20131793), who came of age in 1744, appeared gifted, but proved to be vicious and extravagant, and he soon fell into the hands of unworthy favourites. He spent a great deal of money in building the [[New Castle (Stuttgart)|\"New Castle\"]] in [[Stuttgart]] and elsewhere, and sided against [[Prussia]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756\u20131763, which was unpopular with his Protestant subjects. His whole reign featured dissension between ruler and ruled, the duke's irregular and arbitrary methods of raising money arousing great discontent. The intervention of the emperor and even of foreign powers ensued and, in 1770, a formal arrangement removed some of the grievances of the people. Charles Eugene did not keep his promises, but later, in his old age, he made a few further concessions.\n\nCharles Eugene left no legitimate heirs, and was succeeded by his brother, [[Louis Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Louis Eugene]] (died 1795), who was childless, and then by another brother, [[Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick Eugene]] (died 1797). This latter prince, who had served in the army of [[Frederick the Great]], to whom he was related by marriage, and then managed his family's estates around [[Montb\u00e9liard]], educated his children in the Protestant faith as [[francophone]]s. All of the subsequent W\u00fcrttemberg royal family were descended from him. Thus, when his son [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick II]] became duke in 1797, Protestantism returned to the ducal household, and the royal house adhered to this faith thereafter. Nevertheless, the district legislatures as well as the imperial diets offered a possibility of regulating matters in dispute. Much was left over from the trials before the imperial courts, which often lasted decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw316_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 The German southwest at the end of the 18th century|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Southwest Germany up to 1918 ==\n{{Main|Electorate of Baden|Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|Grand Duchy of Baden|Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\n[[File:KgrWuerttemberg.png|thumb|Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg as it existed from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the end of World War I.

Its countryside was devastated in the ensuing battles. In 1796, the margrave was compelled to pay an [[indemnity]] and to cede his territories on the left bank of the Rhine to France. Fortune, however, soon returned to his side.\n\nIn 1803, largely owing to the good offices of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], emperor of Russia, the margrave received the [[Bishopric of Konstanz]], part of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Rhenish Palatinate]], and other smaller districts, together with the dignity of a [[prince-elector]]. Changing sides in 1805, he fought for [[Napoleon]], with the result that, by the [[peace of Pressburg (1805)|peace of Pressburg]] in that year, he obtained the [[Breisgau]] and other territories at the expense of the [[Habsburgs]] (see [[Further Austria]]). In 1806, the Baden margrave joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], declared himself a sovereign prince, became a [[grand duke]], and received additional territory.\n\nOn 1 January 1806, Duke Frederick II assumed the title of King [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick I]], abrogated the constitution, and united old and new W\u00fcrttemberg. Subsequently, he placed church lands under the control of the state and received some formerly self-governing areas under the [[German Mediatisation|\"mediatisation\"]] process. In 1806, he joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and received further additions of territory containing 160,000 inhabitants. A little later, by the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|peace of Vienna]] in October 1809, about 110,000 more persons came under his rule.\n\nIn return for these favors, Frederick joined [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in his campaigns against Prussia, Austria and Russia. Some 16,000 of his subjects marched as soldiers with the French invasion of Russia to take Moscow; only a few hundred survived to return. After the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, King Frederick deserted the waning fortunes of the French emperor. By a treaty made with [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] at [[Fulda]] in November 1813, he secured the confirmation of his royal title and of his recent acquisitions of territory. He directed his forces to fight with allies in their attack on France.\n\nIn 1815, the king joined the [[German Confederation]], but the [[Congress of Vienna]] made no change in the extent of his lands. In the same year, he proposed a new constitution to the representatives of his people, but they rejected it. In the midst of this controversy, Frederick died on 30 October 1816.\n\nThe new king, [[William I of W\u00fcrttemberg|William I]] (reigned 1816\u20131864), at once took up the constitutional question and, after much discussion, granted a new constitution in September 1819. This constitution, with subsequent modifications, remained in force until 1918 (see [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]). A period of quiet was established. The condition of the kingdom, its education, agriculture trade and manufactures, began to receive earnest attention. King William I helped to repair the shattered finances of the country. But the people's desire for greater political freedom did not fade away under the 1819 constitution. After 1830, a certain amount of unrest occurred. This, however, soon died. The inclusion of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German [[Zollverein]] and the construction of [[History of railways in W\u00fcrttemberg|railways]] fostered trade.\n\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolutionary movement of 1848]] did not leave W\u00fcrttemberg untouched, although no associated violence took place within the kingdom. King William had to dismiss Johannes Schlayer (1792\u20131860) and his other ministers, calling to power men with more liberal ideas and the exponents of the idea of a united Germany. King William did proclaim a democratic constitution but, as soon as the movement had spent its force, he dismissed the liberal ministers. In October 1849, Schlayer and his associates returned to power. In Baden, by contrast, there was a [[Baden Revolution|serious uprising]] that had to be put down by force.\n\nBy interfering with popular electoral rights, the king and his ministers succeeded in assembling a servile ''diet'' in 1851, which surrendered all the privileges gained since 1848. In this way, the authorities restored the constitution of 1819, and power passed into the hands of a [[bureaucracy]]. A [[concordat]] with the [[Papacy]] proved almost the last act of William's long reign. But the ''diet'' repudiated the agreement, preferring to regulate relations between church and state in its own way.\n\nIn July 1864, [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Charles]] (1823\u20131891, reigned 1864\u201391) succeeded his father William I as king. Almost at once, he was faced with considerable difficulties. In the duel between Austria and [[Prussia]] for supremacy in Germany, William I had consistently taken the Austrian side. The new king and his advisers continued this policy.\n\nIn 1866, W\u00fcrttemberg took up arms on behalf of Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], but three weeks after the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] on 3 July 1866, her troops suffered a comprehensive defeat at [[Tauberbischofsheim]], and the country lay at the mercy of Prussia. The Prussians occupied the northern part of W\u00fcrttemberg and negotiated a peace in August 1866. By this, W\u00fcrttemberg paid an indemnity of 8,000,000 gulden, but she at once concluded a secret offensive and defensive treaty with her conqueror. W\u00fcrttemberg was a party to the [[Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868]].\n\nThe end of the struggle against Prussia allowed a renewal of democratic agitation in W\u00fcrttemberg. This had not achieved any changes before the great [[Franco-Prussian War|war between France and Prussia]] broke out in 1870. Although the policy of W\u00fcrttemberg had continued to be antagonistic to Prussia, the kingdom shared in the national enthusiasm that swept over Germany, and its troops took a creditable part in the [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]] and in other operations of the war.\n\nIn 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg became a member of the new [[German Empire]], but retained control of her own [[post office]], [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and railways. She had also certain special privileges with regard to taxation and the army and, for the next 10 years, W\u00fcrttemberg's policy enthusiastically supported the new order. Many important reforms, especially in the area of finance, ensued, but a proposal for a union of the railway system with that of the rest of Germany failed. After reductions in taxation in 1889, the reform of the constitution became the question of the hour. King Charles and his ministers wished to strengthen the conservative element in the chambers, but the laws of 1874, 1876 and 1879 only effected slight reforms pending a more thorough settlement. On 6 October 1891, King Charles died suddenly. His cousin [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|William II]] (1848\u20131921, reigned 1891\u20131918) succeeded and continued the policy of his predecessor.\n\nDiscussions on the reform of the constitution continued, and the election of 1895 memorably returned a powerful party of democrats. King William had no sons, nor had his only Protestant kinsman, Duke Nicholas (1833\u20131903). Consequently, the succession would ultimately pass to a Roman Catholic branch of the family, and this prospect raised certain difficulties about the relations between church and state. The heir to the throne in 1910 was the Roman Catholic [[Albrecht, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Albert]] (b. 1865).\n\nBetween 1900 and 1910, the political history of W\u00fcrttemberg centred round the settlement of the constitutional and the educational questions. The constitution underwent revision in 1906, and a settlement of the education difficulty occurred in 1909. In 1904, the railway system integrated with that of the rest of Germany.\n\nThe population in 1905 was 2,302,179, of whom 69% were Protestant, 30% Catholic and 0.5% Jewish. Protestants largely preponderated in the Neckar district, and Roman Catholics in that of the Danube. In 1910, an estimated 506,061 people worked in the agricultural sector, 432,114 in industrial occupations and 100,109 in trade and commerce. (see [[Demographics of W\u00fcrttemberg]])\n\nIn the confusion at the end of World War I, Frederick [[abdication|abdicated]] on 22 November 1918. A republic had already been declared on 14 November.\n\nIn the course of the revolutionary activities at the close of World War I in November 1918, King William II abdicated on 30 November, and a republican government ensued.\n\nW\u00fcrttemberg became a state (''Land'') in the new [[Weimar Republic]]. Baden named itself a \"democratic republic,\" W\u00fcrttemberg a \"free popular state.\" Instead of monarchs, state presidents were in charge. They were elected by the state legislatures, in Baden by an annual change, in W\u00fcrttemberg after each legislative election.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de6\" />\n\n== German southwest up to World War II ==\n\n[[File:Wappen Volksstaat W\u00fcrttemberg (Farbe).svg|thumb|[[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] coat of arms]]\n\nPolitics between 1918 and 1919 towards a merger of W\u00fcrttemberg and Baden remained largely unsuccessful. After the excitements of the 1918\u20131919 revolution, its [[W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag elections in the Weimar Republic|five election results]] between 1919 and 1932 show a decreasing vote for left-wing parties. After the seizure of power by the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) in the year 1933, the state borders initially remained unchanged. The state of Baden, the state of W\u00fcrttemberg and the Hohenzollern states (the government district of Sigmaringen) continued to exist, albeit with much less autonomy with regard to the empire. From 1934, the [[Administrative division of Nazi Germany|Gau]] of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern added the [[Province of Hohenzollern]].\n\nBy 30 April 1945, all of Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg and Hohenzollern were completely occupied.\n\n== Southwest Germany after the war ==\n{{Main|South Baden|W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern}}\n\nAfter World War II was over, the states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg were split between the American occupation zone in the north and the French occupation zone in the south, which also got Hohenzollern. The border between the occupation zones followed the district borders, but they were drawn purposely in such a way that the autobahn from Karlsruhe to Munich (today the [[Bundesautobahn 8]]) ended up inside the American occupation zone. In the American occupation zone, the state of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] was founded; in the French occupation zone, the southern part of former Baden became the [[South Baden|new state of Baden]] while the southern part of W\u00fcrttemberg and Hohenzollern were fused into [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]].\n\nArticle 29 of the [[Basic Law]] of Germany provided for a way to change the German states via a community vote; however, it could not enter into force due to a veto by the Allied forces. Instead, a separate article 118 mandated the fusion of the three states in the southwest via a trilateral agreement. If the three affected states failed to agree, federal law would have to regulate the future of the three states. This article was based on the results of a conference of the German states held in 1948, where the creation of a Southwest State was agreed upon. The alternative, generally favored in South Baden, was to recreate Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg (including Hohenzollern) in its old, pre-war borders.\n\nThe trilateral agreement failed because the states couldn't agree on the voting system. As such, federal law decided on 4 May 1951 that the area be split into four electoral districts: North W\u00fcrttemberg, South W\u00fcrttemberg, North Baden and South Baden. Because it was clear that both districts in W\u00fcrttemberg as well as North Baden would support the merger, the voting system favored the supporters of the new Southwest State. The state of Baden brought the law to the [[German Constitutional Court]] to have it declared as unconstitutional, but failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv001014.html|title=DFR \u2013 BVerfGE 1, 14 \u2013 S\u00fcdweststaat|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe plebiscite took place on 9 December 1951. In both parts of W\u00fcrttemberg, 93% were in favor of the merger, in North Baden 57% were in favor, but in South Baden only 38% were. Because three of four electoral districts voted in favor of the new Southwest State, the merger was decided upon. Had Baden as a whole formed a single electoral district, the vote would have failed.\n\n== State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg from 1952 to the present ==\n{{Main|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\nThe members of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] were elected on 9 March 1952, and on 25 April the Prime Minister was elected. With this, the new state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was founded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpb-bw.de/entstehung_baden-wuerttembergs.html|title=25. April 1952 \u2013 Die Entstehung des Landes Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> After the constitution of the new state entered force, the members of the constitutional convention formed the state parliament until the first election in 1956. The name ''Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg'' was only intended as a temporary name, but ended up the official name of the state because no other name could be agreed upon.\n\nIn May 1954, the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ''landtag'' (legislature) decided on adoption of the following [[coat of arms]]: three black [[lion]]s on a golden shield, framed by a [[deer]] and a [[griffin]]. This coat of arms once belonged to the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Staufen family]], emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and [[Dukes of Swabia]]. The golden deer stands for W\u00fcrttemberg, the griffin for Baden. Conversely the former W\u00fcrttemberg counties of [[Calw]], [[Freudenstadt]], [[Horb]], [[Rottweil]] and [[Tuttlingen]] were incorporated into the Baden governmental districts of [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Freiburg]]. The last traces of Hohenzollern disappeared. Between county and district, regional associations were formed that are responsible for overlapping planning.\n\nThe opponents of the merger did not give up. After the [[General Treaty]] gave Germany full sovereignty, the opponents applied for a community vote to restore Baden to its old borders by virtue of paragraph&nbsp;2 of Article&nbsp;29 of the Basic Law, which allowed a community vote in states which had been changed after the war without a community vote. The Federal Ministry of the Interior refused the application on the grounds that a community vote had already taken place. The opponents sued in front of the German Constitutional Court and won in 1956, with the court deciding that the plebiscite of 1951 had not been a community vote as defined by the law because the more populous state of W\u00fcrttemberg had had an unfair advantage over the less populous state of Baden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv005034.html|title=DFR \u2013 BVerfGE 5, 34 \u2013 Baden-Abstimmung|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> Because the court did not set a date for the community vote, the government simply did nothing. The opponents eventually sued again in 1969, which led to the decision that the vote had to take place before 30 June 1970. On 7 June, the majority voted against the proposal to restore the state of Baden.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Germany|History}}\n\n* [[Timeline of Stuttgart]]\n* [[History of S\u00fcdwestrundfunk]]; the ''S\u00fcdwestrundfunk'' (SWR) is the public-[[broadcasting]] institution of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (and Rhineland-Palatinate)\n* [[History of Franconia]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\n{{History of the States of Germany}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Wurttemberg}}\n[[Category:History of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg| ]]\n[[Category:House of W\u00fcrttemberg| ]]\n[[Category:History of Baden]]\n[[Category:History of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Swabian Circle]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2016}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:AltesSchlossStuttgart.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Old Castle (Stuttgart)]]]]\n\nThe '''history of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg''' covers the area included in the historical state of [[Baden]], the former Prussian [[Province of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]], and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], part of the region of [[Swabia]] since the 9th century.<ref name=Planet>{{Cite book | author1=Andrea Schulte-Peevers|author2=Anthony Haywood | author3=Sarah Johnstone | author4=Jeremy Gray | author5=Daniel Robinson | title=Germany | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5t5mZE_s5YC&pg=PA392#PPA391,M1 | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] | isbn=978-1-74059-988-7 | year=2007 | accessdate=1 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st century AD, W\u00fcrttemberg was occupied by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], who defended their control of the territory by constructing a ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'' (fortified boundary zone). Early in the 3rd century, the [[Alemanni]] drove the Romans beyond the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]], but they in turn succumbed to the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I]], the decisive battle taking place in 496. The area later became part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe history of Baden as a state began in the 12th century, as a [[fief]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. As a fairly inconsequential [[margraviate]] that was divided between various branches of the ruling family for much of its history, it gained both status and territory during the [[Napoleon]]ic era, when it was also raised to the status of [[grand duchy]]. In 1871, it became one of the founder states of the [[German Empire]]. The monarchy came to an end with the end of the First World War, but Baden itself continued in existence as a state of Germany until the end of the Second World War.\n\nW\u00fcrttemberg, often spelled \"Wirtemberg\" or \"Wurtemberg\" in English, developed as a political entity in southwest Germany, with the core established around [[Stuttgart]] by [[Conrad I, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Count Conrad]] (died 1110). His descendants expanded W\u00fcrttemberg while surviving Germany's [[religious war]]s, changes in [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] policy, and invasions from France. The state had a basic parliamentary system that changed to [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] in the 18th century. Recognised as a kingdom in 1806\u20131918, its territory now forms part of the [[States of Germany|modern German state]] of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], one of the 16 states of Germany, a relatively young [[Federation|federal state]] that has only existed since 1952. The coat of arms represents the state's several historical component parts, of which Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg are the most important.\n\n== Celts, Romans and Alemani ==\n\nThe origin of the name \"W\u00fcrttemberg\" remains obscure. Scholars have universally rejected the once-popular derivation from \"Wirth am Berg\". Some authorities derive it from a proper name: \"Wiruto\" or \"Wirtino,\" others from a Celtic place-name, \"Virolunum\" or \"Verdunum\". In any event, from serving as the name of a castle near the [[Stuttgart]] city district of [[Rotenberg (Stuttgart)|Rotenberg]], the name extended over the surrounding country and, as the lords of this district increased their possessions, so the name covered an ever-widening area, until it reached its present extent. Early forms included ''Wirtenberg'', ''Wirtembenc'' and ''Wirtenberc''. ''Wirtemberg'' was long accepted, and in the latter part of the 16th century ''W\u00fcrtemberg'' and ''Wurttemberg'' appeared. In 1806, ''W\u00fcrttemberg'' became the official spelling, though ''Wurtemberg'' also appears frequently and occurs sometimes in official documents, and even on coins issued after that date.\n\nW\u00fcrttemberg's first known inhabitants, the [[Celts]], preceded the arrival of the [[Suebi]]. In the first century AD, the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered the land and defended their position there by constructing a [[defensive wall|rampart]] (''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]''). Early in the third century, the [[Alemanni]] drove the Romans beyond the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]], but they in turn succumbed to the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]], the decisive battle taking place in 496. For about 400 years, the district was part of the Frankish empire and was administered by counts until it was [[wikt:subsumption|subsumed]] in the ninth century by the German [[Duke of Swabia|Duchy of Swabia]].\n\n== Duchy of Swabia ==\n{{Main|Duchy of Swabia}}\n\n[[File:JH Renz - Burg Wirtemberg um 1600 (Lithographie ca.1840).jpg|thumb|The former [[Burg Wirtemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg Castle]] in an 18th-century print]]\n\nThe Duchy of [[Swabia]] is to a large degree comparable to the territory of the [[Alemanni]]. The [[Suevi]] (Sueben or Swabians) belonged to the tribe of the Alemanni, reshaped in the 3rd century. The name of Swabia is also derived from them. From the 9th century on, in place of the area designation \"[[Alemania]],\" came the name \"[[Schwaben]]\" (Swabia).<ref name=\"pantel-web.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw292_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 The Duchy of Swabia|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> Swabia was one of the five [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] of the [[East Francia|medieval Kingdom of the East Franks]], and its dukes were thus among the most powerful magnates of Germany. The most notable family to hold Swabia were the [[Hohenstaufen]], who held it, with a brief interruption, from 1079 until 1268. For much of this period, the Hohenstaufen were also [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. With the death of [[Conradin]], the last Hohenstaufen duke, the duchy itself disintegrated although King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolf I]] attempted to revive it for his [[Habsburg]] family in the late 13th century.\n\nWith the decline of [[East Francia]] power, the [[House of Z\u00e4hringen]] appeared to be ready as the local successor of the power in southwestern Germany and in the northwest in the [[Kingdom of Arles]]. Duke [[Berthold V, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen|Berthold V]] of [[Duchy of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] founded the city of [[Bern]] in 1191, which became one of the House of Z\u00e4hringen power centers. East of the [[Jura Mountains]] and west of the [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] was described as [[Upper Burgundy]], and Bern was part of the [[Landgraviate of Burgundy]], which was situated on both sides of the [[Aar]], between [[Thun]] and [[Solothurn]]. However Berthold died without an heir in 1218 and Bern was declared a [[Free imperial city]] by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Berthold's death without heirs meant the complete disintegration of southwest Germany and led to the development of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. Bern joined Switzerland in the year 1353.\n\nSwabia takes its name from the tribe of the Suebi, and the name was often used interchangeably with ''[[Alemannia]]'' during the existence of the stem-duchy in the [[High Middle Ages]]. Even [[Alsace]] belonged to it. Swabia was otherwise of great importance in securing the pass route to Italy. After the fall of the Staufers there was never again a Duchy of Swabia. The Habsburgs and the W\u00fcrttembergers endeavored in vain to resurrect it.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de\" />\n\n== Hohenstaufen, Welf and Z\u00e4hringen ==\n{{Main|House of Hohenstaufen|House of Welf|House of Z\u00e4hringen}}\n\n[[File:GrafschaftW\u00fcrttemberg.jpg|thumb|Arms of the counts of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n\nThree of the noble families of the southwest attained a special importance: the Hohenstaufen, the Welf and the Z\u00e4hringen. The most successful appear from the view of that time to be the Hohenstaufen, who, as dukes of Swabia from 1079 and as Frankish kings and emperors from 1138 to 1268, attained the greatest influence in Swabia.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw298_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 Staufer, Welfen, Z\u00e4hringer|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], various counts ruled the territory that now forms [[Baden, Germany|Baden]], among whom the counts and duchy of [[House of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]] figure prominently. In 1112, [[Herman II, Margrave of Baden|Hermann]], son of [[Herman I, Margrave of Baden|Hermann]], Margrave of [[March of Verona|Verona]] (died 1074) and grandson of Duke [[Berthold II, Duke of Carinthia|Berthold II]] of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and the Count of [[County of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]], having inherited some of the German estates of his family, called himself Margrave of [[Margraviate of Baden|Baden]]. The separate history of Baden dates from this time. Hermann appears to have called himself \"[[margrave]]\" rather than \"[[count]],\" because of the family connection to the margrave of Verona.\n\nHis son and grandson, both called Hermann, added to their territories, which were then divided, and the lines of Baden-Baden and Baden-Hochberg were founded, the latter of which divided about a century later into Baden-Hochberg and [[Baden-Sausenberg]]. The family of Baden-Baden was very successful in increasing the area of its holdings.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen family controlled the duchy of Swabia until the death of Conradin in 1268, when a considerable part of its lands fell to the representative of a family first mentioned in about 1080, the count of W\u00fcrttemberg, [[Conrad I, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Conrad von Beutelsbach]], who took the name from his [[W\u00fcrttemberg (hill)|ancestral castle of W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n\nThe earliest historical details of a Count of W\u00fcrttemberg relate to one [[Ulrich I, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg]], who ruled from 1241 to 1265. He served as marshal of Swabia and advocate of the town of [[Ulm]], had large possessions in the valleys of the [[Neckar]] and the [[Rems (river)|Rems]], and acquired [[Bad Urach|Urach]] in 1260. Under his sons, [[Ulrich II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Ulrich II]] and [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard I]], and their successors, the power of the family grew steadily. The charcoal-burner gave him some of his treasure, and was elevated to Duke of [[Duchy of Z\u00e4hringen|Z\u00e4hringen]]. To the Z\u00e4hringer sphere of influence originally belonged [[Freiburg]] and [[Offenburg]], [[Rottweil]] and [[Villingen]], and, in modern Switzerland, [[Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Bern]]. The three prominent noble families were in vigorous competition with one another, even though they were linked by kinship. The mother of the Stauffer King Friedrich Barbarossa (Red beard) was Judith Welfen. The Staufers, as well as the Z\u00e4hringers, based their claims of rule on ties with the family of the Frankish kings from the House of Salier.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de1\" />\n\n== Further Austria and the Palatinate ==\n{{Main|Further Austria|Palatinate (region)}}\n\nOther than the Margraviate of Baden and the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg, Further Austria and the Palatinate lay on the edge of the southwestern area.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw300_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 Anterior Austria and the Electorate of Palatinate|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> '''Further Austria''' (in German: '''Vorder\u00f6sterreich''' or ''die '''Vorlande''''') was the collective name for the old possessions of the [[Habsburgs]] in south-western Germany ([[Swabia]]), the [[Alsace]], and in [[Vorarlberg]] after the focus of the Habsburgs had moved to Austria.\n\nFurther Austria comprised the [[Sundgau]] (southern Alsace) and the [[Breisgau]] east of the [[Rhine]] (including [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] after 1386) and included some scattered territories throughout Swabia, the largest being the [[margravate]] [[Burgau]] in the area of [[Augsburg]] and [[Ulm]]. Some territories in Vorarlberg that belonged to the Habsburgs were also considered part of Further Austria. The original homelands of the Habsburgs, the [[Aargau]] and much of the other original Habsburg possessions south of the Rhine and [[Lake Constance]] were lost in the 14th century to the expanding [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] after the battles of [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]] (1315) and [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]] (1386) and were never considered part of Further Austria, except the [[Fricktal]], which remained a Habsburg property until 1805.\n\nFurther Austria was ruled by the Duke of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]] until 1379. After that, the regent of Further Austria was the Duke of [[Duchy of Tyrol|Tyrol]].\n\nThe Palatinate arose as the '''County Palatine of the Rhine''', a large feudal state lying on both banks of the Rhine, which seems to have come into existence in the 10th century. The territory fell to the [[Wittelsbach]] Dukes of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]] in the early 13th century, and during a later division of territory among one of the heirs of Duke Louis II of [[Duchy of Upper Bavaria|Upper Bavaria]] in 1294, the elder branch of the Wittelsbachs came into possession not only of the Rhenish Palatinate, but also of that part of Upper Bavaria itself which was north of the Danube, and which came to be called the '''Upper Palatinate''' (''Oberpfalz''), in contrast to the '''Lower Palatinate''' along the Rhine. In the [[Golden Bull]] of 1356, the Palatinate was made one of the secular [[Holy Roman Empire elector|electorates]], and given the hereditary offices of '''Archsteward''' of the Empire and '''Imperial Vicar''' of the western half of Germany. From this time forth, the Count Palatine of the Rhine was usually known as the '''Elector Palatine'''.\n\nDue to the practice of division of territories among different branches of the family, by the early 16th century junior lines of the Palatine Wittelsbachs came to rule in [[Simmern]], [[Kaiserslautern]], and [[Zweibr\u00fccken]] in the Lower Palatinate, and in Neuburg and Sulzbach in the Upper Palatinate. The Elector Palatine, now based in Heidelberg, converted to Lutheranism in the 1530s.\n\nWhen the senior branch of the family died out in 1559, the Electorate passed to Frederick III of Simmern, a staunch [[Calvinist]], and the Palatinate became one of the major centers of Calvinism in Europe, supporting Calvinist rebellions in both the Netherlands and France. Frederick&nbsp;III's grandson, Frederick&nbsp;IV, and his adviser, [[Christian of Anhalt]], founded the [[Protestant Union|Evangelical Union]] of Protestant states in 1608, and in 1619 Elector Frederick&nbsp;V (the son-in-law of King [[James I of England|James I]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]]) accepted the throne of [[Bohemia]] from rebellious Protestant noblemen. He was soon defeated by the forces of [[Emperor Ferdinand II]] at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, and Spanish and Bavarian troops soon occupied the Palatinate itself. In 1623, Frederick was put under the ban of the Empire, and his territories and Electoral dignity granted to the Duke (now Elector) of Bavaria, [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I]].\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, the Sundgau became part of France, and in the 18th century, the Habsburgs acquired a few minor new territories in southern Germany such as [[Tettnang]]. In the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] of 1805, Further Austria was dissolved and the formerly Habsburg territories were assigned to [[Bavaria]], [[Baden]], and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], and the Fricktal to Switzerland.\n\nBy the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, Frederick&nbsp;V's son, Charles Louis, was restored to the Lower Palatinate, and given a new electoral title, but the Upper Palatinate and the senior electoral title remained with the Bavarian line. In 1685, the Simmern line died out, and the Palatinate was inherited by the Count Palatine of Neuburg (who was also Duke of [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich]] and [[Berg, Upper Palatinate|Berg]]), a Catholic. The Neuburg line, which moved the capital to Mannheim, lasted until 1742, when it, too, became extinct, and the Palatinate was inherited by the Duke Karl Theodor of [[Duchy of Sulzbach|Sulzbach]]. The childless Karl Theodor also inherited Bavaria when its electoral line became extinct in 1777, and all the Wittelsbach lands save Zweibr\u00fccken on the French border (whose Duke was, in fact, Karl Theodor's presumptive heir) were now under a single ruler. The Palatinate was destroyed in the Wars of the French Revolution&nbsp;\u2013 first its left bank territories were occupied, and then annexed, by France starting in 1795, and then, in 1803, its right bank territories were taken by the Margrave of Baden. The provincial government in Alsace was alternately administered by the Palatinate (1408\u20131504, 1530\u20131558) and by the Habsburgs (13th and 14th centuries, 1504\u20131530). Only the margraves of Baden and the counts and dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg included both homelands within their territories. With the political reordering of the southwest after 1800, Further Austria and the Electorate Palatine disappeared from history.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de2\" />\n\n== Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg before the Reformation ==\n{{Main|Margraviate of Baden|County of W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\n[[File:Hans Baldung - Count Christoph I of Baden - WGA01215.jpg|thumb|''Christoph I of Baden'', by [[Hans Baldung Grien]], 1515]]\n\n[[File:900-49 Ratssitzung Eberhard der Milde.jpg|thumb|Eberhard III in Council]]\n\nThe lords of W\u00fcrttemberg were first named in 1092.

Bernard, a soldier of some renown, continued the work of his predecessors and obtained other districts, including Baden-Hochberg, the ruling family of which died out in 1418.\n\nDuring the 15th century, a war with the [[Frederick I, Elector Palatine|Count Palatine of the Rhine]] deprived the Margrave [[Charles I of Baden|Charles I]] (died 1475) of a part of his territories, but these losses were more than recovered by his son and successor, [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Christoph I of Baden]] (''illustration, right''). In 1503, the family Baden-Sausenberg became extinct, and the whole of Baden was united by Christophe.\n\nUnder his sons, [[Ulrich II, Count of W\u00fcrttemberg|Ulrich II]] and [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard I]], and their successors, the power of the family grew steadily. Eberhard&nbsp;I (died 1325) opposed, sometimes successfully, three Holy Roman emperors. He doubled the area of his county and transferred his residence from W\u00fcrttemberg Castle to the [[Old Castle (Stuttgart)|\"Old Castle\"]] in today's city centre of [[Stuttgart]].\n\nHis successors were not as prominent, but all added something to the land area of W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1381, the [[Duchy of Teck]] was bought, and marriage to an heiress added [[Montb\u00e9liard]] in 1397. The family divided its lands among collateral branches several times but, in 1482, the [[Treaty of M\u00fcnsingen]] reunited the territory, declared it indivisible, and united it under Count [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard V]], called ''im Bart'' (The Bearded). This arrangement received the sanction of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], and of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], in 1495.\n\nUnusually for Germany, from 1457 W\u00fcrttemberg had a [[bicameral]] [[parliament]], the ''[[Landtag]]'', known otherwise as the \"diet\" or [[Estates of W\u00fcrttemberg|\"Estates\" of W\u00fcrttemberg]], that had to approve new taxation.\n\nIn 1477, [[Eberhard I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Count Eberhard]] founded the [[University of T\u00fcbingen]] and expelled the Jews. At Eberhard's death in 1496, his cousin, Duke [[Eberhard II, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard II]], succeeded for a short reign of two years, terminated by a [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]].\n \nEberhard V proved one of the most energetic rulers that W\u00fcrttemberg ever had, and, in 1495, his [[county]] became a [[duchy]].

Religious differences increased the family's rivalry. During the period of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] some of the rulers of Baden remained [[Catholic]] and some became [[Protestant]]s. One of Christoph's sons died childless in 1533. In 1535, his remaining sons Bernard and Ernest, having shared their brother's territories, made a fresh division and founded the lines of Baden-Baden and Baden-Pforzheim, called [[Baden-Durlach]] after 1565. Further divisions followed, and the weakness caused by these partitions was accentuated by a rivalry between the two main branches of the family, culminating in open warfare.\n\nThe long reign (1498\u20131550) of Duke [[Ulrich, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Ulrich]], who succeeded to the duchy while still a child, proved a most eventful period for the country, and many traditions cluster round the name of this gifted, unscrupulous and ambitious man. Duke Ulrich of W\u00fcrttemberg had been living in his County of M\u00f6mpelgard since 1519. He had been exiled from his duchy by his own fault and controversial encroachments into non-W\u00fcrttembergish possessions. In Basel, Duke Ulrich came into contact with the Reformation.\n\nAided by [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Philip]], landgrave of [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Hesse]], and other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] princes, he fought a victorious battle against Ferdinand's troops at [[Lauffen am Neckar|Lauffen]] in May 1534. Then, by the treaty of Cadan, he again became duke, but perforce duke of the duchy as an Austrian fief. He subsequently introduced the reformed religious doctrines, endowed Protestant churches and schools throughout his land, and founded the [[T\u00fcbinger Stift]] seminary in 1536. Ulrich's connection with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] led to another expulsion but, in 1547, Charles&nbsp;V reinstated him, albeit on somewhat onerous terms.\n\nThe total population during the 16th century was between 300,000 and 400,000. Ulrich's son and successor, [[Christoph, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Christoph]] (1515\u20131568), completed the work of converting his subjects to the reformed faith. He introduced a system of church government, the Grosse [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Kirchenordnung]], which endured in part into the 20th century. In this reign, a standing commission started to superintend the finances, and the members of this body, all of whom belonged to the upper classes, gained considerable power in the state, mainly at the expense of the towns, by means of the [[Oberamt]]ure and later, in addition, the [[Landkreis]].\n\nChristopher's son [[Louis III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Louis]], the founder of the Collegium illustre in [[T\u00fcbingen]], died childless in 1593. A kinsman, [[Frederick I, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick I]] (1557\u20131608) succeeded to the duchy. This energetic prince disregarded the limits placed on his authority by the rudimentary constitution. By paying a large sum of money, he induced the emperor [[Rudolph II]] in 1599 to free the duchy from the [[suzerainty]] of Austria. Austria still controlled large areas around the duchy, known as \"[[Further Austria]]\". Thus, once again, W\u00fcrttemberg became a [[Imperial immediacy|direct fief]] of the empire, securing its independence. Even the [[Margraviate of Baden-Baden]] went over to Lutheranism that same year, but indeed only for a short time. Likewise, after the Peace of Augsburg the Reformation was carried out in the County of Hohenlohe. At the same time, however, the Counter-Reformation began. It was persistently supported by the Emperor and the clerical princes.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de4\" />\n\n== Peasants' War ==\n{{Main|German Peasants' War}}\n\nThe living conditions of the peasants in the German southwest at the beginning of the 16th century were quite modest, but an increase in taxes and several bad harvests, with no improvement in sight, led to crisis. Under the sign of the sandal (''Bundschuh''), that is, the farmer's shoe that tied up with laces, rebellions broke out on the Upper Rhine, in the [[Bishopric of Speyer]], in the Black Forest and in the upper Neckar valley at the end of the 15th century.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw308_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 The Peasants' War|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> The [[extortion]]s by which he sought to raise money for his extravagant pleasures excited an uprising known as the ''arme Konrad'' ([[Poor Conrad]]), not unlike the rebellion in England led by [[Wat Tyler]]. The authorities soon restored order, and, in 1514, by the Treaty of [[T\u00fcbingen]], the people undertook to pay the duke's debts in return for various political privileges, which in effect laid the foundation of the constitutional liberties of the country. A few years later, Ulrich quarrelled with the [[Swabian League]], and its forces (helped by Duke [[William IV, Duke of Bavaria|William IV]] of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]], angered by the treatment meted out by Ulrich to his wife [[Sabina of Bavaria|Sabina]], a Bavarian princess), invaded W\u00fcrttemberg, expelled the duke and sold his duchy to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], for 220,000 [[Baden gulden|gulden]].\n\nCharles handed W\u00fcrttemberg over to his brother, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]], who served as nominal ruler for a few years. Soon, however, the discontent caused by the oppressive Austrian rule, the disturbances in Germany leading to the [[German Peasants' War]] and the commotions aroused by the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] gave Ulrich an opportunity to recover his duchy. Thus Marx Sittich of Hohenems went against the Hegenau and Klettgau rebels. On 4 November 1525 he struck down a last attempt by the peasants in that same countryside where the peasants' unrest had begun a year before.

His son and successor [[Eberhard III, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard III]] (1628\u20131674), however, plunged into it as an ally of France and Sweden as soon as he came of age in 1633, but after the [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|battle of Nordlingen]] in 1634, Imperial troops occupied the duchy and the duke himself went into exile for some years. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] restored him, but to a depopulated and impoverished country, and he spent his remaining years in efforts to repair the disasters of the lengthy war. W\u00fcrttemberg was a central battlefield of the war. Its population fell by 57% between 1634 and 1655, primarily because of death and disease, declining birthrates, and the mass migration of terrified [[peasant]]s.<ref>Peter Wilson, ''The Thirty Years' War: Europe's tragedy''  (2009) p 789</ref>\n\nFrom 1584 to 1622, [[Baden-Baden]] was in the possession of one of the princes of [[Principality of Baden-Durlach|Baden-Durlach]].

The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 restored the [[status quo]], and the family rivalry gradually died out. For one part of the southwest, a peace of 150 years began. On the [[Middle Neckar]], in the whole [[Upper Rhine]] area and especially in the Electorate Palatine, the wars waged by the French [[King Louis XIV]] from 1674 to 1714 caused further terrible destruction.

He was interested in the development of agriculture and commerce, sought to improve education and the administration of justice, and proved in general to be a wise and liberal ruler in the Age of [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nIn 1771, [[Augustus George, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Augustus George of Baden-Baden]] died without sons, and his territories passed to Charles Frederick, who thus finally became ruler of the whole of Baden. Although Baden was united under a single ruler, the territory was not united in its customs and tolls, tax structure, laws or government. Baden did not form a compact territory. Rather, a number of separate districts lay on both banks of the upper [[Rhine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoeckmann.de/germany/map-bwsouth.htm|title=Historical Map of Baden-Wurttemberg 1789 \u2013 Southern Part|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> His opportunity for territorial aggrandisement came during the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nDuring the reign of [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Louis]] (1676\u20131733), who succeeded as a one-year-old when his father Duke [[William Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|William Louis]] died in 1677, W\u00fcrttemberg had to face another destructive enemy, [[Louis XIV of France]]. In 1688, 1703 and 1707, the French entered the duchy and inflicted brutalities and suffering upon the inhabitants. The sparsely populated country afforded a welcome to fugitive [[Waldensians|Waldenses]], who did something to restore it to prosperity, but the extravagance of the duke, anxious to provide for the expensive tastes of his mistress, Christiana Wilhelmina von Gr\u00e4venitz, undermined this benefit.\n\nIn 1704, Eberhard Ludwig started to build [[Ludwigsburg Palace]] to the north of Stuttgart, in imitation of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].\n\n[[Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Charles Alexander]], who became duke in 1733, had become a [[Roman Catholic]] while an officer in the Austrian service. His favourite adviser was the Jew [[Joseph S\u00fc\u00df Oppenheimer]], and suspicions arose that master and servant were aiming at the suppression of the [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] (the local parliament) and the introduction of Roman Catholicism. However, the sudden death of Charles Alexander in March 1737 put an abrupt end to any such plans, and the regent, Duke [[Carl Rudolf, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt|Carl Rudolf]] of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt|W\u00fcrttemberg-Neuenstadt]], had Oppenheimer hanged.\n\n[[Charles Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Charles Eugene]] (1728\u20131793), who came of age in 1744, appeared gifted, but proved to be vicious and extravagant, and he soon fell into the hands of unworthy favourites. He spent a great deal of money in building the [[New Castle (Stuttgart)|\"New Castle\"]] in [[Stuttgart]] and elsewhere, and sided against [[Prussia]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] of 1756\u20131763, which was unpopular with his Protestant subjects. His whole reign featured dissension between ruler and ruled, the duke's irregular and arbitrary methods of raising money arousing great discontent. The intervention of the emperor and even of foreign powers ensued and, in 1770, a formal arrangement removed some of the grievances of the people. Charles Eugene did not keep his promises, but later, in his old age, he made a few further concessions.\n\nCharles Eugene left no legitimate heirs, and was succeeded by his brother, [[Louis Eugene, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Louis Eugene]] (died 1795), who was childless, and then by another brother, [[Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick Eugene]] (died 1797). This latter prince, who had served in the army of [[Frederick the Great]], to whom he was related by marriage, and then managed his family's estates around [[Montb\u00e9liard]], educated his children in the Protestant faith as [[francophone]]s. All of the subsequent W\u00fcrttemberg royal family were descended from him. Thus, when his son [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick II]] became duke in 1797, Protestantism returned to the ducal household, and the royal house adhered to this faith thereafter. Nevertheless, the district legislatures as well as the imperial diets offered a possibility of regulating matters in dispute. Much was left over from the trials before the imperial courts, which often lasted decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pantel-web.de/bw_mirror/history/bw316_e.htm|title=History of BW \u2013 The German southwest at the end of the 18th century|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Southwest Germany up to 1918 ==\n{{Main|Electorate of Baden|Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|Grand Duchy of Baden|Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\n[[File:KgrWuerttemberg.png|thumb|Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg as it existed from the end of the Napoleonic Wars to the end of World War I.

Its countryside was devastated in the ensuing battles. In 1796, the margrave was compelled to pay an [[indemnity]] and to cede his territories on the left bank of the Rhine to France. Fortune, however, soon returned to his side.\n\nIn 1803, largely owing to the good offices of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], emperor of Russia, the margrave received the [[Bishopric of Konstanz]], part of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Rhenish Palatinate]], and other smaller districts, together with the dignity of a [[prince-elector]]. Changing sides in 1805, he fought for [[Napoleon]], with the result that, by the [[peace of Pressburg (1805)|peace of Pressburg]] in that year, he obtained the [[Breisgau]] and other territories at the expense of the [[Habsburgs]] (see [[Further Austria]]). In 1806, the Baden margrave joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], declared himself a sovereign prince, became a [[grand duke]], and received additional territory.\n\nOn 1 January 1806, Duke Frederick II assumed the title of King [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick I]], abrogated the constitution, and united old and new W\u00fcrttemberg. Subsequently, he placed church lands under the control of the state and received some formerly self-governing areas under the [[German Mediatisation|\"mediatisation\"]] process. In 1806, he joined the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] and received further additions of territory containing 160,000 inhabitants. A little later, by the [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn|peace of Vienna]] in October 1809, about 110,000 more persons came under his rule.\n\nIn return for these favors, Frederick joined [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in his campaigns against Prussia, Austria and Russia. Some 16,000 of his subjects marched as soldiers with the French invasion of Russia to take Moscow; only a few hundred survived to return. After the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, King Frederick deserted the waning fortunes of the French emperor. By a treaty made with [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] at [[Fulda]] in November 1813, he secured the confirmation of his royal title and of his recent acquisitions of territory. He directed his forces to fight with allies in their attack on France.\n\nIn 1815, the king joined the [[German Confederation]], but the [[Congress of Vienna]] made no change in the extent of his lands. In the same year, he proposed a new constitution to the representatives of his people, but they rejected it. In the midst of this controversy, Frederick died on 30 October 1816.\n\nThe new king, [[William I of W\u00fcrttemberg|William I]] (reigned 1816\u20131864), at once took up the constitutional question and, after much discussion, granted a new constitution in September 1819. This constitution, with subsequent modifications, remained in force until 1918 (see [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]). A period of quiet was established. The condition of the kingdom, its education, agriculture trade and manufactures, began to receive earnest attention. King William I helped to repair the shattered finances of the country. But the people's desire for greater political freedom did not fade away under the 1819 constitution. After 1830, a certain amount of unrest occurred. This, however, soon died. The inclusion of W\u00fcrttemberg in the German [[Zollverein]] and the construction of [[History of railways in W\u00fcrttemberg|railways]] fostered trade.\n\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|revolutionary movement of 1848]] did not leave W\u00fcrttemberg untouched, although no associated violence took place within the kingdom. King William had to dismiss Johannes Schlayer (1792\u20131860) and his other ministers, calling to power men with more liberal ideas and the exponents of the idea of a united Germany. King William did proclaim a democratic constitution but, as soon as the movement had spent its force, he dismissed the liberal ministers. In October 1849, Schlayer and his associates returned to power. In Baden, by contrast, there was a [[Baden Revolution|serious uprising]] that had to be put down by force.\n\nBy interfering with popular electoral rights, the king and his ministers succeeded in assembling a servile ''diet'' in 1851, which surrendered all the privileges gained since 1848. In this way, the authorities restored the constitution of 1819, and power passed into the hands of a [[bureaucracy]]. A [[concordat]] with the [[Papacy]] proved almost the last act of William's long reign. But the ''diet'' repudiated the agreement, preferring to regulate relations between church and state in its own way.\n\nIn July 1864, [[Charles I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Charles]] (1823\u20131891, reigned 1864\u201391) succeeded his father William I as king. Almost at once, he was faced with considerable difficulties. In the duel between Austria and [[Prussia]] for supremacy in Germany, William I had consistently taken the Austrian side. The new king and his advisers continued this policy.\n\nIn 1866, W\u00fcrttemberg took up arms on behalf of Austria in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], but three weeks after the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] on 3 July 1866, her troops suffered a comprehensive defeat at [[Tauberbischofsheim]], and the country lay at the mercy of Prussia. The Prussians occupied the northern part of W\u00fcrttemberg and negotiated a peace in August 1866. By this, W\u00fcrttemberg paid an indemnity of 8,000,000 gulden, but she at once concluded a secret offensive and defensive treaty with her conqueror. W\u00fcrttemberg was a party to the [[Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868]].\n\nThe end of the struggle against Prussia allowed a renewal of democratic agitation in W\u00fcrttemberg. This had not achieved any changes before the great [[Franco-Prussian War|war between France and Prussia]] broke out in 1870. Although the policy of W\u00fcrttemberg had continued to be antagonistic to Prussia, the kingdom shared in the national enthusiasm that swept over Germany, and its troops took a creditable part in the [[Battle of W\u00f6rth]] and in other operations of the war.\n\nIn 1871, W\u00fcrttemberg became a member of the new [[German Empire]], but retained control of her own [[post office]], [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and railways. She had also certain special privileges with regard to taxation and the army and, for the next 10 years, W\u00fcrttemberg's policy enthusiastically supported the new order. Many important reforms, especially in the area of finance, ensued, but a proposal for a union of the railway system with that of the rest of Germany failed. After reductions in taxation in 1889, the reform of the constitution became the question of the hour. King Charles and his ministers wished to strengthen the conservative element in the chambers, but the laws of 1874, 1876 and 1879 only effected slight reforms pending a more thorough settlement. On 6 October 1891, King Charles died suddenly. His cousin [[William II of W\u00fcrttemberg|William II]] (1848\u20131921, reigned 1891\u20131918) succeeded and continued the policy of his predecessor.\n\nDiscussions on the reform of the constitution continued, and the election of 1895 memorably returned a powerful party of democrats. King William had no sons, nor had his only Protestant kinsman, Duke Nicholas (1833\u20131903). Consequently, the succession would ultimately pass to a Roman Catholic branch of the family, and this prospect raised certain difficulties about the relations between church and state. The heir to the throne in 1910 was the Roman Catholic [[Albrecht, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke Albert]] (b. 1865).\n\nBetween 1900 and 1910, the political history of W\u00fcrttemberg centred round the settlement of the constitutional and the educational questions. The constitution underwent revision in 1906, and a settlement of the education difficulty occurred in 1909. In 1904, the railway system integrated with that of the rest of Germany.\n\nThe population in 1905 was 2,302,179, of whom 69% were Protestant, 30% Catholic and 0.5% Jewish. Protestants largely preponderated in the Neckar district, and Roman Catholics in that of the Danube. In 1910, an estimated 506,061 people worked in the agricultural sector, 432,114 in industrial occupations and 100,109 in trade and commerce. (see [[Demographics of W\u00fcrttemberg]])\n\nIn the confusion at the end of World War I, Frederick [[abdication|abdicated]] on 22 November 1918. A republic had already been declared on 14 November.\n\nIn the course of the revolutionary activities at the close of World War I in November 1918, King William II abdicated on 30 November, and a republican government ensued.\n\nW\u00fcrttemberg became a state (''Land'') in the new [[Weimar Republic]]. Baden named itself a \"democratic republic,\" W\u00fcrttemberg a \"free popular state.\" Instead of monarchs, state presidents were in charge. They were elected by the state legislatures, in Baden by an annual change, in W\u00fcrttemberg after each legislative election.<ref name=\"pantel-web.de6\" />\n\n== German southwest up to World War II ==\n\n[[File:Wappen Volksstaat W\u00fcrttemberg (Farbe).svg|thumb|[[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] coat of arms]]\n\nPolitics between 1918 and 1919 towards a merger of W\u00fcrttemberg and Baden remained largely unsuccessful. After the excitements of the 1918\u20131919 revolution, its [[W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag elections in the Weimar Republic|five election results]] between 1919 and 1932 show a decreasing vote for left-wing parties. After the seizure of power by the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) in the year 1933, the state borders initially remained unchanged. The state of Baden, the state of W\u00fcrttemberg and the Hohenzollern states (the government district of Sigmaringen) continued to exist, albeit with much less autonomy with regard to the empire. From 1934, the [[Administrative division of Nazi Germany|Gau]] of W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern added the [[Province of Hohenzollern]].\n\nBy 30 April 1945, all of Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg and Hohenzollern were completely occupied.\n\n== Southwest Germany after the war ==\n{{Main|South Baden|W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden|W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern}}\n\nAfter World War II was over, the states of Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg were split between the American occupation zone in the north and the French occupation zone in the south, which also got Hohenzollern. The border between the occupation zones followed the district borders, but they were drawn purposely in such a way that the autobahn from Karlsruhe to Munich (today the [[Bundesautobahn 8]]) ended up inside the American occupation zone. In the American occupation zone, the state of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] was founded; in the French occupation zone, the southern part of former Baden became the [[South Baden|new state of Baden]] while the southern part of W\u00fcrttemberg and Hohenzollern were fused into [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]].\n\nArticle 29 of the [[Basic Law]] of Germany provided for a way to change the German states via a community vote; however, it could not enter into force due to a veto by the Allied forces. Instead, a separate article 118 mandated the fusion of the three states in the southwest via a trilateral agreement. If the three affected states failed to agree, federal law would have to regulate the future of the three states. This article was based on the results of a conference of the German states held in 1948, where the creation of a Southwest State was agreed upon. The alternative, generally favored in South Baden, was to recreate Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg (including Hohenzollern) in its old, pre-war borders.\n\nThe trilateral agreement failed because the states couldn't agree on the voting system. As such, federal law decided on 4 May 1951 that the area be split into four electoral districts: North W\u00fcrttemberg, South W\u00fcrttemberg, North Baden and South Baden. Because it was clear that both districts in W\u00fcrttemberg as well as North Baden would support the merger, the voting system favored the supporters of the new Southwest State. The state of Baden brought the law to the [[German Constitutional Court]] to have it declared as unconstitutional, but failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv001014.html|title=DFR \u2013 BVerfGE 1, 14 \u2013 S\u00fcdweststaat|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe plebiscite took place on 9 December 1951. In both parts of W\u00fcrttemberg, 93% were in favor of the merger, in North Baden 57% were in favor, but in South Baden only 38% were. Because three of four electoral districts voted in favor of the new Southwest State, the merger was decided upon. Had Baden as a whole formed a single electoral district, the vote would have failed.\n\n== State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg from 1952 to the present ==\n{{Main|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\nThe members of the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] were elected on 9 March 1952, and on 25 April the Prime Minister was elected. With this, the new state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg was founded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpb-bw.de/entstehung_baden-wuerttembergs.html|title=25. April 1952 \u2013 Die Entstehung des Landes Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> After the constitution of the new state entered force, the members of the constitutional convention formed the state parliament until the first election in 1956. The name ''Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg'' was only intended as a temporary name, but ended up the official name of the state because no other name could be agreed upon.\n\nIn May 1954, the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ''landtag'' (legislature) decided on adoption of the following [[coat of arms]]: three black [[lion]]s on a golden shield, framed by a [[deer]] and a [[griffin]]. This coat of arms once belonged to the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Staufen family]], emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and [[Dukes of Swabia]]. The golden deer stands for W\u00fcrttemberg, the griffin for Baden. Conversely the former W\u00fcrttemberg counties of [[Calw]], [[Freudenstadt]], [[Horb]], [[Rottweil]] and [[Tuttlingen]] were incorporated into the Baden governmental districts of [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Freiburg]]. The last traces of Hohenzollern disappeared. Between county and district, regional associations were formed that are responsible for overlapping planning.\n\nThe opponents of the merger did not give up. After the [[General Treaty]] gave Germany full sovereignty, the opponents applied for a community vote to restore Baden to its old borders by virtue of paragraph&nbsp;2 of Article&nbsp;29 of the Basic Law, which allowed a community vote in states which had been changed after the war without a community vote. The Federal Ministry of the Interior refused the application on the grounds that a community vote had already taken place. The opponents sued in front of the German Constitutional Court and won in 1956, with the court deciding that the plebiscite of 1951 had not been a community vote as defined by the law because the more populous state of W\u00fcrttemberg had had an unfair advantage over the less populous state of Baden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv005034.html|title=DFR \u2013 BVerfGE 5, 34 \u2013 Baden-Abstimmung|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref> Because the court did not set a date for the community vote, the government simply did nothing. The opponents eventually sued again in 1969, which led to the decision that the vote had to take place before 30 June 1970. On 7 June, the majority voted against the proposal to restore the state of Baden.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Germany|History}}\n\n* [[Timeline of Stuttgart]]\n* [[History of S\u00fcdwestrundfunk]]; the ''S\u00fcdwestrundfunk'' (SWR) is the public-[[broadcasting]] institution of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (and Rhineland-Palatinate)\n* [[History of Franconia]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\n{{History of the States of Germany}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Wurttemberg}}\n[[Category:History of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg| ]]\n[[Category:House of W\u00fcrttemberg| ]]\n[[Category:History of Baden]]\n[[Category:History of W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Swabian Circle]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reword - you can't be \"among one\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg"}

Earlier, it was surrounded by [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhist states and societies]] which temporarily extended literacy and state rule to the region. The journey to the region was perilous according to reports of Chinese pilgrims [[Fa-hsien]] and [[Sung Yun]]. The decline of Buddhism resulted in the region becoming heavily isolated. The Islamization of the nearby [[Badakhshan]] began in the 8th century and Peristan was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century. The [[Kalasha people]] of lower [[Chitral]] are the last surviving heirs of the area.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Archivio per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia\n|title=Fence of Peristan - The Islamization of the \"Kafirs\" and Their Domestication|publisher=Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Antropologia e Etnologia|author=Alberto M.

It was famous for its precise wood carving, especially of cedar-wood pillars, carved doors, furniture (including \"[[horn furniture|horn chairs]]\") and statuary. Some of these pillars survive, as they were reused in mosques, but temples, shrines, and centers of local cults, with their wooden effigies and multitudes of ancestor figures were torched and burnt to the ground. Only a small fraction brought back to Kabul as spoils of this Islamic victory over infidels. These consisted of various wooden effigies of ancestral heroes and pre-Islamic commemorative chairs.

Earlier, it was surrounded by [[Buddhism in Afghanistan|Buddhist states and societies]] which temporarily extended literacy and state rule to the region. The journey to the region was perilous according to reports of Chinese pilgrims [[Fa-hsien]] and [[Sung Yun]]. The decline of Buddhism resulted in the region becoming heavily isolated. The Islamization of the nearby [[Badakhshan]] began in the 8th century and Peristan was completely surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century. The [[Kalasha people]] of lower [[Chitral]] are the last surviving heirs of the area.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Archivio per l'Antropologia e la Etnologia\n|title=Fence of Peristan - The Islamization of the \"Kafirs\" and Their Domestication|publisher=Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Antropologia e Etnologia|author=Alberto M.

Ford Motor would not only build the bombers, it would supply the airfield as well; the farm at Willow Run was an ideal location for the airfield's runways, being under the personal ownership of Henry Ford (thus solving any land acquisition problem) and sited between the main roads and rail lines connecting Detroit with Ann Arbor and points to the west. Easements were acquired from landowners across the county line in [[Ypsilanti Township, Washtenaw County, Michigan|Ypsilanti Township]] where the Liberator plant (and eventually the airport terminal) would be built.\n\nAlthough officially retired, Henry Ford still had a say in the company's affairs and refused government financing for Willow Run, preferring to have his company build the factory and sell it to the government, which would lease it back to the company for the duration of the war.<ref name=Snyder-OralHist>{{cite web|last=Hess|first=Jerry N.|title=Oral History Interview with John W.

Although the [[Ford Trimotor]] had been a success in the 1920s, the company had since shied away from aviation, and initially, Ford was assigned to provide B-24 components with final assembly performed by [[Consolidated Aircraft|Consolidated]] at its [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] plant, or by fellow licensee [[Douglas Aircraft]] at its [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] plant.  However, in October 1941 Ford received permission from Consolidated and the Army to assemble complete Liberators on its own at its new Willow Run facility.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/> Even then it would take nearly a year before finished Liberators left the factory.\n\nAccording to [[Max Wallace]], [[Henry H.

The plant held the distinction of being the world's largest enclosed \"room.\" The first Ford-built Liberator rolled off the Willow Run line in September 1942; the first series of Willow Run Liberators was the '''B-24E'''.\n[[File:Production. Willow Run bomber plant. 8e11142v.jpg|thumb|A small part of the world's largest one-story war production plant, the giant bomber factory at Willow Run, Michigan. Fixtures in background hold bomber wings during assembly, 1942]]\nThe Willow Run Plant had many initial startup problems, due primarily to the fact that Ford employees were used to automobile mass production and found it difficult to adapt these techniques to aircraft production. The plant at Willow Run was also beset with labor difficulties, high absentee rates, and rapid employee turnover. The factory was nearly an hour's drive from Detroit, and the imposition of wartime gasoline and tire rationing had made the daily commute difficult. In only one month, Ford had hired 2,900 workers but had lost 3,100.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/>\n\nAlso, Henry Ford was cantankerous and rigid in his ways. He was violently anti-union and there were serious labor difficulties, including a massive strike. In addition, Henry Ford refused on principle to hire women. However, he finally relented and did employ \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]s\" on his assembly lines, probably more because so many of his potential male workers had been drafted into the military than due to any sudden change of principle on his part.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/>\n\nBy autumn 1943, the top leadership role at Willow Run had passed from Charles Sorensen to Mead L. Bricker.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=329}}.</ref>\n\nAt the request of the government, Ford began to decentralize operations and many parts were assembled at other Ford plants as well as by the company's sub-contractors, with the Willow Run plant concentrating on final aircraft assembly. The bugs were eventually worked out of the manufacturing processes, and by 1944, Ford was rolling a Liberator off the Willow Run production line every 63 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nAt its peak monthly production (August 1944), Willow Run produced 428 B-24s with highest production listed as 100 completed Bombers flying away from Willow Run Between April 24 and April 26, 1944. By 1945, Ford produced 70% of the B-24s in two 9-hour shifts. Ford built 6,972 of the 18,482 total B-24s and produced kits for 1,893 more to be assembled by the other manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |title=28 June 1945 |url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/2017/06/28/ |work=This Day in Aviation |date=June 28, 2017 |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref> The B-24 holds the distinction of being the most produced heavy bomber in history.<ref name=Willowrun/><ref>{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=David L. |url=http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/willow_run/willow_run.html |title=They may save our honor, our hopes\u2014and our necks |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114193058/http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/willow_run/willow_run.html |archive-date=January 14, 2008 |work=Michigan History |date=September 1993}}</ref>\n\n====Army Air Forces support and post-production activities====\nAfter their manufacture, the next step in the process was the delivery of the aircraft to the operational squadrons. This was done at Willow Run by 1st Concentration Command (1st CC). The 1st CC was responsible for completing the organization and equipment of tactical and combat bombardment squadrons prior to their deployment to the overseas combat theaters. It also provided a final inspection of the aircraft and made any appropriate final changes; i.e., install long-range fuel tanks, remove unnecessary equipment, and give it a final flight safety test.<ref name=\"Thole\">{{cite web |last=Thole |first=Lou |url=http://www.museumofthesoldier.com/baer_field.htm |title=Preparing C-47s for War (Baer Field) |work=Museum of the Soldier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005151807/http://www.museumofthesoldier.com/baer_field.htm |archive-date=October 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/155/775.xml AFHRA Document 00155775 1 Concentration Command History]</ref>\n\nWhile the planes were being serviced and made ready for overseas movement, personnel for these planes were also being processed. Pilots, co-pilots, navigators and crew chiefs were assigned as a crew for each aircraft, sleeping on 1,300 cots as they waited for the B-24s to roll off the assembly line. Paperwork was handled, necessary specific B-24 life support equipment was issued and some technical training for supporting the aircraft accomplished.<ref name=\"Thole\"/><ref>[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/150/138.xml AFHRA Document 00150138 AAFTC Technical Training Command]</ref>\n\nOnce production began, it became difficult to introduce changes dictated by field experience in the various overseas theaters onto the production line in a timely fashion. Consequently, newly constructed Liberators needed modifications for the specific geographic areas they were to be flown in combat. For this reason, a series of [[Air Technical Service Command]] modification centers were established for the incorporation of these required theater changes into new Liberators following their manufacture and assignments. There were seven known modification centers: the [[Birmingham Air National Guard Base|Birmingham Air Depot]] in Alabama; Consolidated's Fort Worth plant, the Oklahoma City Air Materiel Center at [[Tinker Field]], the Tucson Modification Center at [[Tucson International Airport]];<ref>{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Ring |title=Tucson International Airport\u2019s Historic Hangars |url=http://www.ringbrothershistory.com/bobsprojects/azstar/82%20%20June%2020,%202013%20%20Tucson%20International%20Airport%27s%20Historic%20%20Hangars.pdf |work=Ring Brothers History |date=June 20, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> the Northwest Airlines Depot in Minneapolis; the, Martin-Omaha manufacturing plant, and the Hawaiian Air Depot at [[Hickam Field]].<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/> The Birmingham Air Depot's primary mission was modifying Liberators from Willow Run.<ref name=Holley-BuyingAircraft-531>{{cite book|last=Holley|first=Irving Brinton|title=United States Army in World War 2, Buying Aircraft: Material Procurement for Army Air Forces|year=1964|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=531|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUC1WHocc2QC}}</ref>\n\n====Liberator variants produced at Willow Run====\n{{see also|B-24_Liberator#Variants_and_conversions}}\n\nThe '''B-24E''' was the first variant of the B-24 that underwent primary manufacture by Ford at Willow Run. Not only did Ford build 490 complete planes, but it also supplied components of B-24Es as kits that could be trucked for final assembly at the factories of Consolidated in Fort Worth and Douglas in Tulsa, 144 and 167 kits.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/>\n\n[[File:Installing one of the four engines of a new B-24E (Liberator) bomber on one of the assembly lines of ford's big... - NARA - 196388.jpg|thumb|B-24E engine installation, Willow Run 1943]]\n\nB-24Es built and fully assembled at Ford were designated B-24E-FO; those assembled at Tulsa and Fort Worth out of parts supplied by Ford were designated B-24E-DT and B-24E-CF respectively. Because of production delays encountered at Willow Run as a result of the inevitable difficulties and snags involved in the adaptation of automobile manufacturing techniques to aircraft, the B-24Es produced at Willow Run were, generally, obsolete by the time that it began to roll off the production lines, and most were relegated to training roles in the United States and hence few ever saw combat.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\">Davis, Larry, (1987), B-24 Liberator in Action - Aircraft No. 80, Squadron/Signal Publications Inc. {{ISBN|0-89747-190-3}}</ref>\n\nThe '''B-24H''' was the first variant produced by Ford at Willow Run in large numbers that went into combat. The B-24H differed from earlier B-24s by having a second turret placed in the nose of the aircraft to increase defensive firepower. Because of the many structural changes required to accommodate the nose turret, the first B-24Hs were delivered slightly behind schedule, with the first machines rolling off the production lines at Ford in late June 1943. Production for the B-24H at Willow Run was 1,780.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/>\n\nUpon the introduction of the '''B-24J''', all three of the Liberator manufacturing plants converted to the production of this version. The B-24J incorporated a hydraulically driven tail turret and other defensive armament modifications in the nose of the aircraft. The bomber plant produced its first B-24J in April 1944; 1587 were built at Willow Run.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nDuring June 1944, the Army determined that the San Diego and Willow Run plants would be capable of meeting all future requirements for Liberator production. The Boeing [[B-29 Superfortress]] was taking over the long-range bombing role in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] and no new B-24 units were programmed for deployment in the other combat theaters of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean]] or in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|CBI]].<ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nThe '''B-24L''' was the first product of the new, downsized Liberator production pool. It was an attempt to reverse the trend toward ever-increasing weight of the Liberator as more and more armament, equipment, and armor had been added, with no corresponding increase in engine power. With the weight reduction and more powerful engines, it also had a much longer range than earlier models. 1250 B-24L aircraft were built at Willow Run.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nThe '''B-24M''' was the last large-scale production variant of the Liberator. Apart from a new tail turret, the B-24M differed little from the B-24L. The first B-24Ms were delivered in October 1944, and by the end of its production in 1945, Willow Run had built 1677; 124 Ford-built B-24Ms were cancelled before delivery.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nFord had switched over to the single-tailed '''B-24N''' in May 1945, but the end of the war in Europe in the same month brought a rapid end to Liberator production; the contract with Ford was officially terminated on 31 May 1945 and orders for 5168 unbuilt B-24N-FO bombers were cancelled as well. The delivery of seven YB-24Ns by Ford in June 1945 marked the end of Liberator production at Willow Run.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref>Johnson, Fredrick A (1996) Consolidated B-24 Liberator - Warbird Tech Vol. 1, Specialty Press. {{ISBN|0-933424-64-7}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war conversion===\nAlthough Ford had an option to purchase the plant once it was no longer needed for war production, the company declined to exercise it, and ended its association with Willow Run. \n====Kaiser takes control====\n\n[[File:Kaiser-Frazer C-119F-KM Flying Boxcar 51-8156.jpg|thumb|Kaiser-Frazer C-119 built at Willow Run]]\n\nAfter Ford declined to purchase the plant, it was sold to the [[Kaiser-Frazer]] Corporation, a partnership of construction and shipbuilding magnate [[Henry J. Kaiser]] and [[Graham-Paige]] executive [[Joseph W. Frazer]]. The plant produced both Kaiser and [[Frazer (automobile)]] models, including the compact [[Henry J]], which with minor differences was also sold through [[Sears-Roebuck]] as the [[Allstate (automobile)|Allstate]].\n\nWillow Run produced 739,000 cars as part of Kaiser-Frazer and Kaiser Motors, from 1947 through 1953, when after years of losses, the company (now called [[Kaiser Motors]] after Frazer's exit from the partnership) purchased [[Willys-Overland]] and began moving its production at Willow Run to the Willys plant in [[Toledo, Ohio]].\n\nAlthough Willow Run is synonymous with the Liberator bomber, B-24s were not the only planes manufactured at Willow Run. As the [[U.S. Air Force]] struggled to expand its airlift capacity during the [[Korean War]], Kaiser-Frazer built [[C-119 Flying Boxcar]] cargo planes at Willow Run under license from [[Fairchild Aircraft]], producing an estimated 88 C-119s between 1951 and 1953. Kaiser also built two [[C-123 Provider]] airframes at Willow Run, which were scrapped before delivery, as a procurement scandal involving the company put an end to any chance for future Air Force contracts.<ref name=\"WRhist\"/>\n\n====General Motors operations====\nLater in 1953, after a fire on August 12 destroyed [[General Motors]]' Detroit Transmission factory in [[Livonia, Michigan]], the Willow Run complex was first leased to GM, and eventually sold to it, with the salvaged [[Hydramatic]] transmission tooling and machinery relocated to Willow Run, and put back into production just nine weeks after the fire.<ref>Kidder, Warren Benjamin, ''Willow Run, Colossus of American Industry''Michigan:KFT,1995</ref>\n\n[[File:1976 Chevrolet Nova 2-door coupe Cabriolet Roof, front right (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|1976 Chevrolet Nova built in Willow Run]]\n\nOver the years, GM expanded the bomber plant by roughly half, into a nearly {{convert|5,000,000|sqft|m2}} [[Willow Run Transmission|GM Powertrain factory and engineering center]]; a parcel of land to the south of Powertrain was set aside for assembly operations that began in 1959, including a [[Fisher Body]] plant that built bodies for the Chevrolet models assembled there, including the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] and [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova]]. In 1968, General Motors began reorganizing its body and assembly operations into the GM Assembly Division (GMAD). GMAD required 16 years to completely absorb Fisher Body's operations, and Fisher would manufacture bodies at [[Willow Run Assembly]] until the 1970s; vehicles would roll off the line there until 1992.\n\nIn addition to making automatic transmissions, Willow Run Transmission also produced the [[M16 rifle|M16A1 rifle]] and the [[M39 cannon|M39A1 20mm autocannon]] for the U.S. military during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=Liberator-Jan09-p15>{{cite news|last=Lane|first=Kirk and Reyes, Jon|title=History of the Willow Run Plant, Part 3|url=http://www.local735uaw.org/liberator/2009/2009%20jan%2015.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228223745/http://www.local735uaw.org/liberator/2009/2009%20jan%2015.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 28, 2018|accessdate=April 24, 2013|newspaper=The Liberator (a newsletter of UAW Local 735)}}</ref>\n\nBy the time General Motors entered bankruptcy in 2009, manufacturing and assembly operations at Willow Run had dwindled to almost nothing; the [[Willow Run Transmission|GM Powertrain plant]] closed in December 2010 and the complex passed into the control of the [[RACER Trust]], which is charged with cleaning up, positioning for redevelopment and ultimately, selling properties of the former General Motors.<ref name=Demolish-DFP-2013 />\n\n====MARC and Willow Run Laboratories====\nOn the other side of the airport from the assembly plant were a group of World War II [[hangar]]s, which were sold to the [[University of Michigan]] in 1946. The university operated the [[Michigan Aeronautical Research Center]] (MARC), later known as Willow Run Laboratories (WRL), from 1946 to 1972 at Willow Run.  MARC and WRL produced many innovations, including the first ruby [[laser]] and operation of the ruby [[maser]], as well as early research into [[antiballistic missile]] defense and advanced [[remote sensing]]. In 1972, the University spun off WRL into the [[Environmental Research Institute of Michigan]], which eventually left Willow Run for offices in [[Ann Arbor]].\n\n==Redevelopment efforts and the Yankee Air Museum==\nThe airfield, owned by the [[Wayne County Airport Authority]] since 2004, continues to operate as the [[Willow Run Airport]] and is primarily used for [[cargo]] and [[general aviation]] flights.

Ford Motor would not only build the bombers, it would supply the airfield as well; the farm at Willow Run was an ideal location for the airfield's runways, being under the personal ownership of Henry Ford (thus solving any land acquisition problem) and sited between the main roads and rail lines connecting Detroit with Ann Arbor and points to the west. Easements were acquired from landowners across the county line in [[Ypsilanti Township, Washtenaw County, Michigan|Ypsilanti Township]] where the Liberator plant (and eventually the airport terminal) would be built.\n\nAlthough officially retired, Henry Ford still had a say in the company's affairs and refused government financing for Willow Run, preferring to have his company build the factory and sell it to the government, which would lease it back to the company for the duration of the war.<ref name=Snyder-OralHist>{{cite web|last=Hess|first=Jerry N.|title=Oral History Interview with John W.

Although the [[Ford Trimotor]] had been a success in the 1920s, the company had since shied away from aviation, and initially, Ford was assigned to provide B-24 components with final assembly performed by [[Consolidated Aircraft|Consolidated]] at its [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] plant, or by fellow licensee [[Douglas Aircraft]] at its [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] plant.  However, in October 1941 Ford received permission from Consolidated and the Army to assemble complete Liberators on its own at its new Willow Run facility.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/> Even then it would take nearly a year before finished Liberators left the factory.\n\nAccording to [[Max Wallace]], [[Henry H. Arnold|Air Corps Chief General \"Hap\" Arnold]] told [[Charles Lindbergh]], then a consultant at the plant, that \"combat squadrons greatly preferred the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] bomber to the B-24 because 'when we send the 17\u2019s out on a mission, most of them return. But when we send the 24\u2019s out, most of them don\u2019t.'\u201d<ref>Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin\u2019s Press. page 311</ref>\n\nA 1943 committee authorized by Congress to examine problems at the plant issued a highly critical report; the Ford Motor Company had created a production line that too closely resembled an automobile assembly line \"despite the warning of many experienced aircraftmen.\"<ref>Wallace, page 312</ref>\n\nAlthough the jumping of an automotive company into aircraft production posed these quality problems, it also brought remarkable production rates. The plant held the distinction of being the world's largest enclosed \"room.\" The first Ford-built Liberator rolled off the Willow Run line in September 1942; the first series of Willow Run Liberators was the '''B-24E'''.\n[[File:Production. Willow Run bomber plant. 8e11142v.jpg|thumb|A small part of the world's largest one-story war production plant, the giant bomber factory at Willow Run, Michigan. Fixtures in background hold bomber wings during assembly, 1942]]\nThe Willow Run Plant had many initial startup problems, due primarily to the fact that Ford employees were used to automobile mass production and found it difficult to adapt these techniques to aircraft production. The plant at Willow Run was also beset with labor difficulties, high absentee rates, and rapid employee turnover. The factory was nearly an hour's drive from Detroit, and the imposition of wartime gasoline and tire rationing had made the daily commute difficult. In only one month, Ford had hired 2,900 workers but had lost 3,100.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/>\n\nAlso, Henry Ford was cantankerous and rigid in his ways. He was violently anti-union and there were serious labor difficulties, including a massive strike. In addition, Henry Ford refused on principle to hire women. However, he finally relented and did employ \"[[Rosie the Riveter]]s\" on his assembly lines, probably more because so many of his potential male workers had been drafted into the military than due to any sudden change of principle on his part.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/>\n\nBy autumn 1943, the top leadership role at Willow Run had passed from Charles Sorensen to Mead L. Bricker.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=329}}.</ref>\n\nAt the request of the government, Ford began to decentralize operations and many parts were assembled at other Ford plants as well as by the company's sub-contractors, with the Willow Run plant concentrating on final aircraft assembly. The bugs were eventually worked out of the manufacturing processes, and by 1944, Ford was rolling a Liberator off the Willow Run production line every 63 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nAt its peak monthly production (August 1944), Willow Run produced 428 B-24s with highest production listed as 100 completed Bombers flying away from Willow Run Between April 24 and April 26, 1944. By 1945, Ford produced 70% of the B-24s in two 9-hour shifts. Ford built 6,972 of the 18,482 total B-24s and produced kits for 1,893 more to be assembled by the other manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |title=28 June 1945 |url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/2017/06/28/ |work=This Day in Aviation |date=June 28, 2017 |accessdate=June 29, 2017}}</ref> The B-24 holds the distinction of being the most produced heavy bomber in history.<ref name=Willowrun/><ref>{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=David L. |url=http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/willow_run/willow_run.html |title=They may save our honor, our hopes\u2014and our necks |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114193058/http://www.michiganhistorymagazine.com/extra/willow_run/willow_run.html |archive-date=January 14, 2008 |work=Michigan History |date=September 1993}}</ref>\n\n====Army Air Forces support and post-production activities====\nAfter their manufacture, the next step in the process was the delivery of the aircraft to the operational squadrons. This was done at Willow Run by 1st Concentration Command (1st CC). The 1st CC was responsible for completing the organization and equipment of tactical and combat bombardment squadrons prior to their deployment to the overseas combat theaters. It also provided a final inspection of the aircraft and made any appropriate final changes; i.e., install long-range fuel tanks, remove unnecessary equipment, and give it a final flight safety test.<ref name=\"Thole\">{{cite web |last=Thole |first=Lou |url=http://www.museumofthesoldier.com/baer_field.htm |title=Preparing C-47s for War (Baer Field) |work=Museum of the Soldier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005151807/http://www.museumofthesoldier.com/baer_field.htm |archive-date=October 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/155/775.xml AFHRA Document 00155775 1 Concentration Command History]</ref>\n\nWhile the planes were being serviced and made ready for overseas movement, personnel for these planes were also being processed. Pilots, co-pilots, navigators and crew chiefs were assigned as a crew for each aircraft, sleeping on 1,300 cots as they waited for the B-24s to roll off the assembly line. Paperwork was handled, necessary specific B-24 life support equipment was issued and some technical training for supporting the aircraft accomplished.<ref name=\"Thole\"/><ref>[http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/150/138.xml AFHRA Document 00150138 AAFTC Technical Training Command]</ref>\n\nOnce production began, it became difficult to introduce changes dictated by field experience in the various overseas theaters onto the production line in a timely fashion. Consequently, newly constructed Liberators needed modifications for the specific geographic areas they were to be flown in combat. For this reason, a series of [[Air Technical Service Command]] modification centers were established for the incorporation of these required theater changes into new Liberators following their manufacture and assignments. There were seven known modification centers: the [[Birmingham Air National Guard Base|Birmingham Air Depot]] in Alabama; Consolidated's Fort Worth plant, the Oklahoma City Air Materiel Center at [[Tinker Field]], the Tucson Modification Center at [[Tucson International Airport]];<ref>{{cite web |first=Bob |last=Ring |title=Tucson International Airport\u2019s Historic Hangars |url=http://www.ringbrothershistory.com/bobsprojects/azstar/82%20%20June%2020,%202013%20%20Tucson%20International%20Airport%27s%20Historic%20%20Hangars.pdf |work=Ring Brothers History |date=June 20, 2013 |accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref> the Northwest Airlines Depot in Minneapolis; the, Martin-Omaha manufacturing plant, and the Hawaiian Air Depot at [[Hickam Field]].<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"leary\"/> The Birmingham Air Depot's primary mission was modifying Liberators from Willow Run.<ref name=Holley-BuyingAircraft-531>{{cite book|last=Holley|first=Irving Brinton|title=United States Army in World War 2, Buying Aircraft: Material Procurement for Army Air Forces|year=1964|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=531|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUC1WHocc2QC}}</ref>\n\n====Liberator variants produced at Willow Run====\n{{see also|B-24_Liberator#Variants_and_conversions}}\n\nThe '''B-24E''' was the first variant of the B-24 that underwent primary manufacture by Ford at Willow Run. Not only did Ford build 490 complete planes, but it also supplied components of B-24Es as kits that could be trucked for final assembly at the factories of Consolidated in Fort Worth and Douglas in Tulsa, 144 and 167 kits.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/>\n\n[[File:Installing one of the four engines of a new B-24E (Liberator) bomber on one of the assembly lines of ford's big... - NARA - 196388.jpg|thumb|B-24E engine installation, Willow Run 1943]]\n\nB-24Es built and fully assembled at Ford were designated B-24E-FO; those assembled at Tulsa and Fort Worth out of parts supplied by Ford were designated B-24E-DT and B-24E-CF respectively. Because of production delays encountered at Willow Run as a result of the inevitable difficulties and snags involved in the adaptation of automobile manufacturing techniques to aircraft, the B-24Es produced at Willow Run were, generally, obsolete by the time that it began to roll off the production lines, and most were relegated to training roles in the United States and hence few ever saw combat.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\">Davis, Larry, (1987), B-24 Liberator in Action - Aircraft No. 80, Squadron/Signal Publications Inc. {{ISBN|0-89747-190-3}}</ref>\n\nThe '''B-24H''' was the first variant produced by Ford at Willow Run in large numbers that went into combat. The B-24H differed from earlier B-24s by having a second turret placed in the nose of the aircraft to increase defensive firepower. Because of the many structural changes required to accommodate the nose turret, the first B-24Hs were delivered slightly behind schedule, with the first machines rolling off the production lines at Ford in late June 1943. Production for the B-24H at Willow Run was 1,780.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/>\n\nUpon the introduction of the '''B-24J''', all three of the Liberator manufacturing plants converted to the production of this version. The B-24J incorporated a hydraulically driven tail turret and other defensive armament modifications in the nose of the aircraft. The bomber plant produced its first B-24J in April 1944; 1587 were built at Willow Run.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nDuring June 1944, the Army determined that the San Diego and Willow Run plants would be capable of meeting all future requirements for Liberator production. The Boeing [[B-29 Superfortress]] was taking over the long-range bombing role in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] and no new B-24 units were programmed for deployment in the other combat theaters of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean]] or in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|CBI]].<ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nThe '''B-24L''' was the first product of the new, downsized Liberator production pool. It was an attempt to reverse the trend toward ever-increasing weight of the Liberator as more and more armament, equipment, and armor had been added, with no corresponding increase in engine power. With the weight reduction and more powerful engines, it also had a much longer range than earlier models. 1250 B-24L aircraft were built at Willow Run.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nThe '''B-24M''' was the last large-scale production variant of the Liberator. Apart from a new tail turret, the B-24M differed little from the B-24L. The first B-24Ms were delivered in October 1944, and by the end of its production in 1945, Willow Run had built 1677; 124 Ford-built B-24Ms were cancelled before delivery.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref name=\"Davis\"/>\n\nFord had switched over to the single-tailed '''B-24N''' in May 1945, but the end of the war in Europe in the same month brought a rapid end to Liberator production; the contract with Ford was officially terminated on 31 May 1945 and orders for 5168 unbuilt B-24N-FO bombers were cancelled as well. The delivery of seven YB-24Ns by Ford in June 1945 marked the end of Liberator production at Willow Run.<ref name=\"Lloyd\"/><ref>Johnson, Fredrick A (1996) Consolidated B-24 Liberator - Warbird Tech Vol. 1, Specialty Press. {{ISBN|0-933424-64-7}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war conversion===\nAlthough Ford had an option to purchase the plant once it was no longer needed for war production, the company declined to exercise it, and ended its association with Willow Run. \n====Kaiser takes control====\n\n[[File:Kaiser-Frazer C-119F-KM Flying Boxcar 51-8156.jpg|thumb|Kaiser-Frazer C-119 built at Willow Run]]\n\nAfter Ford declined to purchase the plant, it was sold to the [[Kaiser-Frazer]] Corporation, a partnership of construction and shipbuilding magnate [[Henry J. Kaiser]] and [[Graham-Paige]] executive [[Joseph W. Frazer]]. The plant produced both Kaiser and [[Frazer (automobile)]] models, including the compact [[Henry J]], which with minor differences was also sold through [[Sears-Roebuck]] as the [[Allstate (automobile)|Allstate]].\n\nWillow Run produced 739,000 cars as part of Kaiser-Frazer and Kaiser Motors, from 1947 through 1953, when after years of losses, the company (now called [[Kaiser Motors]] after Frazer's exit from the partnership) purchased [[Willys-Overland]] and began moving its production at Willow Run to the Willys plant in [[Toledo, Ohio]].\n\nAlthough Willow Run is synonymous with the Liberator bomber, B-24s were not the only planes manufactured at Willow Run. As the [[U.S. Air Force]] struggled to expand its airlift capacity during the [[Korean War]], Kaiser-Frazer built [[C-119 Flying Boxcar]] cargo planes at Willow Run under license from [[Fairchild Aircraft]], producing an estimated 88 C-119s between 1951 and 1953. Kaiser also built two [[C-123 Provider]] airframes at Willow Run, which were scrapped before delivery, as a procurement scandal involving the company put an end to any chance for future Air Force contracts.<ref name=\"WRhist\"/>\n\n====General Motors operations====\nLater in 1953, after a fire on August 12 destroyed [[General Motors]]' Detroit Transmission factory in [[Livonia, Michigan]], the Willow Run complex was first leased to GM, and eventually sold to it, with the salvaged [[Hydramatic]] transmission tooling and machinery relocated to Willow Run, and put back into production just nine weeks after the fire.<ref>Kidder, Warren Benjamin, ''Willow Run, Colossus of American Industry''Michigan:KFT,1995</ref>\n\n[[File:1976 Chevrolet Nova 2-door coupe Cabriolet Roof, front right (Hershey 2019).jpg|thumb|1976 Chevrolet Nova built in Willow Run]]\n\nOver the years, GM expanded the bomber plant by roughly half, into a nearly {{convert|5,000,000|sqft|m2}} [[Willow Run Transmission|GM Powertrain factory and engineering center]]; a parcel of land to the south of Powertrain was set aside for assembly operations that began in 1959, including a [[Fisher Body]] plant that built bodies for the Chevrolet models assembled there, including the [[Chevrolet Corvair|Corvair]] and [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova]]. In 1968, General Motors began reorganizing its body and assembly operations into the GM Assembly Division (GMAD). GMAD required 16 years to completely absorb Fisher Body's operations, and Fisher would manufacture bodies at [[Willow Run Assembly]] until the 1970s; vehicles would roll off the line there until 1992.\n\nIn addition to making automatic transmissions, Willow Run Transmission also produced the [[M16 rifle|M16A1 rifle]] and the [[M39 cannon|M39A1 20mm autocannon]] for the U.S. military during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=Liberator-Jan09-p15>{{cite news|last=Lane|first=Kirk and Reyes, Jon|title=History of the Willow Run Plant, Part 3|url=http://www.local735uaw.org/liberator/2009/2009%20jan%2015.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228223745/http://www.local735uaw.org/liberator/2009/2009%20jan%2015.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 28, 2018|accessdate=April 24, 2013|newspaper=The Liberator (a newsletter of UAW Local 735)}}</ref>\n\nBy the time General Motors entered bankruptcy in 2009, manufacturing and assembly operations at Willow Run had dwindled to almost nothing; the [[Willow Run Transmission|GM Powertrain plant]] closed in December 2010 and the complex passed into the control of the [[RACER Trust]], which is charged with cleaning up, positioning for redevelopment and ultimately, selling properties of the former General Motors.<ref name=Demolish-DFP-2013 />\n\n====MARC and Willow Run Laboratories====\nOn the other side of the airport from the assembly plant were a group of World War II [[hangar]]s, which were sold to the [[University of Michigan]] in 1946. The university operated the [[Michigan Aeronautical Research Center]] (MARC), later known as Willow Run Laboratories (WRL), from 1946 to 1972 at Willow Run.  MARC and WRL produced many innovations, including the first ruby [[laser]] and operation of the ruby [[maser]], as well as early research into [[antiballistic missile]] defense and advanced [[remote sensing]]. In 1972, the University spun off WRL into the [[Environmental Research Institute of Michigan]], which eventually left Willow Run for offices in [[Ann Arbor]].\n\n==Redevelopment efforts and the Yankee Air Museum==\nThe airfield, owned by the [[Wayne County Airport Authority]] since 2004, continues to operate as the [[Willow Run Airport]] and is primarily used for [[cargo]] and [[general aviation]] flights. The [[Yankee Air Museum]] resides on the airport grounds, occupying as of April 2013 a {{convert|47,000|sqft|m2}} hangar and other properties.<ref name=Demolish-DFP-2013 />\n\nFor a period of time before the eventual demolition of [[Willow Run Assembly]], portions were used as a warehouse, about a quarter of which was leased by GM as a facility for parts distribution.<ref name=InSite-release-WR-Assembly-lease>{{cite web|title=InSite Signs 568,000 SF Lease|url=http://www.insiterealestate.com/news_article.php?id=18|work=press release|publisher=InSite Real Estate|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' confirmed that the facility's current owner, [[RACER Trust]], was negotiating with the [[Yankee Air Museum]] to preserve a small portion of the original bomber plant as a new home for the museum. Yankee was originally granted until August 2013 (deadline was later extended) to raise the funds needed to purchase and separate a portion of the approximately 5,000,000 sq. ft. building, which later became the [[Willow Run Transmission|GM Powertrain facility]]. The museum would consolidate operations scattered on various parcels at Willow Run, and the Trust expects to clear the remainder of the plant for redevelopment.<ref name=Demolish-DFP-2013 /> The 175,000 sq. ft. portion of the original bomber plant that Yankee seeks to preserve is less than 5% of the massive facility, comprises the end of the former B-24 assembly line at the far eastern edge of the property, and contains the two iconic bay doors from which the finished [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers exited the plant during World War II.\n\nThe campaign to save a portion of Willow Run for the Yankee Air Museum is called SaveTheBomberPlant.org, and is centered on a fundraising website by the same name.<ref>[http://www.savethebomberplant.org Save The Bomber Plant] \u2013 Information and fundraising site for Yankee Air Museum's effort to save a portion of the Willow Run Bomber Plant</ref> The campaign has attracted national, and even international, attention from media outlets that include many major news dailies in the U.S. as well as [[National Public Radio]], [[The History Channel]] magazine, [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV, [[The Guardian]] (UK), and the (UK) [[Daily Mail]].<ref name=SaveTheBomberPlant>{{cite web|title=Save The Bomber Plant Website|url=http://savethebomberplant.org/about-the-campaign/media-coverage/|publisher=SaveTheBomberPlant.org|accessdate=September 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBuilding owner RACER Trust extended the original fundraising deadline (August 1, 2013) a total of three times since the [[Yankee Air Museum]] launched its SaveTheBomberPlant.org campaign.
