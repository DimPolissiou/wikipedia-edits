Throughout the decade, many countries (particularly in [[Europe]]) worldwide saw many revolts and uprisings, with the most prominent ones [[Revolutions of 1848| happening in 1848]]. Aside from uprisings, the [[United States]] began to see a shifting population that [[American frontier| migrated to the West Coast]], as the [[California Gold Rush]] ensued in the latter half of the decade.\n\n== Politics and wars ==\n\n=== Pacific Islands ===\nIn 1842, [[Tahiti]] and [[Tahuata]] were declared a [[protectorate|French protectorate]], to allow Catholic missionaries to work undisturbed.

During [[1842 retreat from Kabul|the retreat from Kabul]], the British army of approximately 4,500 troops (of which only 690 were European) and 12,000 [[camp follower]]s was subjected to a series of attacks by Afghan warriors.

It remains the most widespread [[revolutionary wave]] in [[European history]], but within a year, [[reactionary]] forces had regained control, and the revolutions collapsed.\n\nThe revolutions were essentially [[Liberal democracy#Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie|bourgeois-democratic]] in nature with the aim of removing the old [[Feudalism|feudal]] structures and the creation of independent national states. The revolutionary wave began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]], and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America.  Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among the revolutionaries in different countries.  Six factors were involved: widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership; demands for more participation in government and democracy; demands for freedom of press; the demands of the working classes; the upsurge of nationalism; and finally, the regrouping of the reactionary forces based on the royalty, the aristocracy, the army, and the peasants.<ref>R.J.W.

Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more forced into exile. The only significant lasting reforms were the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Austria and Hungary, the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in Denmark, and the definitive end of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian monarchy]] in France.

The region included all of the modern American states of [[California]], [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]], and parts of [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\nThe [[United States]], embarked on the [[Conquest of California]] in an early military campaign of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in Alta California. The California Campaign was marked by a series of small battles throughout 1846 and early 1847.  The [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed on January 13, 1847, and essentially terminated hostilities in Alta California. Shortly thereafter, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] was appointed Governor of the new [[California]] Territory, and [[Yerba Buena, California]], was renamed [[San Francisco]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed in February 1848, marked the end of the Mexican\u2013American War. By the terms of the treaty, [[Mexican Cession|Mexico formally ceded]] Alta California along with its other northern territories east through [[Texas]], receiving [[USD|$]]15,000,000 in exchange. This largely unsettled territory constituted nearly half of its claimed territory with about 1% of its then population of about 4,500,000.<ref>Note: A new international boundary was drawn; [[San Diego Bay]] is one of the only two main natural harbors in California south of [[San Francisco Bay]];  the border was aligned from one Spanish league south of San Diego Bay east to the [[Gila River]] \u2013 [[Colorado River]] confluence, to include strategic San Diego and its harbor.</ref><ref>Two years after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, U.S. statehood was granted in 1850.</ref>  \n\nThe discovery of gold in [[Northern California]] (and subsequent discourse about that discovery in 1848) led to the [[California Gold Rush]]. In October 1848, the [[SS California (1848)|SS ''California'']] left [[New York Harbor]], rounded [[Cape Horn]] at the tip of South America, and arrived in [[San Francisco]] after the 4-month-21-day journey.  Thereafter, regular [[steamboat]] service continued from the west to the east coast of the United States.  During 1848, only an estimated 6,000 to 6,500 people traveled to California to seek gold that year.<ref name=\"Starr48\">Starr, Kevin and Orsi, Richard J. (eds.)

The following year, an ambassador from Texas approached the United States about the possibility of becoming an American state.  Fearing a war with Mexico, which did not recognize Texas independence, the United States declined the offer.<ref>Richard Bruce Winders, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&printsec=frontcover ''Crisis in the Southwest: The United States, Mexico, and the Struggle over Texas''] (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2002), p. 41.</ref>  \n\nIn 1844, [[James K. Polk]] was elected the United States president after promising to annex Texas.  Before he assumed office, the outgoing president, [[John Tyler]], entered negotiations with Texas.  On February 26, 1845, six days before Polk took office, the U.S. Congress approved the annexation.  The Texas legislature approved annexation in July 1845 and constructed a [[Constitution of the State of Texas|state constitution]].  In October, Texas residents approved the annexation and the new constitution, and Texas was officially inducted into the United States on December 29, 1845 as the 28th U.S. state..<ref>Fehrenbach, ''Lone Star'', pp. 264&#x2013;267</ref> Mexico still considered Texas to be a renegade Mexican state, and never considered land south of the [[Nueces River]] to be part of Texas. This border dispute between the newly-expanded United States and Mexico triggered the [[#Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican\u2013American War]]. \n\nWhen the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States. Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the [[Compromise of 1850]], in which Texas ceded some of its territory to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso.\n\n==== Mexican\u2013American War ====\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}[[File:Battle Molino del Rey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mexican\u2013American War]]]][[Territorial expansion of the United States|American territorial expansion]] to the [[Pacific coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] was a major goal of U.S. President [[James K.

Mexico did not accept the annexation, while also continuing to claim the [[Nueces River]] as its border with Texas<s>,</s> and also still considering Texas to be a province of Mexico. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] sent troops to the disputed area, and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces [[Thornton Affair|attacked American forces]], the U.S. declared the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848).\n\nCombat operations lasted a year and a half, from the spring of 1846 to the fall of 1847. U.S. forces quickly occupied the capital town of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] along the upper Rio Grande and began the [[Conquest of California]] in Mexico's [[Alta California]] Department. They then invaded to the south into parts of central Mexico (modern-day northeastern Mexico and northwest Mexico). Meanwhile, the [[Pacific Squadron]] of the [[United States Navy]] conducted a blockade and took control of several garrisons on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast farther south in lower [[Baja California Territory]]. The U.S. Army eventually captured the capital [[Mexico City]], having marched west from the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], where the Americans staged their first amphibious landing on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast.\n\nThe 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], forced onto the remnant Mexican government, ended the war and specified its major consequence, the [[Mexican Cession]] of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15 million compensation for the physical damage of the war. In addition, the United States assumed $3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of their province, later the Republic of Texas (and now the [[Texas|State of Texas]]), and thereafter cited and acknowledged the Rio Grande as its future northern national border with the United States. Including Texas, Mexico ceded an area of approximately {{convert|2500000|km2}} \u2013 by its terms, around 55% of its former national territory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=26|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)}}</ref>\n\n==== Mexico ====\n{{See also|Territorial evolution of Mexico|Centralist Republic of Mexico|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna}}\nThe 1840s for Mexico were the end of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] and the waning years the \"Age of Santa Anna\". In 1834, President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] dissolved Congress, forming a new government. That government instituted the new Centralist Republic of Mexico by approving a new centralist constitution (\"[[Siete Leyes]]\"), From its formation in 1835 until its dissolution in 1846, the Centralist Republic was governed by eleven [[President of Mexico|presidents]] (none of which finished their term). It called for the state militias to disarm, but many states resisted, including [[Mexican Texas]], which won its independence in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836.  \n\nThe [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] declared its independence from Mexico in January 1840. However, the border with Texas was never determined (whether the [[Nueces River]] or the [[Rio Grande]]). The new Republic fought a brief and unsuccessful war for independence, returning to Mexico late in the year.  \n\nIn 1841, Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] and [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Paredes]] led a rebellion against [[Anastasio Bustamante|President  Bustamante]], resulting in Santa Anna becoming president of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] for a fifth time . Local officials in Yucat\u00e1n declared independence in 1841, opposing strong autocratic rule and demanding the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], thus establishing the second [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]].  \n\nIn 1842, the region of [[Soconusco]] was annexed by Mexico as part of the state of [[Chiapas]], following the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].  \n\nIn 1846, [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|President Paredes]] and the Congress of Mexico declared war at the beginning of the Mexican\u2013American War. Paredes' presidential successor was deposed in a coup, replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas]].  Salas issued a new decree that restored the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], ending the Centralist Republic and beginning the [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico]]. After the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] became the second president of Mexico to finish his term (Mexico's first president completed his in 1829). It was during this time that Yucat\u00e1n reunited with Mexico.  A decisive factor for the reunion was the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]] (a revolt by the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population) for which Yucat\u00e1n initially sought help from Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but ultimately reunited with Mexico for help. \n\nHerrera peacefully turned over the presidency to the winner of the Federal Elections of 1850, General [[Mariano Arista]].

The revolutionary wave began in [[French Revolution of 1848|France in February]], and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America.  Over 50 countries were affected, but with no coordination or cooperation among the revolutionaries in different countries.  Six factors were involved: widespread dissatisfaction with political leadership; demands for more participation in government and democracy; demands for freedom of press; the demands of the working classes; the upsurge of nationalism; and finally, the regrouping of the reactionary forces based on the royalty, the aristocracy, the army, and the peasants.<ref>R.J.W.

Tens of thousands of people were killed, and many more forced into exile. The only significant lasting reforms were the abolition of [[serfdom]] in Austria and Hungary, the end of [[absolute monarchy]] in Denmark, and the definitive end of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian monarchy]] in France.

The region included all of the modern American states of [[California]], [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]], and parts of [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]], [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\nThe [[United States]], embarked on the [[Conquest of California]] in an early military campaign of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in Alta California. The California Campaign was marked by a series of small battles throughout 1846 and early 1847.  The [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed on January 13, 1847, and essentially terminated hostilities in Alta California. Shortly thereafter, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] was appointed Governor of the new [[California]] Territory, and [[Yerba Buena, California]], was renamed [[San Francisco]].\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed in February 1848, marked the end of the Mexican\u2013American War. By the terms of the treaty, [[Mexican Cession|Mexico formally ceded]] Alta California along with its other northern territories east through [[Texas]], receiving [[USD|$]]15,000,000 in exchange. This largely unsettled territory constituted nearly half of its claimed territory with about 1% of its then population of about 4,500,000.<ref>Note: A new international boundary was drawn; [[San Diego Bay]] is one of the only two main natural harbors in California south of [[San Francisco Bay]];  the border was aligned from one Spanish league south of San Diego Bay east to the [[Gila River]] \u2013 [[Colorado River]] confluence, to include strategic San Diego and its harbor.</ref><ref>Two years after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, U.S. statehood was granted in 1850.</ref>  \n\nThe discovery of gold in [[Northern California]] (and subsequent discourse about that discovery in 1848) led to the [[California Gold Rush]]. In October 1848, the [[SS California (1848)|SS ''California'']] left [[New York Harbor]], rounded [[Cape Horn]] at the tip of South America, and arrived in [[San Francisco]] after the 4-month-21-day journey.  Thereafter, regular [[steamboat]] service continued from the west to the east coast of the United States.  During 1848, only an estimated 6,000 to 6,500 people traveled to California to seek gold that year.<ref name=\"Starr48\">Starr, Kevin and Orsi, Richard J. (eds.)

The following year, an ambassador from Texas approached the United States about the possibility of becoming an American state.  Fearing a war with Mexico, which did not recognize Texas independence, the United States declined the offer.<ref>Richard Bruce Winders, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mcc9EciebFYC&printsec=frontcover ''Crisis in the Southwest: The United States, Mexico, and the Struggle over Texas''] (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2002), p. 41.</ref>  \n\nIn 1844, [[James K. Polk]] was elected the United States president after promising to annex Texas.  Before he assumed office, the outgoing president, [[John Tyler]], entered negotiations with Texas.  On February 26, 1845, six days before Polk took office, the U.S. Congress approved the annexation.  The Texas legislature approved annexation in July 1845 and constructed a [[Constitution of the State of Texas|state constitution]].  In October, Texas residents approved the annexation and the new constitution, and Texas was officially inducted into the United States on December 29, 1845 as the 28th U.S. state..<ref>Fehrenbach, ''Lone Star'', pp. 264&#x2013;267</ref> Mexico still considered Texas to be a renegade Mexican state, and never considered land south of the [[Nueces River]] to be part of Texas. This border dispute between the newly-expanded United States and Mexico triggered the [[#Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican\u2013American War]]. \n\nWhen the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States. Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the [[Compromise of 1850]], in which Texas ceded some of its territory to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso.\n\n==== Mexican\u2013American War ====\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}[[File:Battle Molino del Rey.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Mexican\u2013American War]]]][[Territorial expansion of the United States|American territorial expansion]] to the [[Pacific coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] was a major goal of U.S. President [[James K.

Mexico did not accept the annexation, while also continuing to claim the [[Nueces River]] as its border with Texas<s>,</s> and also still considering Texas to be a province of Mexico. In 1845, newly elected U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] sent troops to the disputed area, and a diplomatic mission to Mexico. After Mexican forces [[Thornton Affair|attacked American forces]], the U.S. declared the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848).\n\nCombat operations lasted a year and a half, from the spring of 1846 to the fall of 1847. U.S. forces quickly occupied the capital town of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] along the upper Rio Grande and began the [[Conquest of California]] in Mexico's [[Alta California]] Department. They then invaded to the south into parts of central Mexico (modern-day northeastern Mexico and northwest Mexico). Meanwhile, the [[Pacific Squadron]] of the [[United States Navy]] conducted a blockade and took control of several garrisons on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast farther south in lower [[Baja California Territory]]. The U.S. Army eventually captured the capital [[Mexico City]], having marched west from the port of [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], where the Americans staged their first amphibious landing on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coast.\n\nThe 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], forced onto the remnant Mexican government, ended the war and specified its major consequence, the [[Mexican Cession]] of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico to the United States. The U.S. agreed to pay $15 million compensation for the physical damage of the war. In addition, the United States assumed $3.25 million of debt already owed earlier by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico acknowledged the loss of their province, later the Republic of Texas (and now the [[Texas|State of Texas]]), and thereafter cited and acknowledged the Rio Grande as its future northern national border with the United States. Including Texas, Mexico ceded an area of approximately {{convert|2500000|km2}} \u2013 by its terms, around 55% of its former national territory.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=26|title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848)}}</ref>\n\n==== Mexico ====\n{{See also|Territorial evolution of Mexico|Centralist Republic of Mexico|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna}}\nThe 1840s for Mexico were the end of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] and the waning years the \"Age of Santa Anna\". In 1834, President [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] dissolved Congress, forming a new government. That government instituted the new Centralist Republic of Mexico by approving a new centralist constitution (\"[[Siete Leyes]]\"), From its formation in 1835 until its dissolution in 1846, the Centralist Republic was governed by eleven [[President of Mexico|presidents]] (none of which finished their term). It called for the state militias to disarm, but many states resisted, including [[Mexican Texas]], which won its independence in the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836.  \n\nThe [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] declared its independence from Mexico in January 1840. However, the border with Texas was never determined (whether the [[Nueces River]] or the [[Rio Grande]]). The new Republic fought a brief and unsuccessful war for independence, returning to Mexico late in the year.  \n\nIn 1841, Generals [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] and [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|Paredes]] led a rebellion against [[Anastasio Bustamante|President  Bustamante]], resulting in Santa Anna becoming president of the [[Centralist Republic of Mexico|centralist government]] for a fifth time . Local officials in Yucat\u00e1n declared independence in 1841, opposing strong autocratic rule and demanding the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], thus establishing the second [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]].  \n\nIn 1842, the region of [[Soconusco]] was annexed by Mexico as part of the state of [[Chiapas]], following the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].  \n\nIn 1846, [[Mariano Paredes (President of Mexico)|President Paredes]] and the Congress of Mexico declared war at the beginning of the Mexican\u2013American War. Paredes' presidential successor was deposed in a coup, replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Salas]].  Salas issued a new decree that restored the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]], ending the Centralist Republic and beginning the [[Second Federal Republic of Mexico]]. After the conclusion of the Mexican\u2013American War, [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Herrera]] became the second president of Mexico to finish his term (Mexico's first president completed his in 1829). It was during this time that Yucat\u00e1n reunited with Mexico.  A decisive factor for the reunion was the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]] (a revolt by the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] population) for which Yucat\u00e1n initially sought help from Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but ultimately reunited with Mexico for help. \n\nHerrera peacefully turned over the presidency to the winner of the Federal Elections of 1850, General [[Mariano Arista]].  Despite being exiled from Mexico in 1848, Santa Anna would [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna#President for the last time|return to the presidency one last time]] during the [[1850s]]. \n\n==== El Salvador ====\n* February \u2013 [[El Salvador]] proclaims itself an independent republic, bringing an end to the (already ''de facto'' defunct) [[Federal Republic of Central America]].\n\n==== Nicaragua ====\n\n==== Costa Rica ====\n\n==== Puerto Rico ====\n\n==== Honduras ====\n\n=== Caribbean ===\n\n==== Barbados ====\n* [[June 6]], [[1843]] \u2013 In [[Barbados]], [[Samuel Jackman Prescod]] is the first non-white person elected to the House of Assembly.\n\n==== Dominican Republic ====\n* [[February 27]], [[1844]] \u2013 The [[Dominican Republic]] gains independence from [[Haiti]].\n* [[November 6]], [[1844]] \u2013 The [[Dominican Republic]] drafts its first [[Constitution]].\n\n==== Haiti ====\n* [[March 1]], [[1847]] \u2013 [[Faustin Soulouque]] declares himself [[Emperor]] of [[Haiti]].\n\n==== Trinidad ====\n* [[May 30]], [[1845]] \u2013 ''[[Fatel Razack]]'' (''Fath Al Razack'', \"Victory of Allah the Provider\", [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0642\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0642) is the first ship to bring indentured labourers from [[India]] to [[Trinidad]], landing in the [[Gulf of Paria]] with 227 immigrants.<ref>When the British decided they were going to bring Indians to Trinidad this year, most of the traditional British ship owners did not wish to be involved.

''Dasho'' Nedip Dorji, an Oxford graduate, is the current vice chancellor and handles the day-to-day administration of the university system.\n\nThe [[Centre for Bhutan Studies]] (CBS) in [[Thimphu]], originally slated to become a member institution of the university, has retained its autonomous status.\n\n==Administration==\nBased on the distributed model with campuses of the colleges forming the core element of the university,  the Office of the [[Vice-Chancellor]] at the center is responsible for central coordination while the constituent member colleges look after academic functions of teaching and research within their respective colleges. Located at Mothithang, Thimphu, the Office of the Vice Chancellor consists of the departments of Registry, Academic Affairs, Planning and Resources, and Research and External Relations.\n\nThe twofold objective of the university as stated in the Royal Charter (RUB 2003, p.&nbsp;3){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} is to develop and provide programmes of study at tertiary education level, of relevance and good quality which will fulfill the needs of the country for an educated and skilled population; and to promote and conduct [[research]], to contribute to the creation of knowledge in an international context and to promote the transfer of knowledge of relevance to Bhutan.\n\n==Programmes==\nThe Royal University of Bhutan offers programmes across its campuses in eight broad [[curriculum]] areas. These include:\n*teacher education\n*business and management\n*engineering and physical sciences\n*computing and information science\n*biological sciences and agriculture\n*health sciences\n*humanities and social sciences\n*[[Dzongkha]] language and literature\n\nThere are plans to include programmes in arts and design, media and mass communication, Bhutanese history and culture, [[Gross national happiness|Gross National Happiness]], counseling and Buddhist studies in the colleges.\n\nMost programmes are full-time, although the two colleges of education, [[Sherubtse College]], and the Institute of Language and Culture Studies, offer part-time and [[distance education]] programmes. Some programmes offered at Sherubtse College provide their students with freedom to cross departmental boundaries with double degree programmes.\n\nThe university offers diploma, degree, and honours degree courses of study.\n\n===Diploma===\nThe diploma programme consists of 240 credits out of which at least 100 credits are at second year degree level. The programme usually takes over two years of full-time study, or more, if it consists of more than 120 credits.{{clarify|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe diploma may be an interim award in a degree programme, in which case the programme aims to prepare diploma graduates for employment as well as to prepare them to progress to the award of a degree. The diploma may also be an award for an entirely free standing programme unrelated to a degree programme, in which case the programme aims at every specific employment or skills-based target.\n\n===Degree===\nThe degree programme consists of 360 credits, out of which at least 90 shall be at third year level. The degree programme usually takes over three years of full-time study, or more, if it consists of more than 360 credits.\n\n===Honours degree===\nThe honours degree supplements and develops the subject matter learned from the degree to a higher level.

Some programmes offered at Sherubtse College provide their students with freedom to cross departmental boundaries with double degree programmes.\n\nThe university offers diploma, degree, and honours degree courses of study.\n\n===Diploma===\nThe diploma programme consists of 240 credits out of which at least 100 credits are at second year degree level. The programme usually takes over two years of full-time study, or more, if it consists of more than 120 credits.{{clarification needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe diploma may be an interim award in a degree programme, in which case the programme aims to prepare diploma graduates for employment as well as to prepare them to progress to the award of a degree. The diploma may also be an award for an entirely free standing programme unrelated to a degree programme, in which case the programme aims at every specific employment or skills-based target.\n\n===Degree===\nThe degree programme consists of 360 credits, out of which at least 90 shall be at third year level.

{"title_page": "Consumer ethnocentrism", "text_new": "{{underlinked|date=October 2013}}\n'''Consumer ethnocentrism''' is derived from the more general [[psychology|psychological]] concept of [[ethnocentrism]]. Basically, ethnocentric individuals tend to view their group as superior to others. As such, they view other groups from the perspective of their own, and reject those that are different and accept those that are similar (Netemeyer et al., 1991; Shimp & Sharma, 1987). This, in turn, derives from earlier sociological theories of in-groups and out-groups (Shimp & Sharma, 1987). Ethnocentrism, it is consistently found, is normal for an in-group to an out-group (Jones, 1997; Ryan & Bogart, 1997).\n\nConsumer ethnocentrism specifically refers to ethnocentric views held by [[consumer]]s in one country, the in-group, towards products from another country, the out-group (Shimp & Sharma, 1987). Consumers may believe that it is not appropriate, and possibly even immoral, to buy products from other countries.\n\nPurchasing foreign products may be viewed as improper because it costs domestic jobs and hurts the economy. The purchase of foreign products may even be seen as simply unpatriotic (Klein, 2002; Netemeyer et al., 1991; Sharma, Shimp, & Shin, 1995; Shimp & Sharma, 1987).\n\n==Attributes==\nConsumer ethnocentrism gives individuals an understanding of what purchases are acceptable to the in-group, as well as feelings of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[belonging]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}. For consumers who are not ethnocentric, or [[polycentric consumers]], products are evaluated on their merits exclusive of their [[country of origin]], or possibly even viewed more positively because they are foreign (Shimp & Sharma, 1987; Vida & Dmitrovic, 2001).\n\nBrodowsky (1998) studied consumer ethnocentrism among car buyers in the U.S. and found a strong positive relationship between high ethnocentrism and country-based bias in the evaluation of [[automobile]]s. Consumers with low ethnocentrism appeared to evaluate automobiles based more on the merits of the actual automobile rather than its country of origin. Brodowsky suggests that understanding consumer ethnocentrism is critical in understanding country of origin effects.\n\nSeveral antecedents of consumer ethnocentrism have been identified by various studies. Consumers who tend to be less ethnocentric are those who are young, those who are male, those who are better educated, and those with higher income levels (Balabanis et al., 2001; Good & Huddleston, 1995; Sharma et al., 1995).\n\nBalabanis et al. found that the determinants of consumer ethnocentrism may vary from country to country and culture to culture. In Turkey, [[patriotism]] was found to be the most important motive for consumer ethnocentrism (Acikdilli et al., 2017). This, it was theorized, was due to Turkey's collectivist culture, with patriotism being an important expression of loyalty to the group. In the more individualistic Czech Republic, feelings of [[nationalism]] based on a sense of superiority and dominance appeared to provide the most important contribution to consumer ethnocentrism.\n\n==The CETSCALE==\nShimp and Sharma (1987) developed consumer ethnocentrism into a measurable construct through the use of the consumer ethnocentric tendencies scale (CETSCALE). The initial development of the CETSCALE began with 225 different questions, which were narrowed down to 100 before being sent to a [[Statistical survey|survey]] group for the first [[purification study]]. Through repeated purification studies, the number of questions was finally reduced to 17. Repeated studies by Shimp and Sharma validated the CETSCALE in the U.S.\n\nWhile the 17-item CETSCALE is the original version developed by Shimp and Sharma (1987), shortened versions have been used. One, with 10 items, was developed alongside the full version.\n\nThis is probably the most frequently used version of the CETSCALE, as a result of its relatively few number of questions (Balabanis et al., 2001; Klein, 2002; Klein et al., 1998; Neese & Hult, 2002; Netemeyer et al., 1991; Vida & Dmitrovic, 2001). Other versions have been used with success, including a version used by Klein (2002) with just four items that was found to have a .96 [[correlation]] with the 10-item version.\n\nThe first major test of the validity of the CETSCALE in countries other than the U.S. was carried out in 1991 (Netemeyer et al., 1991; Wang, 1996). Netemeyer et al. surveyed students in the U.S., France, Japan, and West Germany and compared the results.\n\nBoth the 17-item version and the 10-item version were tested. It was found that both versions of the CETSCALE were reliable across the different cultures where it was tested. The results also helped validate the CETSCALE as a measure of consumer ethnocentricity. Since that time, the CETSCALE has been used in many studies in many different countries and cultures.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ethnic nepotism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Acikdilli |first1=Gaye |last2=Ziemnowicz |first2=Christopher |last3=Bahhouth|first3=Victor |title=Consumer Ethnocentrism in Turkey: Ours are Better than Theirs |journal=Journal of International Consumer Marketing |volume=30 |date=2 November 2017 |doi=10.1080/08961530.2017.1361882|issn=0896-1530 |pages=45\u201357}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Balabanis|first1=George|last2=Diamantopoulos|first2=Adamantios|last3=Mueller|first3=Rene Dentiste|last4=Melewar|first4=T.

In Turkey, [[patriotism]] was found to be the most important motive for consumer ethnocentrism (Acikdilli et al., 2017). This, it was theorized, was due to Turkey's collectivist culture, with patriotism being an important expression of loyalty to the group. In the more individualistic Czech Republic, feelings of [[nationalism]] based on a sense of superiority and dominance appeared to provide the most important contribution to consumer ethnocentrism.\n\n==The CETSCALE==\nShimp and Sharma (1987) developed consumer ethnocentrism into a measurable construct through the use of the consumer ethnocentric tendencies scale (CETSCALE). The initial development of the CETSCALE began with 225 different questions, which were narrowed down to 100 before being sent to a [[Statistical survey|survey]] group for the first [[purification study]]. Through repeated purification studies, the number of questions was finally reduced to 17. Repeated studies by Shimp and Sharma validated the CETSCALE in the U.S.\n\nWhile the 17-item CETSCALE is the original version developed by Shimp and Sharma (1987), shortened versions have been used. One, with 10 items, was developed alongside the full version.\n\nThis is probably the most frequently used version of the CETSCALE, as a result of its relatively few number of questions (Balabanis et al., 2001; Klein, 2002; Klein et al., 1998; Neese & Hult, 2002; Netemeyer et al., 1991; Vida & Dmitrovic, 2001). Other versions have been used with success, including a version used by Klein (2002) with just four items that was found to have a .96 [[correlation]] with the 10-item version.\n\nThe first major test of the validity of the CETSCALE in countries other than the U.S. was carried out in 1991 (Netemeyer et al., 1991; Wang, 1996). Netemeyer et al. surveyed students in the U.S., France, Japan, and West Germany and compared the results.\n\nBoth the 17-item version and the 10-item version were tested. It was found that both versions of the CETSCALE were reliable across the different cultures where it was tested. The results also helped validate the CETSCALE as a measure of consumer ethnocentricity. Since that time, the CETSCALE has been used in many studies in many different countries and cultures.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ethnic nepotism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Acikdilli |first1=Gaye |last2=Ziemnowicz |first2=Christopher |last3=Bahhouth|first3=Victor |title=Consumer Ethnocentrism in Turkey: Ours are Better than Theirs |journal=Journal of International Consumer Marketing |volume=30 |date=2 November 2017 |doi=10.1080/08961530.2017.1361882|issn=0896-1530 |pages=45\u201357}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Balabanis|first1=George|last2=Diamantopoulos|first2=Adamantios|last3=Mueller|first3=Rene Dentiste|last4=Melewar|first4=T.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Leo Seely was a farmer and an employer of the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

One winter day, her car got caught in a snow bank and she was forced to walk home. \"I decided right then and there that I was ready to make a change,\" she recounted on her website.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}}\n\n==Music career==\n===1961\u20131965: Move to California and early songwriting===\nIn 1961, Seely made the decision to move to southern California.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Semple had spent his life in the military and diplomatic service of the Spanish crown.\n\nThe deed of foundation stipulated that the college was for students \"Scottish by birth, preferably those of superior character and virtue and those who promise more fruit in the welfare of souls, and they have to spend whatever time may be necessary in studying Grammar and Philosophy, Theology, Controversies and Sacred Scripture, so that when they are well versed in all of these, they may proceed to the said Kingdom of Scotland to preach the Gospel and convert heretics... when they leave the said seminary for this purpose, others are to be received in their place having the same end, and thus the matter will continue for as long as the aforesaid conversion may require.\"<ref>[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/articles/salamanca.htm Carlin, Denis. \"A Brief History of the College\", Electric Scotland]</ref>\n\nThe [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Jesuit]] [[Hugh Semple]] was procurator of the Scots College when it was located in Madrid.  In 1771, it was transferred to Valladolid.  The college was closed from 1808 to 1816 due to the [[Peninsular War]].\n\nThe College was transferred to Salamanca in 1988 in order for students to attend the [[Pontifical University of Salamanca]].\n\n==Rectors==\n* Rev.

'''RSLIS''', {{lang-da|Det Informationsvidenskabelige Akademi}}) was a school under the [[University of Copenhagen]] that provides higher education in the field of [[library and information science]]. It has now merged with another department to Department of Communication. It is based in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. It is a member of [[list of I-Schools|iSchools]], a consortium directed to understanding the role of [[information]] in nature and human culture. There has also been a location in [[Aalborg]], however this campus was shut down in the summer of 2017.\n\n==History==\nThe school was an independent institution from 1956 to 2013. It was founded in 1956 and replaced the Danish State Library School that had been established in 1918. In 1973, RSLIS set up a library school branch in Aalborg. Up to 1969 RSLIS offered a [[sandwich course]] leading solely to the qualification of public [[librarian]]. Those graduating with the Diploma in public librarianship would take up positions as librarians in [[public library|public libraries]] (Section I). In 1969, RSLIS extended its course offerings to include a specialised diploma programme directed towards national, research and academic libraries (within the framework of Section II). In 1985, the two librarianship programmes were merged into a joint library degree programme. In 1998, the school was granted university status. In 2004 the first PhD thesis in Library and Information Science was defended and in 2006 the first doctoral degree was awarded. In 2010, the institution changed its name from ''Danmarks Biblioteksskole'' to ''Det Informationsvidenskabelige Akademi'' (In English still \"Royal School of Library and Information Science\"). On April 1, 2013, the RSLIS was merged with  the [[University of Copenhagen]]. December 1, 2017 it changed name to Department of Information Studies, and in September 1, 2019 it merged with the  Department of Media, Cognition and Communication into Department of Communication, University of Copenhagen.\n\n==Locations==\nRSLIS is located in [[Copenhagen]], South Campus of University of Comenhagen. There was until the summer of 2017 a satellite department in [[Aalborg]]. In Aalborg, the RSLIS location was in the [[University of Aalborg]] campus area.\n\n==Academic programmes==\nThe school offers an undergraduate Bachelor of Library and Information Science, a so-called ''Librarian IVA'' qualification, a 2-year Master of Library and Information Science (M.L.I.Sc. degree) along with a PhD degree programme. Also offered are a range of specialised courses including a one-year, post-professional ''Master of Library and Information Science'' degree, diploma courses as well as continuing education options including short courses and theme-days.\n\nIn 2008, the contents of the 3-year Bachelor of Library and Information Science course was revised with the focus being placed at knowledge design and knowledge media. Students are offered course units and seminar options covering, among other things, [[media theory|media theories]], forms of knowledge, [[information architecture]], [[information retrieval|information seeking and retrieval]], [[communication]], [[knowledge management]] and [[user behaviour]].\n\nThe two-year Master of Library and Information Science degree programme was also revised in 2008, providing students with new possibilities of taking options covering constituting as well as free modules. The constituting modules are rooted in the school\u2019s six research programmes with the free modules to a greater extent being offered in relation to specific research fields and having the nature of scientific workshop.

The school is responsible for the education of the officers of the four components of the Belgian defence (Army, Air Force, Navy, Medical). The school is located in [[Brussels]] in a building constructed by the architects [[Henri Maquet]] and [[Henri Van Dievoet]]. The courses are given in [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nThere are two [[Faculty (university)|faculties]]\n*The [[Institute of technology|Polytechnics]] faculty: [[Master of science]] in engineering sciences; comparable to the French [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] (also nicknamed \"X\" and founded by one of its ex-students, Jean Chapeli\u00e9)\n*The Social and Military Sciences faculty: Master in Social and Military Sciences\n\nThe Royal Higher Institute for Defence,<ref>http://www.rhid.be</ref> the highest military academic institute in Belgium is also located at the RMA campus (cf. Defence College, previously War College).\n\n==Admission==\nAdmission to the University is only possible through public exams.\n\nFirst, candidates have to pass military test common to all [[Belgian military]] categories (Medical, Endurance and physical tests, and a psychologic evaluation). After passing these, applying students have to compete with each other in public exams. These consist of mathematics and French & Dutch written language tests.\nThe University can only accommodate a certain number of students each year (rough estimate: 150/year) (strongly influenced by the need for officers of the Belgian military). Applying students have to compete with each other for these limited places.\n\n==Bologna==\nSince 2003, the Academy made some changes to its faculties to conform with the [[Bologna Process]].\nBoth degrees are now taught within a 5-year span. After the first three years, students receive a [[Bachelor Degree]]. The [[Master's degree]] can be attained in succeeding the following 2 years.\nBut in contrast to the common Bologna implementation, flexibility in attaining the degrees isn't greatly augmented. Student can only fail for one year within all five. Re-exams are however possible.\nStudent cannot take courses with them to the next year, they have to pass the re-exams. Before 2003 most courses were fixed, however, students had a limited choice between optional courses. \nA lot of flexibility regarding course choices was added by implementing course modules. \nStudents can opt for certain modules which each hold specific and related courses.\nFor example: \n* Law module\n* Psychology module\n* Weapon systems module ([[ballistics]])\n* Management module\n* Marine science module\n* History module\n* Communication & Information Systems module ([[Telecommunication|Telecom]], [[computer security]], electricity).\n\nThe choice of course module is not always free, but is related with the chosen military speciality of the student (Infantry, Logistics, Transmission, Air traffic control, Artillery, Naval Forces,..) and often mandatory.

The school is responsible for the education of the officers of the four components of the Belgian defence (Army, Air Force, Navy, Medical). The school is located in [[Brussels]] in a building constructed by the architects [[Henri Maquet]] and [[Henri Van Dievoet]]. The courses are given in [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nThere are two [[Faculty (university)|faculties]]\n*The [[Institute of technology|Polytechnics]] faculty: [[Master of science]] in engineering sciences; comparable to the French [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique]] (also nicknamed \"X\" and founded by one of its ex-students, Jean Chapeli\u00e9)\n*The Social and Military Sciences faculty: Master in Social and Military Sciences\n\nThe Royal Higher Institute for Defence,<ref>http://www.rhid.be</ref> the highest military academic institute in Belgium is also located at the RMA campus (cf. Defence College, previously War College).\n\n==Admission==\nAdmission to the University is only possible through public exams.\n\nFirst, candidates have to pass military test common to all [[Belgian military]] categories (Medical, Endurance and physical tests, and a psychologic evaluation). After passing these, applying students have to compete with each other in public exams. These consist of mathematics and French & Dutch written language tests.\nThe University can only accommodate a certain number of students each year (rough estimate: 150/year) (strongly influenced by the need for officers of the Belgian military). Applying students have to compete with each other for these limited places.\n\n==Bologna==\nSince 2003, the Academy made some changes to its faculties to conform with the [[Bologna Process]].\nBoth degrees are now taught within a 5-year span. After the first three years, students receive a [[Bachelor Degree]]. The [[Master's degree]] can be attained in succeeding the following 2 years.\nBut in contrast to the common Bologna implementation, flexibility in attaining the degrees isn't greatly augmented. Student can only fail for one year within all five. Re-exams are however possible.\nStudent cannot take courses with them to the next year, they have to pass the re-exams. Before 2003 most courses were fixed, however, students had a limited choice between optional courses. \nA lot of flexibility regarding course choices was added by implementing course modules. \nStudents can opt for certain modules which each hold specific and related courses.\nFor example: \n* Law module\n* Psychology module\n* Weapon systems module ([[ballistics]])\n* Management module\n* Marine science module\n* History module\n* Communication & Information Systems module ([[Telecommunication|Telecom]], [[computer security]], electricity).\n\nThe choice of course module is not always free, but is related with the chosen military speciality of the student (Infantry, Logistics, Transmission, Air traffic control, Artillery, Naval Forces,..) and often mandatory. The majority of the courses remains fixed in the Bachelor years. In the Masters years, the student follow more modules than fixed courses.\n\n==Nationalities==\n[[File:21 juli 2011 Defil\u00e9 Generaal-majoor Harry Vindevogel.png|thumb|Soldiers at the Royal Military Academy on parade on [[Belgian National Day]], 2011.]]\n[[File:BELGICANA ROYAL MS 21JULY.JPG|thumbnail|The parade uniform]]\n\nThe grand majority of the students have the Belgian nationality, but cooperation with other countries has opened up the University to other nationalities. \nA lot of [[Luxembourg Army|Luxemburgish officers]] receive their education in the University and have a long history in it.\n\nMore recently the University received military students from [[Canada]], [[Lebanon]], [[United States]], [[Niger]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Rwanda]], thanks to military cooperation, training and development programs.
