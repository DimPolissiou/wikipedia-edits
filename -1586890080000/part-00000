The increase in the popularity of those styles is a result of the dramatic changes occurring within the Chinese society.\n\nIn 1900\u201301, the [[Righteous Harmony Society|Righteous and Harmonious Fists]] rose against foreign occupiers and Christian missionaries in China. This uprising is known in the West as the [[Boxer Rebellion]] due to the martial arts and calisthenics practiced by the rebels. [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] gained control of the rebellion and tried to use it against the foreign powers. The failure of the rebellion led ten years later to the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the creation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Chinese Republic]].\n\nThe present view of Chinese martial arts are strongly influenced by the events of the [[History of the Republic of China|Republican Period]] (1912\u20131949). In the transition period between the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as well as the turmoil of the Japanese invasion and the Chinese Civil War, Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public as many martial artists were encouraged to openly teach their art. At that time, some considered martial arts as a means to promote national pride and build a strong nation.

Those [[sifu|masters]] started to teach within the [[overseas Chinese]] communities but eventually they expanded their teachings to include people from other ethnic groups.\n\nWithin China, the practice of traditional martial arts was discouraged during the turbulent years of the [[Chinese Cultural Revolution]] (1969\u20131976).<ref name=\"Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan\"/> Like many other aspects of traditional Chinese life, martial arts were subjected to a radical transformation by the [[People's Republic of China]] to align them with [[Maoist]] revolutionary doctrine.<ref name=\"Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan\"/> The [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] promoted the committee-regulated sport of [[Wushu (sport)|Wushu]] as a replacement for independent schools of martial arts. This new competition sport was disassociated from what was seen as the potentially [[subversive]] self-defense aspects and family lineages of Chinese martial arts.<ref name=\"Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan\"/>\n\nIn 1958, the government established the All-China Wushu Association as an umbrella organization to regulate martial arts training. The Chinese State Commission for Physical Culture and Sports took the lead in creating standardized forms for most of the major arts. During this period, a national Wushu system that included standard forms, teaching curriculum, and instructor grading was established. Wushu was introduced at both the high school and university level.

Because of this, wuxia came to flourish in [[British Hong Kong]], and the genre of [[kung fu movie]] in [[Hong Kong action cinema]] became wildly popular, coming to international attention from the 1970s.\nThe genre underwent a drastic decline in the late 1990s as the [[Hong Kong film industry]] was crushed by economic depression.\nIn the wake of ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (2000), there has been somewhat of a revival of Chinese-produced wuxia films aimed at an international audience,  including ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002), ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' (2004) and ''[[Reign of Assassins]]'' (2010).\n\n==Styles==\n{{main|Styles of Chinese martial arts}}\n{{See also|List of Chinese martial arts}}\n[[File:Taichi shanghai bund 2005.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Yang style]] of [[T'ai chi ch'uan|taijiquan]] being practiced on [[the Bund (Shanghai)|the Bund]] in [[Shanghai]]]]\nChina has a long history of martial arts traditions that includes hundreds of different styles. Over the past two thousand years, many distinctive styles have been developed, each with its own set of techniques and ideas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yan|first=Xing|editor=Liu Yamin, Xing Yan|title=Treasure of the Chinese Nation\u2014The Best of Chinese Wushu Shaolin Kung fu|edition=Chinese|date=1995-06-01|publisher=China Books & Periodicals|isbn=7-80024-196-3}}</ref> There are also common themes to the different styles, which are often classified by \"families\" ({{lang|zh|\u5bb6}}; {{transl|zh|''ji\u0101''}}), \"sects\" ({{lang|zh|\u6d3e}}; {{transl|zh|''pai''}}) or \"schools\" ({{lang|zh|\u9580}}; {{transl|zh|''men''}}). There are styles that mimic movements from animals and others that gather inspiration from various [[Chinese philosophies]], myths and legends. Some styles put most of their focus into the harnessing of [[qi]], while others concentrate on competition.\n\nChinese martial arts can be split into various categories to differentiate them: For example, ''external'' ({{lang|zh|\u5916\u5bb6\u62f3}}) and ''[[Internal martial arts|internal]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5185\u5bb6\u62f3}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tianji|first=Li|author2=Du Xilian|title=A Guide to Chinese Martial Arts|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=7-119-01393-9}}</ref> Chinese martial arts can also be categorized by location, as in ''northern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u62f3}}) and ''southern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u62f3}}) as well, referring to what part of China the styles originated from, separated by the [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang); Chinese martial arts may even be classified according to their province or city.<ref name=\"Kennedy\" /> The main perceived difference between northern and southern styles is that the northern styles tend to emphasize fast and powerful kicks, high jumps and generally fluid and rapid movement, while the southern styles focus more on strong arm and hand techniques, and stable, immovable stances and fast footwork. Examples of the northern styles include [[changquan]] and [[xingyiquan]]. Examples of the southern styles include [[Bak Mei]], [[Wuzuquan]], [[Cai li fo|Choy Li Fut]], and [[Wing Chun]]. Chinese martial arts can also be divided according to religion, imitative-styles ({{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62\u62f3}}), and family styles such as [[Hung Gar]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d2a\u5bb6}}). There are distinctive differences in the training between different groups of the Chinese martial arts regardless of the type of classification. However, few experienced martial artists make a clear distinction between internal and external styles, or subscribe to the idea of northern systems being predominantly kick-based and southern systems relying more heavily on upper-body techniques. Most styles contain both hard and soft elements, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner's skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole. If such differences did once exist, they have since been blurred.\n\n==Training==\nChinese martial arts training consists of the following components: basics, forms, applications and weapons; different styles place varying emphasis on each component.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liang|first=Shou-Yu|author2=Wen-Ching Wu|date=2006-04-01|title=Kung Fu Elements|publisher=The Way of the Dragon Publishing|isbn=1-889659-32-0}}</ref> In addition, philosophy, ethics and even medical practice<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmieg|first=Anthony L.|date=December 2004|title=Watching Your Back: Chinese Martial Arts and Traditional Medicine|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-2823-2}}</ref> are highly regarded by most Chinese martial arts.

Basic training may involve simple movements that are performed repeatedly; other examples of basic training are stretching, meditation, [[Strike (attack)|striking]], [[throw (grappling)|throwing]], or jumping.

Today, many styles begin to teach new students by focusing on exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, in order to allow its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to the most important aspect of application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.\n\nCompetitive sparring disciplines include Chinese [[kickboxing]] [[Sanshou|S\u01censh\u01d2u]] ({{lang|zh|\u6563\u624b}}) and Chinese [[folk wrestling]] [[Shuai jiao|Shu\u0101iji\u0101o]] ({{lang|zh|\u6454\u8de4}}), which were traditionally contested on a raised platform arena [[Lei tai|L\u00e8it\u00e1i]] ({{lang|zh|\u64c2\u53f0}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hui|first=Mizhou|date=July 1996|title=San Shou Kung Fu Of The Chinese Red Army: Practical Skills And Theory Of Unarmed Combat|publisher=Paladin Press|isbn=0-87364-884-6}}</ref> L\u00e8it\u00e1i represents public challenge matches that first appeared in the [[Song Dynasty]].

Forms were originally intended to preserve the lineage of a particular style branch, and were often taught to advanced students selected for that purpose. Forms contained both literal, representative and exercise-oriented forms of applicable techniques that students could extract, test, and train in through [[sparring]] sessions.<ref name=\"Bolelli\">{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|date=2003-02-20|title=On the Warrior's Path: Philosophy, Fighting, and Martial Arts Mythology|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=1-58394-066-9}}</ref>\n\nToday, many consider ''taolu'' to be one of the most important practices in Chinese martial arts. Traditionally, they played a smaller role in training for combat application, and took a back seat to sparring, drilling, and conditioning. Forms gradually build up a practitioner's flexibility, internal and external strength, speed and stamina, and they teach balance and coordination. Many styles contain forms that use weapons of various lengths and types, using one or two hands. Some styles focus on a certain type of weapon. Forms are meant to be both practical, usable, and applicable as well as to promote fluid motion, meditation, flexibility, balance, and coordination. Teachers are often heard to say \"train your form as if you were sparring and spar as if it were a form.\"\n\nThere are two general types of ''taolu'' in Chinese martial arts. Most common are ''solo forms'' performed by a single student. There are also ''sparring'' forms \u2014 choreographed fighting sets performed by two or more people. Sparring forms were designed both to acquaint beginning fighters with basic measures and concepts of combat, and to serve as performance pieces for the school. Weapons-based sparring forms are especially useful for teaching students the extension, range, and technique required to manage a weapon.\n\n====Forms in Traditional Chinese Martial Arts====\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe term ''taolu (\u5957\u8def)'' is a shortened version of ''Tao Lu Yun Dong (\u5957\u8def\u904b\u52d5)'', an expression introduced only recently with the popularity of modern wushu. This expression refers to \"exercise sets\" and used in the context of athletics or sport.\n\nIn contrast, in traditional Chinese martial arts alternative terminologies for the training (\u7df4) of 'sets or forms ''are:''\n\n* lian quan tao (\u7df4\u62f3\u5957) \u2013 practicing a sequence of fists.\n* lian quan jiao (\u7df4\u62f3\u8173) \u2013 practicing fists and feet.\n* lian bing qi (\u7df4\u5175\u5668) \u2013 practicing weapons.\n* dui da (\u5c0d\u6253) and dui lian (\u5c0d\u7df4) \u2013 fighting sets.\n\nTraditional \"sparring\" sets, called ''dui da'' (\u5c0d\u6253) or ''dui lian'' (\u5c0d\u7df4), were an essential part of Chinese martial arts for centuries. ''Dui lian'' means, to train by a pair of combatants opposing each other\u2014the character ''lian'' (\u7df4), referes to practice; to train; to perfect one's skill; to drill. As well, often one of these terms are also included in the name of fighting sets (\u96d9\u6f14; ''shuang yan''), \"paired practice\" (\u6399\u52dd; ''zheng sheng''), \"to struggle with strength for victory\" (\u6575; ''di''), match \u2013 the character suggests to strike an enemy; and \"to break\" (\u7834; ''po'').\n\nGenerally, there are 21, 18, 12, 9 or 5 drills or 'exchanges/groupings' of attacks and counterattacks, in each ''dui lian'' set. These drills were considered only generic patterns and never meant to be considered inflexible 'tricks'. Students practiced smaller parts/exchanges, individually with opponents switching sides in a continuous flow. Dui ''lian'' were not only sophisticated and effective methods of passing on the fighting knowledge of the older generation, but they were also essential and effective training methods. The relationship between single sets and contact sets is complicated, in that some skills cannot be developed with solo 'sets', and, conversely, with ''dui lian''. Unfortunately, it appears that most traditional combat oriented ''dui lian'' and their training methodology have disappeared, especially those concerning weapons. There are several reasons for this. In modern Chinese martial arts, most of the ''dui lian'' are recent inventions designed for light props resembling weapons, with safety and drama in mind. The role of this kind of training has degenerated to the point of being useless in a practical sense, and, at best, is just performance.\n\nBy the early Song period, sets were not so much \"individual isolated technique strung together\" but rather were composed of techniques and counter technique groupings. It is quite clear that \"sets\" and \"fighting (two-person) sets\" have been instrumental in TCM for many hundreds of years\u2014even before the Song Dynasty. There are images of two-person weapon training in Chinese stone painting going back at least to the Eastern Han Dynasty.\n\nAccording to what has been passed on by the older generations, the approximate ratio of contact sets to single sets was approximately 1:3. In other words, about 30% of the 'sets' practiced at Shaolin were contact sets, ''dui lian'', and two-person drill training. This ratio is, in part, evidenced by the Qing Dynasty mural at Shaolin.\n\nFor most of its history, Shaolin martial arts was mostly weapon-focused: staves were used to defend the monastery, not bare hands. Even the more recent military exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing Dynasties involved weapons. According to some traditions, monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting so that they could protect the monastery. Although wrestling has been as sport in China for centuries, weapons have been the essential part of Chinese wushu since ancient times. If one wants to talk about recent or 'modern' developments in Chinese martial arts (including Shaolin for that matter), it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting. During the Northern Song Dynasty (976- 997 A.D) when platform fighting is known as ''Da Laitai'' (Title Fights Challenge on Platform) first appeared, these fights were with only swords and staves. Although later, when bare hand fights appeared as well, it was the weapons events that became the most famous. These open-ring competitions had regulations and organized by government organizations; the public also organized some. The government competitions, held in the capital and prefectures, resulted in appointments for winners, to military posts.\n\n====Practice forms vs. kung fu in combat====\nEven though forms in Chinese martial arts are intended to depict realistic martial techniques, the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat. Many forms have been elaborated upon, on the one hand to provide better combat preparedness, and on the other hand to look more aesthetically pleasing. One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher, stretching kicks. These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are used in forms for exercise purposes.<ref>{{cite book|last= Kane|first=Lawrence A. |year=2005|title=The Way of Kata |publisher=YMAA Publication Center |pages=56|isbn= 1-59439-058-4}}</ref> Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch, thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions.{{refn|Pages 118\u2013119<ref name=\"Bolelli\" />|group=\"note\"}} This has led to criticisms by traditionalists of the endorsement of the more acrobatic, show-oriented Wushu competition.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Johnson |author2=Sue Feng  |title=Inner Peace?

Documentation in ancient literature during the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) and the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279) suggests some sets, (including two + person sets: ''dui da'' also called ''dui lian'') became very elaborate and 'flowery', many mainly concerned with aesthetics. During this time, some martial arts systems devolved to the point that they became popular forms of martial art storytelling entertainment shows. This created an entire category of martial arts known as ''Hua Fa Wuyi''. During the Northern Song period, it was noted by historians this type of training had a negative influence on training in the military.\n\nMany traditional Chinese martial artists, as well as practitioners of modern sport combat, have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the art than sparring and drill application, while most continue to see traditional forms practice within the traditional context\u2014as vital to both proper combat execution, the Shaolin aesthetic as art form, as well as upholding the meditative function of the physical art form.<ref>{{cite news |first=Geoffrey |last=Fowler |author2=Juliet Ye |title=Kung Fu Monks Don't Get a Kick Out of Fighting |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119758024054227513?mod=Sports |publisher= Wall Street Journal |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nAnother reason why techniques often appear different in forms when contrasted with sparring application is thought by some to come from the concealment of the actual functions of the techniques from outsiders.<ref>{{cite book|last= Seabrook|first=Jamie A. |year=2003 |title=Martial Arts Revealed |publisher=iUniverse | pages=20 |isbn= 0-595-28247-4}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}}\n\nForms practice is mostly known for teaching combat techniques yet when  practicing forms, the practitioner focuses on posture, breathing, and performing the techniques of both right and left sides of the body also develop both hemispheres of the brain and contributes to improved motor skills, forms practice also trains the muscles to execute many complex techniques of the art (muscle memory) and can improve balance, flexibility, and the cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904100024/http://www.chinastrategies.com/hiddenforms.htm|title=Three hidden meanings of Chinese forms|last=Verstappe|first=Stefan|date=2014-09-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Wushu==\n[[File:Gun2 10 all china games.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Modern forms are used in the sport of [[wushu (sport)|wushu]], as seen in this staff routine]]\n{{see also|Wushu (sport)}}\nThe word ''wu'' ({{lang|zh|\u6b66}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4}}'') means \u2018martial\u2019.

This implies that \u201cwu\u2019 \u6b66,\u201d is a defensive use of combat.{{Dubious|reason=spelling does not reliably indicate meaning|date=April 2017}} The term \u201cwushu \u6b66\u8853\u201d meaning 'martial arts' goes back as far as the [[Liang Dynasty]] (502-557) in an anthology compiled by Xiao Tong ({{lang|zh|\u856d\u901a}}), (Prince Zhaoming; {{lang|zh|\u662d\u660e\u592a\u5b50}} d. 531), called ''Selected Literature'' ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u9078}}; ''{{transl|zh|W\u00e9nxu\u01cen}}''). The term is found in the second verse of a poem by Yan Yanzhi titled: \u7687\u592a\u5b50\u91cb\u5960\u6703\u4f5c\u8a69 \"Huang Taizi Shidian Hui Zuoshi\".\n\n<blockquote>\"The great man grows the many myriad things . . .\nBreaking away from the military arts,\nHe promotes fully the cultural mandates.\"</blockquote>\n: (Translation from: ''Echoes of the Past'' by Yan Yanzhi (384\u2013456))\n\nThe term ''wushu'' is also found in a poem by Cheng Shao (1626\u20131644) from the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe earliest term for 'martial arts' can be found in the Han History (206BC-23AD) was \"military fighting techniques\" ({{lang|zh|\u5175\u6280\u5de7}}; ''{{transl|zh|b\u012bng j\u00ecqi\u01ceo}}''). During the Song period (c.960) the name changed to \"martial arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u827a}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4y\u00ec}}''). In 1928 the name was changed to \"national arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u56fd\u672f}}; ''{{transl|zh|gu\u00f3sh\u00f9}}'') when the [[Central Guoshu Institute|National Martial Arts Academy]] was established in Nanjing. The term reverted to ''w\u01d4sh\u00f9'' under the People's Republic of China during the early 1950s.\n\nAs forms have grown in complexity and quantity over the years, and many forms alone could be practiced for a lifetime, modern styles of Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms, and do not practice application at all. These styles are primarily aimed at exhibition and competition, and often include more acrobatic jumps and movements added for enhanced visual effect<ref>{{cite book|last=Shoude|first=Xie|year=1999|title=International Wushu Competition Routines|publisher=Hai Feng Publishing Co., Ltd.|isbn=962-238-153-7}}</ref> compared to the traditional styles.

It is a hybrid style of martial art that Bruce Lee practiced and mastered. ''Jeet Kune Do'' is his very own unique style of martial art that uses little to minimum movement but maximizes the effect to his opponents. The influence of Chinese martial art have been widely recognized and have a global appeal in Western cinemas starting off with Bruce Lee.\n\nMartial artists and actors such as [[Jet Li]] and [[Jackie Chan]] have continued the appeal of movies of this genre. Jackie Chan successfully brought in a sense of humour in his fighting style in his movies. Martial arts films from China are often referred to as \"kung fu movies\" ({{lang|zh|\u529f\u592b\u7247}}), or \"wire-fu\" if extensive wire work is performed for special effects, and are still best known as part of the tradition of kung fu theater. (see also: wuxia, [[Hong Kong action cinema]]). The talent of these individuals have broadened Hong Kong's cinematography production and rose to popularity overseas, influencing Western cinemas.\n\nIn the west, kung fu has become a regular action staple, and makes appearances in many films that would not generally be considered \"Martial Arts\" films. These films include but are not limited to [[The Matrix Trilogy]], ''[[Kill Bill]]'', and ''[[The Transporter]]''.\n\nMartial arts themes can also be found on television networks.  A [[United States|U.S.]] network [[TV western]] [[television series|series]] of the early 1970s called ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' also served to popularize the Chinese martial arts on television. With 60 episodes over a three-year span, it was one of the first North American TV shows that tried to convey the philosophy and practice in Chinese martial arts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pilato|first=Herbie J.|date=1993-05-15|title=Kung Fu Book of Caine|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|edition=1st|isbn=0-8048-1826-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Carradine|first=David|date=1993-01-15|title=Spirit of Shaolin|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=0-8048-1828-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spiritofshaolin0000carr}}</ref> The use of Chinese martial arts techniques can now be found in most TV action series, although the philosophy of Chinese martial arts is seldom portrayed in depth.\n\n=== Influence on Hip Hop ===\n\nIn the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for his martial arts movies. The fact that he was a non-white male who portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated with black audiences and made him an important figure in this community.<ref>Phil Hoad,\n [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/18/bruce-lee-films-black-audiences \"Why Bruce Lee and kung fu films hit home with black audiences\"], ''The Guardian''</ref> Around 1973, Kung Fu movies became a hit in America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the films\u2019 popularity well after the general public lost interest. Urban youth in New York City were still going from every borough to Time Square every night to watch the latest movies.<ref>Wisdom B, [http://throwbackmag.com/site/know-your-hip-hop-history-the-b-boy/ \"Know Your Hip-Hop History: The B-Boy\"], ''Throwback Magazine''</ref>  Amongst these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where, during this time, hip-hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was [[DJ Kool Herc]], who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or [[breakdancing]], a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and \u201cup rocking\u201d (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights.<ref name=\"jetli.com\">Chris Friedman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180227094121/https://www.jetli.com/2017/10/kung-fu-break-dancing-hip-hop \"Kung Fu Influences Aspects of Hip Hop Culture Like Break Dancing\"]</ref> The dancers\u2019 ability to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills and musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group [[Rock Steady Crew]], described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, \u201cwhere the one kung fu master says something along the lines of \u2018hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,\u2019 then a fight erupts.\u201d <ref name=\"jetli.com\"/>\n\nHip hop group [[Wu Tang Clan]] were prominently influenced by kung fu cinema.  The name \"Wu Tang\" itself is a reference to the 1983 film ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]''.  Subsequent albums by the group (especially their debut album [[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]) are rich with references to kung fu films of the 1970s and 1980s, which group members grew up watching.  Several group members ([[Ghostface Killah]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], [[Method Man]], and [[Masta Killa]]) had also taken their stage names from kung fu cinema.  Several music videos, promotional photos, etc. feature group members posing or engaging with kung fu regalia and action sequences.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|Martial arts}}\n* [[Eighteen Arms of Wushu]]\n* [[Hard and soft (martial arts)]]\n* [[Kung fu (disambiguation)]]\n* [[List of Chinese martial arts]]\n* [[Wushu (sport)]]\n* [[Kwoon]]\n* [[Weapons and armor in Chinese mythology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{Kung fu schools}}\n{{China topics|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Martial arts}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Martial Arts}}\n[[Category:Chinese martial arts| ]]\n\n[[ml:\u0d15\u0d19\u0d4d \u0d2b\u0d41]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Kung fu|other uses|Kung fu (disambiguation)}}\n\n{{Short description|Category of martial arts}}{{Infobox Chinese\n|s=\u6b66\u672f\n|t=\u6b66\u8853\n|l=\"martial technique\"\n|p=w\u01d4sh\u00f9\n|mi={{IPAc-cmn|wu|3|.|sh|u|4}}\n|j=mou5 seot6\n}}\n[[File:A monk practicing kung fu in the bamboo forest inside the Shaolin Temple.jpg|thumb|A monk practicing kung fu in the bamboo forest inside the Shaolin Temple]]\n'''Chinese martial arts''', often named under the [[umbrella term]]s '''[[Kung fu (term)|kung fu]]''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u028a|\u014b|_|\u02c8|f|u\u02d0}}; {{zh|c=[[wiktionary:\u529f\u592b|\u529f\u592b]]|p=g\u014dngfu|cy=g\u016bng f\u016b}}), '''[[kuoshu]]''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u8853|labels=no|p=gu\u00f3sh\u00f9}}) or '''wushu''' ({{zh|c=\u6b66\u8853|labels=no|p=w\u01d4sh\u00f9}}), are [[Styles of Chinese martial arts|several hundred fighting styles]] that have developed over the centuries in [[China]].

The failure of the rebellion led ten years later to the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the creation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Chinese Republic]].\n\nThe present view of Chinese martial arts are strongly influenced by the events of the [[History of the Republic of China|Republican Period]] (1912\u20131949). In the transition period between the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] as well as the turmoil of the Japanese invasion and the Chinese Civil War, Chinese martial arts became more accessible to the general public as many martial artists were encouraged to openly teach their art.

Over the past two thousand years, many distinctive styles have been developed, each with its own set of techniques and ideas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yan|first=Xing|editor=Liu Yamin, Xing Yan|title=Treasure of the Chinese Nation\u2014The Best of Chinese Wushu Shaolin Kung fu|edition=Chinese|date=1995-06-01|publisher=China Books & Periodicals|isbn=7-80024-196-3}}</ref> There are also common themes to the different styles, which are often classified by \"families\" ({{lang|zh|\u5bb6}}; {{transl|zh|''ji\u0101''}}), \"sects\" ({{lang|zh|\u6d3e}}; {{transl|zh|''pai''}}) or \"schools\" ({{lang|zh|\u9580}}; {{transl|zh|''men''}}). There are styles that mimic movements from animals and others that gather inspiration from various [[Chinese philosophies]], myths and legends. Some styles put most of their focus into the harnessing of [[qi]], while others concentrate on competition.\n\nChinese martial arts can be split into various categories to differentiate them: For example, ''external'' ({{lang|zh|\u5916\u5bb6\u62f3}}) and ''[[Internal martial arts|internal]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u5185\u5bb6\u62f3}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Tianji|first=Li|author2=Du Xilian|title=A Guide to Chinese Martial Arts|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Foreign Languages Press|isbn=7-119-01393-9}}</ref> Chinese martial arts can also be categorized by location, as in ''northern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u62f3}}) and ''southern'' ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u62f3}}) as well, referring to what part of China the styles originated from, separated by the [[Yangtze River]] (Chang Jiang); Chinese martial arts may even be classified according to their province or city.<ref name=\"Kennedy\" /> The main perceived difference between northern and southern styles is that the northern styles tend to emphasize fast and powerful kicks, high jumps and generally fluid and rapid movement, while the southern styles focus more on strong arm and hand techniques, and stable, immovable stances and fast footwork. Examples of the northern styles include [[changquan]] and [[xingyiquan]]. Examples of the southern styles include [[Bak Mei]], [[Wuzuquan]], [[Cai li fo|Choy Li Fut]], and [[Wing Chun]]. Chinese martial arts can also be divided according to religion, imitative-styles ({{lang|zh|\u8c61\u5f62\u62f3}}), and family styles such as [[Hung Gar]] ({{lang|zh|\u6d2a\u5bb6}}). There are distinctive differences in the training between different groups of the Chinese martial arts regardless of the type of classification. However, few experienced martial artists make a clear distinction between internal and external styles, or subscribe to the idea of northern systems being predominantly kick-based and southern systems relying more heavily on upper-body techniques. Most styles contain both hard and soft elements, regardless of their internal nomenclature. Analyzing the difference in accordance with yin and yang principles, philosophers would assert that the absence of either one would render the practitioner's skills unbalanced or deficient, as yin and yang alone are each only half of a whole. If such differences did once exist, they have since been blurred.\n\n==Training==\nChinese martial arts training consists of the following components: basics, forms, applications and weapons; different styles place varying emphasis on each component.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liang|first=Shou-Yu|author2=Wen-Ching Wu|date=2006-04-01|title=Kung Fu Elements|publisher=The Way of the Dragon Publishing|isbn=1-889659-32-0}}</ref> In addition, philosophy, ethics and even medical practice<ref>{{cite book|last=Schmieg|first=Anthony L.|date=December 2004|title=Watching Your Back: Chinese Martial Arts and Traditional Medicine|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-2823-2}}</ref> are highly regarded by most Chinese martial arts.

Basic training may involve simple movements that are performed repeatedly; other examples of basic training are stretching, meditation, [[Strike (attack)|striking]], [[throw (grappling)|throwing]], or jumping.

Today, many styles begin to teach new students by focusing on exercises in which each student knows a prescribed range of combat and technique to drill on. These drills are often semi-compliant, meaning one student does not offer active resistance to a technique, in order to allow its demonstrative, clean execution. In more resisting drills, fewer rules apply, and students practice how to react and respond. 'Sparring' refers to the most important aspect of application training, which simulates a combat situation while including rules that reduce the chance of serious injury.\n\nCompetitive sparring disciplines include Chinese [[kickboxing]] [[Sanshou|S\u01censh\u01d2u]] ({{lang|zh|\u6563\u624b}}) and Chinese [[folk wrestling]] [[Shuai jiao|Shu\u0101iji\u0101o]] ({{lang|zh|\u6454\u8de4}}), which were traditionally contested on a raised platform arena [[Lei tai|L\u00e8it\u00e1i]] ({{lang|zh|\u64c2\u53f0}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hui|first=Mizhou|date=July 1996|title=San Shou Kung Fu Of The Chinese Red Army: Practical Skills And Theory Of Unarmed Combat|publisher=Paladin Press|isbn=0-87364-884-6}}</ref> L\u00e8it\u00e1i represents public challenge matches that first appeared in the [[Song Dynasty]].

Forms were originally intended to preserve the lineage of a particular style branch, and were often taught to advanced students selected for that purpose. Forms contained both literal, representative and exercise-oriented forms of applicable techniques that students could extract, test, and train in through [[sparring]] sessions.<ref name=\"Bolelli\">{{cite book|last=Bolelli|first=Daniele|date=2003-02-20|title=On the Warrior's Path: Philosophy, Fighting, and Martial Arts Mythology|publisher=Frog Books|isbn=1-58394-066-9}}</ref>\n\nToday, many consider ''taolu'' to be one of the most important practices in Chinese martial arts. Traditionally, they played a smaller role in training for combat application, and took a back seat to sparring, drilling, and conditioning. Forms gradually build up a practitioner's flexibility, internal and external strength, speed and stamina, and they teach balance and coordination. Many styles contain forms that use weapons of various lengths and types, using one or two hands. Some styles focus on a certain type of weapon. Forms are meant to be both practical, usable, and applicable as well as to promote fluid motion, meditation, flexibility, balance, and coordination. Teachers are often heard to say \"train your form as if you were sparring and spar as if it were a form.\"\n\nThere are two general types of ''taolu'' in Chinese martial arts. Most common are ''solo forms'' performed by a single student. There are also ''sparring'' forms \u2014 choreographed fighting sets performed by two or more people. Sparring forms were designed both to acquaint beginning fighters with basic measures and concepts of combat, and to serve as performance pieces for the school. Weapons-based sparring forms are especially useful for teaching students the extension, range, and technique required to manage a weapon.\n\n====Forms in Traditional Chinese Martial Arts====\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe term ''taolu (\u5957\u8def)'' is a shortened version of ''Tao Lu Yun Dong (\u5957\u8def\u904b\u52d5)'', an expression introduced only recently with the popularity of modern wushu. This expression refers to \"exercise sets\" and used in the context of athletics or sport.\n\nIn contrast, in traditional Chinese martial arts alternative terminologies for the training (\u7df4) of 'sets or forms ''are:''\n\n* lian quan tao (\u7df4\u62f3\u5957) \u2013 practicing a sequence of fists.\n* lian quan jiao (\u7df4\u62f3\u8173) \u2013 practicing fists and feet.\n* lian bing qi (\u7df4\u5175\u5668) \u2013 practicing weapons.\n* dui da (\u5c0d\u6253) and dui lian (\u5c0d\u7df4) \u2013 fighting sets.\n\nTraditional \"sparring\" sets, called ''dui da'' (\u5c0d\u6253) or ''dui lian'' (\u5c0d\u7df4), were an essential part of Chinese martial arts for centuries. ''Dui lian'' means, to train by a pair of combatants opposing each other\u2014the character ''lian'' (\u7df4), referes to practice; to train; to perfect one's skill; to drill. As well, often one of these terms are also included in the name of fighting sets (\u96d9\u6f14; ''shuang yan''), \"paired practice\" (\u6399\u52dd; ''zheng sheng''), \"to struggle with strength for victory\" (\u6575; ''di''), match \u2013 the character suggests to strike an enemy; and \"to break\" (\u7834; ''po'').\n\nGenerally, there are 21, 18, 12, 9 or 5 drills or 'exchanges/groupings' of attacks and counterattacks, in each ''dui lian'' set. These drills were considered only generic patterns and never meant to be considered inflexible 'tricks'. Students practiced smaller parts/exchanges, individually with opponents switching sides in a continuous flow. Dui ''lian'' were not only sophisticated and effective methods of passing on the fighting knowledge of the older generation, but they were also essential and effective training methods. The relationship between single sets and contact sets is complicated, in that some skills cannot be developed with solo 'sets', and, conversely, with ''dui lian''. Unfortunately, it appears that most traditional combat oriented ''dui lian'' and their training methodology have disappeared, especially those concerning weapons. There are several reasons for this. In modern Chinese martial arts, most of the ''dui lian'' are recent inventions designed for light props resembling weapons, with safety and drama in mind. The role of this kind of training has degenerated to the point of being useless in a practical sense, and, at best, is just performance.\n\nBy the early Song period, sets were not so much \"individual isolated technique strung together\" but rather were composed of techniques and counter technique groupings. It is quite clear that \"sets\" and \"fighting (two-person) sets\" have been instrumental in TCM for many hundreds of years\u2014even before the Song Dynasty. There are images of two-person weapon training in Chinese stone painting going back at least to the Eastern Han Dynasty.\n\nAccording to what has been passed on by the older generations, the approximate ratio of contact sets to single sets was approximately 1:3. In other words, about 30% of the 'sets' practiced at Shaolin were contact sets, ''dui lian'', and two-person drill training. This ratio is, in part, evidenced by the Qing Dynasty mural at Shaolin.\n\nFor most of its history, Shaolin martial arts was mostly weapon-focused: staves were used to defend the monastery, not bare hands. Even the more recent military exploits of Shaolin during the Ming and Qing Dynasties involved weapons. According to some traditions, monks first studied basics for one year and were then taught staff fighting so that they could protect the monastery. Although wrestling has been as sport in China for centuries, weapons have been the essential part of Chinese wushu since ancient times. If one wants to talk about recent or 'modern' developments in Chinese martial arts (including Shaolin for that matter), it is the over-emphasis on bare hand fighting. During the Northern Song Dynasty (976- 997 A.D) when platform fighting is known as ''Da Laitai'' (Title Fights Challenge on Platform) first appeared, these fights were with only swords and staves. Although later, when bare hand fights appeared as well, it was the weapons events that became the most famous. These open-ring competitions had regulations and organized by government organizations; the public also organized some. The government competitions, held in the capital and prefectures, resulted in appointments for winners, to military posts.\n\n====Practice forms vs. kung fu in combat====\nEven though forms in Chinese martial arts are intended to depict realistic martial techniques, the movements are not always identical to how techniques would be applied in combat. Many forms have been elaborated upon, on the one hand to provide better combat preparedness, and on the other hand to look more aesthetically pleasing. One manifestation of this tendency toward elaboration beyond combat application is the use of lower stances and higher, stretching kicks. These two maneuvers are unrealistic in combat and are used in forms for exercise purposes.<ref>{{cite book|last= Kane|first=Lawrence A. |year=2005|title=The Way of Kata |publisher=YMAA Publication Center |pages=56|isbn= 1-59439-058-4}}</ref> Many modern schools have replaced practical defense or offense movements with acrobatic feats that are more spectacular to watch, thereby gaining favor during exhibitions and competitions.{{refn|Pages 118\u2013119<ref name=\"Bolelli\" />|group=\"note\"}} This has led to criticisms by traditionalists of the endorsement of the more acrobatic, show-oriented Wushu competition.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ian |last=Johnson |author2=Sue Feng  |title=Inner Peace?

Documentation in ancient literature during the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) and the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] (960\u20131279) suggests some sets, (including two + person sets: ''dui da'' also called ''dui lian'') became very elaborate and 'flowery', many mainly concerned with aesthetics. During this time, some martial arts systems devolved to the point that they became popular forms of martial art storytelling entertainment shows. This created an entire category of martial arts known as ''Hua Fa Wuyi''. During the Northern Song period, it was noted by historians this type of training had a negative influence on training in the military.\n\nMany traditional Chinese martial artists, as well as practitioners of modern sport combat, have become critical of the perception that forms work is more relevant to the art than sparring and drill application, while most continue to see traditional forms practice within the traditional context\u2014as vital to both proper combat execution, the Shaolin aesthetic as art form, as well as upholding the meditative function of the physical art form.<ref>{{cite news |first=Geoffrey |last=Fowler |author2=Juliet Ye |title=Kung Fu Monks Don't Get a Kick Out of Fighting |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119758024054227513?mod=Sports |publisher= Wall Street Journal |date=December 14, 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nAnother reason why techniques often appear different in forms when contrasted with sparring application is thought by some to come from the concealment of the actual functions of the techniques from outsiders.<ref>{{cite book|last= Seabrook|first=Jamie A. |year=2003 |title=Martial Arts Revealed |publisher=iUniverse | pages=20 |isbn= 0-595-28247-4}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}}\n\nForms practice is mostly known for teaching combat techniques yet when  practicing forms, the practitioner focuses on posture, breathing, and performing the techniques of both right and left sides of the body also develop both hemispheres of the brain and contributes to improved motor skills, forms practice also trains the muscles to execute many complex techniques of the art (muscle memory) and can improve balance, flexibility, and the cardiovascular system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904100024/http://www.chinastrategies.com/hiddenforms.htm|title=Three hidden meanings of Chinese forms|last=Verstappe|first=Stefan|date=2014-09-04|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\n==Wushu==\n[[File:Gun2 10 all china games.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Modern forms are used in the sport of [[wushu (sport)|wushu]], as seen in this staff routine]]\n{{see also|Wushu (sport)}}\nThe word ''wu'' ({{lang|zh|\u6b66}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4}}'') means \u2018martial\u2019.

This implies that \u201cwu\u2019 \u6b66,\u201d is a defensive use of combat.{{Dubious|reason=spelling does not reliably indicate meaning|date=April 2017}} The term \u201cwushu \u6b66\u8853\u201d meaning 'martial arts' goes back as far as the [[Liang Dynasty]] (502-557) in an anthology compiled by Xiao Tong ({{lang|zh|\u856d\u901a}}), (Prince Zhaoming; {{lang|zh|\u662d\u660e\u592a\u5b50}} d. 531), called ''Selected Literature'' ({{lang|zh|\u6587\u9078}}; ''{{transl|zh|W\u00e9nxu\u01cen}}''). The term is found in the second verse of a poem by Yan Yanzhi titled: \u7687\u592a\u5b50\u91cb\u5960\u6703\u4f5c\u8a69 \"Huang Taizi Shidian Hui Zuoshi\".\n\n<blockquote>\"The great man grows the many myriad things . . .\nBreaking away from the military arts,\nHe promotes fully the cultural mandates.\"</blockquote>\n: (Translation from: ''Echoes of the Past'' by Yan Yanzhi (384\u2013456))\n\nThe term ''wushu'' is also found in a poem by Cheng Shao (1626\u20131644) from the Ming Dynasty.\n\nThe earliest term for 'martial arts' can be found in the Han History (206BC-23AD) was \"military fighting techniques\" ({{lang|zh|\u5175\u6280\u5de7}}; ''{{transl|zh|b\u012bng j\u00ecqi\u01ceo}}''). During the Song period (c.960) the name changed to \"martial arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u6b66\u827a}}; ''{{transl|zh|w\u01d4y\u00ec}}''). In 1928 the name was changed to \"national arts\" ({{lang|zh|\u56fd\u672f}}; ''{{transl|zh|gu\u00f3sh\u00f9}}'') when the [[Central Guoshu Institute|National Martial Arts Academy]] was established in Nanjing. The term reverted to ''w\u01d4sh\u00f9'' under the People's Republic of China during the early 1950s.\n\nAs forms have grown in complexity and quantity over the years, and many forms alone could be practiced for a lifetime, modern styles of Chinese martial arts have developed that concentrate solely on forms, and do not practice application at all. These styles are primarily aimed at exhibition and competition, and often include more acrobatic jumps and movements added for enhanced visual effect<ref>{{cite book|last=Shoude|first=Xie|year=1999|title=International Wushu Competition Routines|publisher=Hai Feng Publishing Co., Ltd.|isbn=962-238-153-7}}</ref> compared to the traditional styles.

It is a hybrid style of martial art that Bruce Lee practiced and mastered. ''Jeet Kune Do'' is his very own unique style of martial art that uses little to minimum movement but maximizes the effect to his opponents. The influence of Chinese martial art have been widely recognized and have a global appeal in Western cinemas starting off with Bruce Lee.\n\nMartial artists and actors such as [[Jet Li]] and [[Jackie Chan]] have continued the appeal of movies of this genre. Jackie Chan successfully brought in a sense of humour in his fighting style in his movies. Martial arts films from China are often referred to as \"kung fu movies\" ({{lang|zh|\u529f\u592b\u7247}}), or \"wire-fu\" if extensive wire work is performed for special effects, and are still best known as part of the tradition of kung fu theater. (see also: wuxia, [[Hong Kong action cinema]]). The talent of these individuals have broadened Hong Kong's cinematography production and rose to popularity overseas, influencing Western cinemas.\n\nIn the west, kung fu has become a regular action staple, and makes appearances in many films that would not generally be considered \"Martial Arts\" films. These films include but are not limited to [[The Matrix Trilogy]], ''[[Kill Bill]]'', and ''[[The Transporter]]''.\n\nMartial arts themes can also be found on television networks.  A [[United States|U.S.]] network [[TV western]] [[television series|series]] of the early 1970s called ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]'' also served to popularize the Chinese martial arts on television. With 60 episodes over a three-year span, it was one of the first North American TV shows that tried to convey the philosophy and practice in Chinese martial arts.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pilato|first=Herbie J.|date=1993-05-15|title=Kung Fu Book of Caine|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|edition=1st|isbn=0-8048-1826-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Carradine|first=David|date=1993-01-15|title=Spirit of Shaolin|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=0-8048-1828-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/spiritofshaolin0000carr}}</ref> The use of Chinese martial arts techniques can now be found in most TV action series, although the philosophy of Chinese martial arts is seldom portrayed in depth.\n\n=== Influence on Hip Hop ===\n\nIn the 1970s, Bruce Lee was beginning to gain popularity in Hollywood for his martial arts movies. The fact that he was a non-white male who portrayed self-reliance and righteous self-discipline resonated with black audiences and made him an important figure in this community.<ref>Phil Hoad,\n [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/jul/18/bruce-lee-films-black-audiences \"Why Bruce Lee and kung fu films hit home with black audiences\"], ''The Guardian''</ref> Around 1973, Kung Fu movies became a hit in America across all backgrounds; however, black audiences maintained the films\u2019 popularity well after the general public lost interest. Urban youth in New York City were still going from every borough to Time Square every night to watch the latest movies.<ref>Wisdom B, [http://throwbackmag.com/site/know-your-hip-hop-history-the-b-boy/ \"Know Your Hip-Hop History: The B-Boy\"], ''Throwback Magazine''</ref>  Amongst these individuals were those coming from the Bronx where, during this time, hip-hop was beginning to take form. One of the pioneers responsible for the development of the foundational aspects of hip-hop was [[DJ Kool Herc]], who began creating this new form of music by taking rhythmic breakdowns of songs and looping them. From the new music came a new form of dance known as b-boying or [[breakdancing]], a style of street dance consisting of improvised acrobatic moves. The pioneers of this dance credit kung fu as one of its influences. Moves such as the crouching low leg sweep and \u201cup rocking\u201d (standing combat moves) are influenced by choreographed kung-fu fights.<ref name=\"jetli.com\">Chris Friedman, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180227094121/https://www.jetli.com/2017/10/kung-fu-break-dancing-hip-hop \"Kung Fu Influences Aspects of Hip Hop Culture Like Break Dancing\"]</ref> The dancers\u2019 ability to improvise these moves led way to battles, which were dance competitions between two dancers or crews judged on their creativity, skills and musicality. In a documentary, Crazy Legs, a member of breakdancing group [[Rock Steady Crew]], described the breakdancing battle being like an old kung fu movie, \u201cwhere the one kung fu master says something along the lines of \u2018hun your kung fu is good, but mine is better,\u2019 then a fight erupts.\u201d <ref name=\"jetli.com\"/>\n\nHip hop group [[Wu Tang Clan]] were prominently influenced by kung fu cinema.  The name \"Wu Tang\" itself is a reference to the 1983 film ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]''.  Subsequent albums by the group (especially their debut album [[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]) are rich with references to kung fu films of the 1970s and 1980s, which group members grew up watching.  Several group members ([[Ghostface Killah]], [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]], [[Method Man]], and [[Masta Killa]]) had also taken their stage names from kung fu cinema.

As more and more young men were sent down into the trenches, influential voices in the United States and Britain began calling for the establishment of a permanent international body to maintain peace in the postwar world. President Woodrow Wilson became a vocal advocate of this concept, and in 1918 he included a sketch of the international body in his 14-point proposal to end the war. In November 1918, the [[Central Powers]] agreed to an armistice to halt the killing in [[World War I]]. Two months later, the Allies met with Germany and Austria-Hungary at Versailles to hammer out formal peace terms. President Wilson wanted peace, but the United Kingdom and France disagreed, forcing harsh war reparations on their former enemies. The League of Nations was approved, and in the summer of 1919 Wilson presented the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] to the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] for ratification.

As more and more young men were sent down into the trenches, influential voices in the United States and Britain began calling for the establishment of a permanent international body to maintain peace in the postwar world. President Woodrow Wilson became a vocal advocate of this concept, and in 1918 he included a sketch of the international body in his 14-point proposal to end the war. In November 1918, the [[Central Powers]] agreed to an armistice to halt the killing in [[World War I]]. Two months later, the Allies met with Germany and Austria-Hungary at Versailles to hammer out formal peace terms. President Wilson wanted peace, but the United Kingdom and France disagreed, forcing harsh war reparations on their former enemies. The League of Nations was approved, and in the summer of 1919 Wilson presented the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] to the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] for ratification.  On 10 January 1920, the [[League of Nations]] formally came into being when the Covenant of the League of Nations, ratified by 42 nations in 1919, took effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.history.com/.amp/this-day-in-history/league-of-nations-instituted|title=League of Nations instituted|website=www.history.com|access-date=3 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204005625/https://www.history.com/.amp/this-day-in-history/league-of-nations-instituted|archive-date=4 December 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nHowever, at some point the League became ineffective when it failed to act against the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] as in February 1933, 40 nations voted for Japan to withdraw from [[Manchuria]] but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.johndclare.net/EL5.htm|title=League of Nations and Manchuria invasion|website=www.johndclare.net|access-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127143657/http://www.johndclare.net/EL5.htm|archive-date=27 November 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It also failed against the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]] despite trying to talk to [[Benito Mussolini]] as he used the time to send an army to Africa, so the League had a plan for Mussolini to just take a part of Ethiopia, but he ignored the League and invaded Ethiopia, the League tried putting sanctions on Italy, but Italy had already conquered Ethiopia and the League had failed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://johndclare.net/league_of_nations6b.htm|title=League of Nations and Italo-Ethiopian War|website=johndclare.net|access-date=3 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813150313/http://www.johndclare.net/league_of_nations6b.htm|archive-date=13 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After Italy conquered Ethiopia, Italy and other nations left the league.

Goldie Kaushik ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]) is the leader of Bharat Nirmaan Party's Youth Wing in Kanpur and [[moral police|beats up young couples seen together]] in the name of protecting Indian culture. Given his political position, police too helps him in his activities. Vipul ([[Kunaal Roy Kapur]]) is chastised by his father for his joblessness and loitering around the city, while his girlfriend Shaheen ([[Karishma Sharma]]) does not like his opposition to Kaushik; ultimately breaking up with him for this reason. Desperate to win back her affection and earn money, Vipul decides to open a hotel for young couples, along with his friend Saurabh ([[Zeishan Quadri]]). They rent an old lodge belonging to Saurabh's uncle ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]) and make him a partner in their hotel named \"Hotel Milan: Khilte Hain Gul Yahan Khil Ke Bikharne Ko\".\n\nThey charge customers on hourly basis and very soon the hotel becomes a popular destination for young couples to spend time together without the fear of Anti-Romeo Squads and public shaming. The trio is turning in huge profit daily and Shaheen patches up with Vipul. They book a room in the latter's hotel on [[Valentine's Day]] but instead go to a nearby ''dargah'' on Shaheen's insistence. In Vipul's absence, Kaushik reaches the Hotel with his goons.

The film was released on 16 November 2018.\n\n==Plot== \nThe film begins with news clips reporting on the Anti-Romeo Squads formed in [[Uttar Pradesh]], with the purpose to prevent [[eve teasing]] and harassment of women at public places, harassing and humiliating young couples. Goldie Kaushik ([[Jaideep Ahlawat]]) is the leader of Bharat Nirmaan Party's Youth Wing in Kanpur and [[moral police|beats up young couples seen together]] in the name of protecting Indian culture. Given his political position, police too helps him in his activities. Vipul ([[Kunaal Roy Kapur]]) is chastised by his father for his joblessness and loitering around the city, while his girlfriend Shaheen ([[Karishma Sharma]]) does not like his opposition to Kaushik; ultimately breaking up with him for this reason. Desperate to win back her affection and earn money, Vipul decides to open a hotel for young couples, along with his friend Saurabh ([[Zeishan Quadri]]). They rent an old lodge belonging to Saurabh's uncle ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]) and make him a partner in their hotel named \"Hotel Milan: Khilte Hain Gul Yahan Khil Ke Bikharne Ko\".\n\nThey charge customers on hourly basis and very soon the hotel becomes a popular destination for young couples to spend time together without the fear of Anti-Romeo Squads and public shaming. The trio is turning in huge profit daily and Shaheen patches up with Vipul. They book a room in the latter's hotel on [[Valentine's Day]] but instead go to a nearby ''dargah'' on Shaheen's insistence. In Vipul's absence, Kaushik reaches the Hotel with his goons. They vandalise the hotel and beat up Saurabh and his uncle. Kaushik's goons drag out the couples from their rooms and thrash them mercilessly. Vipul and Shaheen return to find the hotel ransacked. Together they admit the injured to a nearby hospital and deliberate on their next step. The incident gains huge media coverage and Vipul is invited to one such discussion, where he is disheartened by the repeated haggling of Kaushik and an other politician. Vipul returns home and informs his friends and family that he is going to file a case against Kaushik and ACP Yadav for vandalising his hotel and beating up his customers and staff. They engage the services of Guptaji ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]), a lawyer who has not a won a single case till then and is depressed because his wife ran away with his servant.\n\nDuring the court trial, Kaushik has a case filed against Vipul for [[Prostitution in India|running an immoral place]] and sends goons at Guptaji's residence to intimidate him.

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ...From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available ... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts.<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

Pelagius was also highly educated, spoke and wrote Latin and Greek with great fluency, and was well versed in theology. His name has traditionally been understood as a Graecized form (from ''p\u00e9lagos'', \"sea\") of the Welsh name Morgan (\"sea-born\"), or another Celtic equivalent.<ref>Dods, Marcus (1911). \"Pelagius\".

He blamed this laxity on the theology of [[divine grace]] preached by Augustine, among others. He began to teach a very strict, rigid moralism, emphasizing a natural, innate human ability to attain salvation.<ref name=Filippo>[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2008/sfilippo_augustinepelag_jan08.asp Filippo, Stephen N. \"St. Augustine and Pelagianism\". ''Ignatius Insight'']</ref>\n\nWhen [[Alaric I|Alaric]] sacked Rome in 410, Pelagius and his follower [[Caelestius]] fled to [[Carthage]], where he continued his work.<ref name=Fletcher_11 /> He was in Jerusalem by 415.\n\n== Opponents ==\n[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]]]]\n\n=== Augustine of Hippo ===\nPelagianism quickly spread, especially around Carthage. Augustine wrote \"''De peccatorum meritis et remissione'' libri III\" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and \"''De spiritu et littera''\" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called \"Definitiones Caelestii\", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, \"De perfectione justitiae hominis.\" In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.<ref name=pohle/>\n\n=== Jerome ===\nPelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=pohle/> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his \"''Letter to Ctesiphon''\" and \"''Dialogus contra Pelagianos''\". With Jerome at the time was [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John of Jerusalem]], a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.\n\n=== Diospolis ===\nA few months later in December of 415, another synod in [[Lod|Diospolis]] (Lydda) under the bishop of C\u00e6sarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of [[Celestius]] did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures including Augustine himself, who for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius' character.\n\nThe [[Synod of Diospolis]] therefore concluded: \"Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD.html|title=Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD|website=www.seanmultimedia.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n== Pelagius and the doctrine of free will ==\nAfter his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, ''On Nature'' and ''Defense of the Freedom of the Will''. In these, he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence<br />Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence,<br />Or cry down Sin Originall, or that<br /> The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help\", However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.vii.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils: Excursus on Pelagianism], ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', series II, vol 14.</ref>\n\nBelief in Pelagianism and [[Semipelagianism]] was common for the next few centuries, especially in Britain, the Holy Land, and North Africa. [[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders. The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church. Modern scholarship suggests that Pelagius did not take the more extreme positions later associated with his followers.<ref name=Clark>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111006045016/http://americanphilosophy.net/pelagianheresy.htm Clark, R.

Powys referred approvingly to Pelagianism in his nonfiction book ''Obstinate Cymric'' (1947).\n\nThe Saint Augustine/Pelagius debate is mockingly discussed in the novel by [[Flann O'Brien]] titled ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'', wherein Saint Augustine actually makes a ghostly appearance.\n\nThe government of the English-speaking Union (Enspun) in [[Anthony Burgess]]' ''[[The Wanting Seed]]'' is locked in a perpetual cycle, rotating between the 'Pel-Phase', named after Pelagius, and an Augustinian phase. The former is one of police and social services; the latter is characterized by martial law. Burgess took up the Augustine/Pelagius theme again in ''[[The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End|The Clockwork Testament]]'' and in ''[[Earthly Powers]]''.\n\nIn the movie ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' (2004),<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/k/king-arthur-script-transcript.html \"King Arthur\"]</ref> Pelagius is a former mentor of young Lucius Artorius Castus ([[King Arthur|Arthur]]) played by Clive Owen. Arthur champions Pelagius' ideals, particularly those regarding free will. Upon learning of Pelagius's excommunication and death, Arthur realizes that the Roman ideal that he supported no longer exists.  He breaks ties with the [[Roman Empire]], and leads the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] against the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invaders.\n\nPelagius is the subject of a poem by the [[Glasgow]] poet [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] (\"Cathures\", Carcanet 2002) which imagines that Pelagius has returned to his native Glasgow (Cathures) and that his Celtic name was Morgan.\n\n[[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], in his novel ''[[Emperor (Baxter novel)|Emperor]]'', imagines how time's tapestry would have looked had Pelagius' views and not Augustine's influenced the evolution of Christianity.  He also portrays the Emperor Constantine's actions as having dealt a harsh blow, but not necessarily a mortal one, to Pelagius' teaching that humans are free and sin is not inherent in us.\n\nA facsimile of the 1808 \"A Dissertation of the Pelagian Heresy and the Refutation of it al Llandewi Brevi by St David\" has been printed in [[Carmarthen]] on the same street as the original.\n\n''Heresy: the Life of Pelagius'' (2012) by David Lovejoy, portrays Pelagius through the eyes of his (fictional) servant Arwel.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=794693050&qt=results_page Heresy: the Life of Pelagius by David Lovejoy, Echo Publications]</ref>\n\nIn his [[Sister Fidelma mysteries|Sister Fidelma mystery series]] (1994\u2013present), author Peter Berresford Ellis, under the pen name Peter Tremayne, uses the teachings of Pelagius to contrast the dogma and practices of the contemporary Celtic church and that of Rome for supremacy in the British Isles.\n\n== Writings==\nPelagius wrote: ''De fide Trinitatis libri \u2162'' (\"On Faith in the Trinity: Three Books\"), ''Eclogarum ex divinis Scripturis liber primus'' (\"Excerpts out of Divine Scriptures: Book One\"), and ''Commentarii in epistolas S.

He was accused by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and others of denying the need for divine aid in performing [[good works]]. They understood him to have said that the only grace necessary was the declaration of the law; humans were not wounded by Adam's sin and were perfectly able to fulfill the law without divine aid. Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of [[original sin]]. Adherents of Pelagius cited [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 24:16 in support of their position. Pelagius was declared a [[heresy|heretic]] by the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. His interpretation of a doctrine of free will became known as [[Pelagianism]].\n\nHe was well educated, fluent in both [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and learned in [[theology]]. He spent time as an ascetic, focusing on practical asceticism. He was well known in Rome, both for the harsh asceticism of his public life and the power and persuasiveness of his speech. His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a \"saintly man.\" However, he was later accused of lying about his own teachings to avoid public condemnation. Most of his later life was spent defending his doctrine against Christian theologians who held that Pelagius was spreading novelties in the Faith unknown to the apostolic tradition.\n\nDue to some calling him a heretic, little of his work has come down to the present day except in the quotes of his opponents. However, more recently, some authors have defended Pelagius as a misunderstood \u201corthodox\u201d:\n{{quote|Recent analysis of his thinking suggests that it was, in fact, highly orthodox, following in the tradition established by the early fathers and in keeping with the teaching of the church in both the East and the West. ...From what we are able to piece together from the few sources available ... it seems that the [[Celts|Celtic]] monk held to an orthodox view of the prevenience of God's grace, and did not assert that individuals could achieve salvation purely by their own efforts.<ref>Bradley, Ian (1993) ''The Celtic Way''.

Pelagius was also highly educated, spoke and wrote Latin and Greek with great fluency, and was well versed in theology.

Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 18 Jan. 2014]</ref> Pelagius became concerned about the moral laxity of society. He blamed this laxity on the theology of [[divine grace]] preached by Augustine, among others. He began to teach a very strict, rigid moralism, emphasizing a natural, innate human ability to attain salvation.<ref name=Filippo>[http://www.ignatiusinsight.com/features2008/sfilippo_augustinepelag_jan08.asp Filippo, Stephen N. \"St. Augustine and Pelagianism\". ''Ignatius Insight'']</ref>\n\nWhen [[Alaric I|Alaric]] sacked Rome in 410, Pelagius and his follower [[Caelestius]] fled to [[Carthage]], where he continued his work.<ref name=Fletcher_11 /> He was in Jerusalem by 415.\n\n== Opponents ==\n[[File:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Saint Augustine of Hippo]]]]\n\n=== Augustine of Hippo ===\nPelagianism quickly spread, especially around Carthage. Augustine wrote \"''De peccatorum meritis et remissione'' libri III\" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and \"''De spiritu et littera''\" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called \"Definitiones Caelestii\", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, \"De perfectione justitiae hominis.\" In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine stands as an important source on the life and theology of Pelagius, and wrote about him extensively.<ref name=pohle/>\n\n=== Jerome ===\nPelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there. Jerome, who also lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<ref name=pohle/> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his \"''Letter to Ctesiphon''\" and \"''Dialogus contra Pelagianos''.\" With Jerome at the time was [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism. Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius. Bishop [[John II, Bishop of Jerusalem|John of Jerusalem]], a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415. Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.\n\n=== Diospolis ===\nA few months later in December of 415, another synod in [[Lod|Diospolis]] (Lydda) under the bishop of C\u00e6sarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land. However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John. Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of [[Celestius]] did not represent his own views. He showed letters of recommendation by other authoritative figures including Augustine himself, who for all their disagreements, thought highly of Pelagius' character.\n\nThe [[Synod of Diospolis]] therefore concluded: \"Now since we have received satisfaction in respect of the charges brought against the monk Pelagius in his presence and since he gives his assent to sound doctrines but condemns and anathematises those contrary to the faith of the Church, we adjudge him to belong to the communion of the Catholic Church.\"<ref>[http://www.seanmultimedia.com/Pie_Pelagius_Synod_Lydda_415AD.html Jennings, Daniel R., \"Pelagius: Transcript From The Council of Diospolis (Lydda) Against Pelagius, 415AD]</ref>\n\n== Pelagius and the doctrine of free will ==\nAfter his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, ''On Nature'' and ''Defense of the Freedom of the Will''. In these, he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of [[Manichaeism]] by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nManichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<ref>Bonner, Gerald. ''St. Augustine of Hippo: Life and Controversies'', Philadelphia: The Westminister Press, 1963</ref> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)\n\nThe view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that humans can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stands at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<ref name=Filippo/>\n\nAn illustration of Pelagius' views on man's \"moral ability\" not to sin can be found in his \"Letter to Demetrias\".<ref>[http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/pelagius-to-demetrias \"Letter of Pelagius to Demetrias\", ''The Letters of Pelagius'' (Robert Van de Weyer, ed.)]</ref> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned [[Anicia (gens)|Anician]] family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, [[Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)|Demetrias]].  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, ''On the Grace of Christ''.\n\n==Pelagius on grace==\n[[File:Pelagius.jpg|thumb|A 17th-century [[Calvinist]] print depicting Pelagius: The caption says:<br />\"Accurst Pelagius, with what false pretence<br />Durst thou excuse Man's foul Concupiscence,<br />Or cry down Sin Originall, or that<br /> The Love of GOD did Man predestinate.\"]]\nFor Pelagius, \"grace\" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<ref>Stephen J. Duffy, Stephen J., ''The Dynamics of Grace: Perspectives in Theological Anthropology'', Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 1993</ref> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.\n\nExtant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.\n\nHe instead said, \"This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace.\" In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, \"This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help\", and in an accompanying confession of faith, \"Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God's help\", However, he affirmed that \"We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man\" (a statement which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated \"''non possum non peccare''\" (\"I cannot not sin\").\n\n==Pope Innocent I ==\nIn the fall of 416, Augustine and four other bishops wrote a letter urging [[Pope Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism.  Innocent I responded by rejecting the Pelagian teachings and excluding Pelagius and Celestius from communion with the Catholic Church until they should recant. Shortly after this, Innocent I died in March of 417.\n\n==Pope Zosimus ==\nSeeking to undo his condemnation, Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief to [[Pope Zosimus]], Innocent I's successor, showing himself to be orthodox. In these he articulated his beliefs so as not to contradict what the synods condemned.  Zosimus was persuaded by Celestius to reopen the case, but opposition from the African bishops and [[Honorius (emperor)|Emperor Honorius]] forced Zosimus to condemn and excommunicate Celestius and Pelagius in 418.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nPelagianism was condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)|Council of Carthage in 418]].<ref name=Filippo/>  Augustine, shocked that Pelagius and Celestius were not denounced as heretics, called the Council of Carthage in 418 and stated nine beliefs of the Church that Pelagianism denied:\n\n# Death came from sin, not man's physical nature.\n# Infants must be baptized to be cleansed from original sin.\n# Justifying grace covers past sins and helps avoid future sins.\n# The grace of Christ imparts strength and will to act out God's commandments.\n# No good works can come without God's grace.\n# We confess we are sinners because it is true, not from humility.\n# The saints ask for forgiveness for their own sins.\n# The saints also confess to be sinners because they are.\n# Children dying without baptism are excluded from both the kingdom of heaven and eternal life.\n\n== Death and later ==\nAfter his condemnation, Pelagius was expelled from Jerusalem, and Saint [[Cyril of Alexandria]] allowed him to settle in Egypt. He is not heard of thereafter.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nHis death did not end his teachings, although those who followed him may have modified those teachings.  Because little information remains with regard to Pelagius' actual teachings, some of his doctrines possibly were subject to revision and suppression by his enemies (followers of Augustine and the Church leadership as a whole at that time).\n\nPelagius and Caelestius were declared heretics by the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref>Schaff, Philip. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.x.xvi.vii.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils: Excursus on Pelagianism], ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', series II, vol 14.</ref>\n\nBelief in Pelagianism and [[Semipelagianism]] was common for the next few centuries, especially in Britain, the Holy Land, and North Africa. [[Germanus of Auxerre|St Germanus]] visited Britain to combat Pelagianism in or around AD 429. In Wales, [[Saint David]] was credited with convening the [[Synod of Brefi]] and the [[Synod of Victory]] against the followers of Pelagius in the sixth century.\n\n==Evaluation==\nAn objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult. His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders. The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church. Modern scholarship suggests that Pelagius did not take the more extreme positions later associated with his followers.<ref name=Clark>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111006045016/http://americanphilosophy.net/pelagianheresy.htm Clark, R.

Melbourne: Fairfax Digital]</ref>\n\nIn [[M J Trow]] and Richard Denham's 'Britannia' series, Pelagius is a character who has a huge moral impact on one of the four central characters, Vitalis, and his take on Christianity resonates throughout the rest of the series.\n\nPelagius is referred to in [[Stephen Lawhead]]'s book, ''The Black Rood''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawhead |first1=Stephen R |title=The black rood |date=2000 |publisher=EOS |location=New York |isbn=9780061050343 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackrood00lawh |accessdate=19 January 2019 |language=English |url-access=registration }}</ref>, and makes an appearance in ''Patrick''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lawhead |first1=Stephen R |title=Patrick : Son of Ireland |date=2004 |publisher=HarperTorch |location=New York |isbn=9780060012823 |url=https://archive.org/details/patrick00step |accessdate=19 January 2019 |url-access=registration }}</ref>, where he has a discussion with the Hiberno-British saint.\n\nPelagius is frequently referred to in [[Jack Whyte]]'s series of books known as ''[[A Dream of Eagles]]'', where a major character's belief in Pelagius' ideas of free will and the laxity of the [[Roman Catholic]] Church eventually cause him to come into conflict with Church representatives.\n\n[[John Cowper Powys]]' novel ''[[Porius (A Romance of the Dark Ages)]]'' (1951) features the conflict between Augustinian/Pelagian beliefs, with the eponymous hero being a follower of Pelagius. Powys referred approvingly to Pelagianism in his nonfiction book ''Obstinate Cymric'' (1947).\n\nThe Saint Augustine/Pelagius debate is mockingly discussed in the novel by [[Flann O'Brien]] titled ''[[The Dalkey Archive]]'', wherein Saint Augustine actually makes a ghostly appearance.\n\nThe government of the English-speaking Union (Enspun) in [[Anthony Burgess]]' ''[[The Wanting Seed]]'' is locked in a perpetual cycle, rotating between the 'Pel-Phase', named after Pelagius, and an Augustinian phase. The former is one of police and social services; the latter is characterized by martial law. Burgess took up the Augustine/Pelagius theme again in ''[[The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End|The Clockwork Testament]]'' and in ''[[Earthly Powers]]''.\n\nIn the movie ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'' (2004),<ref>[http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/k/king-arthur-script-transcript.html \"King Arthur\"]</ref> Pelagius is a former mentor of young Lucius Artorius Castus ([[King Arthur|Arthur]]) played by Clive Owen. Arthur champions Pelagius' ideals, particularly those regarding free will. Upon learning of Pelagius's excommunication and death, Arthur realizes that the Roman ideal that he supported no longer exists.  He breaks ties with the [[Roman Empire]], and leads the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]] against the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invaders.\n\nPelagius is the subject of a poem by the [[Glasgow]] poet [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]] (\"Cathures\", Carcanet 2002) which imagines that Pelagius has returned to his native Glasgow (Cathures) and that his Celtic name was Morgan.\n\n[[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], in his novel ''[[Emperor (Baxter novel)|Emperor]]'', imagines how time's tapestry would have looked had Pelagius' views and not Augustine's influenced the evolution of Christianity.  He also portrays the Emperor Constantine's actions as having dealt a harsh blow, but not necessarily a mortal one, to Pelagius' teaching that humans are free and sin is not inherent in us.\n\nA facsimile of the 1808 \"A Dissertation of the Pelagian Heresy and the Refutation of it al Llandewi Brevi by St David\" has been printed in [[Carmarthen]] on the same street as the original.\n\n''Heresy: the Life of Pelagius'' (2012) by David Lovejoy, portrays Pelagius through the eyes of his (fictional) servant Arwel.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=794693050&qt=results_page Heresy: the Life of Pelagius by David Lovejoy, Echo Publications]</ref>\n\nIn his [[Sister Fidelma mysteries|Sister Fidelma mystery series]] (1994\u2013present), author Peter Berresford Ellis, under the pen name Peter Tremayne, uses the teachings of Pelagius to contrast the dogma and practices of the contemporary Celtic church and that of Rome for supremacy in the British Isles.\n\n== Writings==\nPelagius wrote: ''De fide Trinitatis libri \u2162'' (\"On Faith in the Trinity: Three Books\"), ''Eclogarum ex divinis Scripturis liber primus'' (\"Excerpts out of Divine Scriptures: Book One\"), and ''Commentarii in epistolas S.
