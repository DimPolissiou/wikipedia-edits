At the start of the story, Paul is suspended from his high school in Pittsburgh for a week. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado, which is later shown to be of importance. He then goes to work at [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Hall]] in Pittsburgh. Here he works as an usher and can be himself by serving those in his section with grand enthusiasm. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of abuse, so much so that while in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake all night imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four lovely children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, he lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards, a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing over $2000 from his new job at Denny & Carson's to finance a new life. He buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

Since Paul sees everything as dull and boring, the flowers represent the desire that he has to find the beauty in life.<ref name=\":1\">Cather, Willa, and Karl Schlenk. ''Paul's case''.

Paul has the opportunity to use a gun to end his life. However, the gun belongs to his father. Paul had always feared his father. His choice to not use the gun shows that Paul doesn't want to give his father any more power over his life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Obertino|first=James|date=May 21, 2012|title='Paul's Case' and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder|journal=[[The Explicator]]|volume=70|issue=1|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.1080/00144940.2012.663009}}</ref>\n\n'''Snowfall''' - Cather utilizes extensive imagery related to snowfall throughout Paul's case in order to represent the coming of a richer lifestyle. The \"whirling\" motions of said snowfall occur several times; as Paul gazes out of the train window on his way to New York, as well as consistently throughout the time he is actually in the city. It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself. Note that on his way back from New York, he gazes out of the train window to see nothing of the sort besides the snow that has already fallen - A depressing representation that Paul's fantasy has come to an end.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Czernicki |first1=Martha |title=Fantasy and Reality in Willa Cather's PAUL'S CASE |journal=The Explicator |date=2017 |volume=75 |issue=4 |page=242|doi=10.1080/00144940.2017.1379466 }}</ref>\n\n'''Paul's Smile''' - There are several instances where Paul's smile is brought up in the story and a few different interpretations of what his smile symbolizes. When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://englishivbl2b.pbworks.com/w/page/19070348/%22Paul%27s%20Case%22%20--%20Cork%20Terborg,%20Payton%20Laczynski,%20Katie%20Erickson|title=English / \"Paul's Case\" -- Cork Terborg, Payton Laczynski, Katie Erickson|website=englishivbl2b.pbworks.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Foreshadowing==\nThe foreshadowing demonstrated in \"Paul's Case\" is seen in the carnations that Paul wears.

His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is en route to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old one was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

The \"whirling\" motions of said snowfall occur several times; as Paul gazes out of the train window on his way to New York, as well as consistently throughout the time he is actually in the city. It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://englishivbl2b.pbworks.com/w/page/19070348/%22Paul%27s%20Case%22%20--%20Cork%20Terborg,%20Payton%20Laczynski,%20Katie%20Erickson|title=English / \"Paul's Case\" -- Cork Terborg, Payton Laczynski, Katie Erickson|website=englishivbl2b.pbworks.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Foreshadowing==\nThe foreshadowing demonstrated in \"Paul's Case\" is seen in the carnations that Paul wears.

In a statement right after the budget vote, Gurtler said, \"Growing the size of government and harming the free market goes against the values and principles I believe in and was  of the reasons I was elected. While I agree that there are times for compromise, I believe someone had to take a stand. That is why I voted NO.\" In February 2017, Gurtler had a dispute with Deal's chief of staff, Chris Riley, at a breakfast event at the [[Georgia Governor's|Governor's Mansion]], regarding the state budget. Following the exchange, Gurtler accused Riley of \"intimidation and bullying tactics\" and claimed that Riley had threatened to \"cut all funding\" to Gurtler's district unless he voted for the budget.  Days after Rep. Gurtler told the press he was threatened by Governor Deal's Chief of Staff, Chris Riley, to vote YES to approve the budget a dismissed arrest charge was aired on WSBTV. IN a written statement regarding the incident Rep.

While I agree that there are times for compromise, I believe someone had to take a stand.
