Spontaneous [[deamination]] of [[5-methylcytosine]] converts it to thymine. This results in a T:G mismatch. Repair mechanisms then correct it back to the original C:G pair; alternatively, they may substitute A for G, turning the original C:G pair into a T:A pair, effectively changing a base and introducing a mutation.

However, for decitabine to be active, it must be incorporated into the [[genome]] of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have led to the development of antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their [[mRNA]]s and preventing their [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.\n\n==In plants==\nSignificant progress has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a [[CpG site]], in plants the cytosine can be methylated at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but not guanine. Overall, ''Arabidopsis'' DNA is highly methylated, [[mass spectrometry]] analysis estimated 14% of cytosines to be modified.<ref name=pmid24640988/>{{Rp|abstract}}\n\nThe principal ''Arabidopsis'' DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which transfer and covalently attach methyl groups onto DNA, are DRM2, MET1, and CMT3. Both the DRM2 and MET1 proteins share significant homology to the mammalian methyltransferases DNMT3 and DNMT1, respectively, whereas the CMT3 protein is unique to the plant kingdom. There are currently two classes of DNA methyltransferases: 1) the ''de novo'' class or enzymes that create new methylation marks on the DNA; 2) a maintenance class that recognizes the methylation marks on the parental strand of DNA and transfers new methylation to the daughter strands after DNA replication. DRM2 is the only enzyme that has been implicated as a ''de novo'' DNA methyltransferase. DRM2 has also been shown, along with MET1 and CMT3 to be involved in maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao X, Jacobsen SE | title = Locus-specific control of asymmetric and CpNpG methylation by the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferase genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 Suppl 4 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = 16491\u20138 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12151602 | pmc = 139913 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.162371599 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9916491C }}</ref> Other DNA methyltransferases are expressed in plants but have no known function (see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190410083124/http://www.chromdb.org/ Chromatin Database]).\n\nIt is not clear how the cell determines the locations of ''de novo'' DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that for many (though not all) locations, [[RNA-directed DNA methylation]] (RdDM) is involved.

A [[methylase]] is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific [[restriction enzyme]]s and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by [[bacteriophage]].\n\n''[[E. coli]]'' [[Dna adenine methylase|DNA adenine methyltransferase]] (Dam) is an enzyme of ~32 kDa that does not belong to a restriction/modification system. The target recognition sequence for ''E. coli'' Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNA\u2013Dam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the ''E. coli'' genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in an increased spontaneous mutation rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair.\n\nOne region of the DNA that keeps its hemimethylated status for longer is the [[origin of replication]], which has an abundance of GATC sites. This is central to the bacterial mechanism for timing DNA replication. SeqA binds to the origin of replication, sequestering it and thus preventing methylation. Because hemimethylated origins of replication are inactive, this mechanism limits DNA replication to once per cell cycle.\n\nExpression of certain genes, for example, those coding for [[pilus]] expression in ''E. coli'', is regulated by the methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells' environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the pilus gene transcription is locked in the on or off position until the DNA is again replicated. In ''E. coli'', these pili [[operon]]s have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed{{By whom|date=December 2010}} that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics.\n\nOn the other hand, DNA cytosine methylase targets CCAGG and CCTGG sites to methylate cytosine at the C5 position (C meC(A/T) GG). The other methylase enzyme, EcoKI, causes methylation of adenines in the sequences AAC(N<sub>6</sub>)GTGC and GCAC(N<sub>6</sub>)GTT.\n\nIn ''Clostridioides difficile'', DNA methylation at the target motif CAAAAA was shown to impact [[sporulation]], a key step in disease transmission, as well as cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization.<ref name=\":110\">{{Cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=Pedro H.|last2=Ribis|first2=John W.|last3=Garrett|first3=Elizabeth M.|last4=Trzilova|first4=Dominika|last5=Kim|first5=Alex|last6=Sekulovic|first6=Ognjen|last7=Mead|first7=Edward A.|last8=Pak|first8=Theodore|last9=Zhu|first9=Shijia|last10=Deikus|first10=Gintaras|last11=Touchon|first11=Marie|title=Epigenomic characterization of Clostridioides difficile finds a conserved DNA methyltransferase that mediates sporulation and pathogenesis|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=5|issue=1|language=en|pages=166\u2013180|doi=10.1038/s41564-019-0613-4|pmid=31768029|pmc=6925328|issn=2058-5276|year=2020}}</ref>\n\n===Molecular cloning===\n\nMost strains used by molecular biologists are derivatives of ''E. coli'' K-12, and possess both Dam and Dcm, but there are commercially available strains that are dam-/dcm- (lack of activity of either methylase).

Spontaneous [[deamination]] of [[5-methylcytosine]] converts it to thymine. This results in a T:G mismatch. Repair mechanisms then correct it back to the original C:G pair; alternatively, they may substitute A for G, turning the original C:G pair into a T:A pair, effectively changing a base and introducing a mutation.

However, for decitabine to be active, it must be incorporated into the [[genome]] of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have led to the development of antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their [[mRNA]]s and preventing their [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.\n\n==In plants==\nSignificant progress has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a [[CpG site]], in plants the cytosine can be methylated at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but not guanine. Overall, ''Arabidopsis'' DNA is highly methylated, [[mass spectrometry]] analysis estimated 14% of cytosines to be modified.<ref name=pmid24640988/>{{Rp|abstract}}\n\nThe principal ''Arabidopsis'' DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which transfer and covalently attach methyl groups onto DNA, are DRM2, MET1, and CMT3. Both the DRM2 and MET1 proteins share significant homology to the mammalian methyltransferases DNMT3 and DNMT1, respectively, whereas the CMT3 protein is unique to the plant kingdom. There are currently two classes of DNA methyltransferases: 1) the ''de novo'' class or enzymes that create new methylation marks on the DNA; 2) a maintenance class that recognizes the methylation marks on the parental strand of DNA and transfers new methylation to the daughter strands after DNA replication. DRM2 is the only enzyme that has been implicated as a ''de novo'' DNA methyltransferase. DRM2 has also been shown, along with MET1 and CMT3 to be involved in maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao X, Jacobsen SE | title = Locus-specific control of asymmetric and CpNpG methylation by the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferase genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 Suppl 4 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = 16491\u20138 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12151602 | pmc = 139913 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.162371599 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9916491C }}</ref> Other DNA methyltransferases are expressed in plants but have no known function (see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190410083124/http://www.chromdb.org/ Chromatin Database]).\n\nIt is not clear how the cell determines the locations of ''de novo'' DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that for many (though not all) locations, [[RNA-directed DNA methylation]] (RdDM) is involved.

A [[methylase]] is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific [[restriction enzyme]]s and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by [[bacteriophage]].\n\n''[[E. coli]]'' [[Dna adenine methylase|DNA adenine methyltransferase]] (Dam) is an enzyme of ~32 kDa that does not belong to a restriction/modification system. The target recognition sequence for ''E. coli'' Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNA\u2013Dam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the ''E. coli'' genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in an increased spontaneous mutation rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair.\n\nOne region of the DNA that keeps its hemimethylated status for longer is the [[origin of replication]], which has an abundance of GATC sites. This is central to the bacterial mechanism for timing DNA replication. SeqA binds to the origin of replication, sequestering it and thus preventing methylation. Because hemimethylated origins of replication are inactive, this mechanism limits DNA replication to once per cell cycle.\n\nExpression of certain genes, for example, those coding for [[pilus]] expression in ''E. coli'', is regulated by the methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells' environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the pilus gene transcription is locked in the on or off position until the DNA is again replicated. In ''E. coli'', these pili [[operon]]s have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed{{By whom|date=December 2010}} that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics.\n\nOn the other hand, DNA cytosine methylase targets CCAGG and CCTGG sites to methylate cytosine at the C5 position (C meC(A/T) GG). The other methylase enzyme, EcoKI, causes methylation of adenines in the sequences AAC(N<sub>6</sub>)GTGC and GCAC(N<sub>6</sub>)GTT.\n\nIn ''Clostridioides difficile'', DNA methylation at the target motif CAAAAA was shown to impact [[sporulation]], a key step in disease transmission, as well as cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization.<ref name=\":110\">{{Cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=Pedro H.|last2=Ribis|first2=John W.|last3=Garrett|first3=Elizabeth M.|last4=Trzilova|first4=Dominika|last5=Kim|first5=Alex|last6=Sekulovic|first6=Ognjen|last7=Mead|first7=Edward A.|last8=Pak|first8=Theodore|last9=Zhu|first9=Shijia|last10=Deikus|first10=Gintaras|last11=Touchon|first11=Marie|title=Epigenomic characterization of Clostridioides difficile finds a conserved DNA methyltransferase that mediates sporulation and pathogenesis|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=5|issue=1|language=en|pages=166\u2013180|doi=10.1038/s41564-019-0613-4|pmid=31768029|pmc=6925328|issn=2058-5276|year=2020}}</ref>\n\n===Molecular cloning===\n\nMost strains used by molecular biologists are derivatives of ''E. coli'' K-12, and possess both Dam and Dcm, but there are commercially available strains that are dam-/dcm- (lack of activity of either methylase).

Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through [[H3K27ac]] and transcription factor binding sites in a cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks are associated with the cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes.

Deciding which marker to use for an assay is one of the first steps of the identification of body fluids. In general, markers are selected by examining prior research conducted. Identification markers that are chosen should give a positive result for one type of cell. One portion of the chromosome that is an area of focus when conducting DNA methylation are tissue-specific differentially methylated regions, T-DMRs.The degree of methylation for the T-DMRs ranges depending on the body fluid.<ref name=\":4\" /> A research team developed a marker system that is two-fold. The first marker is methylated only in the target fluid while the second is methylated in the rest of the fluids.<ref name=\":3\" /> For instance, if venous blood marker A is un-methylated and venous blood marker B is methylated in a fluid, it indicates the presence of only venous blood. In contrast, if venous blood marker A is methylated and venous blood marker B is un-methylated in some fluid, then that indicates venous blood is in a mixture of fluids. Some examples for DNA methylation markers are Mens1(menstrual blood), Spei1(saliva), and Sperm2(seminal fluid).\n\nDNA methylation provides a relatively good means of sensitivity when identifying and detecting body fluids.

His mother died prematurely in 1369, shortly after his birth, perhaps even during the childbirth.  The prince grew in the intellectual and artistic court of his grandfather, [[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]].  He took part in the many scientific disputes, sumptuous feasts and balls, theatrical presentations and also knight tournaments.  Louis I's library was one of the most extensive in Europe. The Duke, who was a renowned patron of the arts and culture, cared intensely about the education of his heirs.\n\nIn 1379, Henry IX's father remarried. His new wife was Margareta of Masovia, daughter of Duke [[Siemowit III of Masovia|Siemowit III]] and widow of [[Casimir IV of Pomerania]]. From this union, Henry IX gained two half-siblings: [[Louis II of Brieg|Louis II]] and Margareta. Despite the considerable age difference between them, the brothers had a warm and close relationship for many years until the succession war at the beginning of the 15th century.\n\nOn 5 July 1396 Louis I the Fair give Henry IX the towns of [[Kluczbork]], [[Byczyna]] and [[Wo\u0142czyn]], on occasion of his betrothal with Anna of Cieszyn, daughter of Duke [[Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn|Przemyslaus I Noszak]]; but was only on 29 September (nine days after the marriage ceremony) when he was confirmed with the formal possession of their domains, who produced a rent of 2,000 fines. In the marriage contract, was also stipulated that lands became in the widow's lands ({{lang|pl|Oprawa wdowia}}) of the bride. A few months later, Duke Louis I give his grandson the half of the rents of the towns of [[Brzeg]], [[Wierzbno]] and [[O\u0142awa]].\n\n===Beginning of Rule===\nOn 6/23 December 1398 Louis I the Fair died, and was succeeded by his son Henry VIII, who died only eight months later, on 11 July 1399. Both brothers Henry IX and Louis II inherited the Duchy of Brieg and became co-rulers, but in October 1400 they decided to divided their lands. Henry IX took the districts of [[Lubin|Lubin (L\u00fcben)]], [[Chojn\u00f3w|Chojn\u00f3w (Haynau)]] and [[O\u0142awa|O\u0142awa (Ohlau)]], and Louis II took [[Brzeg|Brzeg (Brieg)]].\n\nOn 17 July 1402 the two brothers appeared in a meeting of Piast Dukes in [[Wroclaw]], which concluded with each other and the other Dukes a defensive alliance and paid homage to [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus IV]].\n\n===Captivity of Louis II by the Saracens===\nIn 1404 Louis II went on a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]], during which he was imprisoned by the [[Saracens]]. The unfortunate news reached to Brzeg only until the end of the year. Henry IX, in order to reunited the ransom for his brother, imposed to the inhabitants of Brzeg, as well of his own subjects of Chojn\u00f3w and O\u0142awa an additional tax. The needed sum of 4,000 fines was collected shortly after; however, Louis II wasn't returned to Silesia until the end of 1405. During his captivity, Henry IX held the regency over the Duchy of Brzeg.\n\n===War against Louis II. Death===\nIn March 1409 Duke [[Wenceslaus II of Legnica]], Bishop of [[Wroclaw]], declared Louis II as his heir over the Duchy of [[Legnica]] and the half of [[Z\u0142otoryja]]. The rights over the other half of Z\u0142otoryja and a rent of 6,000 fines were assigned to Henryk IX. Wenceslaus II also decided also that both brothers had the option to take control over all Z\u0142otoryja if one pay the other in compensation. In the same year Louis II purchased to Henry IX his part of Z\u0142otoryja. At this point, the Duke of Lubin (already infuriated by the favoritism of Wenceslaus II over Louis II) and his younger brother broke their friendly relations. Soon the dispute turned into an open war, issued by Henry IX, which is going during the years 1411-1414. The war continue despite the mediation of Wenceslaus II, who tried to persuade Henry IX to stop. The dispute only ended thanks to the action of King Wenceslaus IV, who forbade his vassals to fight. The brothers were finally reconciled and issued a document on mutual help. The residents of the Duchy of Legnica-Z\u0142otoryja were obliged to paid homage to both Dukes. Henry IX died between 1419 and 1420. The place of his burial is unknown.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nOn 20 September 1396 Henry IX married with Anna (bef. 1374 \u2013 8 July bef. 1405/1420?), daughter of [[Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn|Przemys\u0142aw I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn]].

His mother died prematurely in 1369, shortly after his birth, perhaps even during the childbirth.  The prince grew in the intellectual and artistic court of his grandfather, [[Ludwik I the Fair|Louis I the Fair]].  He took part in the many scientific disputes, sumptuous feasts and balls, theatrical presentations and also knight tournaments.  Louis I's library was one of the most extensive in Europe. The Duke, who was a renowned patron of the arts and culture, cared intensely about the education of his heirs.\n\nIn 1379, Henry IX's father remarried. His new wife was Margareta of Masovia, daughter of Duke [[Siemowit III of Masovia|Siemowit III]] and widow of [[Casimir IV of Pomerania]]. From this union, Henry IX gained two half-siblings: [[Louis II of Brieg|Louis II]] and Margareta. Despite the considerable age difference between them, the brothers had a warm and close relationship for many years until the succession war at the beginning of the 15th century.\n\nOn 5 July 1396 Louis I the Fair give Henry IX the towns of [[Kluczbork]], [[Byczyna]] and [[Wo\u0142czyn]], on occasion of his betrothal with Anna of Cieszyn, daughter of Duke [[Przemyslaus I Noszak, Duke of Cieszyn|Przemyslaus I Noszak]]; but was only on 29 September (nine days after the marriage ceremony) when he was confirmed with the formal possession of their domains, who produced a rent of 2,000 fines. In the marriage contract, was also stipulated that lands became in the widow's lands ({{lang|pl|Oprawa wdowia}}) of the bride. A few months later, Duke Louis I give his grandson the half of the rents of the towns of [[Brzeg]], [[Wierzbno]] and [[O\u0142awa]].\n\n===Beginning of Rule===\nOn 6/23 December 1398 Louis I the Fair died, and was succeeded by his son Henry VIII, who died only eight months later, on 11 July 1399. Both brothers Henry IX and Louis II inherited the Duchy of Brieg and became co-rulers, but in October 1400 they decided to divided their lands. Henry IX took the districts of [[Lubin|Lubin (L\u00fcben)]], [[Chojn\u00f3w|Chojn\u00f3w (Haynau)]] and [[O\u0142awa|O\u0142awa (Ohlau)]], and Louis II took [[Brzeg|Brzeg (Brieg)]].\n\nOn 17 July 1402 the two brothers appeared in a meeting of Piast Dukes in [[Wroclaw]], which concluded with each other and the other Dukes a defensive alliance and paid homage to [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|King Wenceslaus IV]].\n\n===Captivity of Louis II by the Saracens===\nIn 1404 Louis II went on a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]], during which he was imprisoned by the [[Saracens]]. The unfortunate news reached to Brzeg only until the end of the year. Henry IX, in order to reunited the ransom for his brother, imposed to the inhabitants of Brzeg, as well of his own subjects of Chojn\u00f3w and O\u0142awa an additional tax. The needed sum of 4,000 fines was collected shortly after; however, Louis II wasn't returned to Silesia until the end of 1405. During his captivity, Henry IX held the regency over the Duchy of Brzeg.\n\n===War against Louis II. Death===\nIn March 1409 Duke [[Wenceslaus II of Legnica]], Bishop of [[Wroclaw]], declared Louis II as his heir over the Duchy of [[Legnica]] and the half of [[Z\u0142otoryja]].

During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected for a band initially named \"Touch\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> The group moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates [[John Thirkell]] and Erwin Keiles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rob |first1=McGibbon |title=Spice Power: The Inside Story |date=1997 |page=52}}</ref> During the first two months, they worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]] with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger [[Tim Hawes]]. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was \"very, very young pop\";<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004 book\">Sinclair (2004), p. 29</ref> one of the songs they recorded, \"Sugar and Spice\", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]. A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Sinclair (2004). According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because \"she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go\". (Sinclair, p. 30). Stephenson later challenged Herbert's claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she \"just couldn't be arsed\" to put in the work the rest of the group was doing. (Sinclair, p. 31)</ref> It was also during this time that Halliwell came up with the band name Spice.<ref name=\"official timeline\" />\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers, and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction.<ref>Sinclair (2004), p. 33</ref> Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\">Sinclair (2004)</ref>\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/><ref name=\"shampoo\" /> That same day, the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based producer [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], who in turn brought them to the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as [[Spice 1|a rapper]] was already using the name \"Spice\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the US, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/>\n\n===1996\u20131997: ''Spice'' and breakthrough===\n{{Main|Spice (album)}}\n[[File:Spice Girls live West MacLaren 1997.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Spice Girls performing \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" at the [[McLaren]] party in 1997]]\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \"[[Wannabe]]\" in the United Kingdom.

In July 1996, the group conducted their first interview with [[Paul Gorman]], the contributing editor of music paper ''Music Week'', at Virgin Records' Paris headquarters.

During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected for a band initially named \"Touch\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> The group moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates [[John Thirkell]] and Erwin Keiles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rob |first1=McGibbon |title=Spice Power: The Inside Story |date=1997 |page=52}}</ref> During the first two months, they worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]] with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger [[Tim Hawes]]. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was \"very, very young pop\";<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004 book\">Sinclair (2004), p. 29</ref> one of the songs they recorded, \"Sugar and Spice\", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]. A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Sinclair (2004). According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because \"she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go\". (Sinclair, p. 30). Stephenson later challenged Herbert's claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she \"just couldn't be arsed\" to put in the work the rest of the group was doing. (Sinclair, p. 31)</ref> It was also during this time that Halliwell came up with the band name Spice.<ref name=\"official timeline\" />\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers, and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction.<ref>Sinclair (2004), p. 33</ref> Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\">Sinclair (2004)</ref>\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/><ref name=\"shampoo\" /> That same day, the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based producer [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], who in turn brought them to the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as [[Spice 1|a rapper]] was already using the name \"Spice\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the US, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/>\n\n===1996\u20131997: ''Spice'' and breakthrough===\n{{Main|Spice (album)}}\n[[File:Spice Girls live West MacLaren 1997.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Spice Girls performing \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" at the [[McLaren]] party in 1997]]\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \"[[Wannabe]]\" in the United Kingdom.

In July 1996, the group conducted their first interview with [[Paul Gorman]], the contributing editor of music paper ''Music Week'', at Virgin Records' Paris headquarters.
