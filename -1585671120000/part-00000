For example, the most developed regions of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, have the highest [[Global Internet usage|Internet penetration rates]] at over 80% each, while the least developed countries such as in Africa and South Asia have less than 30% each.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269329/penetration-rate-of-the-internet-by-region/|title=Global regional internet penetration rate 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> On the other hand, the reduced cost and increasing availability of mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s throughout less developed regions is helping to reduce this disparity at an exponential rate.

The largest use of bots is in web spidering, in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers at many times the speed of a human. More than half of all web traffic is made up of bots. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/web_crawler.htm|title=Web crawler|website=ScienceDaily|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> This aids in the detection of bots as through qualitative coding, softwares can confirm the presence of bots. An example would be the Bot-a-meter developed by Indiana University, where they evaluate 7 different factors to determine whether or not an accounts is a bot. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/|title=Botometer by OSoMe|website=botometer.iuni.iu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref> \n\nA Sock Puppet is an online identity used for purposes of deception<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2127107-sock-puppet-accounts-unmasked-by-the-way-they-write-and-post/|website=www.newscientist.com|access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref>.

There is significant evidence to indicate that the [[Internet Research Agency]], a group of professional Russian Trolls, created fake accounts on major networking sites, online newspapers, to promote specific Ukrainian, Middle Eastern, and American political issues, even advocating for Trump as early as December 2015. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/23/troll-steven-poole-word-of-week|title=What's the difference between a troll and a sockpuppet?|last=Poole|first=Steven|date=2018-02-23|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-06|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n== Leapfrog Democracies ==\n[[File:Estonian municipal elections 2013.png|thumb|This is the divide of the different political parties in Estonia where in the 2013 elections, over 133,000 people (roughly 21.2% of participating voters) voted over the Internet.

It was a term first used at the Personal Democracy Forum in 2014. The basic concept of [[leapfrogging]] is that small and incremental innovations lead allow radical innovations with new firms or countries to \"leapfrog\" old and ancient ones, including with different governmental institutions and ideas. Countries that have huge developments that more typically advanced countries might only have much later. \n\n==== Tunisia ====\nAn example of this is the new [[Tunisia|Tunsia]] constitution. Learning from America and other countries, Tunisia developed a constitution that provides more rights that typical constitutions with issues concerning climate change, healthcare, women's rights, and workers' rights. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/4-ways-tunisia-is-now-more-progressive-than-the-united-states-9879ae93d105/|title=4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> They have provided rights that the United States' government does not cover for its citizens. Tunisia has set the stage for many other countries to follow in their footsteps including Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Although these countries' attempts at democracies have not been nearly as successful as Tunisia's constitution. \n\n==== Estonia ====\nAnother example of a Leapfrog democracy is Estonia being one of the first countries to use online voting. Nearly 99% of their public services are available online, and a reported 44% of Estonia citizens use the online services. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-governance/i-voting/|title=i-Voting|website=e-Estonia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> [[Electronic voting in Estonia|Electronic Voting in Estonia]] has been occurring since 2005 and can cast votes through an app on their mobile device. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/06/07/how-estonias-e-voting-system-could-be-the-future/|title=How Estonia's E-Voting System Could Be The Future|last=Leetaru|first=Kalev|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> Through Estonia's national ID infrastructure, National ID cards have the ability to perform cryptographic functions to authenticate their access to different websites and make legally binding signatures on documents if needed. These cards work through the use of two different RSA key pairs. However, there are still some drawbacks of this voting process as there are inadequate procedural controls that change several times or are not followed, lax operational security, and insufficient transparency. These weaknesses can allow for client side attacks on the voting system.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Springall|first=Drew|chapter=Security Analysis of the Estonian Internet Voting System|title= CCS '14: Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security |year=2014|pages=703\u2013715|doi=10.1145/2660267.2660315|isbn=9781450329576}}</ref>\n\n== Presence of online tools for political participation ==\n\nWith the increasing use of technology in the political sphere, many new platforms have emerged in an attempt to provide unbiased information to the general public in a manner that is easy access to all.

Many of these apps hope to be able to spread this information so that voters may be more educated about the political sphere and make more of an informed decision when voting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2018/03/01/how-technology-is-really-going-to-change-politics-in-the-next-20-years/|title=How Technology Is Really Going To Change Politics In The Next 20 Years|last=Armstrong|first=Paul|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> Some more examples include Liquid.us, Countable<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.countable.us/|title=Contact your Reps, Influence Congress, Vote on Bills|website=www.countable.us|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>, Capitol Bells<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitolbells.com/splash/|title=Capitol Bells|website=www.capitolbells.com|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>, Fiscalnote<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fiscalnote.com/|title=Homepage|website=FiscalNote|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>, and Councilmatic<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://councilmatic.org/|title=Councilmatic - Your local city council, demystified|last=Councilmatic|website=Councilmatic|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>.

They have an in-depth survey on their website that asks about the users' political opinion on common issues discussed or debated within the government currently to give the voter a ranking of which politician best aligns with what stance they have on the current political sphere<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isidewith.com/political-quiz|title=2019 Political Quiz|website=iSideWith|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>. This gives voters more of an educated guess of who they should be casting their vote for. The more time the voters spend filling out the survey, the more accurate the results will align with their political stance. \n\n==== Change.org ====\n[[File:Change.org.jpg|thumb|The logo and slogan for change.org]]\nChange.org is a website that allows for people to take a stance on something they agree or disagree with and actually petition for others to rally behind their cause<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.activistfacts.com/organizations/530-change-dot-org/|title=Change.org {{!}} Funding sources, staff profiles, and political agenda {{!}} Activist FactsActivist Facts|website=Activist Facts|language=en|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref>. People can search up petitions that have been started already concerning a cause that they may feel strongly about or they have the option of starting their own. The website displays past successful petitions that have made an impact and the petition does not necessarily have to be related to politics as well. There are many different surveys started by different people that could just be targeting different issues within their neighborhood but can range up to a social issue that they believe the whole world should be aware about. \n\n==== D21 ====\nD21 is a platform that allows people to participate in voting on issues through a form of \"modern democracy.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.d21.me/|title=D21 {{!}} Participation and voting in municipalities, schools and companies.|website=en.d21.me|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> It is also known as the Jane\u010dek Method which allows people to cast both a negative and a positive vote<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2016/march/better-way-for-voters.html|title=Alumnus Gives Voters A Better Way to Decide - News - Carnegie Mellon University|last=University|first=Carnegie Mellon|date=2016|website=www.cmu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>. They wish to inform users more accurately about different issues happening within their community and provide them with a platform for them to be able to voice their opinions on. This is a platform that is used mainly in the Czech Republic to target corruption within the Czech government.

Specifically having a section about Internet Voting, they speak about the dangers and information leaks that come with using the internet or anything digital to cast votes, even with blockchain. Verified Voting defines internet voting to even include email or fax voting or any voting through an online portal. This is due to the fact that any form of electronic voting can cause the vote to be susceptible to a large number of security threats including cyber-attacks that can skew voting results and preferences<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/internet-voting/|title=Internet Voting {{!}} Verified Voting|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>.

For example, the most developed regions of the world, such as North America and Western Europe, have the highest [[Global Internet usage|Internet penetration rates]] at over 80% each, while the least developed countries such as in Africa and South Asia have less than 30% each.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/269329/penetration-rate-of-the-internet-by-region/|title=Global regional internet penetration rate 2017 {{!}} Statistic|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}</ref> On the other hand, the reduced cost and increasing availability of mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s throughout less developed regions is helping to reduce this disparity at an exponential rate.

Countries that have huge developments that more typically advanced countries might only have much later. \n\n==== Tunisia ====\nAn example of this is the new [[Tunisia|Tunsia]] constitution. Learning from America and other countries, Tunisia developed a constitution that provides more rights that typical constitutions with issues concerning climate change, healthcare, women's rights, and workers' rights. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/4-ways-tunisia-is-now-more-progressive-than-the-united-states-9879ae93d105/|title=4 Ways Tunisia Is Now More Progressive Than The United States|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> They have provided rights that the United States' government does not cover for its citizens. Tunisia has set the stage for many other countries to follow in their footsteps including Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Syria. Although these countries' attempts at democracies have not been nearly as successful as Tunisia's constitution. \n\n==== Estonia ====\nAnother example of a Leapfrog democracy is Estonia being one of the first countries to use online voting.

People can search up petitions that have been started already concerning a cause that they may feel strongly about or they have the option of starting their own. The website displays past successful petitions that have made an impact and the petition does not necessarily have to be related to politics as well. There are many different surveys started by different people that could just be targeting different issues within their neighborhood but can range up to a social issue that they believe the whole world should be aware about. \n\n==== D21 ====\nD21 is a platform that allows people to participate in voting on issues through a form of \"modern democracy.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.d21.me/|title=D21 {{!}} Participation and voting in municipalities, schools and companies.|website=en.d21.me|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> It is also known as the Jane\u010dek Method which allows people to cast both a negative and a positive vote<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2016/march/better-way-for-voters.html|title=Alumnus Gives Voters A Better Way to Decide - News - Carnegie Mellon University|last=University|first=Carnegie Mellon|date=2016|website=www.cmu.edu|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>. They wish to inform users more accurately about different issues happening within their community and provide them with a platform for them to be able to voice their opinions on. This is a platform that is used mainly in the Czech Republic to target corruption within the Czech government.

Specifically having a section about Internet Voting, they speak about the dangers and information leaks that come with using the internet or anything digital to cast votes, even with blockchain. Verified Voting defines internet voting to even include email or fax voting or any voting through an online portal. This is due to the fact that any form of electronic voting can cause the vote to be susceptible to a large number of security threats including cyber-attacks that can skew voting results and preferences<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/internet-voting/|title=Internet Voting {{!}} Verified Voting|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>.
