[[Vlastimir]] defeated the [[Medieval Bulgarian army|Bulgarian army]] in a three-year-war (839\u2013842), and the two powers lived in peace for some decades. Vlastimir's three sons succeeded in ruling Serbia together, although not for long; Serbia became a key part in the power struggle between the Byzantines and [[Bulgarians]] (predominantly allied with the Byzantines), which also resulted in major dynastic wars for a period of three decades. Central parts of the principality were shortly occupied by the Bulgarian army for three years (924\u2013927), until Serbian prince [[\u010caslav of Serbia|\u010caslav]] was able to liberate the land and unite several Serbian regions, becoming the most powerful ruler of the Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty. An important process during this period was the [[Christianization of the Serbs]], the establishment of Christianity as state-religion c. 869, and the founding of the first Serbian [[eparchy]] (diocese), the [[Eparchy of Ras]]. The principality was annexed by the Byzantines in c. 969-971 and ruled as the [[Catepanate of Ras]].

Michael had also grown powerful, ruling not only [[Zachlumia]], but exerting his influence over Travunia and [[Duklja]]. [[Constantine VII|Porphyrogenitus]] explains that Michael\u2019s roots were different from the [[Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty]], and was unwilling to yield authority to Peter.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nAlthough allied to [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Symeon]], Peter became increasingly disgruntled by the fact that he was essentially subordinate to him. Peter\u2019s expansion toward the coast facilitated contacts with the Byzantines, by way of the strategies of [[Dyrrhachium]]. Searching for allies against Bulgaria, the Byzantines showered Peter with gold and promises of greater independence if he would join their alliance - a convincing strategy. Peter might have been planning an attack on Bulgaria with the Magyars, showing that his realm had stretched north to the Sava river. However, Michael of Zahumlje forewarned Symeon of this plan, since Michael was an enemy of Peter, and a loyal vassal of Symeon. What followed was multiple Bulgarian interventions and a succession of Serb rulers. Symeon attacked Serbia (in 917) and deposed Peter, placing [[Pavle Branovi\u0107]] (a grandson of Mutimir) as Prince of Serbia, subordinate to Symeon (although some scholars suggest that Symeon took control over Serbia directly at this time). Unhappy with this, the Byzantines then sent [[Zaharije Prvoslavljevic]] in 920 to oust Pavle, but he failed and was sent to Bulgaria as prisoner. The Byzantines then succeeded in turning Prince Pavle to their side. In turn, the Bulgarians started indoctrinating Zaharije. Zaharije invaded Serbia with a Bulgarian force, and ousted his cousin Pavle in 922. However, he too turned to Byzantium. A punitive force sent by the Bulgarians was defeated.  Thus we see a continuous cycle of dynastic strife amongst Vlastimir\u2019s successors, stirred on by the Byzantine and Bulgarians, who were effectively using the Serbs as pawns. Whilst Bulgarian help was more effective, Byzantine help seemed preferable. Simeon made peace with the Byzantines to settle affairs with Serbia once and for all. In 924, he sent a large army accompanied by [[\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107|\u010caslav]], son of [[Klonimir]]. The army forced Zaharije to flee to [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]]. The Serbian \u017eupans were then summoned to recognize \u010caslav as the new Prince. When they came, however, they were all imprisoned and taken to Bulgaria, as too was \u010caslav. Much of Serbia was ravaged, and many people fled to Croatia, Bulgaria and Constantinople. Simeon made Serbia into a Bulgarian province so that Bulgaria now bordered Croatia and Zahumlje. He then resolved to attack Croatia, because it was a Byzantine ally and had sheltered the Serbian Prince.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nAt the [[battle of the Bosnian Highlands]], Croatian King [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] defeated the Bulgarians, whilst Prince Michael of Zahumlje maintained neutrality. During the fall of central Serbia, Michael was the pre-eminent Serb prince, having been awarded the honorary title of ''[[patrikios]]'' by the Byzantine Emperor, and may have ruled over Zachlumia, Travunia, and Duklja.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\n== \u010caslav (927\u2013960) ==\n{{main|\u010caslav of Serbia}}\n[[File:Serb lands in the 9th century (en).png|alt=|thumb|270x270px|Serbian principality during the rule of [[\u010caslav of Serbia|\u010caslav]] (927\u2013960)]]\nThe Bulgarian rule over Serbia lasted only three years. After Symeon died, [[\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]] (927- c. 960s) led Serb refugees back to Serbia. He secured the allegiance of the Dalmatian duchies and ended Bulgarian rule in central Serbia. After Tomislav\u2019s death, Croatia was in near-anarchy as his sons vied for sole rule, so Caslav was able to extend his domain north to the Vrbas river (gaining the allegiance of the chiefs of the various Bosnian \u017eupas).{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nDuring this apogee of Serbian power, Christianity and culture penetrated Serbia, as the Serb prince lived in peaceful and cordial relations with the Byzantines. However, strong as it had grown to be, Serbia\u2019s power (as in other early Slavic states) was only as strong as its ruler. There was no centralized rule, but instead a confederacy of Slavic principalities. The existence of the unified Grand Principality was dependent on the allegiance of the lesser princes to Caslav. When he died defending Bosnia against [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] incursions sometime between 950 and 960, the coalition disintegrated.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nAfter this, there is a gap in the history of hinterland Serbia--in western sources, ''Rascia''--as it was annexed by the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire. The dynasty continued to rule the maritime regions, and, in the 990s, [[Jovan Vladimir]] (Vlastimirovi\u0107) rose as the most powerful Serbian prince, ruling over present-day Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, and Koplik in Albania.  This state became known as ''Duklja'', after the ancient Roman town of Doclea. However, by 997, it had been conquered and made subject to Bulgaria again by [[tsar Samuil|tsar Samuel]].{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nWhen the Byzantines finally defeated the Bulgarians, they regained control over most of the Balkans for the first time in four centuries. Serbian lands were governed by a ''strategos'' presiding over the Theme of Sirmium. However, local Serbian princes continued to reign as suzerains to the Byzantines, maintaining total autonomy over their lands, such as in Rascia, while only nominally being Byzantine vassals. Forts were maintained in [[Belgrade]], [[Sirmium]], [[Ni\u0161]] and [[Brani\u010devo (region)|Brani\u010devo]]. These were, for the most part, in the hands of local nobility, which often revolted against Byzantine rule.\n\n== Fall and aftermath ==\n{{main|Catepanate of Serbia}}\nAfter \u010caslav died c. 960, Rascia (hinterland of Serbia) was annexed by the Byzantines (and reorganized as the [[Catepanate of Serbia]], 971\u2013976) and Bulgars. Serbia lost its centralized rule and the provinces once again came under the Empire. [[Jovan Vladimir]] emerged later as a ruler of [[Duklja]], a small territory centered in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] on the Adriatic coast, as a Byzantine vassal. His realm was called ''Serbia'', ''Dalmatia'', ''Sklavonia'', etc., and eventually included much of the [[pomorje|maritime provinces]], including [[Travunia]] and [[Zachlumia]]. His realm probably stretched into the hinterland to include some parts of ''Zagorje'' (inland Serbia and Bosnia) as well. Vladimir\u2019s pre-eminent position over other Slavic nobles in the area explains why Emperor Basil approached him for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. With his hands tied by war in Anatolia, Emperor Basil required allies for his war against [[Tsar Samuel]], who ruled a [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian empire]] stretching over [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. In retaliation, Samuel invaded Duklja in 997, and pushed through [[Dalmatia]] up to the city of [[Zadar]], incorporating [[Bosnia]] and [[Serbia]] into his realm. After defeating Vladimir, Samuel reinstated him as a [[vassal]] prince. We do not know what Vladimir\u2019s connection was to the previous princes of Serbia, or to the rulers of Croatia--much of what is written in the [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]] about the genealogy of the Doclean rulers is mythological. Vladimir was murdered by Vladislav, Samuel\u2019s brother and successor, circa 1016 AD. The last prominent member of his family, his uncle Dragimir, was killed by some local citizens in Kotor in 1018. That same year, the Byzantines defeated the Bulgarians, and in one masterful stroke re-took virtually all of southeastern Europe.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\n== Government ==\n{{Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty sidebar}}\nThe Serbian ruler was titled \"Prince (''[[archon]]'') of the Serbs\" (\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2).{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=156}} In [[Serbo-Croatian]] historiography, the Slavic title of ''[[Knez (title)|knez]]'' (\u043a\u043d\u0435\u0437) is used instead of the Greek ''arhont'' (\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0442).{{sfn|SANU|1995|p=37}} The DAI mentions that the Serbian throne is inherited by ''the son'', i.e. the first-born; his descendants succeeded him, though their names are unknown until the coming of Vi\u0161eslav.{{sfn|\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b|1989|p=19}}{{sfn|\u0416\u0438\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|2006|p=22\u201323}} The Serbs at that time were organized into ''[[\u017eupe]]'' ({{singular abbr}} ''\u017eupa''), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local ''\u017eupan'' (a magistrate or governor); the governorship was hereditary, and the ''\u017eupan'' reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=225, 304}}\n\nAccording to [[V. \u0106orovi\u0107]], the Serbs at first lived withdrawn in gorges, in their old tribal organization.

[[Vlastimir]] defeated the [[Medieval Bulgarian army|Bulgarian army]] in a three-year-war (839\u2013842), and the two powers lived in peace for some decades. Vlastimir's three sons succeeded in ruling Serbia together, although not for long; Serbia became a key part in the power struggle between the Byzantines and [[Bulgarians]] (predominantly allied with the Byzantines), which also resulted in major dynastic wars for a period of three decades. Central parts of the principality were shortly occupied by the Bulgarian army for three years (924\u2013927), until Serbian prince [[\u010caslav of Serbia|\u010caslav]] was able to liberate the land and unite several Serbian regions, becoming the most powerful ruler of the Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty. An important process during this period was the [[Christianization of the Serbs]], the establishment of Christianity as state-religion c. 869, and the founding of the first Serbian [[eparchy]] (diocese), the [[Eparchy of Ras]]. The principality was annexed by the Byzantines in c. 969-971 and ruled as the [[Catepanate of Ras]]. The main information of the history of the principality and Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty are recorded in the contemporary historical work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (written c. 950\u2013960).{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|pp=}}\n\n== Background ==\nSlavs ([[Sklavenoi]]) settled the Balkans in the 6th century.{{sfn|Jankovi\u0107|2004|p=39-61}} The history of the early medieval Serbian principality and the [[Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty]] is recorded in the work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (On the Governance of the Empire, abbr. \"DAI\"), compiled by the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] (r. 913\u2013959).  The work mentions the first Serbian ruler, without a name (known conventionally as \"[[Unknown Archon]]\"), that led the [[White Serbs]] to southeastern Europe and received the protection of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (r. 610\u2013641), and was said to have died long before the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgar invasion]] (680).{{sfn|\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b|1989|p=19}}{{sfn|\u0416\u0438\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|2006|p=11}} The Serbian ruler was titled \"Prince (''[[archon]]'') of the Serbia\" (\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2).{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=156, 160}} The DAI mentions that this ruler was inherited by ''the son''--i.e., the first-born.{{sfn|\u0416\u0438\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|2006|p=11}} According to some Serbian authors, his descendants succeeded him,{{sfn|\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b|1989|p=19}} but their names are unknown until the coming of Vi\u0161eslav.

The Serbs and the Bulgarians concluded peace, and the Christianization of the Slavs began; by the 870s the Serbs were baptized and had established the [[Eparchy of Ras]] (mentioned in the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|Fourth Council of Constantinople]], 878\u2013880), on the order of Emperor [[Basil I]]. Mutimir maintained the communion with the Eastern Church (Constantinople) when [[Pope John VIII]] invited him to recognize the jurisdiction of the bishopric of Sirmium. The Serbs and Bulgarians adopted the [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] liturgy instead of the Greek. Sometime after defeating the Bulgarians, Mutimir ousted his brothers, who fled to Bulgaria. He kept Gopnik's son [[Petar Gojnikovi\u0107]] in his court, but he managed to escape to Croatia. Mutimir ruled until 890, being succeeded by his son [[Pribislav of Serbia|Prvoslav]]. However, Prvoslav was overthrown by Petar who had returned from his exile in [[Principality of Dalmatian Croatia|Croatia]] in {{circa}} 892.\n\n== Peter, Pavle and Zaharije (892\u2013927) ==\n{{main|Petar of Serbia|Pavle of Serbia|Zaharija of Serbia}}\nThe name Peter suggests that Christianity had started to permeate into Serbia, undoubtedly through Serbia's contacts with the Bulgarians and Byzantines. Peter secured himself on the throne (after fending off a challenge from Klonimir, son of Stojmir) and was recognized by [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Tsar Symeon I]] of Bulgaria. An alliance was signed between the two states. Already having Travunia\u2019s loyalty, Peter began to expand his state north and west. He annexed the [[Bosna River]] valley, and then moved west securing allegiance from the [[Narentines]], a fiercely independent, pirateering Slavic tribe. However, Peter\u2019s expansion into [[Dalmatia]] brought him into conflict with Prince [[Michael of Zahumlje]]. Michael had also grown powerful, ruling not only [[Zachlumia]], but exerting his influence over Travunia and [[Duklja]]. [[Constantine VII|Porphyrogenitus]] explains that Michael\u2019s roots were different from the [[Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty]], and was unwilling to yield authority to Peter.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nAlthough allied to [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Symeon]], Peter became increasingly disgruntled by the fact that he was essentially subordinate to him. Peter\u2019s expansion toward the coast facilitated contacts with the Byzantines, by way of the strategies of [[Dyrrhachium]]. Searching for allies against Bulgaria, the Byzantines showered Peter with gold and promises of greater independence if he would join their alliance - a convincing strategy. Peter might have been planning an attack on Bulgaria with the Magyars, showing that his realm had stretched north to the Sava river. However, Michael of Zahumlje forewarned Symeon of this plan, since Michael was an enemy of Peter, and a loyal vassal of Symeon. What followed was multiple Bulgarian interventions and a succession of Serb rulers. Symeon attacked Serbia (in 917) and deposed Peter, placing [[Pavle Branovi\u0107]] (a grandson of Mutimir) as Prince of Serbia, subordinate to Symeon (although some scholars suggest that Symeon took control over Serbia directly at this time). Unhappy with this, the Byzantines then sent [[Zaharije Prvoslavljevic]] in 920 to oust Pavle, but he failed and was sent to Bulgaria as prisoner. The Byzantines then succeeded in turning Prince Pavle to their side. In turn, the Bulgarians started indoctrinating Zaharije. Zaharije invaded Serbia with a Bulgarian force, and ousted his cousin Pavle in 922. However, he too turned to Byzantium. A punitive force sent by the Bulgarians was defeated.  Thus we see a continuous cycle of dynastic strife amongst Vlastimir\u2019s successors, stirred on by the Byzantine and Bulgarians, who were effectively using the Serbs as pawns. Whilst Bulgarian help was more effective, Byzantine help seemed preferable. Simeon made peace with the Byzantines to settle affairs with Serbia once and for all. In 924, he sent a large army accompanied by [[\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107|\u010caslav]], son of [[Klonimir]]. The army forced Zaharije to flee to [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]]. The Serbian \u017eupans were then summoned to recognize \u010caslav as the new Prince. When they came, however, they were all imprisoned and taken to Bulgaria, as too was \u010caslav. Much of Serbia was ravaged, and many people fled to Croatia, Bulgaria and Constantinople. Simeon made Serbia into a Bulgarian province so that Bulgaria now bordered Croatia and Zahumlje. He then resolved to attack Croatia, because it was a Byzantine ally and had sheltered the Serbian Prince.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nAt the [[battle of the Bosnian Highlands]], Croatian King [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] defeated the Bulgarians, whilst Prince Michael of Zahumlje maintained neutrality. During the fall of central Serbia, Michael was the pre-eminent Serb prince, having been awarded the honorary title of ''[[patrikios]]'' by the Byzantine Emperor, and may have ruled over Zachlumia, Travunia, and Duklja.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\n== \u010caslav (927\u2013960) ==\n{{main|\u010caslav of Serbia}}\n[[File:Serb lands in the 9th century (en).png|alt=|thumb|270x270px|Serbian principality during the rule of [[\u010caslav of Serbia|\u010caslav]] (927\u2013960)]]\nThe Bulgarian rule over Serbia lasted only three years. After Symeon died, [[\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]] (927- c. 960s) led Serb refugees back to Serbia. He secured the allegiance of the Dalmatian duchies and ended Bulgarian rule in central Serbia. After Tomislav\u2019s death, Croatia was in near-anarchy as his sons vied for sole rule, so Caslav was able to extend his domain north to the Vrbas river (gaining the allegiance of the chiefs of the various Bosnian \u017eupas).{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nDuring this apogee of Serbian power, Christianity and culture penetrated Serbia, as the Serb prince lived in peaceful and cordial relations with the Byzantines. However, strong as it had grown to be, Serbia\u2019s power (as in other early Slavic states) was only as strong as its ruler. There was no centralized rule, but instead a confederacy of Slavic principalities. The existence of the unified Grand Principality was dependent on the allegiance of the lesser princes to Caslav. When he died defending Bosnia against [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] incursions sometime between 950 and 960, the coalition disintegrated.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nAfter this, there is a gap in the history of hinterland Serbia--in western sources, ''Rascia''--as it was annexed by the Byzantine Empire and the Bulgarian Empire. The dynasty continued to rule the maritime regions, and, in the 990s, [[Jovan Vladimir]] (Vlastimirovi\u0107) rose as the most powerful Serbian prince, ruling over present-day Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, and Koplik in Albania.  This state became known as ''Duklja'', after the ancient Roman town of Doclea. However, by 997, it had been conquered and made subject to Bulgaria again by [[tsar Samuil|tsar Samuel]].{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\nWhen the Byzantines finally defeated the Bulgarians, they regained control over most of the Balkans for the first time in four centuries. Serbian lands were governed by a ''strategos'' presiding over the Theme of Sirmium. However, local Serbian princes continued to reign as suzerains to the Byzantines, maintaining total autonomy over their lands, such as in Rascia, while only nominally being Byzantine vassals. Forts were maintained in [[Belgrade]], [[Sirmium]], [[Ni\u0161]] and [[Brani\u010devo (region)|Brani\u010devo]]. These were, for the most part, in the hands of local nobility, which often revolted against Byzantine rule.\n\n== Fall and aftermath ==\n{{main|Catepanate of Serbia}}\nAfter \u010caslav died c. 960, Rascia (hinterland of Serbia) was annexed by the Byzantines (and reorganized as the [[Catepanate of Serbia]], 971\u2013976) and Bulgars. Serbia lost its centralized rule and the provinces once again came under the Empire. [[Jovan Vladimir]] emerged later as a ruler of [[Duklja]], a small territory centered in [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] on the Adriatic coast, as a Byzantine vassal. His realm was called ''Serbia'', ''Dalmatia'', ''Sklavonia'', etc., and eventually included much of the [[pomorje|maritime provinces]], including [[Travunia]] and [[Zachlumia]]. His realm probably stretched into the hinterland to include some parts of ''Zagorje'' (inland Serbia and Bosnia) as well. Vladimir\u2019s pre-eminent position over other Slavic nobles in the area explains why Emperor Basil approached him for an anti-Bulgarian alliance. With his hands tied by war in Anatolia, Emperor Basil required allies for his war against [[Tsar Samuel]], who ruled a [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian empire]] stretching over [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. In retaliation, Samuel invaded Duklja in 997, and pushed through [[Dalmatia]] up to the city of [[Zadar]], incorporating [[Bosnia]] and [[Serbia]] into his realm. After defeating Vladimir, Samuel reinstated him as a [[vassal]] prince. We do not know what Vladimir\u2019s connection was to the previous princes of Serbia, or to the rulers of Croatia--much of what is written in the [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]] about the genealogy of the Doclean rulers is mythological. Vladimir was murdered by Vladislav, Samuel\u2019s brother and successor, circa 1016 AD. The last prominent member of his family, his uncle Dragimir, was killed by some local citizens in Kotor in 1018. That same year, the Byzantines defeated the Bulgarians, and in one masterful stroke re-took virtually all of southeastern Europe.{{sfn|\u0106irkovi\u0107|2004|p=}}\n\n== Government ==\n{{Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty sidebar}}\nThe Serbian ruler was titled \"Prince (''[[archon]]'') of the Serbs\" (\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03bd \u03a3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2).{{sfn|Moravcsik|1967|p=156}} In [[Serbo-Croatian]] historiography, the Slavic title of ''[[Knez (title)|knez]]'' (\u043a\u043d\u0435\u0437) is used instead of the Greek ''arhont'' (\u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0442).{{sfn|SANU|1995|p=37}} The DAI mentions that the Serbian throne is inherited by ''the son'', i.e. the first-born; his descendants succeeded him, though their names are unknown until the coming of Vi\u0161eslav.{{sfn|\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b|1989|p=19}}{{sfn|\u0416\u0438\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|2006|p=22\u201323}} The Serbs at that time were organized into ''[[\u017eupe]]'' ({{singular abbr}} ''\u017eupa''), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local ''\u017eupan'' (a magistrate or governor); the governorship was hereditary, and the ''\u017eupan'' reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=225, 304}}\n\nAccording to [[V. \u0106orovi\u0107]], the Serbs at first lived withdrawn in gorges, in their old tribal organization.
