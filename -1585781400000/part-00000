Eighteen teams contested the competition, which ended with [[Hajduk Split]] winning their fourth title, club's first in 16 years.\n\n==Incidents==\nThe season featured an incident that occurred in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]'s [[Stadion Stari plac|Stari plac Stadium]] on 23 September 1970 during the Hajduk vs. [[OFK Beograd]] week 7 league fixture. With the score tied at 2-2, match referee Pavle Risti\u0107 from [[Novi Sad]] fell unconscious in the 52nd minute after getting hit in the head with an object thrown from the stands. The match was stopped and the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav FA]]'s (FSJ) disciplinary body made a ruling to register it with a 0-3 score for OFK Beograd.\n\nThe disciplinary measure set off huge days-long, often violent protests in Split that quickly assumed a distinctly anti-[[Belgrade]] and anti-[[Serb]] tone. Led by the club's hardcore fans [[Torcida Split|Torcida]], the practice of seeking out parked cars with the city of Belgrade [[Vehicle registration plates of Serbia|license plates]] and pushing them into the [[Adriatic Sea]] from the [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] was especially widespread in Split during the protests. The press also reported about some of the gathered mob spontaneously launching into a cynical and sarcastic rendition of [[Sergio Endrigo]]'s then current and popular song \"Kud plovi ovaj brod\" ('Where is This Ship Going') as the cars with Belgrade plates were pushed into the sea and floated in the water before sinking.<ref>{{cite news|first=Alen|last=Orli\u0107|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20031112/sport01.asp|title=Zdravko Rei\u0107: Izop\u0107ili su me iz Hajduka ZBOG SLU\u010cAJA \u0160I\u0160MI\u0160|newspaper=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|date=12 November 2003|accessdate=24 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111041539/http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20031112/sport01.asp|archive-date=11 November 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to their political undertones and the potential to undermine the [[Brotherhood and unity|country's official inter-ethnic guiding principle]] during the sensitive time when [[MASPOK]] was gathering steam in [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]], the Split football protests quickly came to the attention of Yugoslav politicians who decided to deal with the situation by pressing FSJ into changing its disciplinary ruling and registering the 2-2 score.

At the invitation of the [[Bishop of Kensington]] and with the support of local churches, a small group from a church in Fulham, joined by other friends and supporters in the Teddington area, were asked to re-establish a church community in the previously redundant building of St Michael's Fulwell.\n\nThe church launched a regular Sunday 10:00 am service in January 2015. Soon after, the informal 6.30 pm service was started.  In the midst of it all, the church has refurbished the side-chapel and some side-rooms where almost all the services and activities initially took place. However, in 2016 the side-chapel was deemed too small for the growing morning congregation and so a temporary indoor marquee was constructed in the main part of the church. The church aims to restore the rest of the building in the future.\n\nThe church meets at 10:00 am on Sundays for a family service and at 6:30 pm for an informal service.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.stmichaelsfulwell.co.uk/ Official website]\n\n{{Places of worship in Richmond upon Thames}}\n{{LB Richmond}}\n{{Churches in Richmond upon Thames}}\n{{coord|51.4335|-0.3477|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:St Michael's, Fulwell}}\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in 1913]]\n[[Category:1913 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Church of England church buildings in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Fulwell]]\n[[Category:Diocese of London]]\n[[Category:History of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=September 2018}} \n{{Infobox church\n| denomination           = [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]\n| name                   = St Michael's Fulwell\n| fullname               = Church of St Michael and St George\n| image                  = File:St Michael & St George, Wilcox Road, Fulwell (geograph 2833855).jpg\n| imagesize              =\n| caption                =\n| pushpin map            =\n| pushpin label position =\n| pushpin map alt        =\n| latm                   = \n| latNS                  = \n| latd                   = \n| longm                  =\n| longEW                 = \n| longd                  =\n| lats                   =\n| longs                  =\n| pushpin mapsize        =\n| map caption            =\n| coordinates            = \n| country                = [[England]]\n| osgridref              = \n| location               = [[Fulwell, London]]\n| previous denomination  =\n| churchmanship          =\n| membership             = \n| attendance             =\n| website                = [http://stmichaelsfulwell.co.uk/  http://stmichaelsfulwell.co.uk/]\n| former name            =\n| bull date              =\n| founded date           = 1913; reopened 2014\n| founder                =\n| dedication             = \n| dedicated date         =\n| consecrated date       = \n| cult                   =\n| relics                 =\n| events                 =\n| past bishop            =\n| people                 = \n| status                 = \n| functional status      = Active\n| heritage designation   =\n| designated date        =\n| architect              = \n| architectural type     =\n| style                  = \n| groundbreaking         = \n| completed date         = \n| construction cost      = \n| closed date            = 2006\u201314\n| demolished date        =\n| capacity               =\n| length                 =\n| width                  =\n| width nave             =\n| height                 =\n| diameter               =\n| other dimensions       =\n| floor count            =\n| floor area             =\n| dome quantity          =\n| dome height outer      =\n| dome height inner      =\n| dome dia outer         =\n| dome dia inner         =\n| spire quantity         =\n| spire height           =\n| materials              =\n| parish                 = \n| deanery                = Hampton\n| archdeaconry           = Middlesex\n| episcopalarea          = Kensington\n| archdiocese            =\n| diocese                = [[Diocese of London]]\n| province               = Canterbury\n| presbytery             =\n| synod                  =\n| circuit                =\n| district               =\n| division               =\n| subdivision            =\n| archbishop             =\n| bishop                 = The Rt Revd & Rt Hon Dr [[Richard Chartres]]; The Rt Revd Paul Williams; The Rt Revd Graham Tomlin\n| abbot                  =\n| vicar                  = \n| provost-rector         =\n| provost                =\n| viceprovost            =\n| rector                 =\n| dean                   =\n| subdean                =\n| precentor              =\n| canon                  =\n| canonpastor            =\n| prebendary             =\n| priestincharge         =\n| priest                 =\n| asstpriest             =\n| honpriest              = \n| curate                 =\n| minister               =The Revd Ed Kendall.

At the invitation of the [[Bishop of Kensington]] and with the support of local churches, a small group from a church in Fulham, joined by other friends and supporters in the Teddington area, were asked to re-establish a church community in the previously redundant building of St Michael's Fulwell.\n\nThe church launched a regular Sunday 10:00 am service in January 2015. Soon after, the informal 6.30 pm service was started.  In the midst of it all, the church has refurbished the side-chapel and some side-rooms where almost all the services and activities initially took place. However, in 2016 the side-chapel was deemed too small for the growing morning congregation and so a temporary indoor marquee was constructed in the main part of the church. The church aims to restore the rest of the building in the future.\n\nThe church meets at 10:00 am on Sundays for a family service and at 6:30 pm for an informal service.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.stmichaelsfulwell.co.uk/ Official website]\n\n{{Places of worship in Richmond upon Thames}}\n{{LB Richmond}}\n{{Churches in Richmond upon Thames}}\n{{coord|51.4335|-0.3477|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:St Michael's, Fulwell}}\n[[Category:1913 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Church of England church buildings in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Fulwell]]\n[[Category:Diocese of London]]\n[[Category:History of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]]\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in 1913]]\n", "name_user": "Headhitter", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Reordered cats", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael%27s,_Fulwell"}
