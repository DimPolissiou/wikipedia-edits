In October 2017, Rae-Venter was contributing to the team attempting to identify the killer. Rae-Venter utilized [[GEDmatch]], and provided structure to the team's genetic search efforts.<ref name=mercurynews /> The team isolated a DNA sample from a Golden State Killer crime scene to create a DNA profile that could be uploaded to GEDMatch, and then worked from profiles that were identified to create [[family tree]]s. By identifying relatives of the killer, investigators could work back to find a common ancestor and then work forward to identify all members of the younger generations. Once all members of a family had been identified, investigators could then start eliminating individuals who were not suspects. In the case of the Golden State Killer, the team needed to go back to great-great-great grandparents before starting to work forward.<ref name=mercurynews /> Multiple family trees needed to be constructed.<ref name=oxygen /> This information was combined with predictions about ethnicity and physical appearance to narrow down the suspect list.<ref name=mercurynews /> Multiple pieces of evidence started to converge when the genetic profiles were considered, including the possibility that the suspect had [[Italians|Italian]] heritage.<ref name=oxygen /> After the suspect had been identified, new DNA samples were collected from the suspect surreptitiously and tested against crime scene samples. The suspect's samples matched those from the killer, confirming his identity.

She has also been one of the most sought after voices when ethical questions arise about the use of shared genetic data by law enforcement.  At the conclusion of the Golden State Killer case, Rae-Venter discussed future cases that she was working on, including the [[Boy in the Box (Philadelphia)|Boy in the Box]] case in Pennsylvania.<ref name=mercurynews />  In 2019, Rae-Venter helped identify the remains of a boy who had been found in 1998.

Searches of online databases identified a possible relative, who could identify the child.  The child's family had assumed he had returned to [[South Korea]] with his mother.

In October 2017, Rae-Venter was contributing to the team attempting to identify the killer. Rae-Venter utilized [[GEDmatch]], and provided structure to the team's genetic search efforts.<ref name=mercurynews /> The team isolated a DNA sample from a Golden State Killer crime scene to create a DNA profile that could be uploaded to GEDMatch, and then worked from profiles that were identified to create [[family tree]]s. By identifying relatives of the killer, investigators could work back to find a common ancestor and then work forward to identify all members of the younger generations. Once all members of a family had been identified, investigators could then start eliminating individuals who were not suspects. In the case of the Golden State Killer, the team needed to go back to great-great-great grandparents before starting to work forward.<ref name=mercurynews /> Multiple family trees needed to be constructed.<ref name=oxygen /> This information was combined with predictions about ethnicity and physical appearance to narrow down the suspect list.<ref name=mercurynews /> Multiple pieces of evidence started to converge when the genetic profiles were considered, including the possibility that the suspect had [[Italians|Italian]] heritage.<ref name=oxygen /> After the suspect had been identified, new DNA samples were collected from the suspect surreptitiously and tested against crime scene samples. The suspect's samples matched those from the killer, confirming his identity.

The intervening months had seen increased interest in genetic genealogy, and additional people had been identified in the field.<ref name=\"20180829NYT\" />  After her role in the Golden State Killer case became well-known, Rae-Venter was approached to assist in at least 50 unsolved cases, including homicides and unidentified victims.<ref name=ktvu>{{cite web|title=Critical genealogist in Golden State Killer case speaks out about her role|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/critical-genealogist-in-golden-state-killer-case-speaks-out-about-her-role|accessdate = March 11, 2019|date=August 30, 2018|publisher=Fox 2 KTVU | author = Lee, Amber}}</ref>\n\n===Additional cases===\nAs one of the first public faces of genetic genealogy in law enforcement in the United States, Rae-Venter has been asked to consult on additional cases, and also to comment on the ethics of using shared community data for law enforcement purposes.  She has also been one of the most sought after voices when ethical questions arise about the use of shared genetic data by law enforcement.  At the conclusion of the Golden State Killer case, Rae-Venter discussed future cases that she was working on, including the [[Boy in the Box (Philadelphia)|Boy in the Box]] case in Pennsylvania.<ref name=mercurynews />  In 2019, Rae-Venter helped identify the remains of a boy who had been found in 1998.  Based on the DNA profile of the child, she determined that the child was likely of mixed Asian and white descent.  Searches of online databases identified a possible relative, who could identify the child.  The child's family had assumed he had returned to [[South Korea]] with his mother.  This discovery also resulted in the identification of his mother's remains.  A suspect, who was already incarcerated on other charges was identified.<ref name=northcarolina>{{cite web|title=Ancestry DNA leads to identity of boy whose remains were found in 1998 | url=https://abc6onyourside.com/news/nation-world/ancestry-dna-leads-to-identity-of-boy-found-murdered-in-1998 | date=2019-02-05|accessdate = 2019-09-13|publisher=ABC6}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the late 1960s, while in Sydney, Australia, she met [[J.
