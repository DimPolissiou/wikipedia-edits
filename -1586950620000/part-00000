[[Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus.<ref name=\"Catholic News Service\"/> Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. [[Emperor Constantine]] legalized the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted [[Arian Christianity]], eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.\n\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries, expanding [[Muslim conquests]] following the advent of [[Islam]] led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between [[Rome]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Eastern Orthodox opposition to papal supremacy|Conflicts involving authority in the church]], particularly the [[Ecclesiastical differences between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church#Papal authority|authority of the Bishop of Rome]] finally culminated in the [[East\u2013West Schism]] in the 11th century, splitting the church into the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Churches. Earlier splits within the church occurred after the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in [[communion (Christian)|communion]] with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].\n\nEarly monasteries throughout Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman [[classical civilization]]. The church eventually became the dominant influence in Western civilization into the modern age. Many [[Renaissance]] figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the [[Protestant Reformation]], as well as in the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the [[New World]].\n\nIn 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] declared the dogma of [[papal infallibility]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the city of Rome, the last portion of the [[Papal States]] to be incorporated into the new nation. In the 20th century, anti-clerical governments around the world, including Mexico and Spain, persecuted or executed thousands of clerics and laypersons. In the Second World War, the church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the [[Holocaust]]; its efforts, however, have been criticized as inadequate. After the war, freedom of religion was severely restricted in the [[Communist]] countries newly aligned with the [[Soviet Union]], several of which had large Catholic populations.\n\nIn the 1960s, the [[Second Vatican Council]] led to reforms of the church's liturgy and practices, described as \"opening the windows\" by defenders, but criticized by [[traditionalist Catholic]]s. In the face of increased criticism from both within and without, the church has upheld or reaffirmed at various times controversial doctrinal positions regarding sexuality and gender, including limiting clergy to males, and moral exhortations against [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[Human sexual activity#Sex outside of marriage|sexual activity]] outside of marriage, remarriage following [[divorce]] without [[annulment]], and against [[same-sex marriage]].\n\n===Apostolic era and papacy===\n{{Main|Apostolic Age}}\n[[File:DambachVille StEtienne 14.JPG|thumb|Jesus' commission to [[Saint Peter]]]]\nThe [[New Testament]], in particular the [[Gospels]], records Jesus' activities and teaching, his appointment of the [[twelve Apostles]] and his [[Great Commission]] of the [[Apostles]], instructing them to continue his work.<ref name=\"bokenkotter30\"/><ref name=\"Kreeft98O\">Kreeft, p. 980.</ref> The book [[Acts of Apostles]], tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman empire.<ref>Burkett, p. 263</ref> <!--from Acts of the Apostles--> The Catholic Church teaches that its public ministry began on [[Pentecost]], occurring fifty days following the date Christ is believed to have [[Resurrection of Christ|resurrected]].<ref name=\"Barry48\"/> At Pentecost, the Apostles are believed to have received the Holy Spirit, preparing them for their mission in leading the church.<ref>{{CCC|1076|11/8/14|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1.htm|quote=\u00a7&nbsp;1076: The Church was made manifest to the world on the day of Pentecost by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit....}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |wstitle=Holy Ghost}}<br />\"He [the Holy Spirit] is essentially the Spirit of truth (John 14:16\u201317; 15:26), Whose office it is to ...to teach the Apostles the full meaning of it [of the truth] (John 14:26; 16:13).

In considering this point, it will be well to begin with the third century, when references to it become frequent, and work backwards from this point. In the middle of the third century St. Cyprian expressly terms the Roman See the Chair of St. Peter, saying that Cornelius has succeeded to \"the place of Fabian which is the place of Peter\" (Ep 55:8; cf. 59:14). Firmilian of Caesarea notices that Stephen claimed to decide the controversy regarding rebaptism on the ground that he held the succession from Peter (Cyprian, Ep. 75:17). He does not deny the claim: yet certainly, had he been able, he would have done so. Thus in 250 the Roman episcopate of Peter was admitted by those best able to know the truth, not merely at Rome but in the churches of Africa and of Asia Minor. In the first quarter of the century (about 220) Tertullian (De Pud. 21) mentions Callistus's claim that Peter's power to forgive sins had descended in a special manner to him. Had the Roman Church been merely founded by Peter and not reckoned him as its first bishop, there could have been no ground for such a contention. Tertullian, like Firmilian, had every motive to deny the claim. Moreover, he had himself resided at Rome, and would have been well aware if the idea of a Roman episcopate of Peter had been, as is contended by its opponents, a novelty dating from the first years of the third century, supplanting the older tradition according to which Peter and Paul were co-founders, and Linus first bishop. About the same period, Hippolytus (for Lightfoot is surely right in holding him to be the author of the first part of the \"Liberian Catalogue\" \u2013 \"Clement of Rome\", 1:259) reckons Peter in the list of Roman bishops....\"<ref name=JoyceCE1913/>|}} Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/was-peter-in-rome |title=Was Peter in Rome? |publisher=Catholic Answers |date=10 August 2004 |quote=if Peter never made it to the capital, he still could have been the first pope, since one of his successors could have been the first holder of that office to settle in Rome.

The Churches which, while not existing in perfect ''Koinonia'' with the Catholic Church, remain united to her by means of the closest bonds, that is, by apostolic succession and a valid Eucharist, are true [[particular Churches]]. Therefore, the Church of Christ is present and operative also in these Churches, even though they lack full communion with the Catholic Church, since they do not accept the Catholic doctrine of the Primacy, which, according to the will of God, the Bishop of Rome objectively has and exercises over the entire Church. ... 'The Christian faithful are therefore not permitted to imagine that the Church of Christ is nothing more than a collection\u2014divided, yet in some way one\u2014of Churches and [[ecclesial community|ecclesial communities]]; nor are they free to hold that today the Church of Christ nowhere really exists, and must be considered only as a goal which all Churches and ecclesial communities must strive to reach.'}}</ref>\n\n<!--UNUSED REF AS OF APRIL 2017<ref name=suiiuris>{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2057012/Malankara-Catholic-Church-sui-iuris-Juridical-Status-and-Power-of-Governance |title=Malankara Catholic Church sui iuris: Juridical Status and Power of Governance |work=Scribd |quote=A church ''sui iuris'' is \"a community of the Christian faithful, which is joined together by a hierarchy according to the norm of law and which is expressly or tacitly recognized as sui iuris by the supreme authority of the Church\" (CCEO.27).

This canonical term, pregnant with many juridical nuances, indicates the God-given mission of the Oriental Catholic Churches to keep up their patrimonial autonomous nature.

[[Catholic theology|Catholic doctrine]] teaches that the contemporary Catholic Church is the continuation of this early Christian community established by Jesus.<ref name=\"Catholic News Service\"/> Christianity spread throughout the early Roman Empire, despite persecutions due to conflicts with the pagan state religion. [[Emperor Constantine]] legalized the practice of Christianity in 313, and it became the state religion in 380. Germanic invaders of Roman territory in the 5th and 6th centuries, many of whom had previously adopted [[Arian Christianity]], eventually adopted Catholicism to ally themselves with the papacy and the monasteries.\n\nIn the 7th and 8th centuries, expanding [[Muslim conquests]] following the advent of [[Islam]] led to an Arab domination of the Mediterranean that severed political connections between that area and northern Europe, and weakened cultural connections between [[Rome]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Eastern Orthodox opposition to papal supremacy|Conflicts involving authority in the church]], particularly the [[Ecclesiastical differences between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church#Papal authority|authority of the Bishop of Rome]] finally culminated in the [[East\u2013West Schism]] in the 11th century, splitting the church into the Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Churches. Earlier splits within the church occurred after the [[Council of Ephesus]] (431) and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451). However, a few Eastern Churches remained in [[communion (Christian)|communion]] with Rome, and portions of some others established communion in the 15th century and later, forming what are called the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].\n\nEarly monasteries throughout Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman [[classical civilization]]. The church eventually became the dominant influence in Western civilization into the modern age. Many [[Renaissance]] figures were sponsored by the church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the [[Protestant Reformation]], as well as in the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the [[New World]].\n\nIn 1870, the [[First Vatican Council]] declared the dogma of [[papal infallibility]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]] annexed the city of Rome, the last portion of the [[Papal States]] to be incorporated into the new nation. In the 20th century, anti-clerical governments around the world, including Mexico and Spain, persecuted or executed thousands of clerics and laypersons.

In considering this point, it will be well to begin with the third century, when references to it become frequent, and work backwards from this point. In the middle of the third century St. Cyprian expressly terms the Roman See the Chair of St. Peter, saying that Cornelius has succeeded to \"the place of Fabian which is the place of Peter\" (Ep 55:8; cf. 59:14). Firmilian of Caesarea notices that Stephen claimed to decide the controversy regarding rebaptism on the ground that he held the succession from Peter (Cyprian, Ep. 75:17). He does not deny the claim: yet certainly, had he been able, he would have done so. Thus in 250 the Roman episcopate of Peter was admitted by those best able to know the truth, not merely at Rome but in the churches of Africa and of Asia Minor. In the first quarter of the century (about 220) Tertullian (De Pud. 21) mentions Callistus's claim that Peter's power to forgive sins had descended in a special manner to him. Had the Roman Church been merely founded by Peter and not reckoned him as its first bishop, there could have been no ground for such a contention. Tertullian, like Firmilian, had every motive to deny the claim. Moreover, he had himself resided at Rome, and would have been well aware if the idea of a Roman episcopate of Peter had been, as is contended by its opponents, a novelty dating from the first years of the third century, supplanting the older tradition according to which Peter and Paul were co-founders, and Linus first bishop. About the same period, Hippolytus (for Lightfoot is surely right in holding him to be the author of the first part of the \"Liberian Catalogue\" \u2013 \"Clement of Rome\", 1:259) reckons Peter in the list of Roman bishops....\"<ref name=JoyceCE1913/>|}} Others say that the institution of the papacy is not dependent on the idea that Peter was Bishop of Rome or even on his ever having been in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.com/tracts/was-peter-in-rome |title=Was Peter in Rome? |publisher=Catholic Answers |date=10 August 2004 |quote=if Peter never made it to the capital, he still could have been the first pope, since one of his successors could have been the first holder of that office to settle in Rome.

[[Raymond E.

Sometimes warehouses are designed for the loading and unloading of goods directly from [[railway]]s, [[airport]]s, or [[seaport]]s. They often have [[crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[Forklift truck|forklift]]s for moving goods, which are usually placed on [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard [[pallet]]s loaded into [[pallet racking|pallet rack]]s. Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, [[spare part]]s, components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing, and production. In India and Hong Kong, a warehouse may be referred to as a godown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/godown|title=godown - Definition of godown in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref> There are also godowns in the [[Shanghai Bund]].\n\n==History==\nA warehouse can be defined functionally as a building in which to store bulk produce or goods (''wares'') for commercial purposes. The built form of warehouse structures throughout time depends on many contexts: materials, technologies, sites, and cultures.\n\nIn this sense, the warehouse postdates the need for communal or state-based mass storage of surplus food. Prehistoric civilizations relied on family- or community-owned [[Prehistoric storage pits|storage pits]], or \u2018palace\u2019 storerooms, such as at [[Knossos]], to protect surplus food. The archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] argued that gathering and storing agricultural surpluses in Bronze Age Minoan \u2018palaces\u2019 was a critical ingredient in the formation of proto-state power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Emergence of Civilisation: The Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC.|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|publisher=Methuen|year=1972|isbn=0-416-16480-3|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe need for ''ware''houses developed in societies in which trade reached a critical mass requiring storage at some point in the exchange process. This was highly evident in ancient Rome, where the horreum (pl. horrea) became a standard building form.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Roman Granaries and Store Buildings|last=Rickman|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|isbn=0-521-07724-9|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref> &nbsp;The most studied examples are in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the port city that served Rome. The [[Horrea Galbae]], a warehouse complex on the road towards Ostia, demonstrates that these buildings could be substantial, even by modern standards. Galba's horrea complex contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m\u00b2). As a point of reference, less than half of U.S. warehouses today are larger than 100,000 square feet (9290 m\u00b2).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.action-storage.com/blog/general/history-of-the-warehouse/|title=A History of the Warehouse|last=Anon.|first=Michael|date=15 October 2018|website=Action Storage|archive-url=https://www.action-storage.com/blog/|url-status=}}</ref>\n\nThe need for a warehouse implies having quantities of goods too big to be stored in a domestic storeroom. But as attested by legislation concerning the levy of duties, some medieval merchants across Europe commonly kept goods in their large household storerooms, often on the ground floor or cellars.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Palaces of Medieval Venice|last=Schulz|first=Jurgen|publisher=Penn State Press|year=2004|isbn=0-271-04836-0|location=University Park PA|pages=26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Merchant Venturers: Collected Studies|last=Carus-Wilson|first=E.M.|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-136-58279-0|location=Hoboken NJ|pages=}}</ref> An example is the [[Fondaco dei Tedeschi]], the substantial quarters of German traders in Venice, which combined a dwelling, warehouse, market and quarters for travellers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trade, Travel, and Exploration in the Middle Ages: An Encyclopedia|last=Friedman, John Block (1) & Figg, Kristeb Mossler (2), Eds|publisher=Garland|year=2000|isbn=978-1-135-59094-9|location=New York|pages=196}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Middle Ages on, dedicated warehouses were constructed around ports and other commercial hubs to facilitate large-scale trade. The warehouses of the trading port [[Bryggen]] in Bergen, Norway (now a World Heritage site), demonstrate characteristic European gabled timber forms dating from the late Middle Ages, though what remains today was largely rebuilt in the same traditional style following great fires in 1702 and 1955.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, the function of warehouses evolved and became more specialised. Always a building of function, in the past few decades warehouses have adapted to standardisation, mechanisation, technological innovation and changes in supply chain methods.\n\nThe mass production of goods launched by the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries fuelled the development of larger and more specialised warehouses, usually located close to transport hubs on canals, at railways and portside. Specialisation of tasks is characteristic of the [[factory system]], which developed in British textile mills and potteries in the mid-late 1700s. Factory processes speeded up work and deskilled labour, bringing new profits to capital investment.\n\nWarehouses also fulfill a range of commercial functions besides simple storage, exemplified by [[Manchester cotton warehouses|Manchester's cotton warehouses]] and Australian wool stores: receiving, stockpiling and despatching goods; displaying goods for commercial buyers; packing, checking and labelling orders, and dispatching them.\n\nThe utilitarian architecture of warehouses responded fast to emerging technologies. Before and into the nineteenth century, the basic European warehouse was built of load-bearing masonry walls or heavy-framed timber with a suitable external cladding. Inside, heavy timber posts supported timber beams and joists for the upper levels, rarely more than four to five stories high.\n\nA gabled roof was conventional, with a gate in the gable facing the street, rail lines or port for a crane to hoist goods into the window-gates on each floor below. Convenient access for road transport was built-in via very large doors on the ground floor. If not in a separate building, office and display spaces were located on the ground or first floor.\n\nTechnological innovations of the early 19th century changed the shape of warehouses and the work performed inside them: cast iron columns and later, moulded steel posts; saw-tooth roofs; and steam power. All (except steel) were adopted quickly and were in common use by the middle of the 19th century.\n\n:1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Strong, slender [[Cast-iron architecture|cast iron columns]] began to replace masonry piers or timber posts to carry levels above the ground floor. As modern [[Steel frame|steel framing]] developed in the late 19th century, its strength and constructability enabled the first skyscrapers. Steel girders replaced timber beams, increasing the span of internal bays in the warehouse.\n\n:2. &nbsp; &nbsp;The [[saw-tooth roof]] brought natural light to the top story of the warehouse. It transformed the shape of the warehouse, from the traditional peaked hip or gable to an essentially flat roof form that was often hidden behind a parapet. Warehouse buildings now became strongly horizontal. Inside the top floor, the vertical glazed pane of each saw-tooth enabled natural lighting over displayed goods, improving buyer inspection.\n\n:3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Hoists and cranes driven by [[Steam engine|steam power]] expanded the capacity of manual labour to lift and move heavy goods.\n\nTwo more new power sources, hydraulics, and electricity, re-shaped warehouse design and practice at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century.\n\n:1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Public [[hydraulic power network]]s were constructed in many large industrial cities around the world in the 1870s-80s, exemplified by [[Manchester Hydraulic Power|Manchester]]. They were highly effective to power cranes and lifts, whose application in warehouses served taller buildings and enabled new labour efficiencies.\n\n:2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Public [[Electric power industry|electricity networks]] emerged in the 1890s. They were used at first mainly for lighting and soon to electrify lifts, making possible taller, more efficient warehouses. It took several decades for electrical power to be distributed widely throughout cities in the western world.\n\n20th-century technologies made warehousing ever more efficient. Electricity became widely available and transformed lighting, security, lifting and transport from the 1900s. The [[internal combustion engine]], developed in the late 19th century, was installed in mass-produced vehicles from the 1910s. It not only reshaped transport methods but enabled many applications as a compact, portable power plant, wherever small engines were needed.\n\nThe [[forklift]] truck was invented in the early 20th century and came into wide use after World War II. Forklifts transformed the possibilities of multi-level [[pallet racking]] of goods in taller, single-level steel-framed buildings for higher storage density. The forklift, and its load fixed to a uniform [[pallet]], enabled the rise of [[Logistics|logistic]] approaches to storage in the later 20th century.\n<!-- Holding text- to allow the introduction of a photo gallery References or radical edit appreciated-->\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:GlosDocks.jpg| 19th-century warehouses in [[Gloucester]] docks in the [[United Kingdom]], originally used to store imported corn\nFile:Horgen - Sust-Ortsmuseum - Z\u00fcrichsee IMG 3829.JPG| A ''Sust'', a [[Middle Ages]] type of warehouse, in [[Horgen]], [[Switzerland]]\nFile:Atlantic Dock, Brooklyn, ca. 1872-1887.

Their street frontage was impressive, so they took the styles of Italianate [[Palazzo style architecture|Palazzi]].\n\n[[Richard Cobden]]'s construction in Manchester's [[Mosley Street]] was the first [[Palazzo style architecture|palazzo]] warehouse. There were already seven warehouses on [[Portland Street, Manchester|Portland Street]] when S. & J. Watts & Co. commenced building the elaborate [[Watts Warehouse]] of 1855,<ref name=\"Wyke\">{{cite web|url=http://www.revealinghistories.org.uk/why-was-cotton-so-important-in-north-west-england/places/manchester-warehouses.html|title=Manchester warehouses|last=Wyke|first=Terry|work=Revealing Histories: Remembering Slavery|publisher=Manchester City Galleries|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"PB81\">{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=81}}</ref> but four more were opened before it was finished.\n\n=== Cool warehouses and cold storage ===\n{{main|Cool warehouse}}\nCold storage preserves agricultural products. Refrigerated storage helps in eliminating [[sprouting]], [[Decomposition|rotting]] and insect damage. Edible products are generally not stored for more than one year. Several [[perishable]] products require a storage temperature as low as \u221225&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nCold storage helps stabilize [[market price]]s and evenly distribute goods both on demand and timely basis. The farmers get the opportunity of producing [[cash crops]] to get remunerative prices. The consumers get the supply of perishable commodities with lower fluctuation of prices.\n\n[[Ammonia]] and [[Freon]] compressors are commonly used in cold storage warehouses to maintain the temperature. Ammonia refrigerant is cheaper, easily available, and has a high latent [[heat of evaporation]], but it is also highly [[toxic]] and can form [[ANFO|an explosive mixture]] when mixed with fuel oil. [[Building insulation|Insulation]] is also important, to reduce the loss of cold and to keep different sections of the warehouse at different temperatures.\n\nThere are two main types of refrigeration system used in cold storage warehouses: [[vapor absorption refrigeration|vapor absorption systems]] (VAS) and [[vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression systems]] (VCS). VAS, although comparatively costlier to install, is more economical in operation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe temperature necessary for [[Food preservation|preservation]] depends on the storage time required and the type of product. In general, there are three groups of products, foods that are alive (e.g. fruits and vegetables), foods that are no longer alive and have been processed in some form (e.g. meat and fish products), and commodities that benefit from storage at controlled temperature (e.g. beer, tobacco).\n\nLocation is important for the success of a cold storage facility. It should be in close proximity to a growing area as well as a market,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} be easily accessible for heavy vehicles, and have an uninterrupted power supply.\n\n=== Overseas warehouses ===\nThese catered for the overseas trade. They became the meeting places for overseas wholesale buyers where printed and plain could be discussed and ordered.<ref name=\"Wyke\"/> Trade in cloth in Manchester was conducted by many nationalities.\n\nBehrens Warehouse is on the corner of [[Oxford Street, Manchester|Oxford Street]] and [[Portland Street]]. It was built for Louis Behrens & Son by P Nunn in 1860. It is a four-storey predominantly red brick build with 23 bays along Portland Street and 9 along Oxford Street.<ref name = PB81/> The Behrens family were prominent in banking and in the social life of the German Community in Manchester.<ref name=PB84>{{harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=84}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Coates\">{{cite journal|last=Coates|first=Su|date=1991\u201392|title=German Gentlemen: Immigrant Institutions in a Provincial City 1840\u20131920|journal=Manchester Region History Review|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.mcrh.mmu.ac.uk/pubs/pdf/mrhr_05ii_coates.pdf|access-date=2012-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210182518/http://www.mcrh.mmu.ac.uk/pubs/pdf/mrhr_05ii_coates.pdf|archive-date=2012-02-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Packing warehouses ===\n''Modern term: [[Fulfillment house]]''\n\nThe main purpose of packing warehouses was the picking, checking, labelling and packing of goods for export.<ref name=\"Wyke\"/>  The packing warehouses: [[Asia House, Manchester|Asia House]], [[India House, Manchester|India House]] and Velvet House along [[Whitworth Street]] in Manchester were some of the tallest buildings of their time.  See [[List of packing houses]].\n\n=== Railway warehouses ===\nWarehouses were built close to the major stations in railway hubs. The first railway warehouse to be built was opposite the passenger platform at the terminus of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]]. There was an important group of warehouses around [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|London Road station]] (now Piccadilly station).In the 1890s  the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway Company]]\u2019s [[Great Northern Warehouse|warehouse]] was completed on [[Deansgate]]: this was the last major railway warehouse to be built.<ref name=\"Wyke\"/>\n\nThe London Warehouse Picadilly was one of four warehouses built by the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]] in about 1865 to service the new London Road Station. It had its own branch to the [[Ashton Canal]]. This warehouse was built of brick with stone detailing. It had cast iron columns with wrought iron beams.<ref name=\"M 2002\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/history/victorian/Victorian3.html |title=Victorian Manchester: Textile Industries & Warehouses |last=Moss |first=John |date=2011-11-15 |encyclopedia=Manchester 2000 Virtual Encyclopedia |publisher=Papillon Graphics |accessdate=26 January 2012 |location=Manchester |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127194533/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/history/victorian/Victorian3.html |archivedate=27 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Canal warehouses ===\n{{further|Canal warehouse}}\nAll these warehouse types can trace their origins back to the canal warehouses which were used for trans-shipment and storage. [[Castlefield]] warehouses are of this type- and important as they were built at the terminus of the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in 1761.\n\n==Operations==\nA customised storage building, a warehouse enables a business to stockpile goods, e.g., to build up a full load prior to transport, or hold unloaded goods before further distribution, or store goods like wine and cheese that require maturation. As a place for storage, the warehouse has to be secure, convenient, and as spacious as possible, according to the owner's resources, the site and contemporary building technology. &nbsp;Before mechanised technology developed, warehouse functions relied on human labour, using mechanical lifting aids like pulley systems.\n\n===Storage and shipping systems===\nSome of the most common warehouse storage systems are:\n*  [[Pallet racking]] including selective, drive-in, drive-thru, double-deep, pushback, and gravity flow\n*  Cantilever racking uses arms, rather than pallets, to store long thin objects like timber.\n*  [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine]] adds a semi-permanent story of storage within a warehouse<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palletrackingsystemsltd.co.uk/glossary/mezzanine-flooring/\n|title=Pallet Racking Systems Ltd|accessdate=26 February 2016|date=2014-02-18}}</ref>\n\n*  [[AS/RS|Vertical Lift Modules]] are packed systems with vertically arranged trays stored on both sides of the unit.\n*  [[AS/RS|Horizontal Carousels]] consist of a frame and a rotating carriage of bins.\n*  [[AS/RS|Vertical Carousels]] consisting of a series of carriers mounted on a vertical closed-loop track, inside a metal enclosure.\n\nA \"piece pick\" is a type of order selection process where a product is picked and handled in individual units and placed in an outer carton, tote or another container before shipping. Catalog companies and internet retailers are examples of predominantly piece-pick operations. Their customers rarely order in pallet or case quantities; instead, they typically order just one or two pieces of one or two items. Several elements make up the piece-pick system. They include the order, the picker, the pick module, the pick area, handling equipment, the container, the pick method used and the information technology used.<ref name=\"C4WDefault-2292585\">{{cite book |title=PICK THIS! A Compendium of Piece-Picking Process Alternatives|isbn=9781892663467  |date=September 1, 2009 |author=OPSdesign Consulting |publisher=Warehousing Education & Research Council (WERC)}}</ref> Every movement inside a warehouse must be accompanied by a [[work order]]. Warehouse operation can fail when workers move goods without work orders, or when a storage position is left unregistered in the system.\n\nMaterial direction and [[Track & Trace|tracking]] in a warehouse can be coordinated by a [[Warehouse Management System]] (WMS), a [[database]] driven computer program. [[Logistics]] personnel use the WMS to improve warehouse efficiency by directing pathways and to maintain accurate [[inventory]] by recording warehouse transactions.\n\n===Automation and optimization===\n{{main|Warehouse robotics}}\nSome warehouses are completely [[automation|automated]], and require only operators to work and handle all the task. Pallets and product move on a system of automated [[conveyor]]s, [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[automated storage and retrieval system]]s coordinated by [[programmable logic controller]]s and [[computer]]s running [[logistics automation]] software.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  These systems are often installed in [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] warehouses where temperatures are kept very cold to keep the product from spoiling.  This is especially true in electronics warehouses that require specific temperatures to avoid damaging parts. Automation is also common where land is expensive, as automated storage systems can use vertical space efficiently. These high-bay storage areas are often more than 10 meters (33&nbsp;feet) high, with some over 20 meters (65&nbsp;feet) high.  Automated storage systems can be built up to 40m high.\n\nFor a warehouse to function efficiently, the facility must be properly ''slotted''. Slotting addresses which storage medium a product is picked from ([[pallet racking|pallet rack]] or [[carton flow]]), and how they are picked (pick-to-light, [[Voice Directed Warehousing|pick-to-voice]], or pick-to-paper). With a proper slotting plan, a warehouse can improve its inventory rotation requirements\u2014such as [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO)]]\u2014control labor costs and increase productivity.<ref>[http://www.sdcexec.com/news/10327109/effectively-slotting-a-warehouse-or-distribution-center ''Effectively Slotting a Warehouse or Distribution Center''] by Paul Hansen and Kelvin Gibson.

It is important to know the dimensions of racking and the number of bays needed as well as the dimensions of the product to be stored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rackexpress.com/blog/pallet-rack/installation-guide-warehouse-storage-rack-systems/|title=Installation Guide to Warehouse Storage Rack Systems - Rack Express|website=www.rackexpress.com}}</ref>  Clearance should be accounted for if using a forklift or pallet mover to move inventory.\n\n==Recent trends==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nModern warehouses commonly use a system of wide aisle pallet racking<!-- Can this be considered a proper source? --> to store goods which can be loaded and unloaded using [[forklift trucks]].\n\nTraditional warehousing has declined since the last decades of the 20th century, with the gradual introduction of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] techniques.  The JIT system promotes product delivery directly from suppliers to consumer without the use of warehouses. However, with the gradual implementation of [[offshore outsourcing]] and [[offshoring]] in about the same time period, the distance between the manufacturer and the retailer (or the parts manufacturer and the industrial plant) grew considerably in many domains, necessitating at least one warehouse per country or per region in any typical [[supply chain]] for a given range of products.\n\nRecent retailing trends have led to the development of [[Warehouse stores|warehouse-style retail stores]]. These high-ceiling buildings display retail goods on tall, heavy-duty industrial racks rather than conventional retail shelving. Typically, items ready for sale are on the bottom of the racks, and crated or palletized inventory is in the upper rack.  Essentially, the same building serves as both a warehouse and retail store.\n\nAnother trend relates to [[vendor-managed inventory]] (VMI). This gives the vendor the control to maintain the level of stock in the store. This method has its own issue that the vendor gains access to the warehouse.\n\nLarge exporters and manufacturers use warehouses as distribution points for developing retail outlets in a particular region or country. This concept reduces end cost to the consumer and enhances the production sale ratio.\n\nCross-docking is a specialised type of distribution center (DC) in that little or no inventory is stored and product is received, processed (if needed) and shipped within a short timeframe. As in warehousing, there are different types of cross-docks.\n\nReverse logistics is another type of warehousing that has become popular for environmental reasons. The term refers to items that are going from the end user back to the distributor or manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Education ==\nThere are few non-profit organizations which are focused on imparting knowledge, education and research in the field of warehouse management and its role in the supply chain industry.

Sometimes warehouses are designed for the loading and unloading of goods directly from [[railway]]s, [[airport]]s, or [[seaport]]s. They often have [[crane (machine)|crane]]s and [[Forklift truck|forklift]]s for moving goods, which are usually placed on [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard [[pallet]]s loaded into [[pallet racking|pallet rack]]s. Stored goods can include any raw materials, packing materials, [[spare part]]s, components, or finished goods associated with agriculture, manufacturing, and production. In India and Hong Kong, a warehouse may be referred to as a godown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/godown|title=godown - Definition of godown in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref> There are also godowns in the [[Shanghai Bund]].\n\n==History==\nA warehouse can be defined functionally as a building in which to store bulk produce or goods (''wares'') for commercial purposes. The built form of warehouse structures throughout time depends on many contexts: materials, technologies, sites, and cultures.\n\nIn this sense, the warehouse postdates the need for communal or state-based mass storage of surplus food. Prehistoric civilizations relied on family- or community-owned [[Prehistoric storage pits|storage pits]], or \u2018palace\u2019 storerooms, such as at [[Knossos]], to protect surplus food. The archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] argued that gathering and storing agricultural surpluses in Bronze Age Minoan \u2018palaces\u2019 was a critical ingredient in the formation of proto-state power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Emergence of Civilisation: The Cyclades and the Aegean in the Third Millennium BC.|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|publisher=Methuen|year=1972|isbn=0-416-16480-3|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe need for ''ware''houses developed in societies in which trade reached a critical mass requiring storage at some point in the exchange process. This was highly evident in ancient Rome, where the horreum (pl. horrea) became a standard building form.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Roman Granaries and Store Buildings|last=Rickman|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|isbn=0-521-07724-9|location=Cambridge|pages=}}</ref> &nbsp;The most studied examples are in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]], the port city that served Rome. The [[Horrea Galbae]], a warehouse complex on the road towards Ostia, demonstrates that these buildings could be substantial, even by modern standards. Galba's horrea complex contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m\u00b2). As a point of reference, less than half of U.S. warehouses today are larger than 100,000 square feet (9290 m\u00b2).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.action-storage.com/blog/general/history-of-the-warehouse/|title=A History of the Warehouse|last=Anon.|first=Michael|date=15 October 2018|website=Action Storage|archive-url=https://www.action-storage.com/blog/|url-status=}}</ref>\n\nThe need for a warehouse implies having quantities of goods too big to be stored in a domestic storeroom. But as attested by legislation concerning the levy of duties, some medieval merchants across Europe commonly kept goods in their large household storerooms, often on the ground floor or cellars.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Palaces of Medieval Venice|last=Schulz|first=Jurgen|publisher=Penn State Press|year=2004|isbn=0-271-04836-0|location=University Park PA|pages=26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Medieval Merchant Venturers: Collected Studies|last=Carus-Wilson|first=E.M.|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-136-58279-0|location=Hoboken NJ|pages=}}</ref> An example is the [[Fondaco dei Tedeschi]], the substantial quarters of German traders in Venice, which combined a dwelling, warehouse, market and quarters for travellers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trade, Travel, and Exploration in the Middle Ages: An Encyclopedia|last=Friedman, John Block (1) & Figg, Kristeb Mossler (2), Eds|publisher=Garland|year=2000|isbn=978-1-135-59094-9|location=New York|pages=196}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Middle Ages on, dedicated warehouses were constructed around ports and other commercial hubs to facilitate large-scale trade. The warehouses of the trading port [[Bryggen]] in Bergen, Norway (now a World Heritage site), demonstrate characteristic European gabled timber forms dating from the late Middle Ages, though what remains today was largely rebuilt in the same traditional style following great fires in 1702 and 1955.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, the function of warehouses evolved and became more specialised. Always a building of function, in the past few decades warehouses have adapted to standardisation, mechanisation, technological innovation and changes in supply chain methods.\n\nThe mass production of goods launched by the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries fuelled the development of larger and more specialised warehouses, usually located close to transport hubs on canals, at railways and portside. Specialisation of tasks is characteristic of the [[factory system]], which developed in British textile mills and potteries in the mid-late 1700s. Factory processes speeded up work and deskilled labour, bringing new profits to capital investment.\n\nWarehouses also fulfill a range of commercial functions besides simple storage, exemplified by [[Manchester cotton warehouses|Manchester's cotton warehouses]] and Australian wool stores: receiving, stockpiling and despatching goods; displaying goods for commercial buyers; packing, checking and labelling orders, and dispatching them.\n\nThe utilitarian architecture of warehouses responded fast to emerging technologies. Before and into the nineteenth century, the basic European warehouse was built of load-bearing masonry walls or heavy-framed timber with a suitable external cladding. Inside, heavy timber posts supported timber beams and joists for the upper levels, rarely more than four to five stories high.\n\nA gabled roof was conventional, with a gate in the gable facing the street, rail lines or port for a crane to hoist goods into the window-gates on each floor below. Convenient access for road transport was built-in via very large doors on the ground floor. If not in a separate building, office and display spaces were located on the ground or first floor.\n\nTechnological innovations of the early 19th century changed the shape of warehouses and the work performed inside them: cast iron columns and later, moulded steel posts; saw-tooth roofs; and steam power. All (except steel) were adopted quickly and were in common use by the middle of the 19th century.\n\n:1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Strong, slender [[Cast-iron architecture|cast iron columns]] began to replace masonry piers or timber posts to carry levels above the ground floor. As modern [[Steel frame|steel framing]] developed in the late 19th century, its strength and constructability enabled the first skyscrapers. Steel girders replaced timber beams, increasing the span of internal bays in the warehouse.\n\n:2. &nbsp; &nbsp;The [[saw-tooth roof]] brought natural light to the top story of the warehouse. It transformed the shape of the warehouse, from the traditional peaked hip or gable to an essentially flat roof form that was often hidden behind a parapet. Warehouse buildings now became strongly horizontal. Inside the top floor, the vertical glazed pane of each saw-tooth enabled natural lighting over displayed goods, improving buyer inspection.\n\n:3. &nbsp; &nbsp;Hoists and cranes driven by [[Steam engine|steam power]] expanded the capacity of manual labour to lift and move heavy goods.\n\nTwo more new power sources, hydraulics, and electricity, re-shaped warehouse design and practice at the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century.\n\n:1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Public [[hydraulic power network]]s were constructed in many large industrial cities around the world in the 1870s-80s, exemplified by [[Manchester Hydraulic Power|Manchester]]. They were highly effective to power cranes and lifts, whose application in warehouses served taller buildings and enabled new labour efficiencies.\n\n:2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Public [[Electric power industry|electricity networks]] emerged in the 1890s. They were used at first mainly for lighting and soon to electrify lifts, making possible taller, more efficient warehouses. It took several decades for electrical power to be distributed widely throughout cities in the western world.\n\n20th-century technologies made warehousing ever more efficient. Electricity became widely available and transformed lighting, security, lifting and transport from the 1900s. The [[internal combustion engine]], developed in the late 19th century, was installed in mass-produced vehicles from the 1910s. It not only reshaped transport methods but enabled many applications as a compact, portable power plant, wherever small engines were needed.\n\nThe [[forklift]] truck was invented in the early 20th century and came into wide use after World War II. Forklifts transformed the possibilities of multi-level [[pallet racking]] of goods in taller, single-level steel-framed buildings for higher storage density. The forklift, and its load fixed to a uniform [[pallet]], enabled the rise of [[Logistics|logistic]] approaches to storage in the later 20th century.\n<!-- Holding text- to allow the introduction of a photo gallery References or radical edit appreciated-->\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:GlosDocks.jpg| 19th-century warehouses in [[Gloucester]] docks in the [[United Kingdom]], originally used to store imported corn\nFile:Horgen - Sust-Ortsmuseum - Z\u00fcrichsee IMG 3829.JPG| A ''Sust'', a [[Middle Ages]] type of warehouse, in [[Horgen]], [[Switzerland]]\nFile:Atlantic Dock, Brooklyn, ca. 1872-1887.

There were already seven warehouses on [[Portland Street, Manchester|Portland Street]] when S. & J. Watts & Co. commenced building the elaborate [[Watts Warehouse]] of 1855,<ref name=\"Wyke\">{{cite web|url=http://www.revealinghistories.org.uk/why-was-cotton-so-important-in-north-west-england/places/manchester-warehouses.html|title=Manchester warehouses|last=Wyke|first=Terry|work=Revealing Histories: Remembering Slavery|publisher=Manchester City Galleries|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"PB81\">{{Harvnb|Parkinson-Bailey|2000|p=81}}</ref> but four more were opened before it was finished.\n\n=== Cool warehouses and cold storage ===\n{{main|Cool warehouse}}\nCold storage preserves agricultural products. Refrigerated storage helps in eliminating [[sprouting]], [[Decomposition|rotting]] and insect damage. Edible products are generally not stored for more than one year. Several [[perishable]] products require a storage temperature as low as \u221225&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nCold storage helps stabilize [[market price]]s and evenly distribute goods both on demand and timely basis. The farmers get the opportunity of producing [[cash crops]] to get remunerative prices. The consumers get the supply of perishable commodities with lower fluctuation of prices.\n\n[[Ammonia]] and [[Freon]] compressors are commonly used in cold storage warehouses to maintain the temperature. Ammonia refrigerant is cheaper, easily available, and has a high latent [[heat of evaporation]], but it is also highly [[toxic]] and can form [[ANFO|an explosive mixture]] when mixed with fuel oil. [[Building insulation|Insulation]] is also important, to reduce the loss of cold and to keep different sections of the warehouse at different temperatures.\n\nThere are two main types of refrigeration system used in cold storage warehouses: [[vapor absorption refrigeration|vapor absorption systems]] (VAS) and [[vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression systems]] (VCS). VAS, although comparatively costlier to install, is more economical in operation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe temperature necessary for [[Food preservation|preservation]] depends on the storage time required and the type of product. In general, there are three groups of products, foods that are alive (e.g. fruits and vegetables), foods that are no longer alive and have been processed in some form (e.g. meat and fish products), and commodities that benefit from storage at controlled temperature (e.g. beer, tobacco).\n\nLocation is important for the success of a cold storage facility. It should be in close proximity to a growing area as well as a market,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} be easily accessible for heavy vehicles, and have an uninterrupted power supply.\n\n=== Overseas warehouses ===\nThese catered for the overseas trade. They became the meeting places for overseas wholesale buyers where printed and plain could be discussed and ordered.<ref name=\"Wyke\"/> Trade in cloth in Manchester was conducted by many nationalities.\n\nBehrens Warehouse is on the corner of [[Oxford Street, Manchester|Oxford Street]] and [[Portland Street]]. It was built for Louis Behrens & Son by P Nunn in 1860.

See [[List of packing houses]].\n\n=== Railway warehouses ===\nWarehouses were built close to the major stations in railway hubs. The first railway warehouse to be built was opposite the passenger platform at the terminus of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]].

[[Castlefield]] warehouses are of this type- and important as they were built at the terminus of the [[Bridgewater Canal]] in 1761.\n\n==Operations==\nA customised storage building, a warehouse enables a business to stockpile goods, e.g., to build up a full load prior to transport, or hold unloaded goods before further distribution, or store goods like wine and cheese that require maturation. As a place for storage, the warehouse has to be secure, convenient, and as spacious as possible, according to the owner's resources, the site and contemporary building technology. &nbsp;Before mechanised technology developed, warehouse functions relied on human labour, using mechanical lifting aids like pulley systems.\n\n===Storage and shipping systems===\nSome of the most common warehouse storage systems are:\n*  [[Pallet racking]] including selective, drive-in, drive-thru, double-deep, pushback, and gravity flow\n*  Cantilever racking uses arms, rather than pallets, to store long thin objects like timber.\n*  [[Mezzanine (architecture)|Mezzanine]] adds a semi-permanent story of storage within a warehouse<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palletrackingsystemsltd.co.uk/glossary/mezzanine-flooring/\n|title=Pallet Racking Systems Ltd|accessdate=26 February 2016|date=2014-02-18}}</ref>\n\n*  [[AS/RS|Vertical Lift Modules]] are packed systems with vertically arranged trays stored on both sides of the unit.\n*  [[AS/RS|Horizontal Carousels]] consist of a frame and a rotating carriage of bins.\n*  [[AS/RS|Vertical Carousels]] consisting of a series of carriers mounted on a vertical closed-loop track, inside a metal enclosure.\n\nA \"piece pick\" is a type of order selection process where a product is picked and handled in individual units and placed in an outer carton, tote or another container before shipping. Catalog companies and internet retailers are examples of predominantly piece-pick operations. Their customers rarely order in pallet or case quantities; instead, they typically order just one or two pieces of one or two items. Several elements make up the piece-pick system. They include the order, the picker, the pick module, the pick area, handling equipment, the container, the pick method used and the information technology used.<ref name=\"C4WDefault-2292585\">{{cite book |title=PICK THIS! A Compendium of Piece-Picking Process Alternatives|isbn=9781892663467  |date=September 1, 2009 |author=OPSdesign Consulting |publisher=Warehousing Education & Research Council (WERC)}}</ref> Every movement inside a warehouse must be accompanied by a [[work order]]. Warehouse operation can fail when workers move goods without work orders, or when a storage position is left unregistered in the system.\n\nMaterial direction and [[Track & Trace|tracking]] in a warehouse can be coordinated by a [[Warehouse Management System]] (WMS), a [[database]] driven computer program. [[Logistics]] personnel use the WMS to improve warehouse efficiency by directing pathways and to maintain accurate [[inventory]] by recording warehouse transactions.\n\n===Automation and optimization===\n{{main|Warehouse robotics}}\nSome warehouses are completely [[automation|automated]], and require only operators to work and handle all the task. Pallets and product move on a system of automated [[conveyor]]s, [[crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[automated storage and retrieval system]]s coordinated by [[programmable logic controller]]s and [[computer]]s running [[logistics automation]] software.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}  These systems are often installed in [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] warehouses where temperatures are kept very cold to keep the product from spoiling.  This is especially true in electronics warehouses that require specific temperatures to avoid damaging parts. Automation is also common where land is expensive, as automated storage systems can use vertical space efficiently. These high-bay storage areas are often more than 10 meters (33&nbsp;feet) high, with some over 20 meters (65&nbsp;feet) high.  Automated storage systems can be built up to 40m high.\n\nFor a warehouse to function efficiently, the facility must be properly ''slotted''. Slotting addresses which storage medium a product is picked from ([[pallet racking|pallet rack]] or [[carton flow]]), and how they are picked (pick-to-light, [[Voice Directed Warehousing|pick-to-voice]], or pick-to-paper). With a proper slotting plan, a warehouse can improve its inventory rotation requirements\u2014such as [[FIFO and LIFO accounting|first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO)]]\u2014control labor costs and increase productivity.<ref>[http://www.sdcexec.com/news/10327109/effectively-slotting-a-warehouse-or-distribution-center ''Effectively Slotting a Warehouse or Distribution Center''] by Paul Hansen and Kelvin Gibson. [[Cygnus Business Media|Cygnus]] Supply and Demand Chain Executive. Accessed 2010-08-06.</ref>\n\nPallet racks are commonly used to organize a warehouse.  It is important to know the dimensions of racking and the number of bays needed as well as the dimensions of the product to be stored.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rackexpress.com/blog/pallet-rack/installation-guide-warehouse-storage-rack-systems/|title=Installation Guide to Warehouse Storage Rack Systems - Rack Express|website=www.rackexpress.com}}</ref>  Clearance should be accounted for if using a forklift or pallet mover to move inventory.\n\n==Recent trends==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nModern warehouses commonly use a system of wide aisle pallet racking<!-- Can this be considered a proper source? --> to store goods which can be loaded and unloaded using [[forklift trucks]].\n\nTraditional warehousing has declined since the last decades of the 20th century, with the gradual introduction of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] techniques.  The JIT system promotes product delivery directly from suppliers to consumer without the use of warehouses. However, with the gradual implementation of [[offshore outsourcing]] and [[offshoring]] in about the same time period, the distance between the manufacturer and the retailer (or the parts manufacturer and the industrial plant) grew considerably in many domains, necessitating at least one warehouse per country or per region in any typical [[supply chain]] for a given range of products.\n\nRecent retailing trends have led to the development of [[Warehouse stores|warehouse-style retail stores]]. These high-ceiling buildings display retail goods on tall, heavy-duty industrial racks rather than conventional retail shelving. Typically, items ready for sale are on the bottom of the racks, and crated or palletized inventory is in the upper rack.  Essentially, the same building serves as both a warehouse and retail store.\n\nAnother trend relates to [[vendor-managed inventory]] (VMI). This gives the vendor the control to maintain the level of stock in the store. This method has its own issue that the vendor gains access to the warehouse.\n\nLarge exporters and manufacturers use warehouses as distribution points for developing retail outlets in a particular region or country. This concept reduces end cost to the consumer and enhances the production sale ratio.\n\nCross-docking is a specialised type of distribution center (DC) in that little or no inventory is stored and product is received, processed (if needed) and shipped within a short timeframe. As in warehousing, there are different types of cross-docks.\n\nReverse logistics is another type of warehousing that has become popular for environmental reasons. The term refers to items that are going from the end user back to the distributor or manufacturer.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Education ==\nThere are few non-profit organizations which are focused on imparting knowledge, education and research in the field of warehouse management and its role in the supply chain industry.

Retrieved 2009-10-15.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples inhabited the area at least as early as 11000 B.C. When European emigres arrived, the area was inhabited by the Ilini, Osage and Missouri tribes.\n\nAccording to Hopewell's Romantic ''Legends of the Missouri and Mississippi'': Blanchette met another French Canadian (Bernard Guillet) at the site of St. Charles in 1765. Blanchette, determined to settle there, asked if Guillet, who had become a chief of a [[Lakota people|Dakota]] tribe, had chosen a name for it.\n\n:\"I called the place 'Les Petites C\u00f4tes' \" replied Bernard, \"from the sides of the hills that you see.\"\n\n:\"By that name shall it be called\", said Blanchette Chasseur, \"for it is the echo of nature &mdash; beautiful from its simplicity.\"\n\nBlanchette settled there ''circa'' 1769 under the authority of the Spanish governor of [[Upper Louisiana]] (the area had been ceded by France [[Spanish Louisiana|to Spain]] under an agreement with Great Britain following French defeat in the [[French and Indian Wars]]). He was appointed as the territory's civil and military leader, serving until his death in 1793. Although the settlement was under Spanish jurisdiction, the settlers were primarily Native American and French Canadians who had migrated from northern territories.\n\nConsidered to begin in St. Charles, the [[Boone's Lick Road]] along the [[Missouri River]] was the major overland route for settlement of central and western Missouri. This area became known as the [[Boonslick]] or \"Boonslick Country.\" At [[Franklin, Missouri|Franklin]], the trail ended. Westward progress continued on the [[Santa Fe Trail]].\n\n===San Carlos Borromeo===\nThe first church, built in 1791, was Catholic and dedicated to the Italian saint [[Charles Borromeo]], under the Spanish version of his name, San Carlos Borromeo. The town became known as ''San Carlos del Misuri'': \"St. Charles of the Missouri\". The original location of the church is not known but a replica has been built just off Main Street. The fourth St. Charles Borromeo Church now stands on Fifth Street.\n\nThe Spanish Lieutenant-Governor [[Carlos de Hault de Lassus]] appointed [[Daniel Boone]] as commandant of the [[Femme Osage]] District, which he served as until the United States government assumed control in 1804 following the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The name of the town, San Carlos, was anglicized to St. Charles.  [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] arrived in St. Charles on May 16, 1804. With him were 40 men and three boats; they made final preparations, as they waited for [[Meriwether Lewis]] to arrive from St. Louis. They attended dances, dinners, and a church service during this time, and the town residents, excited to be part of the national expedition, were very hospitable to the explorers. Lewis arrived via [[St. Charles Rock Road]] on May 20. The expedition launched the next day in a [[keel]] boat at 3:30 pm. St. Charles was the last established American town the expedition visited for more than two and a half years.\n\n===State capital and growth===\nWhen Missouri was granted statehood in 1821, the legislature decided to build a \"City of [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]\" to serve as the state capital, in the center of the state, overlooking the Missouri River. Since this land was undeveloped at the time, a temporary capital was needed. St. Charles beat eight other cities in a competition to house the temporary capital, offering free meeting space for the legislature in rooms located above a hardware store. This building is preserved as the [[First Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site]] and may be toured. The Missouri government continued to meet there until [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]] was ready in 1826.\n\n[[Gottfried Duden]] was a German who visited in the area in 1824. Travelling under the guidance of Daniel M. Boone, he wrote extensive accounts of life in [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]] during his year there. He published these after returning to Germany in 1829, and his favorable impressions of the area led to the immigration of a number of Germans in 1833. The first permanent German settler in the region was probably Louis Eversman, who arrived with Duden but decided to stay.  St. Charles, Missouri, is where the first claimed interstate project started in 1956. A state highway marker is displayed with a logo and information regarding this claim, off Interstate 70 going westbound, to the right of the First Capitol Drive exit. [[Kansas]] and [[Pennsylvania]] also lay claim to the first interstate project.\n\n==Government==\nSt. Charles is a [[charter city]] under the [[Missouri Constitution]], with a City Council as the governing body, consisting of one member for each of the ten wards, each serving a three-year term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stcharlescitymo.gov/Government/CityCouncil/tabid/147/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831011630/http://www.stcharlescitymo.gov/Government/CityCouncil/tabid/147/Default.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-31 }}</ref>  The executive head of the City government is the Mayor for all legal and ceremonial purposes.

[[St. Charles High School (Missouri)|St. Charles High School]] (sometimes called SCHS or simply \"High\") was the first built of the two high schools in (1895). First as military school, then around the 1950s changed into a public high school. [[St. Charles West High School|St. Charles West]] (SCW or simply \"West\") was added in the late 1970s in response to the city's growing population. St. Charles West had its first graduation in 1979. St. Charles High School underwent renovation in 1995 to improve both the exterior and interior of the building, as did St. Charles West in 2005, in which a new library and auxiliary gym were built. The city is also served by Jefferson Intermediate, which has all 5th and 6th grade classes, and Hardin Middle School, which has all 7th and 8th grade classes.\n\nSt. Charles is the location of a variety of [[private school]]s, including Immanuel Lutheran (Pre-K to 8), Zion Lutheran (Pre-K to 8), St. Charles Borromeo, St. Peter's, St. Cletus (K-8), Academy of the Sacred Heart (founded by [[Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne]], and the site of her shrine), [[Duchesne High School (Missouri)|Duchesne High School]] (formerly named St. Peter High school), and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton-St. Robert Bellarmine (K-8).\n\nOther schools are associated with the [[Francis Howell School District|Francis Howell]] and the [[Orchard Farm School District|Orchard Farm]] school districts, which also serve parts of St. Charles. Many students who live on the southern edge of St. Charles City attend Henderson, Becky David and Harvest Ridge elementary schools, Barnwell Middle, and [[Francis Howell North High School]]. To the North, the Orchard Farm School District also serves St. Charles but is based outside the city like the Francis Howell School District, it has two elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school.\n\n[[Lindenwood University]] is located on Kingshighway, near downtown St. Charles and St. Charles High.

Since the late 1970s, there has been healthy new home construction, commercial growth and explosive population growth in the St. Charles area. The phrase \"Golden Triangle\" was coined for this area in the 1980s, referring to the rate of real estate development in the St. Charles County region bordered by highways [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|Interstate 70]], [[Interstate 64 (Missouri)|Interstate 64]], and [[Missouri Route 94|Route 94]].\n\nSt. Charles has a historic shopping district on Main Street with numerous restored buildings housing restaurants and various specialty stores. It offers most standard living features (with the exception of a public golf course) usually found in a community of its size. The city also has many special events and features related to the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. In 2007, St. Charles welcomed men's professional [[road bicycle racing]] riders and fans as it served as the stage 5 final for the [[2007 Tour of Missouri]].\n\nAs of 2015, walking food tours on Historic Main Street can be taken through the company Dishing Up America.

Much is planned for the development and improvement of the area, including a northward extension of the Katy Trail, residential and commercial development, parking garage expansion, casino expansion, and development of hotels.\n\nThe \"Christmas Traditions Festival\", one of the nation's largest Christmas festivals, takes place on the streets of St. Charles annually. It starts the day after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and continues until the Saturday after [[Christmas]].  Over 30 costumed Legends of Christmas stroll the streets and interact with guests, while [[Victorian Era]] Christmas Carolers fill the air with old-fashioned carols.  Every Saturday and Sunday, the Legends of Christmas and the Lewis & Clark Fife and Drum Corps take part in the Santa Parade as it heads up Historic South Main Street to the site of the [[First Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site|First Missouri State Capitol]].\n\nOn the [[Fourth of July]] fireworks displays draw large numbers on two nights, [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] and another night before or after the Fourth. Many bring blankets to sit near the riverfront. Others opt to view the festivities from the Old Courthouse.  The festival, named Riverfest, has been sponsored by the city of St. Charles and organized by a volunteer committee formed of city residents and sponsoring private organization (like the Jaycees) leaders.\n\nThe Festival of the Little Hills is a historic St. Charles tradition that takes place every year in August, the third full weekend of the month.

The city also encourages individuals to bring homemade crafts, jewelry, paintings, clothing and other items to sell at the festival.\n\nOktoberfest, held near the river, celebrates the historic German influence on the city. Many vendors sell beer and other German goods. It includes a parade.  Missouri Tartan Day is a celebration of Scottish American Heritage and Culture held each Spring, coinciding as closely as possible with April 6. This is the anniversary of the signing of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320. The Founding Fathers are said to have drawn from this document in drafting our own Constitution. The event features a parade with marching bagpipers from around the World and region, Scottish heavy athletics (caber toss, hammer throw, etc.), musical entertainment, traditional and contemporary foods and lots of fun.  Highlights include the Kirkin' o' the Tartans (ceremony of blessing for the Scottish clans), displays of traditional Scottish clan Tartans, and demonstrations of traditional Scottish activities and games.\n\nThe Fete de Glace is an ice-carving competition and demonstration held on North Main Street in mid-January.

For a time, it played a significant role in the United States' westward expansion as a river port and starting point of the [[Boone's Lick Road]] to the [[Boonslick]].\n\nSt. Charles was settled primarily by French-speaking colonists from [[Canada]] in its early days and was considered the last \"civilized\" stop by the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1804, which was exploring the western territory after the United States made the [[Louisiana Purchase]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stcharlescitymo.gov/AboutStCharles/Timeline/tabid/296/Default.aspx |title=Timeline |publisher=Stcharlescitymo.gov |accessdate=2011-08-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721065303/http://www.stcharlescitymo.gov/AboutStCharles/Timeline/tabid/296/Default.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> The city served as the first Missouri capital from 1821 to 1826,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slfp.com/SLFP-StCharles.htm |title=St. Charles: Missouri's First Capitol |publisher=Slfp.com |accessdate=2011-08-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716110708/http://www.slfp.com/SLFP-StCharles.htm |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref> and is the site of the [[Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne]] shrine.<ref>[http://www.ash1818.org/main/about/shrine-of-st-philippine-duchesne Shrine of St. Philippine Duchesne] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725015759/http://www.ash1818.org/main/about/shrine-of-st-philippine-duchesne |date=2011-07-25 }}, Academy of the Sacred Heart. Retrieved 2009-10-15.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] peoples inhabited the area at least as early as 11000 B.C. When European emigres arrived, the area was inhabited by the Ilini, Osage and Missouri tribes.\n\nAccording to Hopewell's Romantic ''Legends of the Missouri and Mississippi'': Blanchette met another French Canadian (Bernard Guillet) at the site of St. Charles in 1765. Blanchette, determined to settle there, asked if Guillet, who had become a chief of a [[Lakota people|Dakota]] tribe, had chosen a name for it.\n\n:\"I called the place 'Les Petites C\u00f4tes' \" replied Bernard, \"from the sides of the hills that you see.\"\n\n:\"By that name shall it be called\", said Blanchette Chasseur, \"for it is the echo of nature &mdash; beautiful from its simplicity.\"\n\nBlanchette settled there ''circa'' 1769 under the authority of the Spanish governor of [[Upper Louisiana]] (the area had been ceded by France [[Spanish Louisiana|to Spain]] under an agreement with Great Britain following French defeat in the [[French and Indian Wars]]). He was appointed as the territory's civil and military leader, serving until his death in 1793. Although the settlement was under Spanish jurisdiction, the settlers were primarily Native American and French Canadians who had migrated from northern territories.\n\nConsidered to begin in St. Charles, the [[Boone's Lick Road]] along the [[Missouri River]] was the major overland route for settlement of central and western Missouri. This area became known as the [[Boonslick]] or \"Boonslick Country.\" At [[Franklin, Missouri|Franklin]], the trail ended. Westward progress continued on the [[Santa Fe Trail]].\n\n===San Carlos Borromeo===\nThe first church, built in 1791, was Catholic and dedicated to the Italian saint [[Charles Borromeo]], under the Spanish version of his name, San Carlos Borromeo. The town became known as ''San Carlos del Misuri'': \"St. Charles of the Missouri\". The original location of the church is not known but a replica has been built just off Main Street. The fourth St. Charles Borromeo Church now stands on Fifth Street.\n\nThe Spanish Lieutenant-Governor [[Carlos de Hault de Lassus]] appointed [[Daniel Boone]] as commandant of the [[Femme Osage]] District, which he served as until the United States government assumed control in 1804 following the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The name of the town, San Carlos, was anglicized to St. Charles.  [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] arrived in St. Charles on May 16, 1804. With him were 40 men and three boats; they made final preparations, as they waited for [[Meriwether Lewis]] to arrive from St. Louis. They attended dances, dinners, and a church service during this time, and the town residents, excited to be part of the national expedition, were very hospitable to the explorers. Lewis arrived via [[St. Charles Rock Road]] on May 20. The expedition launched the next day in a [[keel]] boat at 3:30 pm. St. Charles was the last established American town the expedition visited for more than two and a half years.\n\n===State capital and growth===\nWhen Missouri was granted statehood in 1821, the legislature decided to build a \"City of [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]\" to serve as the state capital, in the center of the state, overlooking the Missouri River. Since this land was undeveloped at the time, a temporary capital was needed. St. Charles beat eight other cities in a competition to house the temporary capital, offering free meeting space for the legislature in rooms located above a hardware store. This building is preserved as the [[First Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site]] and may be toured. The Missouri government continued to meet there until [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]] was ready in 1826.\n\n[[Gottfried Duden]] was a German who visited in the area in 1824. Travelling under the guidance of Daniel M. Boone, he wrote extensive accounts of life in [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]] during his year there. He published these after returning to Germany in 1829, and his favorable impressions of the area led to the immigration of a number of Germans in 1833. The first permanent German settler in the region was probably Louis Eversman, who arrived with Duden but decided to stay.  St. Charles, Missouri, is where the first claimed interstate project started in 1956. A state highway marker is displayed with a logo and information regarding this claim, off Interstate 70 going westbound, to the right of the First Capitol Drive exit. [[Kansas]] and [[Pennsylvania]] also lay claim to the first interstate project.\n\n==Government==\nSt. Charles is a [[charter city]] under the [[Missouri Constitution]], with a City Council as the governing body, consisting of one member for each of the ten wards, each serving a three-year term.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stcharlescitymo.gov/Government/CityCouncil/tabid/147/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831011630/http://www.stcharlescitymo.gov/Government/CityCouncil/tabid/147/Default.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-31 }}</ref>  The executive head of the City government is the Mayor for all legal and ceremonial purposes.

[[St. Charles High School (Missouri)|St. Charles High School]] (sometimes called SCHS or simply \"High\") was the first built of the two high schools in (1895). First as military school, then around the 1950s changed into a public high school. [[St. Charles West High School|St. Charles West]] (SCW or simply \"West\") was added in the late 1970s in response to the city's growing population. St. Charles West had its first graduation in 1979. St. Charles High School underwent renovation in 1995 to improve both the exterior and interior of the building, as did St. Charles West in 2005, in which a new library and auxiliary gym were built. The city is also served by Jefferson Intermediate, which has all 5th and 6th grade classes, and Hardin Middle School, which has all 7th and 8th grade classes.\n\nSt. Charles is the location of a variety of [[private school]]s, including Immanuel Lutheran (Pre-K to 8), Zion Lutheran (Pre-K to 8), St. Charles Borromeo, St. Peter's, St. Cletus (K-8), Academy of the Sacred Heart (founded by [[Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne]], and the site of her shrine), [[Duchesne High School (Missouri)|Duchesne High School]] (formerly named St. Peter High school), and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton-St. Robert Bellarmine (K-8).\n\nOther schools are associated with the [[Francis Howell School District|Francis Howell]] and the [[Orchard Farm School District|Orchard Farm]] school districts, which also serve parts of St. Charles. Many students who live on the southern edge of St. Charles City attend Henderson, Becky David and Harvest Ridge elementary schools, Barnwell Middle, and [[Francis Howell North High School]]. To the North, the Orchard Farm School District also serves St. Charles but is based outside the city like the Francis Howell School District, it has two elementary schools, a middle school, and a high school.\n\n[[Lindenwood University]] is located on Kingshighway, near downtown St. Charles and St. Charles High. Founded by Major George Sibley and his wife Mary in 1827 as a women's school named Lindenwood School For Girls, the institution is the second-oldest higher-education institution west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abbevilleinstitute.org/Lindenwood/08Lindenwood.htm |title=Abbeville Institute 2008 Lindenwood Summer School |publisher=Abbevilleinstitute.org |accessdate=2010-07-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414081452/http://www.abbevilleinstitute.org/Lindenwood/08Lindenwood.htm |archivedate=2010-04-14 }}</ref> The private university is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church]].

Since the late 1970s, there has been healthy new home construction, commercial growth and explosive population growth in the St. Charles area. The phrase \"Golden Triangle\" was coined for this area in the 1980s, referring to the rate of real estate development in the St. Charles County region bordered by highways [[Interstate 70 in Missouri|Interstate 70]], [[Interstate 64 (Missouri)|Interstate 64]], and [[Missouri Route 94|Route 94]].\n\nSt. Charles has a historic shopping district on Main Street with numerous restored buildings housing restaurants and various specialty stores. It offers most standard living features (with the exception of a public golf course) usually found in a community of its size. The city also has many special events and features related to the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. In 2007, St. Charles welcomed men's professional [[road bicycle racing]] riders and fans as it served as the stage 5 final for the [[2007 Tour of Missouri]].\n\nAs of 2015, walking food tours on Historic Main Street can be taken through the company Dishing Up America. These tours take customers to the locally famous restaurants in the city.\n\nThe St. Charles Parks and Recreation System opened a dog park on the north side of the city as a part of DuSable Park-Bales Area in November 2006. This off-leash dog area has two sections - one for smaller dogs, one for larger.\n\nThe [[St. Charles Convention Center]] brings visitors, meetings and events to the city. The [[Family Arena]], a city-owned 11,000-seat venue, was built in 1999 near the Missouri River. It is used by minor league sports franchises and hosts concerts and events.\n\n== Sports ==\nThe city has been home to several minor league sports teams. The [[Missouri River Otters]] hockey team of the [[United Hockey League]], played from 1999 until the team folded in 2006.

The primary features of the riverfront and Historic Main Street are residences and businesses.  Each block features shops, restaurants, and offices frequented by visitors and locals. Much is planned for the development and improvement of the area, including a northward extension of the Katy Trail, residential and commercial development, parking garage expansion, casino expansion, and development of hotels.\n\nThe \"Christmas Traditions Festival\", one of the nation's largest Christmas festivals, takes place on the streets of St. Charles annually. It starts the day after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and continues until the Saturday after [[Christmas]].  Over 30 costumed Legends of Christmas stroll the streets and interact with guests, while [[Victorian Era]] Christmas Carolers fill the air with old-fashioned carols.  Every Saturday and Sunday, the Legends of Christmas and the Lewis & Clark Fife and Drum Corps take part in the Santa Parade as it heads up Historic South Main Street to the site of the [[First Missouri State Capitol State Historic Site|First Missouri State Capitol]].\n\nOn the [[Fourth of July]] fireworks displays draw large numbers on two nights, [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] and another night before or after the Fourth. Many bring blankets to sit near the riverfront. Others opt to view the festivities from the Old Courthouse.  The festival, named Riverfest, has been sponsored by the city of St. Charles and organized by a volunteer committee formed of city residents and sponsoring private organization (like the Jaycees) leaders.\n\nThe Festival of the Little Hills is a historic St. Charles tradition that takes place every year in August, the third full weekend of the month. Started in 1971, this festival is known nationally as one of the top ten craft fairs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalofthelittlehills.com/|title=Festival of the Little Hills - F\u00eate des Petites C\u00f4tes, Historic St. Charles, Missouri|website=www.festivalofthelittlehills.com|accessdate=29 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929083928/http://www.festivalofthelittlehills.com/|archivedate=29 September 2017}}</ref> It runs through an entire weekend featuring great food, live entertainment, craft sales, and shows for kids. The festival is related to the famous Lewis & Clark expedition: many participants don clothing from the era and re-enact historic events.  The city also encourages individuals to bring homemade crafts, jewelry, paintings, clothing and other items to sell at the festival.\n\nOktoberfest, held near the river, celebrates the historic German influence on the city. Many vendors sell beer and other German goods. It includes a parade.  Missouri Tartan Day is a celebration of Scottish American Heritage and Culture held each Spring, coinciding as closely as possible with April 6. This is the anniversary of the signing of the [[Declaration of Arbroath]] in 1320. The Founding Fathers are said to have drawn from this document in drafting our own Constitution. The event features a parade with marching bagpipers from around the World and region, Scottish heavy athletics (caber toss, hammer throw, etc.), musical entertainment, traditional and contemporary foods and lots of fun.  Highlights include the Kirkin' o' the Tartans (ceremony of blessing for the Scottish clans), displays of traditional Scottish clan Tartans, and demonstrations of traditional Scottish activities and games.\n\nThe Fete de Glace is an ice-carving competition and demonstration held on North Main Street in mid-January.  The Missouri River Irish Festival is held every September in Frontier Park and on Main Street to celebrate Irish Heritage with music, dancing, storytelling, athletics, food, and fun.<ref>[http://www.moriveririshfest.com Missouri River Irish Fest<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109140310/http://moriveririshfest.com/ |date=2014-01-09 }}</ref>  During Quilts on Main Street, hundreds of quilts are displayed outside the shops on storefronts and balconies. This event is held annually in September.  The Bluegrass Festival in Frontier Park on the big stage of Jaycee's pavilion is held early in September every year, featuring local and regional acts.

The Gulf would extend as far as [[Indio, California]], except for the tremendous [[river delta|delta]] created by the [[Colorado River]].

Most of the islands are found on the peninsular side of the gulf. In fact, many of the islands of the Sea of Cortez are the result of volcanic explosions that occurred during the early history of Baja California. The islands of [[Islas Mar\u00edas]], Islas San Francisco, and [[Isla Partida]] are thought to be the result of such explosions. The formations of the islands, however, are not dependent on each other. They were each formed as a result of an individual structural occurrence.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/> Several islands, including [[Isla Coronados]], are home to volcanoes.\n\nThe gulf has more than 900 islets and islands which together total about 420 hectares. All of them as a whole were enacted as \"Area Reserve and Migratory Bird Refuge and Wildlife\" on August 2, 1978. In June 2000, the islands were given a new category \"Protection Area Wildlife\". In addition to this effort by the Mexican government, for its importance and recognition worldwide, all islands in the Gulf of California are also part of the international program \"Man and Biosphere\" (MAB) and are part of the World Reserve Network UNESCO Biosphere as Special Biosphere Reserve. Due to the vast expanse covered by this federal protected area conservation and management is carried out through a system of four regional directorates (one per bordering the Gulf of California state) by way of co-direction. There is a regional directorate in the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora and Sinaloa. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the work of direct and indirect conservation is done in the islands is governed by a single Management Program, published in 2000, which is complemented by local and specific management programs (at individuals) archipelagos. The Directorate of Protection Area Wildlife California Gulf Islands (APFF-GCR) in Baja California is responsible for 56 islands located off the coast of the state. These are grouped into four archipelagos: San Luis Gonzaga or Enchanted, Guardian Angel, Bahia de los Angeles and San Lorenzo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/valle-de-los-cirios.-tesoro-de-baja-california.html|title=Valle de los Cirios.

Some of the rich biodiversity and high [[endemism]] that characterize the Gulf of California and make it such a hotspot for fishing can be attributed to seemingly insignificant factors, such as the types of rocks that make up a shore. Beaches with softer, more porous rocks (such as Coquina limestone, rhyolites, granite, or diorite) generally have a higher species richness than those with harder, smoother rocks (such as basalt or diabase). Porous rocks will naturally have more cracks and crevices in them, making them ideal living spaces for many animals. The rocks themselves, however, generally need to be stable on the shore for a habitat to be stable. Additionally, the color of the rocks can affect the organisms living on a shore. For example, darker rocks will be significantly warmer than lighter ones, and can deter animals that do not have a high tolerance for heat.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\nThe northern Gulf of California experiences tidal ranges of up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}. Mixed [[semidiurnal tides]] are the norm throughout most of the Gulf.\n\n;Estuaries\nIn the Gulf of California, there are a number of negative [[estuary|estuaries]], that is, ones in which the [[evaporation]] of seawater is relatively greater than that of the fresh water input. The salinities of these inlets are higher than that of the [[ocean]]. The temperatures, [[Poikilotherm#Ecological niches|poikilothermal]], of these negative [[estuary|estuaries]] also are higher than the general temperature of the Gulf.\n\nIt is possible that at one time these estuaries were positive, that is, ones in which the [[seawater]] component is [[Concentration|diluted]]; therefore, the water is [[brackish water|brackish]], with salinity less than that of the ocean.\n\nHowever, due to human settlement around the Gulf of California and water diversion for municipal and agricultural use in an area of comparatively low rainfall, there are no longer many rivers that freely empty into the Gulf of California. The upper [[Colorado River Delta]] is one example of a historically major estuary and [[wetlands]] [[ecosystem]], that since the 20th century construction of upriver dams and diversion aqueducts on the [[Colorado River]], is now a small [[ephemeral]] remnant estuary. The remaining Gulf inlets still are important to several species of fishes, [[crustacean]]s, and [[shellfish]] that are commercially harvested.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n==Climate==\n;Air\nEven though the shores of the Gulf of California are generally sheltered from the continuous wave shock that is experienced by most other North American shores, storms known as a \"[[chubasco]]\" can cause significant damage to shorelines, despite their brevity.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n;Ocean\nThe depth of the water helps to determine its temperature. For example, shallow depths are directly influenced by the local temperature of the air, while deeper waters are less susceptible to changes in air temperature.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/> The temperature of the water in the Gulf of California generally experiences lows of {{convert|16|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in winter and highs of {{convert|24|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in summer. But temperatures can vary greatly in the gulf, and the water is almost always warmer by the coast than the open ocean.

In addition to a wide range of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] creatures, such as the critically endangered [[vaquita]], it hosts many migratory species, such as the [[humpback whale]], [[California gray whale]], [[killer whale]], [[manta ray]], [[Humboldt squid]] and [[leatherback sea turtle]], and the world's largest animal, the [[blue whale]]. The unusual resident populations of [[fin whale]]s and [[sperm whale]]s do not migrate annually. The area near the delta of the Colorado river has a small remnant population of the [[totoaba]] fish. This region has historically been a magnet for world-class sport [[fishing]] activities, with a rich history of sporting world records.\n\nThe region also has a rich history as a commercial [[fishery]]. However, the data vary wildly according to the species being studied, and the Gulf's ability to recuperate after years of overfishing remains uncertain. Moreover, changes in terrestrial ecology, such as the vast reduction in flow from the Colorado River into the Gulf, have negatively affected fisheries, particularly in the northern region.\n\nThe Gulf of California sustains a large number of marine mammals, many of which are rare and endangered. Its more than 900 islands are important nesting sites for thousands of seabirds, and its waters are primary breeding, feeding, and nursing grounds for myriad migratory and resident fish species. For decades, the gulf has been a primary source of two of Mexico's leading marine resources, sardines and anchovies. Water pollution is a problem in the Gulf of California, but the more immediate concerns are overfishing and bottom trawling, which destroys eelgrass beds and shellfish.\n\nEfforts by the Mexican government to create [[Conservation ethic|conservation zones]] and [[nature reserve]]s have been hampered by lack of enforcement resources, as well as a lack of a political consensus on this issue of conservation of the Gulf.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This occurs even though significant areas are a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The thousands of miles of coastline are remote and difficult to police, and the politically powerful commercial fishing industry has been slow to embrace even economically viable conservation measures, much less strict measures of conservation. Conservation of the Gulf's fisheries and coastlines is also complicated by a long history of overcapitalization in the sector, and the direct, often negative, impacts that conservation measures have on the livelihoods of Mexico's coastal inhabitants. At present, the Mexican government and business interests have promoted a macro-level, tourist development vision for the Gulf, the impacts of which on local ecology and society are uncertain. In 2019, the gulf was added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of concerns of the imminent extinction of the [[vaquita]], an endemic porpoise in the area.<ref name=\"whs danger\">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1999 |title=The Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California (Mexico) inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nCoastal communities are highly reliant on both commercial and sport fishing, including [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[San Carlos, Sonora]], [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], [[Guaymas]], [[Bah\u00eda Kino]], [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]], [[Topolobampo]] and [[Muleg\u00e9]]. The well-developed shrimp and sardine fleets of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], on the Mexican mainland's Pacific coast, heavily exploit the commercial fisheries of the southern Gulf.\n\nMany marine organisms can only survive within a particular [[salinity]] range, which makes salinity a notable factor in determining the types of potentially commercial organisms found in the Gulf of California. The mean annual ranges of salinity of the Sea of Cortez are between 3.5 and 3.58% at the surface.<ref name=\"Nix\"/> Furthermore, the salinity of the water of the Northern Gulf of California is generally higher than the Central and Southern faunal regions due to the increased amount of evaporation that occurs in that region.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of western shore communities on the Gulf of California]]\n* [[List of eastern shore communities on the Gulf of California]] \n* [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Brusca, Richard C.

Most of the islands are found on the peninsular side of the gulf. In fact, many of the islands of the Sea of Cortez are the result of volcanic explosions that occurred during the early history of Baja California. The islands of [[Islas Mar\u00edas]], Islas San Francisco, and [[Isla Partida]] are thought to be the result of such explosions. The formations of the islands, however, are not dependent on each other. They were each formed as a result of an individual structural occurrence.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/> Several islands, including [[Isla Coronados]], are home to volcanoes.\n\nThe gulf has more than 900 islets and islands which together total about 420 hectares. All of them as a whole were enacted as \"Area Reserve and Migratory Bird Refuge and Wildlife\" on August 2, 1978. In June 2000, the islands were given a new category \"Protection Area Wildlife\". In addition to this effort by the Mexican government, for its importance and recognition worldwide, all islands in the Gulf of California are also part of the international program \"Man and Biosphere\" (MAB) and are part of the World Reserve Network UNESCO Biosphere as Special Biosphere Reserve. Due to the vast expanse covered by this federal protected area conservation and management is carried out through a system of four regional directorates (one per bordering the Gulf of California state) by way of co-direction. There is a regional directorate in the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora and Sinaloa. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the work of direct and indirect conservation is done in the islands is governed by a single Management Program, published in 2000, which is complemented by local and specific management programs (at individuals) archipelagos. The Directorate of Protection Area Wildlife California Gulf Islands (APFF-GCR) in Baja California is responsible for 56 islands located off the coast of the state.

Some of the rich biodiversity and high [[endemism]] that characterize the Gulf of California and make it such a hotspot for fishing can be attributed to seemingly insignificant factors, such as the types of rocks that make up a shore. Beaches with softer, more porous rocks (such as Coquina limestone, rhyolites, granite, or diorite) generally have a higher species richness than those with harder, smoother rocks (such as basalt or diabase). Porous rocks will naturally have more cracks and crevices in them, making them ideal living spaces for many animals. The rocks themselves, however, generally need to be stable on the shore for a habitat to be stable. Additionally, the color of the rocks can affect the organisms living on a shore. For example, darker rocks will be significantly warmer than lighter ones, and can deter animals that do not have a high tolerance for heat.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\nThe northern Gulf of California experiences tidal ranges of up to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}}. Mixed [[semidiurnal tides]] are the norm throughout most of the Gulf.\n\n;Estuaries\nIn the Gulf of California, there are a number of negative [[estuary|estuaries]], that is, ones in which the [[evaporation]] of seawater is relatively greater than that of the fresh water input. The salinities of these inlets are higher than that of the [[ocean]]. The temperatures, [[Poikilotherm#Ecological niches|poikilothermal]], of these negative [[estuary|estuaries]] also are higher than the general temperature of the Gulf.\n\nIt is possible that at one time these estuaries were positive, that is, ones in which the [[seawater]] component is [[Concentration|diluted]]; therefore, the water is [[brackish water|brackish]], with salinity less than that of the ocean.\n\nHowever, due to human settlement around the Gulf of California and water diversion for municipal and agricultural use in an area of comparatively low rainfall, there are no longer many rivers that freely empty into the Gulf of California. The upper [[Colorado River Delta]] is one example of a historically major estuary and [[wetlands]] [[ecosystem]], that since the 20th century construction of upriver dams and diversion aqueducts on the [[Colorado River]], is now a small [[ephemeral]] remnant estuary. The remaining Gulf inlets still are important to several species of fishes, [[crustacean]]s, and [[shellfish]] that are commercially harvested.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n==Climate==\n;Air\nEven though the shores of the Gulf of California are generally sheltered from the continuous wave shock that is experienced by most other North American shores, storms known as a \"[[chubasco]]\" can cause significant damage to shorelines, despite their brevity.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n;Ocean\nThe depth of the water helps to determine its temperature. For example, shallow depths are directly influenced by the local temperature of the air, while deeper waters are less susceptible to changes in air temperature.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/> The temperature of the water in the Gulf of California generally experiences lows of {{convert|16|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in winter and highs of {{convert|24|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} in summer. But temperatures can vary greatly in the gulf, and the water is almost always warmer by the coast than the open ocean.

In addition to a wide range of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] creatures, such as the critically endangered [[vaquita]], it hosts many migratory species, such as the [[humpback whale]], [[California gray whale]], [[killer whale]], [[manta ray]], [[Humboldt squid]] and [[leatherback sea turtle]], and the world's largest animal, the [[blue whale]]. The unusual resident populations of [[fin whale]]s and [[sperm whale]]s do not migrate annually. The area near the delta of the Colorado river has a small remnant population of the [[totoaba]] fish. This region has historically been a magnet for world-class sport [[fishing]] activities, with a rich history of sporting world records.\n\nThe region also has a rich history as a commercial [[fishery]]. However, the data vary wildly according to the species being studied, and the Gulf's ability to recuperate after years of overfishing remains uncertain. Moreover, changes in terrestrial ecology, such as the vast reduction in flow from the Colorado River into the Gulf, have negatively affected fisheries, particularly in the northern region.\n\nThe Gulf of California sustains a large number of marine mammals, many of which are rare and endangered. Its more than 900 islands are important nesting sites for thousands of seabirds, and its waters are primary breeding, feeding, and nursing grounds for myriad migratory and resident fish species. For decades, the gulf has been a primary source of two of Mexico's leading marine resources, sardines and anchovies. Water pollution is a problem in the Gulf of California, but the more immediate concerns are overfishing and bottom trawling, which destroys eelgrass beds and shellfish.\n\nEfforts by the Mexican government to create [[Conservation ethic|conservation zones]] and [[nature reserve]]s have been hampered by lack of enforcement resources, as well as a lack of a political consensus on this issue of conservation of the Gulf.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This occurs even though significant areas are a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. The thousands of miles of coastline are remote and difficult to police, and the politically powerful commercial fishing industry has been slow to embrace even economically viable conservation measures, much less strict measures of conservation. Conservation of the Gulf's fisheries and coastlines is also complicated by a long history of overcapitalization in the sector, and the direct, often negative, impacts that conservation measures have on the livelihoods of Mexico's coastal inhabitants. At present, the Mexican government and business interests have promoted a macro-level, tourist development vision for the Gulf, the impacts of which on local ecology and society are uncertain. In 2019, the gulf was added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] because of concerns of the imminent extinction of the [[vaquita]], an endemic porpoise in the area.<ref name=\"whs danger\">{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1999 |title=The Islands and Protected Areas of the Gulf of California (Mexico) inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nCoastal communities are highly reliant on both commercial and sport fishing, including [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[San Carlos, Sonora]], [[Cabo San Lucas]], [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]], [[Guaymas]], [[Bah\u00eda Kino]], [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]], [[Topolobampo]] and [[Muleg\u00e9]]. The well-developed shrimp and sardine fleets of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], on the Mexican mainland's Pacific coast, heavily exploit the commercial fisheries of the southern Gulf.\n\nMany marine organisms can only survive within a particular [[salinity]] range, which makes salinity a notable factor in determining the types of potentially commercial organisms found in the Gulf of California. The mean annual ranges of salinity of the Sea of Cortez are between 3.5 and 3.58% at the surface.<ref name=\"Nix\"/> Furthermore, the salinity of the water of the Northern Gulf of California is generally higher than the Central and Southern faunal regions due to the increased amount of evaporation that occurs in that region.<ref name=\"Brusca\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of western shore communities on the Gulf of California]]\n* [[List of eastern shore communities on the Gulf of California]] \n* [[Ferdinand Kon\u0161\u010dak]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=Brusca, Richard C.
