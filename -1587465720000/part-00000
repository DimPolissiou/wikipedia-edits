Cook|Douglas Cook]] and [[David Weisberg]]. The film is about a convict who is implanted with a dead CIA agent's memories to finish an assignment. The film stars [[Kevin Costner]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Tommy Lee Jones]], in the second collaboration among all three following the 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. The film also features [[Alice Eve]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Michael Pitt]], [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]], [[Antje Traue]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Amaury Nolasco]], and [[Ryan Reynolds]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on September 4, 2014, in [[London]]. The film was produced by [[Campbell-Grobman Films]] and [[Millennium Films]] and was released on April 15, 2016 and received negative reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb|box office failure]], grossing only $38.8 million against its $31.5 million  budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIndustrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl arranges for his associate Jan Strook\u2014a [[hacker]] known as \"the Dutchman\"\u2014to create a wormhole program that would allow the owner to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes. The Dutchman panics and attempts to hand his secret over to [[CIA]] agent Bill Pope. Although Pope gets the Dutchman to a [[safe house]] and recovers the money to pay him for his services, he is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman.\n\nDesperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's supervisor Quaker Wells contacts Dr. Micah Franks, who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memory patterns of a dead person onto a living one. Franks requests that they \"graft\" Pope's knowledge into the brain of convict Jerico Stewart, whose damaged [[frontal lobe]] has effectively made him a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. \n\nAfter the operation, Jerico escapes custody and fakes his death. He goes to Pope's house, where he holds Pope's widow Jillian hostage while he looks for the money. As time goes on, he experiences memory flashes of Pope's past, but all he can determine is that the bag of money was hidden behind a bookshelf, without identifying where it or the Dutchman are kept.\n\nThe CIA learns that the Dutchman is planning to sell the program to the Russians, believing that the CIA has betrayed him. Fortunately, they are able to find Jerico after he contacts Dr. Franks for medication using Pope's CIA codes. Jerico is beginning to develop emotions and draw on Pope's experience. As Jerico attempts to retrace the route Pope took to hide the Dutchman, Heimdahl creates a distraction at the airport that draws Wells' attention, allowing Heimdahl's accomplice and lover Elsa to try and capture Jerico, killing his CIA guards before Jerico escapes by driving off a bridge.\n\nJerico retreats to the Pope house, where he encounters Jillian and explains the situation to her. Although she initially fears him, Jillian comes to accept Jerico as she sees him bonding with her daughter, Emma, allowing Jerico to stay the night. The next morning, Jerico realizes through a conversation with Jillian that the bag is hidden in the rare books collection at the [[University of London]] where she works. He attempts to retrieve the bag, but he is captured by Heimdahl and Elsa once he has found it. Heimdahl threatens to kill Jillian and Emma unless Jerico takes him to the Dutchman.\n\nWith the CIA and a Russian strike team now seeking the Dutchman, Jerico\u2014who has recalled that Pope hid the Dutchman in Jillian's office at the university\u2014is able to escape Elsa using an improvised [[nitro-glycerine]] bomb, returning to the office to provide a hurried explanation to the Dutchman. Elsa finds them before they can escape, shooting Jerico in the shoulder and killing the Dutchman, but Jerico gets the upper hand and bludgeons her to death with a lamp.\n\nJerico takes the flash drive containing the wormhole program to the airfield where Heimdahl is attempting an escape. Jerico saves Jillian and Emma, even as Heimdahl shoots him. As Heimdahl's plane takes off, Jerico reveals to Wells that he had the Dutchman reprogram the wormhole so that it would target the source of the next transmission. This results in Heimdahl unwittingly destroying his own plane when he tries to fire a missile at the airfield.\n\nA few months later, Jerico is shown on the beach where Pope and Jillian had their honeymoon. He is initially unresponsive to anything but automatic reflexes and responses. With all other options exhausted, Wells and Franks take Jillian and Emma to see him. The sight of Pope's family confirms that some part of Pope exists in Jerico as he responds with a nose-tap. This was Pope and Jillian's way of saying \"I love you\". Witnessing this, Quaker reflects that he will offer Jerico a job.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Jerico Stewart\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Bill Pope\n* [[Gal Gadot]] as Jillian \"Jill\" Pope\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Quaker Wells\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Dr. Micah Franks \n* [[Alice Eve]] as Marta Lynch \n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Jan Strook\n* [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] as Xavier Heimdahl\n* [[Antje Traue]] as Elsa Mueller\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Pete Greensleeves \n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as Esteban Ruiza\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as Warden\n* [[Robert Davi]] as Admiral Lance (uncredited)\n* [[Richard Reid (actor)|Richard Reid]] as James Osborne\n* [[Natalie Burn]] as Shoo Shoo\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nOn June 20, 2013, it was announced that [[Millennium Films]] had acquired the script for ''Criminal'', written by [[Douglas S.

Cook|Douglas Cook]] and [[David Weisberg]]. The film is about a convict who is implanted with a dead CIA agent's memories to finish an assignment. The film stars [[Kevin Costner]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Tommy Lee Jones]], in the second collaboration among all three following the 1991 film ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. The film also features [[Alice Eve]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Michael Pitt]], [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]], [[Antje Traue]], [[Scott Adkins]], [[Amaury Nolasco]], and [[Ryan Reynolds]].\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on September 4, 2014, in [[London]]. The film was produced by [[Campbell-Grobman Films]] and [[Millennium Films]] and was released on April 15, 2016 and received negative reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb|box office failure]], grossing only $38.8 million against its $31.5 million  budget.\n\n==Plot==\nIndustrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl arranges for his associate Jan Strook\u2014a [[hacker]] known as \"the Dutchman\"\u2014to create a wormhole program that would allow the owner to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes. The Dutchman panics and attempts to hand his secret over to [[CIA]] agent Bill Pope. Although Pope gets the Dutchman to a [[safe house]] and recovers the money to pay him for his services, he is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman.\n\nDesperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's supervisor Quaker Wells contacts Dr. Micah Franks, who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memory patterns of a dead person onto a living one. Franks requests that they \"graft\" Pope's knowledge into the brain of convict Jerico Stewart, whose damaged [[frontal lobe]] has effectively made him a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. \n\nAfter the operation, Jerico escapes custody and fakes his death. He goes to Pope's house, where he holds Pope's widow Jillian hostage while he looks for the money. As time goes on, he experiences memory flashes of Pope's past, but all he can determine is that the bag of money was hidden behind a bookshelf, without identifying where it or the Dutchman are kept.\n\nThe CIA learns that the Dutchman is planning to sell the program to the Russians, believing that the CIA has betrayed him. Fortunately, they are able to find Jerico after he contacts Dr. Franks for medication using Pope's CIA codes. Jerico is beginning to develop emotions and draw on Pope's experience. As Jerico attempts to retrace the route Pope took to hide the Dutchman, Heimdahl creates a distraction at the airport that draws Wells' attention, allowing Heimdahl's accomplice and lover Elsa to try and capture Jerico, killing his CIA guards before Jerico escapes by driving off a bridge.\n\nJerico retreats to the Pope house, where he encounters Jillian and explains the situation to her. Although she initially fears him, Jillian comes to accept Jerico as she sees him bonding with her daughter, Emma, allowing Jerico to stay the night. The next morning, Jerico realizes through a conversation with Jillian that the bag is hidden in the rare books collection at the [[University of London]] where she works. He attempts to retrieve the bag, but he is captured by Heimdahl and Elsa once he has found it. Heimdahl threatens to kill Jillian and Emma unless Jerico takes him to the Dutchman.\n\nWith the CIA and a Russian strike team now seeking the Dutchman, Jerico\u2014who has recalled that Pope hid the Dutchman in Jillian's office at the university\u2014is able to escape Elsa using an improvised [[nitro-glycerine]] bomb, returning to the office to provide a hurried explanation to the Dutchman. Elsa finds them before they can escape, shooting Jerico in the shoulder and killing the Dutchman, but Jerico gets the upper hand and bludgeons her to death with a lamp.\n\nJerico takes the flash drive containing the wormhole program to the airfield where Heimdahl is attempting an escape. Jerico saves Jillian and Emma, even as Heimdahl shoots him. As Heimdahl's plane takes off, Jerico reveals to Wells that he had the Dutchman reprogram the wormhole so that it would target the source of the next transmission. This results in Heimdahl unwittingly destroying his own plane when he tries to fire a missile at the airfield.\n\nA few months later, Jerico is shown on the beach where Pope and Jillian had their honeymoon. He is initially unresponsive to anything but automatic reflexes and responses. With all other options exhausted, Wells and Franks take Jillian and Emma to see him. The sight of Pope's family confirms that some part of Pope exists in Jerico as he responds with a nose-tap. This was Pope and Jillian's way of saying \"I love you\". Witnessing this, Quaker reflects that he will offer Jerico a job.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kevin Costner]] as Jerico Stewart\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Bill Pope\n* [[Gal Gadot]] as Jillian \"Jill\" Pope\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Quaker Wells\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as Dr. Micah Franks \n* [[Alice Eve]] as Marta Lynch \n* [[Michael Pitt]] as Jan Strook\n* [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] as Xavier Heimdahl\n* [[Antje Traue]] as Elsa Mueller\n* [[Scott Adkins]] as Pete Greensleeves \n* [[Amaury Nolasco]] as Esteban Ruiza\n* [[Colin Salmon]] as Warden\n* [[Robert Davi]] as Admiral Lance (uncredited)\n* [[Richard Reid (actor)|Richard Reid]] as James Osborne\n* [[Natalie Burn]] as Shoo Shoo\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nOn June 20, 2013, it was announced that [[Millennium Films]] had acquired the script for ''Criminal'', written by [[Douglas S.

In his working life, he was a schoolmaster, and most of his first-class cricket was played in school holiday times.\n\n==Cricket career==\nEducated at [[Downside School]] where he was later a teacher, the bespectacled Watts was a successful schoolboy cricketer as a left-handed middle-order batsman and a leg-break bowler. He appeared in the public schools cricket festival at [[Lord's]] in August 1939, where he top-scored for \"The Rest\" in the match against the \"Lord's Schools\", and then featured in the combined schools side to play the [[British Army cricket team|Army]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/136/136321.html | title = Scorecard: Army v Public Schools | date = 9 August 1939| publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}</ref> From Lord's he went straight into the Somerset side for the final four matches of the 1939 [[County Championship]] season, batting in the lower order and making 76 runs in six innings.\n\nWatts went to Cambridge University in 1940 and appeared in the 1941 wartime Varsity cricket match against Oxford. In September 1942, he was commissioned into the [[Rifle Brigade]] as a second lieutenant.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35758|page=4638|date=23 October 1942}}</ref> He was promoted to lieutenant in November 1945<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37364|page=5742|date=23 November 1945}}</ref> and finally resigned his commission in March 1947 with the honorary rank of major.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37904|page=1207|date=11 March 1947}}</ref>\n\nWatts' resumption of a first-class cricket career pre-dated his discharge from the army: he played in nine games for Somerset in the 1946 season, and made his first first-class 50 in the game against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] at [[Trent Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17735.html | title = Scorecard: Nottinghamshire v Somerset | date = 6 July 1946| publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}</ref> In 1947, Watts played virtually a full season of first-class cricket, with 11 matches for Cambridge University followed by 12 for Somerset.
