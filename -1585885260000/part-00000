The earliest known settlement in the area can be dated to the 7th century CE, but there was no permanent settlement for a long period and it was not known as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi until the [[Dzungar Khanate]] in the 17th century, and the current city dates from the rebuilding started in the 18th century.\n\n=== Early period ===\nDuring prehistory, the [[Gushi culture|Jushi]] or Gushi, a nomadic people who lived on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, inhabited the area.\n\nThe oldest known settlement in the area, a village called '''Urabo''' (or Wulabo), was located about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the southern suburbs of present-day \u00dcr\u00fcmqi.  Under the name '''Luntai''', the  city was established near Urabo by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] government during the 22nd year of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]'s reign (648 AD), as part of the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] that controlled Xinjiang.<ref name=chinatoday>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |title=Urumqi |publisher=Chinatoday.com.cn |date=1 February 1954 |access-date=19 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021021001913/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |archive-date=21 October 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was a seat of local government, and collected taxes from the [[caravan (travellers)|caravans]] along the northern route of the Silk Road.<ref name=chinatoday />\n\nAfter the Tang retreated from the [[Western Regions]], the region came under the control of the [[Uyghurs]] of the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Khaganate]] and [[Gaochang]]/[[Qocho]]. After the Tang until the Qing Dynasty, there was little information about the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi area, and there appeared to be no permanent settlement here for most of this period.

Under the name '''Luntai''', the  city was established near Urabo by the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] government during the 22nd year of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]'s reign (648 AD), as part of the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] that controlled Xinjiang.<ref name=chinatoday>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |title=Urumqi |publisher=Chinatoday.com.cn |date=1 February 1954 |access-date=19 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021021001913/http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/English/chinatours/urumqi.htm |archive-date=21 October 2002 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was a seat of local government, and collected taxes from the [[caravan (travellers)|caravans]] along the northern route of the Silk Road.<ref name=chinatoday />\n\nAfter the Tang retreated from the [[Western Regions]], the region came under the control of the [[Uyghurs]] of the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Khaganate]] and [[Gaochang]]/[[Qocho]]. After the Tang until the Qing Dynasty, there was little information about the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi area, and there appeared to be no permanent settlement here for most of this period.
