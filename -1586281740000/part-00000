It also marked the 19th and final season under the ownership of [[Malcolm Glazer]], who died on May 28, 2014. The Buccaneers finished with a record of 4\u201312 and failed to improve their 7\u20139 record from last season, and were eliminated from postseason contention in Week 13. For the first time since 1996, longtime cornerback Ronde Barber was not on the roster, as he retired in May 2013.\n\nDespite having a +10 turnover margin (tied for 3rd best in the NFL), and franchise rookie quarterback records from third round [[2013 NFL Draft|draft]] pick [[Mike Glennon]], the overall offensive production ranked near the bottom of the league in most categories. The team ranked 32nd (last) in total yards, 32nd (last) in passing yards, 30th in total points scored. The team also had the third-most penalties in the league (121 for 1,136 yards), and ranked 31st in third down conversions. Running back [[Doug Martin (running back)|Doug Martin]] went on injured reserve halfway through the season with a shoulder injury. His replacement, [[Bobby Rainey]] had a solid performance, scoring his first career touchdown, and setting a franchise record for longest touchdown run (80 yards). On the defensive side, the offseason news was highlighted by the free agent acquisition of [[Darrelle Revis]], and [[Lavonte David]]'s stellar numbers.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Season==\nThe team got off to a dismal start, which created considerable tension inside and outside the locker room, as well as among fans. The fan support of head coach Greg Schiano began to decay, as illustrated by a local radio station erecting a billboard carrying the message \"Fire Schiano.\"<ref>[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9872198/fire-schiano-billboard-appears-tampa-bay-buccaneers-winless Sign calls for Greg Schiano's firing, ESPN.com]</ref> The trouble started on opening day, as Tampa Bay had a last-second loss to the Jets, owing primarily to a personal foul late hit penalty, which advanced the Jets into field goal range, and an improbable comeback victory. Late-game losses to New Orleans, Arizona, and Seattle brought the Buccaneers to an 0\u20138 start. The Buccaneers won four of their next five games, but were ultimately eliminated from playoff contention by December, and they dropped the last three games.\n\nOne day after the conclusion of the regular season, head coach Greg Schiano and general manager Mark Dominik were fired.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, all eight regular season home games were announced as a \"sellout,\" and no regular season games were blacked out locally. Due to the new concussion rule, the Bucs did not wear their \"creamsicle\" throwback uniforms at all during this season.\n\n[[Darrelle Revis]] was named the ''[[Sporting News]]'' [[National Football League Comeback Player of the Year Award#Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year award|Comeback Player of the Year]].\n\n===Josh Freeman benching===\nThe season started out on a rocky note, as reports of a rift between head coach [[Greg Schiano]] and starting quarterback [[Josh Freeman]] were coming from the locker room. Freeman was entering the final season of his contract, and trade rumors were already being tossed around by media and fans. An allegation surfaced that Schiano rigged the voting for [[National Football League team captains|team captains]], which prevented Freeman from being selected by his teammates.<ref name=\"ESPN 9-13-13\">{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9664746/greg-schiano-tampa-bay-buccaneers-josh-freeman-overslept-missed-photo|title=Josh Freeman overslept for photo|publisher=ESPN.com|first=Pat|last=Yasinskas|date=September 13, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}</ref> The next day, Freeman missed the annual team photo session, an absence he blamed on \"oversleeping.\"<ref name=\"ESPN 9-13-13\"/> After starting the season 0\u20133, Freeman was quickly criticized for his poor offensive output, throwing a league-worst 45.3% completion percentage, two interceptions, and only two touchdown passes.<ref name=\"USAToday\">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/buccaneers/2013/09/25/bucs-bench-josh-freeman-for-mike-glennon-starting-quarterback-greg-schiano-trade-general-manager-mark-dominik/2867585/|title=Bucs bench Josh Freeman, then put him on the market|publisher=USA Today|first=Jim|last=Corbett|date=September 25, 2013|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref> It was also leaked that Freeman was a stage one participant in the NFL drug program,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9750827/josh-freeman-tampa-bay-buccaneers-nfl-drug-program|title=Sources: Bucs QB not facing penalty|publisher=ESPN.com|first=Chris|last=Mortensen|date=October 1, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}</ref> a situation related to his treatment of [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.620wdae.com/pages/bucs.html?article=11697903|title=Josh Freeman Releases Statement Following Report|publisher=WDAE|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=September 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003025355/http://www.620wdae.com/pages/bucs.html?article=11697903|archive-date=October 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> On week four, Freeman was benched in favor of rookie [[Mike Glennon]],<ref name=\"USAToday\"/> and on October 3, 2013, Freeman was released from the team as he granted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9764541/tampa-bay-buccaneers-release-josh-freeman|title=Bucs release Josh Freeman|publisher=ESPN.com|date=October 3, 2013|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===MRSA outbreak===\nDuring [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]], an outbreak of [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] was reported in the Tampa Bay locker room.

It also marked the 19th and final season under the ownership of [[Malcolm Glazer]], who died on May 28, 2014. The Buccaneers finished with a record of 4\u201312 and failed to improve their 7\u20139 record from last season, and were eliminated from postseason contention in Week 13. For the first time since 1996, longtime cornerback Ronde Barber was not on the roster, as he retired in May 2013.\n\nDespite having a +10 turnover margin (tied for 3rd best in the NFL), and franchise rookie quarterback records from third round [[2013 NFL Draft|draft]] pick [[Mike Glennon]], the overall offensive production ranked near the bottom of the league in most categories. The team ranked 32nd (last) in total yards, 32nd (last) in passing yards, 30th in total points scored. The team also had the third-most penalties in the league (121 for 1,136 yards), and ranked 31st in third down conversions. Running back [[Doug Martin (running back)|Doug Martin]] went on injured reserve halfway through the season with a shoulder injury. His replacement, [[Bobby Rainey]] had a solid performance, scoring his first career touchdown, and setting a franchise record for longest touchdown run (80 yards). On the defensive side, the offseason news was highlighted by the free agent acquisition of [[Darrelle Revis]], and [[Lavonte David]]'s stellar numbers.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Season==\nThe team got off to a dismal start, which created considerable tension inside and outside the locker room, as well as among fans. The fan support of head coach Greg Schiano began to decay, as illustrated by a local radio station erecting a billboard carrying the message \"Fire Schiano.\"<ref>[http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9872198/fire-schiano-billboard-appears-tampa-bay-buccaneers-winless Sign calls for Greg Schiano's firing, ESPN.com]</ref> The trouble started on opening day, as Tampa Bay had a last-second loss to the Jets, owing primarily to a personal foul late hit penalty, which advanced the Jets into field goal range, and an improbable comeback victory. Late-game losses to New Orleans, Arizona, and Seattle brought the Buccaneers to an 0\u20138 start. The Buccaneers won four of their next five games, but were ultimately eliminated from playoff contention by December, and they dropped the last three games.\n\nOne day after the conclusion of the regular season, head coach Greg Schiano and general manager Mark Dominik were fired.\n\nFor the first time since 2009, all eight regular season home games were announced as a \"sellout,\" and no regular season games were blacked out locally. Due to the new concussion rule, the Bucs did not wear their \"creamsicle\" throwback uniforms at all during this season.\n\n[[Darrelle Revis]] was named the ''[[Sporting News]]'' [[National Football League Comeback Player of the Year Award#Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year award|Comeback Player of the Year]].\n\n===Josh Freeman benching===\nThe season started out on a rocky note, as reports of a rift between head coach [[Greg Schiano]] and starting quarterback [[Josh Freeman]] were coming from the locker room.

It started its operation on January 1, 1980. Apart from the National Bank of Hungary, the shareholders of the bank included leading European and Japanese banks. CIB started its business with an authorized and paid-up capital of US$20 million, and conducted it in a geographically neutral manner, influenced only by business considerations.\n\nCIB was registered under the Hungarian Company Law of 1875, subsequently replaced by the Company Law of 1988. Until the end of 1995 the bank pursued its operation on the basis of a licence issued by the Ministry of Finance and then on December 21, 1995 the State Banking Supervision licensed CIB Bank to conduct a commercial banking business.\n\nOn the basis of the operating licence, the bank performed transactions in convertible currencies only. The customers of the bank gradually included more and more Hungarian companies and organisations making use of the services of the bank subject to the licences of the foreign exchange authorities.\n\nSince the customers of the bank showed an ever-increasing need for HUF transactions, CIB and its foreign shareholders decided to found an onshore bank. This became possible with the establishment of the two-tier banking system. This was how CIB Hung\u00e1ria Bank Rt. was founded in 1988 and thus the convertible currency services of CIB were completed with commercial banking services available in HUF.\n\nCIBINTRA International Trading Co. Ltd. was established in 1989 by Central-European International Bank Ltd. and its domestic subsidiary, CIB Hung\u00e1ria Bank Rt. on the basis of Act VI. (Company Law) of 1988. Its legal successor, CIB Rent Leasing Co. Ltd. together with the newly founded CIB Leasing Co. Ltd., deal with financial and operating lease activities.\n\nCIB Securities Ltd. is the investment company of CIB Bank. Its legal predecessor, CIB Broker Co. Ltd. was founded in December 1992 as a fully owned subsidiary of CIB Hung\u00e1ria Bank Rt. Following several capital increases, the initial capital of HUF 5 million grew to HUF 1.8 billion by December 1996 and on December 31, 1996 the company transformed into a joint stock company. The company meets the criteria of an investment company required in the Securities Act. As a result of the decisions of the shareholder aiming to increase capital, the registered and fully paid-up capital of the company grew to HUF 3.1 billion in January 1998 and to HUF 4.4 billion in March 1999. The company has been a member of the Budapest Stock Exchange since June 1993. It has been licensed for full securities trading and issuing activities since November 1994. In October 1995, its scope of activities was extended with fund management. CIB Securities Ltd. entered the futures market first as a broker and then on January 1, 1997 it became a primary dealer of government securities.\n\nCIB Securities Ltd. is one of the leading participants on the government securities market. Considering corporate bonds, CIB Securities Ltd. had the largest turnover among providers of investment services.CIB Securities Ltd. founded CIB Investment Fund Management Ltd. on April 1, 1997. The company first launched CIB-KINCSEM Open-Ended Investment Fund on June 5, 1997, which was followed by CIB Open-Ended Equity Fund on May 7, 1998. The third fund - the CIB International Securities Fund - was launched on the market on May 3, 1999. The fourth member of the CIB Fund Family - the CIB Money Market Fund - was launched in May 2000. The name and investment strategy of the CIB International Securities Fund was changed in May 2001. It now operates as the CIB European Equity Fund.\n\nCIB Service Ltd. was founded on the basis of the resolution passed by the Board of Directors in September 1996. The objective of the company is property management and rendering services, primarily to cater for the physical needs of the Group's headquarters and branch network. At the end of 1997 the Bank's organization and ownership underwent a profound change. The change in the regulatory environment, requirements deriving from approaching European integration made it necessary for the National Bank of Hungary to sell its 34% stake. The other shareholders had pre-emptive rights for purchasing these shares. The rearrangement of the ownership structure took place in a way that one of the founding shareholders, the Banca Commerciale Italiana Group purchased not only the shares of NBH but also those of the other shareholders, except for 5% retained temporarily by the Long-Terms Credit Bank of Japan.\n\nThe change in the regulatory environment, particularly the liberalization of foreign exchange transactions caused the earlier authorizations of CIB to lose their practical value. Also, the simultaneous operation of two banks became a source of difficulties to an increasing extent. Maintaining the original status of CIB and the resulting operation of two separate banks made no sense any longer. Consequently, Central-European International Bank Ltd. and CIB Hung\u00e1ria Bank Rt. amalgamated as of January 1, 1998. This new bank continued operation under the name of the former parent bank with a full authorization to conduct both local currency and foreign exchange business, like any other domestic commercial bank. The unified bank offers its clientele all services offered by the two banks prior to the merger.\n\nCIB Bank started to establish its branch network in 1992. The process accelerated during the last few years. At the beginning of 2006 the bank had 98 active branches, of which 44 were located and served the customers in Budapest and 54 in the countryside.\n\nIn early 1999, another change occurred in the ownership structure. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan decided to part with its 5% equity participation. The Italian banking group, already the majority shareholder, acquired the shares and became the sole and exclusive shareholder of CIB Bank.\n\nFollowing these changes, Banca Intesa acquired influential participation in the parent company, the Banca Commerciale Italiana, seated in Milan, so the Group changed its name to Gruppo Banca Intesa, effective 1 Jan. 2003.\n\nIn Jan. 2007, by way of the fusion of the parent bank of CIB, Banca Intesa and Sanpaolo IMI, the third-largest Italian Bank, the biggest bank group of Italy came about under the name Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A. The group plays a definitive role in the European financial market.\n\nFollowing the example of the mother institutions, CIB Bank and Inter-Europa Bank have also joined their forces, mixing the ancestors best knowledge and tradition.  From 1 January 2008 it  will continue its activity under the name CIB Bank Ltd. With the merger, Hungary's second largest bank started to operate, which was resulted in a branch network of almost 140 units, multiple prize-winner electronic channels, and many renewed products and services.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of banks]]\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cib.hu/index?defaultLanguage=english CIB Bank official website]\n\n{{Banks of Hungary}}\n\n[[Category:Banks of Hungary]]\n[[Category:Banks established in 1979]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Budapest]]\n[[Category:Intesa Sanpaolo subsidiaries]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=March 2011}}\n{{Infobox company\n|logo   = CIB Bank logo.png\n|type   = [[Public company|Public]]\n|foundation     = 1979\n|location       = [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] \n|key_people     = \n|industry       = [[Finance and insurance]]\n|products       = [[Commercial bank]]ing\n|homepage       = [http://www.cib.hu/ www.cib.hu]\n}}\n\n'''CIB Bank''' is the second-biggest [[commercial bank]] in [[Hungary]], after the 1 January 2008 merger with [[Inter-Eur\u00f3pa Bank]].

This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence.

This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H. Bautista, personal assistants of Imelda, and Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, who played key roles in helping the Marcoses purchase and conceal ownership of their Manhattan properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nImelda Marcos purchased five expensive Manhattan condominiums at the Olympic Towers, located on 5th Avenue, New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first three condominiums were purchased by Thetaventure Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shell corporation, for a total of $688,000 and was remodelled for $3.75 million. The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" /> All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

This was taking place at the same time that China was beginning to accept free-market capitalism and American businesses were jockeying to establish manufacturing plants in China. The political troubles of the Philippines hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.\n\nIn an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program and despite his growing isolation from American businesses, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts \u2013 to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.\n\nHowever, the economy continued to shrink despite the government's recovery efforts due to a number of reasons. Most of the so-called government development programs failed to materialize. Government funds were often siphoned off by Marcos or his cronies. American investors were discouraged by the Filipino economic elite who were against the corruption that by now had become endemic in the Marcos regime.<ref name=\"albert\">{{cite book|last1=Celoza|first1=Albert|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: The Political Economy of Authoritarianism|date=November 25, 1997|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0275941376}}</ref> The failure of the recovery program was further augmented by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility.

Two Americans, namely attorney Richard Hirschfeld and business consultant Robert Chastain, both of whom posed as arms dealers, gained knowledge of a plot by gaining Marcos's trust and secretly tape recorded their conversations with the ousted leader.\n\nAccording to Hirschfeld, he was first invited by Marcos to a party held at the latter's family residence in Oahu, Hawaii. After hearing that one of Hirschfeld's clients was Saudi Sheikh Mohammad Fassi, Marcos's interest was piqued because he had done business with Saudis in the past. A few weeks later, Marcos asked for help with securing a passport from another country, in order to travel back to the Philippines while bypassing travel restrictions imposed by the Philippines and United States governments. This failed, however, and subsequently Marcos asked Hirschfeld to arrange a $10-million loan from Fassi.\n\nOn January 12, 1987, Marcos stated to Hirschfeld that he required another $5-million loan \"in order to pay 10,000 soldiers $500 each as a form of 'combat life insurance.' When asked by Hirschfeld if he was talking about an invasion of the Philippines, Marcos responded, \"Yes.\" Hirschfeld also recalled that the former president said that he was negotiating with several arms dealers to purchase up to $18 million worth of weapons, including tanks and heat-seeking missiles, and enough ammunition to \"last an army three months.\"\n\nMarcos had thought of being flown to his hometown in Ilocos Norte, greeted by his loyal supporters, and initiating a plot to kidnap Corazon Aquino. \u2033What I would like to see happen is we take her hostage,\u2033 Marcos told Chastain. \u2033Not to hurt her ... no reason to hurt her .. to take her.\u2033\n\nLearning of this plan, Hirschfeld contacted the US Department of Justice, and was asked for further evidence.

This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.<ref>For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&pg=PA153|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|author1=Chaikin, David|author2=Sharman, Jason Campbell|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy}}</ref> The old social and economic elite, all of whom relied on trade and agricultural and industrial exports to the United States such as the families of Enrile, Lopez, Cojuangco, and Aquino, sought a free-market economy. At this point, Marcos controlled both the oligarchy and the oligopoly.\n\n====Establishment of Metro Manila====\nWithout the consent of the people of Manila and environs, Marcos merged four neighboring cities and thirteen municipalities into a Metro Manila. Without the consent of residents of the merged cities and municipalities, he appointed his wife, Imelda Marcos as governor of Metro Manila - the second most powerful office in the republic. Given that Metro Manila accounts for around 20% of the country's population, it is estimated to be responsible for at least 70% of gross national receipts. It is the seat of the national government and some 90% of the national government's offices and instrumentalities are located within its environs. Its budget is second to the national government. In the words of Carlos P. Romulo, Mrs. Marcos was the ''de facto'' Vice President of the Philippines. Because of this, the Marcoses possessed a monopoly of power.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Floating Casino in Manila Bay====\nOne of the first acts of Imelda Romualdez Marcos as the Governor of Metro Manila was to legalize gambling to raise revenue for the new metropolis. A floating casino was allowed to operate exclusively inside the Manila Bay. It is owned and operated by \u201cmysterious\u201d stockholders according to the major daily. However, the people of Manila are aware that behind the floating casino management was the brother of Imelda Marcos. One of the most lucrative gambling managements back then was the Jai-Alai, managed by a corporation that received its franchise from the pre-war Commonwealth government. As soon as its franchised expired, a new corporation took over management of Jai-Alai. It was immediately under the control of the First Lady's brother. This new management was allowed to perform operations denied from the former, and it is estimated that the take between the Jai-Alai fronton and the floating casino is Php 2 million a day.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)====\nReports of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have described massive million-dollar bribes to officials of the government-backed Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company by the General Telephone and Electric Co. of New York in exchange for supply contracts. The officials of PLDT needed to be investigated for violations of foreign currency regulations and unearned income. However, different stakeholders were kept silent. As one PLDT official boasted \u201can expose will only hurt the Palace.\u201d In the U.S. and Japan, presidents have been driven out of office for similar misconduct.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO)====\nThe Manila Electric Co. (MERALCO) was one of the largest corporations in the Philippines before the declaration of Martial Law. It was owned and controlled by the Lopez family. After martial law was imposed, it became the prime target for takeover by the Marcos-Romualdez family. Among the first things the clan did was to arrest the eldest son of Eugenio Lopez, Sr., the major stockholder of Meralco for allegedly plotting the assassination of Ferdinand Marcos.\n\nIn the years 1973\u20131974, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) started applying the oil prize squeeze. As a public utility that supplies power needs of the metro, MERALCO was caught in a vicious vise. Its fuel costs started to double, triple, and quadruple but the government refused to allow them to charge higher consumer rates. Within a year, MERALCO was at the brink of bankruptcy. Government financing institutions refused to guarantee MERALCO's foreign loans. As a result, the company was pushed to the edge of massive defaults in loans.\n\nIt was here that the Marcos-Romualdez clan stepped in. According to Eugenio Lopez, Sr., he was promised the release of his eldest son from prison in exchange for the sale of his control in MERALCO to the Marcos-Romualdez group. After several months of negotiations and with the increasing loan defaults, Mr. Lopez conceded defeat. He even died without seeing his son Eugenio, Jr. released from the Marcos martial law prison.\n\nAfter the Marcos-Romualdez takeover, the government allowed MERALCO to increase consumer rates. The government gave huge subsidies to the company. On the fifth anniversary of martial rule, Jesus Bigornia of Bulletin Today wrote that MERALCO rose as one of the top earners. Around Php 200 million in net income was recorded. This was 168% more than the previous year. Aside from being allowed to raise electricity rates, MERALCO was also exempted from paying the duty of oil imports, which is a form of indirect subsidy it should share with poor consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Infrastructure projects ===\nFerdinand Marcos's term was characterized by booming infrastructure,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/|title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People|website=Martial Law Museum|accessdate=February 27, 2019}}</ref> but to the detriment of the economy and of the lives of Filipinos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//views/imho/124682-marcos-economy-golden-age-philippines|title=Marcos years marked 'golden age' of PH economy?

The projected budget for the construction of CCP was P15 million, but by December 1968 the cost had already reached P48 million, and the construction was not even complete yet. Because of this, Imelda Romualdez Marcos loaned $7 million from the National Investment Development Corporation to finance the remaining amount.

In 1974, National Power was already negotiating with General Electric to get the order. However, Westinghouse, another energy company, hired a lobbyist: Herminio Disini, a friend of Ferdinand Marcos. Using his proximity to Marcos, Westinghouse made a direct offer to Marcos and his cabinet to supply a plant with two 620 MW reactors at a base price of $500 million. The estimated total price was raised to around $650 million because of other charges like fuel and transmission lines.<ref name=\":5\" /> Soon after, the negotiations with General Electric were scrapped, and Westinghouse won the deal. By March 1975, Westinghouse's contract price increased to $1.1 billion for interest and escalation costs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere were numerous issues regarding its safety and usability. After the Three Mile Island incident in the United States, construction of the nuclear power plant was stopped. A safety inquiry was done subsequently, which revealed over 4,000 defects.<ref name=\":5\" /> The site chosen for the nuclear plant was also dangerous, as it was built near the open sea, the then-dormant Mount Pinatubo, and was within 25 miles of three geological faults.<ref name=\":5\" /> The nuclear plant was discontinued in 1986 following the Chernobyl disaster.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its goal of generating 620 MW of electricity was never achieved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/camacho2/|title=The Controversy of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant|website=large.stanford.edu|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts cost reached over $2.3 million and was only paid off by the government in April 2017, 31 years after the beginning of its construction. However, government spending for the BNPP continues long after that. Maintaining the plant costs the government P40 million a year. In 2011, the government had to reimburse P4.2 billion to National Power Corporation for the plant's maintenance. To contribute to the cost of its maintenance, it was transformed into a tourist attraction.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== San Juanico Bridge ====\n[[File:San Juanico Bridge.jpg|thumb|San Juanico Bridge connecting Leyte and Samar]]\nThe San Juanico Bridge is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and links the provinces of Leyte and Samar through Tacloban City and Santa Rita, Samar.

There was not enough traffic between these two islands to warrant a bridge to be constructed there. It is for this reason that the San Juanico Bridge remains to be the one of the costliest white elephant projects during the Marcos era.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Marcos's Green Revolution ===\nThe Green Revolution is a set of research technology transfer initiatives from the 1950s to 1960s that increased agricultural production worldwide, particularly in developing countries such as the Philippines.<ref name=\":14\">{{Citation|last=Wu|first=Felicia|title=The Green Revolution|date=2004|work=The Future of Genetically Modified Crops|pages=11\u201338|series=Lessons from the Green Revolution|edition=1|publisher=RAND Corporation|isbn=9780833036469|last2=P.Butz|first2=William|jstor=10.7249/mg161rc.11}}</ref>\n\nWith the support of the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in the Philippines. By 1966, the rice variety IR-8 was created. It required intensive irrigation, plenty of fertilizer, and chemical pesticides, but produced substantially higher yields.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nThis led to the creation of Ferdinand Marcos's major programs, Presidential Decree No. 27, the Masagana 99 agricultural program, which had the goal of producing 99 sacks or 4.4 tons of unmilled rice per hectare to ensure self-sufficiency in food.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kenneth|date=1989|title=PALAY, POLICY, AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION: THE \"MASAGANA 99\" PROGRAM REVISITED|url=|journal=Philippine Journal of Public Administration|volume=XXXIII|issue=1|pages=69\u201371|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnnual rice production in the Philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades.The switch to IR8 rice made the Philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nAlthough IR8 showed promising results, the years from 1965 to 1986 showed a complete paradox of events. The income per capita rose, the economy was growing, yet people were in famine. The American economist James K. Boyce calls this phenomenon \u201cimmiserizing growth\u201d, when economic growth, and political and social conditions, are such that the rich get absolutely richer and the poor become absolutely poorer.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/marcos-green-revolution/246377/|title=Marcos' Green Revolution|date=February 22, 2016|website=The Manila Times Online|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Gonzalo Gatan's Pesticide case''\n\nOne of the possible causes to this was the case reported by Gonzalo Gatan of the Manila Pest Control Company against the key implementors of Masagana 99. He was allegedly unable to introduce his agricultural pesticides to the market due to the \"conivance\" between transnational corporations (TNCs) that dominated the production and distribution of chemicals and the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) (Ofreno 1982: 109). In the production of IR8 rice, FPA specified that only certain agricultural pesticides, all of which were German and American pesticide imports, were to be used. Any other pesticide needed to undergo tests at the National Crop Protection Center and at the Bureau of Plant Industry, whose laboratories were headed by German and American specialists. These laboratories were said to have been set up through RP-German Crop Protection Agreement and with the help of the United States Agency for International Development. Therefore, none of Gatan's formulations made it to the FPA recommended pesticides (Ofreno 1982: 109-110).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=BAUTISTA|first=VICTORIA A.|title=Public-Interest Perspective: A Neglected Dimension in the Study of Corruption|date=1983|journal=Philippine Sociological Review|volume=31|issue=3/4|pages=45\u201353|issn=0031-7810|jstor=23898197}}</ref> Probably any other local pesticide which that tried to penetrate the market faced the same fate.\n\n''Land control''\n\nMarcos also allegedly took feudal control of landlords by only covering rice and corn lands to Masagana 99, excluding the vast sugar haciendas of his crony Danding Cojuangco and even Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac.\n\n''Effects of Masagana 99''\n\nAfter the declaration of martial law in 1972, the gap between the rich and the poor became significantly wide. Possible gains from Masagana 99 were either going out of the country or going to the rich alone. Even if rice supply was high and prices were down, people could not afford to buy rice. In a 1979 review of Philippine grain production policy, the World Bank found that total rice consumption in the 1970s slowed, growing at only 2.9%, barely in step with the rate of population increase. Studies by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute found that by 1982, two thirds of families consumed less than the recommended minimum daily calorie intake. 25% of the country's pre-schoolers were stunted, 14% were wasted, and an appalling 69% were underweight. Between 1970 and 1983, infant mortality was at 59 per 1,000 in rural areas and 55 per 1,000 in urban areas \u2013 among the highest in East and Southeast Asia. The cause of infant and child deaths could be directly traced to hunger and a lack of basic health care services.<ref name=\"Marcos' Green Revolution\"/>\n\n===Overseas investments and bank accounts===\nThe overseas properties of Marcos and his associates created an empire spanning places as diverse as California, Washington, New York, Rome, Vienna, Australia, Antilles, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, &nbsp;Switzerland and Singapore.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism|last=Manapat, Ricardo|date=1991|publisher=Aletheia Publications|isbn=978-9719128700|oclc=28428684}}</ref> The more popular properties among those in this empire are the multi-million dollar New York real estate investments, California banks and Swiss bank accounts; lesser known ones are villas in Austria, London, and Rome,&nbsp;gold and diamond investments in South Africa, and banks and hotels in Israel.\n\nThere were ten prominent Filipinos, led by Ferdinand Marcos and Imelda Marcos, who acquired, presumably illegally, various extensive properties in the U.S. They were Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Floirendo, Juan Ponce Enrile, Jose Yao Campos, Eduardo Cojuangco, Roman Cruz, Jr., Geronimo Velasco, and Rodolfo Cuenca.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|title=The transnational dynamics of the Marcos Plunder|last=Aquino, Belinda A.|date=1999|publisher=University of the Philippines, National College of Public Administration and Governance|isbn=978-9718567197|oclc=760665486}}</ref> Other nominees who were noted as having been crucial in considerable overseas transactions were Ricardo Silverio, Herminio Disini, Nemesio Yabi and Edna Camam.<ref name=\":11\"/> Dewey Dee, one of Marcos\u2019 main nominees, as well as Jose Yao Campos would later reveal how they fronted Marcos\u2019 investments both locally and abroad via at least twenty five interlocking corporations set up for this purpose.\n\nThe main way the Marcoses were able to get money abroad was via the laundering of dirty money. Contrary to images commonly conjured by the word \"dirty\", dirty money, as defined by Jean Ziegler, who wrote extensively about the faults of the Swiss banking system, is simply \"capital whose transfer does not relate to any repayment of debt or trading transaction.\" The notion that dirty money is money which was stolen via ''dirty'' means has been used by various officials to excuse the unreasonable transfer of capital abroad, defending themselves through trite legalisms and the urgency of preserving money amidst local hyperinflation and political instability, as well as to completely deny its existence.<ref name=\":7\" /> &nbsp;Estelito Mendoza, Marcos\u2019 Solicitor General, is quoted in Ricardo&nbsp;Manapat's book ''Some Are Smarter than Others: The History of Marcos' Crony Capitalism'' as defining dirty money as money whose \"value moves merely in one direction without any equal compensatory movement in the other.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe process by which Marcos laundered dirty money abroad was very comprehensive and difficult to track. First, overseas bank accounts were established in order to have easy access to the funds without concern for Philippine exchange laws. Often, cronies would choose distinguished U.S. law firms which specialized in offshore real investment in U.S. jurisdictions.<ref name=\":11\"/> Then, a lawyer or accountant would be contacted to establish an offshore corporation, usually in Hong Kong, to serve as the managing director of the corporation. A \"shell\" company, organized solely for the purpose of moving and hiding the true ownership of assets served as a channel for transferring funds from the Philippines inconspicuously.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":7\" /> As this happened, another lawyers, often in the U.S., would be hired for a fee of S200 to S3,000 to arrange for the incorporation of another offshore corporation through accounting firms in Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands Antilles.<ref name=\":11\"/> This would become the significant link between the real estate investment and the client. By this point, it would be more and more convoluted, becoming in the process much more difficult to track. One San Francisco lawyer, who represented affluent Filipino investors in California land deals, said \"You\u2019ll never find out who the principals are. Every time I have ever dealt with these guys, I have never dealt with a document signed by a principal.\" The Marcos group used this very complicated and developed \"laundering\" process of involving multiple layers of dummy corporations scattered internationally to acquire and establish several multimillion assets in various U.S. locations.<ref name=\":11\"/>\n\nMarcos, through different international banks, was able to launder money abroad. Crocker National Bank in San Francisco, for example, had to settle with the US Treasury Department, because they failed to report $4 billion in cash deposits from 1980 to 1984 from six Hong Kong-based banks.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong was a favorite among Filipino launderers. Due to the absence of foreign exchange controls in Hong Kong, it was impossible to determine the origin of the money.\n\nCrocker merely stated that the money came from \"various Asian countries.\"<ref name=\":7\" /> The compliance of private banks with anonymous individuals looking to deposit their money enabled money laundering. Consequently, money laundering is an integral part of private banking. Marcos would later go on to seek the help of other private banks in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Austria, Panama, Liechtenstein, and the Netherland Antilles. The Swiss are known for their mastery in money laundering thanks to the central role of secrecy in their society.<ref name=\":7\" /> Austria, which also has its own tradition of banking secrecy, allowed accounts to be opened without the client ever revealing his or her name, something Swiss banks did not even allow.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hong Kong, more conveniently located for the Philippines, has developed facilities for the movement of money and the ready availability of various British lawyers who offer services of opening front or [[shell corporation]]s for a fee. Panama is noted for its corrupt politicians and convenient transit point to the U.S.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Netherland Antilles served as the home for more than 35,000 shell companies of Marcos in order to invest anonymously in overseas financial markets and U.S. real estates.<ref name=\":7\" /> Throughout the entire process, highly-paid lawyers, accountants, investment consultants and portfolio managers were hired in order to organize shell corporations and acquire overseas properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe Marcoses invested a lot in the US East and West coasts, but there were also important investments in Texas and Washington state.<ref name=\":7\" /> Most of the major real estate investments were Imelda's purchases of real estate in New York, Jose Campos Yao's investments in Texas and Seattle, and crony purchases in California.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nJose Campos Yao, a Marcos ally and crony, along with his associates, purchased a whole city block in Seattle, Washington in 1983.

She elicited the help of key individuals such as Gliceria Tantoco, one of Imelda's closest friends and business associates, Antonio Floirendo, who was instrumental in Imelda's involvement in the lucrative sugar trading business in New York and the purchase of the Olympic Towers, Rolando Gapud, one of Marcos\u2019 financial advisers, Fe Roa Gimenez and Vilma H. Bautista, personal assistants of Imelda, and Joseph and Ralph Bernstein, who played key roles in helping the Marcoses purchase and conceal ownership of their Manhattan properties.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nImelda Marcos purchased five expensive Manhattan condominiums at the Olympic Towers, located on 5th Avenue, New York.<ref name=\":7\" /> The first three condominiums were purchased by Thetaventure Ltd., a Hong Kong-based shell corporation, for a total of $688,000 and was remodelled for $3.75 million. The fourth and fifth condominium were bought for $270,000 and $1.1 million respectively. Imelda also purchased her own resort, the Lindenmere Estate in Center Moriches, Suffolk County, Long Island.

However, at the same time, for the US, the Philippines was just one of its many allies, and for the Philippines, the US was its only patron. Therefore, Marcos ensured to identify himself closely to the US in order to secure a strong bargaining power with their government. Indeed, he had manipulated this American connection to sustain him during his two decades of power. US support was believed to be the only reason why Marcos remained in power.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal|last=Kessler|first=Richard J.|date=1986|title=Marcos and the Americans|journal=Foreign Policy|issue=63|pages=40\u201357|doi=10.2307/1148755|issn=0015-7228|jstor=1148755}}</ref>\n[[File:Marcos visit Reagan 1982.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos meet with President Reagan in 1982]]\nOver his term, Marcos was able to strengthen his ties to the US government. Johnson received two engineer battalions bought with the Philippine's American aid as a form of Philippines military participation in the Vietnam War. After the fall of South Vietnam, Gerald Ford demanded better security assistance from allies, such as the Philippines. While Carter wanted to retain the US military bases in the Philippines to project military power in the Indian Ocean to guard West's oil supply line from the Middle East.<ref name=\":10\" /> All of which, Marcos granted.\n\n==== Obtaining additional aid ====\nTo obtain additional aid, Marcos often leveraged on threats that caught the attention of the US government. To secure additional aid for his campaign, Marcos threatened to search every visiting American naval vessel. The US responded by assisting his campaign indirectly, injecting several million dollars into the government banking system.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Leifer|first=Michael|last2=Thompson|first2=W.

Yet he received warnings from the Philippine embassy in Washington that \u201cprovisions should now be made in anticipation of a possible phasing out or minimization of U.S. aid to the Republic of the Philippines, both for military aid and non-military items, considering the evolving temper of the American Congress.\u201d Afraid, Marcos began to suggests threats again. In one of his presidential speeches, he stated that the bases were a threat to regional peace and security, while reminding the United States of its \"solemn obligation\" to continue aid. He warned that the bases could \"imperil more than they serve our interests.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Presidential Speeches|last=|first=|year=1979|isbn=|location=Manila|pages=275\u2013277|chapter=Speech by Ferdinand E.

In less than 20 days however, the Sandiganbayan listed Imelda's \u201cadvanced age\u201d and health condition as considerations for allowing the accused to post bail. The Fifth Division's (of the Sandiganbayan) ruling read that \u201cthe fact that she is of advanced age and for health reasons, consistent with the doctrine in Enrile vs Sandiganbayan, bail is allowed for these seven cases.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/04/1874021/sandiganbayan-defends-grant-bail-imelda-marcos|title=Sandiganbayan defends grant of bail to Imelda Marcos|website=philstar.com|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirms that the Marcoses\u2019 assets, that are beyond the legal and declared government salaries, are considered as ill-gotten wealth. In 1998 however, the Supreme Court acquitted Imelda Marcos of corruption charges from a previous graft conviction in 1993.\n\nSome US Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit confirmed a contempt judgement in relation to the assets of Imelda and her son Bongbong in the United States. Although on a different subject matter, this judgement awarded $353.6 million to human rights victims, which was arguably the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court.\n\n=== Illegal Swiss foundations ===\nIn 1986, following the overthrow of the Marcos regime, it was discovered that as early as 1968, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, under the pseudonyms William Saunders and Jane Ryan, opened four bank accounts in Swiss banks amounting to nearly $1 million.<ref name=\":11\"/> Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 salary then was only 60,000 pesos a year.<ref name=\":11\" /> Imelda Marcos, on the other hand, did not have any visible means of income.

In December 1997 (Reuters 1997:3), Switzerland's highest court ordered the Swiss banks to return $500 million of Marcos\u2019 secret accounts to the Philippine government, marking a major step forward in efforts to recover the Marcos\u2019 hidden wealth.<ref name=\":11\" /> That same year, the Philippine Senate, through its Blue Ribbon Committee chairman Franklin Drilon, has revealed the existence of 97 alleged accounts of Ferdinand Marcos in 23 banks in Europe, the United States, and Asia, suspected to be depositories of wealth looted from the Philippine treasury. Thirteen of the 23 banks mentioned by Drilon are in Switzerland, namely: Swiss Credit Bank, Swiss Bank Corp., Bankers Trust AG, Banque Paribas, Affida Bank, Copla, S.A., Lombard Odier et Cie, Standard Chartered Bank, Swiss Volkabank, Bank Ricklin, Compaigne Banque Et d\u2019Investissements, Compaigne de Gestion Et De Banque Gonet Sa Nyon, and Bank Hoffman AG.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nThe Sandiganbayan 5th Division has recently convicted Imelda Marcos of seven counts of graft for creating and maintaining private foundations in Switzerland, violating the anti-graft law that prohibits public officials from having pecuniary interests in private businesses.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com//nation/216333-imelda-marcos-guilty-verdict-graft-case-shows-scheme-earnings-swiss-foundations|title=Imelda Marcos verdict shows scheme to earn $200M from Swiss foundations|last=Buan|first=Lian|website=Rappler|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2019}}</ref> As the Sandiganbayan's decision reads, \u201cThough named as a foundation, the evidence shows that these entities were put up primarily for the entrepreneurial activity of opening bank accounts and deposits, transferring funds, earning interests and even profit from investment, for the private benefit of the Marcos family as beneficiaries\u201d.

{"title_page": "Gifted education", "text_new": "'''Gifted education''' (also known as '''gifted and talented education''' ('''GATE'''), '''talented and gifted''' programs ('''TAG'''), or '''G/T education''') is a broad group of special practices, procedures, and theories used in the education of children who have been identified as [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted or talented]].\n\nThe main approaches to gifted education are enrichment and [[Academic acceleration|acceleration]]. An enrichment program teaches additional, related material, but keeps the student progressing through the curriculum at the same rate as other students.  For example, after the gifted students have completed the normal work in the curriculum, an enrichment program might provide them with additional information about a subject. An acceleration program advances the student through the standard curriculum faster than normal. This is done through many different approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10313|title=Types of Acceleration|website=www.davidsongifted.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\nThere is no standard global definition of what a gifted student is; multiple definitions exist. Most definitions select the students who are the most skilled or talented in a given area, e.g., the students with the most skill or talent in music, language, logical reasoning, or mathematics.  The percentage of students selected varies, generally with 10% or fewer being selected for gifted education programs.  However, since students vary in their aptitudes and achievements, a student who is not gifted in one area, such as music, may be considered gifted in another, such as language.  Consequently, even if all programs agreed to include only the top 5% of students in their area, more than just 5% of students would be identified as gifted.\n\n==Forms==\nAttempts to provide gifted education can be classified in several ways. Most gifted students benefit from a combination of approaches at different times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Acceleration===\nPupils are advanced to a higher-level class covering material more suited to their abilities and preparedness. This may take the form of [[Grade skipping|skipping grades]] or completing the normal curriculum in a shorter-than-normal period of time (\"telescoping\").  Subject acceleration (also called partial acceleration) is a flexible approach that can advance a student in one subject, such as mathematics or language, without changing other studies, such as [[history]] or science. This type of acceleration is usually based upon achievement testing, rather than [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]].\n\nSome colleges offer [[Early entrance to college|early entrance programs]] that give gifted younger students the opportunity to attend college early. In the U.S., many [[community colleges]] allow advanced students to enroll with the consent of school officials and the pupil's parents.\n\n[[Academic acceleration|Acceleration]] presents gifted children with academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, and for this reason is a low-cost option from the perspective of the school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. For the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially.<ref>Nicholas Colangelo, N., Assouline, S., and Gross, M., A Nation Deceived:How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest Students, University of Iowa, Volume I, p. 2</ref>  Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, [[psychologist]] Miraca Gross reports: \"the majority of these children [retained in a typical classroom] are socially rejected [by their peers with typical academic talents], isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of [[IQ]] 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress.\"<ref>[http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586 Factors in the social adjustment and social acceptability of extremely gifted children<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190517/http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586|date=2007-09-27}}</ref> These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible.<ref>Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991)</ref> Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Liu|first2=Jonathan K|date=2017|title=Income differences among grade skippers and non-grade skippers across genders in the Terman sample, 1936\u20131976|journal=Learning and Instruction|volume=47|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2016.10.004}}</ref>\n\n===Cluster Grouping===\n[[Cluster grouping]] is the gathering of four to six gifted and talented and/or high achieving students in a single classroom for the entire school day.  Cluster teachers are specially trained in differentiating for gifted learners.  Clusters are typically used in upper elementary grades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Within a cluster group, instruction may include enrichment and extensions, higher-order thinking skills, pretesting and differentiation, compacting, an accelerated pace, and more complexity in content\n\n===Colloquium===\nLike acceleration, colloquium provides advanced material for high school students. In colloquium, students take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes in a different way than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from [[The Scarlet Letter]] in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take [[Advanced Placement]] courses in math and science and vice versa.\n\n===Compacting===\nIn compacting, the regular school material is compacted by pretesting the student to establish which skills and content have already been mastered.  Pretests can be presented on a daily basis (pupils doing the most difficult items on a worksheet first and skipping the rest if they are performed correctly), or before a week or longer unit of instructional time.  When a student demonstrates an appropriate level of proficiency, further repetitive practice can be safely skipped, thus reducing boredom and freeing up time for the student to work on more challenging material.\n\n===Enrichment===\nOn the primary school level, students spend all class time with their peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may be as simple as a modified [[assignment (education)|assignment]] provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as [[Odyssey of the Mind]], [[Destination Imagination]] or academic competitions such as [[Brain Bowl]], [[Future Problem Solving]], [[Science Olympiad]], [[National History Day]], [[science fair]]s, or [[spelling bee]]s. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education<ref>Taber, K. S. (2007). Enriching School Science for the Gifted Learner. London: Gatsby Science Enhancement Programme.</ref>). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like [[English studies|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities.  Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives.  However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.<ref>Assouline, S. and Lupkowski-Shoplik, A., ''Developing Math Talent: A Guide for Educating Gifted And Advanced Learners in Math'' (Prufrock Press), 2005.</ref>\n\n===Full-time separate classes or schools===\n''See also: [[List of gifted and talented programmes]]''\n\nSome gifted students are educated in either a separate class or a separate school. These classes and schools are sometimes called \"congregated gifted programs\" or \"dedicated gifted programs.\"\n\nSome independent schools have a primary mission to serve the needs of the academically gifted. Such schools are relatively scarce and often difficult for families to locate.  One resource for locating gifted schools in the United States can be found on the [[National Association for Gifted Children]]'s \"Resource Directory\" accessible through their home page. Such schools often need to work to guard their mission from occasional charges of elitism, support the professional growth and training of their staff, write curriculum units that are specifically designed to meet the social, emotional, and academic talents of their students, and educate their parent population at all ages.\n\nSome gifted and talented classes offer self-directed or individualized studies, where the students lead a class themselves and decide on their own task, tests, and all other assignments. These separate classes or schools tend to be more expensive than regular classes, due to smaller class sizes and lower student-to-teacher rations. [[Not-for-profit]] (non-profit) schools often can offer lower costs than for-profit schools.  Either way, they are in high demand and parents often have to pay part of the costs.\n\n===Hobby===\nActivities such as [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[creative writing]], [[sport]], [[computer games]], [[chess]], [[music]], [[dance]], foreign languages, and [[art]] give an extra intellectual challenge outside of school hours.\n\n===Homeschooling in the US===\nAn umbrella term encompassing myriad educational options for gifted children: part-time schooling; school at home; classes, groups, mentors and tutors; and [[unschooling]]. In many US states, the population of gifted students who are being [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] is rising quite rapidly, as school districts responding to budgetary issues and standards-based policies are cutting what limited gifted education programs remain in existence, and families seek educational opportunities that are tailored to each child's unique needs\n\n=== Pull-Out ===\nGifted students are [[Gifted Pull-out|pulled out]] of a heterogeneous classroom to spend a portion of their time in a [[gifted class]]. These programs vary widely, from carefully designed half-day academic programs to a single hour each week of educational challenges. Generally, these programs are ineffective at promoting academic advancement unless the material covered contains extensions and enrichment to the core curriculum.  The majority of pull-out programs include an assortment of critical thinking drills, creative exercises, and subjects typically not introduced in standard curricula. Much of the material introduced in gifted pull-out programs deals with the study of [[logic]], and its application to fields ranging from [[philosophy]] to [[mathematics]]. Students are encouraged to apply these empirical reasoning skills to every aspect of their education both in and outside of class.\n\n===Self-pacing===\nSelf-pacing methods, such as the [[Montessori Method]], use flexible grouping practices to allow children to advance at their own pace. Self-pacing can be beneficial for all children and is not targeted specifically at those identified as gifted or talented, but it can allow children to learn at a highly accelerated rate. Directed Studies are usually based on self-pacing.\n\n===Summer Enrichment Programs (United States)===\nThese offer a variety of courses that mainly take place in the summer. Summer schools are popular in the United States. Entrance fees are required for such programs, and programs typically focus on one subject, or class, for the duration of the camp.\n\nSeveral examples of this type of program are:\n\n*[[Center for Talented Youth]]\n*[[CTYI]]\n*[[GERI: Gifted Education Resource Institute, Purdue University]]\n*[[The Johns Hopkins University]]\n\nWithin the United States, in addition to programs designed by the state, some counties also choose to form their own Talented and Gifted Programs.  Sometimes this means that an individual county will form its own TAG program; sometimes several counties will come together if not enough gifted students are present in a single county. Generally, a TAG program focuses on a specific age group, particularly the local TAG programs. This could mean elementary age, high school age, or by years such as ages 9 through 14.\n\nThese classes are generally organized so that students have the opportunity to choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting it out in a performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.\n\n==Identifying gifted children==\nThe term \"Gifted Assessment\" is typically applied to a process of using norm-referenced psychometric tests administered by a qualified psychologist or psychometrist with the goal of identifying children whose intellectual functioning is significantly advanced as compared to the appropriate reference group (i.e., individuals of their age, gender, and country). The cut-off score for differentiating this group is usually determined by district school boards and can differ slightly from area to area, however, the majority defines this group as students scoring in the top 2 percentiles on one of the accepted tests of intellectual (cognitive) functioning or IQ. Some school boards also require a child to demonstrate advanced academic standing on individualized achievement tests and/ or through their classroom performance. Identifying gifted children is often difficult but is very important because typical school teachers are not qualified to educate a gifted student. This can lead to a situation where a gifted child is bored, underachieves and misbehaves in class.<ref name=\"ERIC\">{{cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530599|title=Contemporary Intellectual Assessment: Theories, Tests, and Issues.

However it does not distinguish well among those found to be gifted. Therefore, examiners prefer using a variety of tests to first identify giftedness and then further differentiate. This is often done by using individual IQ tests and then group or individual achievement tests. There is no standard consensus on which tests to use, as each test is better suited for a certain role.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|title=Assessing Intelligence in Children and Adolescents|last=Kranzler|first=John H. ; Floyd, Randy G.|work=Guilford Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201213/http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|archive-date=2014-10-16|url-status=dead|access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n\nThe two most popular tests for identifying giftedness in the school-age population are the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC IV]] and the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|SB5]]. The [[Wechsler Individual Achievement Test|WIAT III]] is considered the most popular academic achievement test to determine a child's aggregate learned knowledge.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nAlthough a newer WISC version, the WISC V, was developed in late 2014, the WISC IV is still the most commonplace test. It has been translated into several languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, German, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Italian. The WISC-IV assesses a child's cognitive abilities, with respect to age group. Coupled with results from other tests, the WISC accurately depicts a child's developmental and psychological needs for the future.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nThe SB5 is an intelligence test that determines cognitive abilities and can be administered to persons in virtually any age group. It assesses a series of intelligence indicators including fluid reasoning, general knowledge, quantitative reasoning, spatial processing, and working memory. The SB5 makes use of both verbal and nonverbal testing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Deborah D.|date=1979-11-30|title=The Stanford-Binet: An Evaluation of the Technical Data Available Since the 1972 Restandardization.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ233903|journal=ERIC|volume=18|issue=3|pages=203\u20139}}</ref>\n\nThe WIAT-III cannot assess all components of learned knowledge, but does give an understanding of a child's ability to acquire skills and knowledge through formal education. This test measures aspects of the learning process that take place in a traditional school setting in reading, writing, math, and oral language. Although the WIAT-III tests a wide range of material, it is designed primarily to assess children's learning before adolescence.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nVersions of these tests exist for each age group. However it is recommended to begin assessment as early as possible, with approximately eight years of age being the optimal time to test. Testing allows identification of specific needs of students and help to plan an education early.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"poppies\" />\n\nOut-of-group achievement testing (such as taking the SAT or ACT early) can also help to identify these students early on (see [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth|SMPY]]) and is implemented by various talent search programs in use by education programs. Out-of-group testing can also help to differentiate children who have scored in the highest percentiles in a single IQ test.<ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nTesting alone cannot accurately identify every gifted child.  Teacher and parent nominations are essential additions to the objective information provided by grades and scores.  Parents are encouraged to keep portfolios of their children's work, and documentation of their early signs of gifted behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaegt.net.au/?page_id=753|title=The Identification of Gifted and Talented Students {{!}} AAEGT - Australian Association for the Education of the Gifted and Talented|website=www.aaegt.net.au|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raisingwizards.com/#!characteristics-of-giftedness/cpqu|title=Characteristics of Gifted Children|last=Natcharian|first=Lisa|date=2015|website=Raising Wizards|publisher=Raising Wizards|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Studies of giftedness==\nThe development of early intelligence tests by [[Alfred Binet]] led to the Stanford-Binet IQ test developed by Lewis Terman. Terman began long-term studies of gifted children with a view to checking if the popular view \"early ripe, early rot\" was true.

Within a single school district, there can be substantial differences in the distribution of measured IQ. (The IQ for the top percentile at a high-performing school may be quite different from that at a lower performing school.)\n\n=== Dr Peter Marshall ===\nDr Peter Marshall obtained his doctorate in 1995, for research carried out in this field in the years from 1986. At the time, he was the first Research Director of The Mensa Foundation for Gifted Children. His work challenged the difficult childhood hypothesis, concluding that gifted children, by and large, do not have any more difficult childhoods than mainstream children and, in fact, that where they do, their giftedness probably helps them cope better than mainstream children. His thesis is published under the title Growing up Gifted \u2013 Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project<ref>Marshall, P. (1995) Growing Up Gifted: Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project, Ph.D. Thesis: University of Manchester</ref> and provided the material for his subsequent book Educating a Gifted Child<ref>Marshall, P (2013) Educating a Gifted Child, London: Oakley Books, {{ISBN|9780956978479}}(3).</ref>\n\nHe has acted as consultant to schools and local education authorities such as Cumbria County Council and Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley Health Authority and Thorncliffe Grammar in Barrow in Furness<ref>Mensa Magazine, March 2014, p.19</ref> and he has been chosen to give the Mensa Lecture on the Subject at Trinity College Cambridge in August 2018.<ref>Mensa Magazine, June 2018,p.11</ref>\n\nIn his book,  Educating a Gifted Child, he analyses a large range of causes of underachievement, explains the social attitudes to giftedness, lists the range of non-intellective aspects of giftedness, and explores the concepts of intelligence and IQ tests.\n\nDr Marshall is the President of The International Association for High Ability (IAFHA),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iafha.com|title=The International Association for High Ability \u2013 A resource site for High Ability Children and Adults}}</ref> which aims to help gifted individuals from all backgrounds to fulfil their potential for the benefit of themselves, their society and the human race in general.\n\nIn ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States federal definition of gifted and talented students:\n\n{{quotation|The term 'gifted and talented' when used in respect to students, children, or youth means [those who show] [[evidence]] of high performance capability in areas such as [[intellectual]], [[creativity|creative]], [[artistic]], or [[leadership]] capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the [[school]] in order to fully develop such capabilities.|P.L. 103\u2013382, Title XIV, p. 388}}\n\nThe National Association for Gifted Children in the United States defines giftedness as:<ref>National Association for Gifted Children. (2011). Redefining giftedness for a new century: Shifting the paradigm [Position Paper]. http://www.nagc.org/sites/default/files/Position%20Statement/Redefining%20Giftedness%20for%20a%20New%20Century.pdf</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Gifted individuals are those who demonstrate outstanding levels of aptitude (defined as an exceptional ability to reason and learn) or competence (documented performance or achievement in top 10% or rarer) in one or more domains. Domains include any structured area of activity with its own symbol system (e.g., mathematics, music, language) and/or set of sensorimotor skills (e.g., painting, dance, sports).\n\nThe development of ability or talent is a lifelong process. It can be evident in young children as exceptional performance on tests and/or other measures of ability or as a rapid rate of learning, compared to other students of the same age, or in actual achievement in a domain. As individuals mature through childhood to adolescence, however, achievement and high levels of motivation in the domain become the primary characteristics of their giftedness. Various factors can either enhance or inhibit the development and expression of abilities.}}\n\nThis definition has been adopted in part or completely by the majority of the states in the United States. Most have some definition similar to that used in the [[State of Texas]], whose definition states:\n\n{{quotation|[The phrase] 'gifted and talented student' means a child or youth who performs at or shows the potential for performing at a remarkably high level of accomplishment when compared to others of the same age, experience, or environment, and who:\n*exhibits high performance capability in an intellectual, creative, or artistic area;\n*possesses an unusual capacity for leadership; or\n*excels in a specific academic field.|74th legislature of the State of Texas, Chapter 29, Subchapter D, Section 29.121}}\n\nThe major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creative, artistic, leadership, academic), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).\n\n====Reliance on IQ====\nIn her book, ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) writes that schools should use a variety of measures of students' capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These measures may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement measures, and intelligence scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single measure can be used in isolation to accurately identify every gifted child.\n\nEven if the notion of IQ is generally useful for identifying academically talented students who would benefit from further services, the question of the cutoff point for giftedness is still important. As noted above, different authorities often define giftedness differently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Identification: The Theory and Practice of Identifying Students for Gifted and Talented Education Services|last1=Lohman|first1=David F.|last2=Foley Nicpon|first2=Megan|publisher=Prufrock|year=2012|isbn=978-1-931280-17-4|editor-last=Hunsaker|editor-first=Scott|location=Waco (TX)|pages=287\u2013386|chapter=Chapter 12: Ability Testing & Talent Identification|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://faculty.education.uiowa.edu/docs/default-source/dlohman/ability-testing-and-talent-identification.pdf?sfvrsn=0|lay-url=http://www.prufrock.com/Identification-The-Theory-and-Practice-of-Identifying-Students-for-Gifted-and-Talented-Education-Services-P1816.aspx|laydate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Classical era to Renaissance===\nGifted and talented education dates back thousands of years.

Between 1888 and 1894, Galton tested more than 7,500 individuals to measure their natural intellectual abilities. He found that if a parent deviates from the norm, so will the child, but to a lesser extent than the parent.<ref>\"Francis Galton, Sir.\" ''World of Sociology''. 2 vols. Gale Group, 2001.</ref> This was one of the earliest observed examples of [[regression toward the mean]]. Galton believed that individuals could be improved through interventions in [[heredity]], a movement he named [[eugenics]]. He categorized individuals as [[gifted]], capable, [[average]], or degenerate, and he recommended breeding between the first two categories, and forced abstinence for the latter two. His term for the most intelligent and talented people was \"eminent\". After studying England's most prominent families, Galton concluded that one's eminence was directly related to the individual's direct line of heredity.<ref>\"Francis Galton.\" ''Science and Its Times'', '''5''': 1800\u20131899. Gale Group, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Lewis Terman===\nAt [[Stanford University]] in 1918, [[Lewis Terman]] adapted [[Alfred Binet]]'s Binet-Simon [[intelligence]] test into the [[Stanford-Binet]] test, and introduced [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scoring for the test. According to Terman, the IQ was one's mental age compared to one's chronological age, based on the mental age norms he compiled after studying a sample of children.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''American Decades''. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> He defined intelligence as \"the ability to carry on abstract thinking\".<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> During [[World War I]] Terman was a commissioned officer of the United States Army, and collaborated with other psychologists in developing intelligence tests for new recruits to the armed forces. For the first time, intelligence testing was given to a wide population of drafted soldiers.\n\nAfter the war, Terman undertook an extensive [[longitudinal study]] of 643 children in California who scored at IQ 140 or above, the [[Genetic Studies of Genius]], continuing to evaluate them throughout their lives. Subjects of these case studies were called \"Termites\" and the studies contacted the children in 1921, and again in 1930, 1947, and 1959 after his death. Terman's studies have to date been the most extensive on high-functioning children, and are still quoted in psychological literature today. Terman claimed to have disproven common misconceptions, such as that highly intelligent children were prone to ill physical and mental health, that their intelligence burned out early in their lives, or that they either achieved greatly or underachieved.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\"Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 6: 1956-1960.

Through project-based learning, students are challenged to use higher order thinking skills. Another focus of the program is autonomous learning; students are encouraged to self-monitor, self-reflect and seek out enrichment opportunities. Entrance to the program is initiated through referral followed by a review by a screening committee. IQ tests are used but not exclusively. Students are also assessed by performance, cognitive ability tests, and motivation. There are 4 MACC's in Vancouver: grade 4/5 and grade 6/7 at Sir William Osler Elementary, grade 5/6/7 at Tecumseh Elementary, and a French Immersion grade 5/6/7 at Kerrisdale Elementary.\n\nAt a lower scale, the [[Peel District School Board]] operates its [[Regional Enhanced Program]] at [[The Woodlands School (Mississauga)|The Woodlands School]], [[Lorne Park Secondary School]], [[Glenforest Secondary School]], [[Heart Lake Secondary School]] and [[Humberview Secondary School]] to provide students an opportunity to develop and explore skills in a particular area of interest. Students identified as gifted (which the PDSB classifies as \"enhanced\") may choose to attend the nearest of these high schools instead of their assigned home high school. In the Regional Enhanced Program, enhanced students take core courses (primarily, but not limited to English, mathematics, and the sciences) in an environment surrounded by fellow enhanced peers. The classes often contain modified assignments that encourage students to be creative.\n\n===Ecuador===\nIn Ecuador, [http://www.cedapecuador.com/ Centro Ecuatoriano para el Desarrollo del Alto Potencial] started in 2018 as the first all around gifted children educational program in the country.

In his introduction to the tenth anniversary edition of his classic work Frames of Mind. The [[theory of multiple intelligences]], he says:\n\nIn the heyday of the psychometric and behaviorist eras, it was generally believed that intelligence was a single entity that was inherited; and that human beings - initially a blank slate - could be trained to learn anything, provided that it was presented in an appropriate way. Nowadays an increasing number of researchers believe precisely the opposite; that there exists a multitude of intelligences, quite independent of each other; that each intelligence has its own strengths and constraints; that the mind is far from unencumbered at birth; and that it is unexpectedly difficult to teach things that go against early 'naive' theories of that challenge the natural lines of force within an intelligence and its matching domains. (Gardner 1993: xxiii)\n\n[[Howard Gardner]] initially formulated a list of seven intelligences, but later added an eighth, that are intrinsic to the human mind: linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, musical, bodily kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and naturalist intelligences.\nIt has become widely accepted at both local and international scales to adopt a broad definition of giftedness using multiple criteria to formulate gifted education policy.\n\n;The Mission and Principles of Gifted Education Policy in [[Hong Kong]]\n\nThe mission of gifted education is to systematically and strategically explore and develop the potential of gifted students.

The motto is motivating intelligence for social change. The school, located in central Pune, admits 80 students each year, after thorough testing, which includes two written papers and an interview. The psychology department of Jnana Prabodhini has worked on J. P. Guilford's model of Intelligence.\n\n===Iran===\n[[National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents]] ([[NODET]], also known as [[SAMPAD]],\nPersian: \u0633\u0645\u067e\u0627\u062f, which stands for \u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u062e\u0634\u0627\u0646 in Persian) are national Middle and High Schools in Iran developed\nspecifically for the development of exceptionally talented students in Iran. [[NODET]] was first\nestablished in 1976 and re-established in 1987.\n\nAdmission to NODET schools is selective and based on a comprehensive nationwide entrance\nexamination procedure.\n\nEvery year thousands of students apply to enter the schools, from which less\nthan 5% are chosen for the 99 middle schools and 98 high-schools within the country. All applicants must have a minimum GPA of 19 (out of 20) for attending the entrance exam. In 2006, 87,081 boys and 83,596 girls from 56 cities applied, and finally 6,888 students were accepted for the 2007 middle schools. The admission process is much more selective in big cities like [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]], [[Mashhad]] and [[Karaj]] in\nwhich less than 150 students are accepted after two exams and interviews, out of over 50,000\napplicants.\n\nTop schools of NODET (and also Iran's top) are [[Allameh Helli High Schools|Allameh Helli High School]] and [[Shahid Madani High School]] (in Tabriz), [[Farzanegan High School]] located in [[Tehran]], [[Shahid Ejei High School]] located in [[Isfahan]], [[Shahid Hashemi Nejad High School]] located in [[Mashhad]] and [[Shahid Soltani School]] located in [[Karaj]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.\nCourses taught in NODET schools are college-level in fields such as [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] and [[English Language]]. The best teachers of the ministry of education are chosen mainly by the school's principal and faculty to teach at NODET schools. Schools mainly have only two majors (normal schools have three majors), math-physics and experimental sciences (like math-physics but having biology as the main course). Even though social sciences are taught, there is much less emphasis on these subjects due to the lack of interest in both students and the organization.\n\n===Norway===\nNorway has no centre for gifted or talented children or youth. However, there is the privately run [[Barratt Due Institute of Music]] who offers musical kindergarten, evening school and college for highly talented young musicians. There is also the public secondary school for talents in ballet at Rusel\u00f8kka school in Oslo, who admits the 15 top dancers. On athletics, Privately run Norwegian Elite Sports Gymnasium (NTG) offers secondary school for talents in five locations in Norway.

The center is managed by the [[Korean Educational Development Institute|Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI)]].  Presently twenty-five universities conduct gifted and talented education research in some form; for example, [[Seoul National University]] is conducting Science-gifted Education Center, and [[KAIST]] is conducting Global Institute For Talented Education (GIFTED), the Korean Society for the Gifted and Talented (\ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\uad50\uc721\ud559\ud68c) and the Korean Society for the Gifted (\uc0ac\ub2e8\ubc95\uc778 \ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\ud559\ud68c).\n\nEducation for the scientifically gifted in Korea can be traced back to the 1983 government founding of [[Gyeonggi Science High School]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Kim\n| first =H.J.\n| authorlink =\n| title = A comparative study on gifted education for mathematics in Korea and foreign countries.\n| work = [[Dankook University]]\n| publisher = Dankook University (unpublished master's thesis)\n| year = 2006\n| url =\n| doi =\n}}</ref> Following three later additions ([[Korea Science Academy|Korea Science Academy of KAIST]]; [[Seoul Science High School]] and [[Daegu Science High School]]), approximately 1,500, or 1 in 1,300 (0.08 percent) of high school students are currently enrolled among its four gifted academies.  By 2008, about 50,000, or 1 in 140 (0.7 percent) of elementary and middle school students participated in education for the gifted. In 2005, a program was undertaken to identify and educate gifted children of socioeconomically underprivileged people.  Since then, more than 1,800 students have enrolled in the program.\n\nGradually the focus has expanded over time to cover informatics, arts, physical education, creative writing, humanities, and social sciences, leading to the 2008 creation of the government funded [[Korean National Institute for the Gifted Arts]].  To pluralize the need for trained professional educators, teachers undergo basic training (60 hours), advanced training (120 hours), and overseas training (60 hours) to acquire skills necessary to teach gifted youth.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{Main article|Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)}}\n\nIn Singapore, the [[Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)|Gifted Education Programme]] (GEP) was introduced in 1984 and is offered in the upper primary years (Primary 4\u20136, ages 10\u201312).

Warwick University decided not to reapply for the contract to run NAGTY in 2007, instead introducing its own programme, the [[International Gateway for Gifted Youth]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/aug/28/highereducation.schools\n|title=Why Warwick stopped running the gifted and taolented programme - Gifthorse bolts\n|author=John Crace\n|publisher=The Guardian\n|date=28 August 2007\n|accessdate=7 October 2010|author-link=John Crace (writer)\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/apr/22/schools.uk2\n|title=The future of the gifted and talented programme - The tricky issue of talent\n|author=John Crace\n|publisher=The Guardian\n|date=22 April 2008\n|accessdate=7 October 2010\n|author-link=John Crace (writer)\n}}</ref> In January 2010, the government announced that NAGTY was to be scrapped the following month.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7062061/Ministers-pull-the-plug-on-gifted-and-talented-academy.html\n|title=Ministers pull the plug on gifted and talented academy\n|author=Julie Henry\n|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]\n|date=23 January 2010\n|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, each [[state department of education]] determines if the needs of gifted students will be addressed as a mandatory function of public education. If so, the state determines the definition of which students will be identified and receive services, but may or may not determine how they shall receive services. If a state does not consider gifted education mandatory, individual districts may, thus the definition of what gifted is varies from state or [[district]].<ref>National Association for Gifted Children {{cite web|url=http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=532|title=The Big Picture}} NAGC website. Retrieved on December 31, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn contrast with [[special education]], gifted education is not regulated on a federal level, although recommendations by the [[US Department of Education]] are offered. As such, funding for services is not consistent from state to state, and although students may be identified, the extent to which they receive services can vary widely depending upon a state or district's [[budget]]. \n\nAlthough schools with higher enrollment of minority or low-income students are just as likely to offer gifted programs as other schools, differing enrollment rates across racial and ethnic groups has raised concerns about equity in gifted education in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yaluma |first1=Christopher |last2=Tyner |first2=Adam |title=Is There a Gifted Gap?

For example, [[The Mirman School]] caters to children with an IQ of 138 and above.\n\n== Commonly used terms ==\nSource: Frequently Used Terms in Gifted Education<ref>[http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=565 NAGC - Information & Resources - Glossary of Gifted Terms<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105054659/http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=565 |date=2006-11-05 }}</ref>\n\n;Affective curriculum\n:A curriculum that is designed to teach gifted students about emotions, [[self-esteem]], and [[social skills]]. This can be valuable for all students, especially those who have been grouped with much older students, or who have been rejected by their same-age, but academically typical, [[peer group|peers]].\n\n;[[Differentiated instruction|Differentiation]]\n:Modification of a gifted student\u2019s curriculum to accommodate their specific needs. This may include changing the content or ability level of the material.\n\n;Heterogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students of varied ability, preparedness, or accomplishment in a single classroom environment. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be heterogeneously grouped in math if they were randomly assigned to classes instead of being grouped by demonstrated subject mastery.  Heterogeneous grouping is sometimes claimed to provide a more effective instructional environment for less prepared students.\n\n;Homogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students by specific ability, preparedness, or interest within a subject area. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school.  For example, students in fifth grade would be homogeneously grouped in math if they were assigned to classes based on demonstrated subject mastery rather than being randomly assigned. Homogeneous grouping can provide more effective instruction for the most prepared students.\n\n;[[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP)\n:A written document that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created for students with disabilities, who are required by law to have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating [[boredom]] or [[frustration]], or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning [[disability]] that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical [[classroom]]. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.\n\n==Justification==\nResearchers and practitioners in gifted education contend that, if education were to follow the medical maxim of \"first, do no harm,\" then no further justification would be required for providing resources for gifted education as they believe gifted children to be [[Gifted At-Risk|at-risk]]. The notion that gifted children are \"at-risk\" was publicly declared in the [[Marland report|Marland Report]] in 1972:\n<blockquote>\nGifted and Talented children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs served by the Office of Education.\n\n(pp. xi-xii)<ref name = marland/></blockquote>\nThree decades later, a similar statement was made by researchers in the field: <blockquote>\nNational efforts to increase the availability of a variety of appropriate instructional and out-of-school provisions must be a high priority since ''research indicates that many of the emotional or social difficulties gifted students experience disappear when their educational climates are adapted to their level and pace of learning''.\" [emphasis added]<ref>''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?'', Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002, p. 286.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\nControversies concerning gifted education are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon the appropriateness of the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'. For example, does 'giftedness' refer to performance or potential (such as inherent intelligence)? Many students do not exhibit both at the same time.\n\nMeasures of general intelligence also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially over the past half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven test]]), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many school districts in the United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented.<ref>Yoon, S. Y., & Gentry, M. (2009) Racial and ethnic representation in gifted programs: Current status of and implications for gifted Asian American students. ''Gifted Child Quarterly, 53'', 121-136. doi:10.1177/0016986208330564</ref> However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the [[achievement gap in the United States]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Anderson|first2=Braydon|last3=Johnson|first3=Alyce O.|year=2013|title=The impact of race and ethnicity on the identification process for giftedness in Utah|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|volume=36|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508|doi=10.1177/0162353213506065}}</ref>\n\nSome schools and districts only accept IQ tests as evidence of giftedness. This brings scrutiny to the fact that many affluent families can afford to consult with an [[educational psychologist]] to test their children, whereas families with a limited income cannot afford the test and must depend on district resources.\n\n===Appropriateness of forms of gifted education===\nThis is the most hotly debated aspect of gifted education. Some people believe that gifted education resources lack availability and flexibility. They feel that in the alternative methods of gifted education, the gifted students \"miss out\" on having a \"normal\" childhood, at least insofar as \"normal childhood\" is defined as attending school in a mixed-ability classroom. Others believe that gifted education allows gifted students to interact with peers that are on their level, be adequately challenged, and leaves them better equipped to take on the challenges of life.\n\nAnother facet of this controversy is the effectiveness of the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.\n\n===Class and ethnicity===\nGifted programs are often seen as being elitist in places where the majority of students receiving gifted services are from a privileged background. Identifying and serving gifted children from poverty presents unique challenges, ranging from emotional issues arising from a family's economic insecurity, to gaps in pre-school cognitive development due to the family's lack of education and time.<ref>Paul D. Slocumb and Ruby K. Payne (2000) [http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=656 Identifying and Nurturing the Gifted Poor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114045049/https://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=656|date=2007-11-14}} ''Principal: The New Diversity'' May 2000, Vol. 79, No. 5 - pages 28-32</ref>\n\nIn New York City experience has shown that basing admission to gifted and talented programs on tests of any sort can result in selection of substantially more middle-class and white or Asian students and development of more programs in schools that such students attend.<ref name=\"NYT011213\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/education/in-one-school-students-are-divided-by-gifted-label-and-race.html|title=A System Divided series: Gifted, Talented and Separated: In One School, Students Are Divided by Gifted Label \u2014 and Race|author=Al Baker|date=January 12, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nAnother area of controversy has been the marginalization of gifted females with studies attributing it to self-efficacy, acculturation and biological differences in aptitude between boys and girls for advanced maths.<ref>[http://aer.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/4/598 Camilla Persson Benbow and Julian C.

A person who is intellectually advanced may or may not be advanced in other areas. Each individual student needs to be evaluated for physical, social, and emotional skills without the traditional prejudices which prescribe either \"compensatory\" weaknesses or \"matching\" advancement in these areas.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF8BrSrOqjwC|title=Exceptionally Gifted Children|last=Gross|first=Miraca U.

This behavior is usually discouraged by educators when they recognize it.  Unfortunately, the very educators who want these children to challenge themselves and to embrace their gifts and talents are often the same people who are forced to discourage them in a mixed-ability classroom, through mechanisms like refusing to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nStudents who are young, enthusiastic or aggressive are more likely to attract attention and to disrupt the class by working ahead, giving the correct answers all the time, asking for new assignments, or finding creative ways to entertain themselves while the rest of the class finishes an assignment. This behavior can be mistaken for [[ADHD]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nMany parents of gifted find that it is the social-emotional aspect of their children's lives that needs support. Schools and Talent Development programs often focus on academic enrichment rather than providing time for gifted kids to have the social interaction with true peers that is required for healthy development.  National organizations such as Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted [[SENG]] as well as local organizations, have emerged in an effort to meet these needs.\n\nIt can also happen that some unidentified gifted students will get bored in regular class, daydream and lose track of where the class is in a lecture, and the teacher becomes convinced that the student is slow and struggling with the material.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFinally, G&T students are statistically somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] such as [[bipolar disorder]] and to become addicted to drugs or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Savage|first1=P.

These students can require special attention in school.\n\n===Test preparation===\nIn the United States, particularly in New York City where qualifying children as young as 4 are enrolled in enriched kindergarten classes offered by the public schools, a [[test preparation]] industry has grown up which closely monitors the nature of tests given to prospective students of gifted and talented programs. This can result in admission of significant numbers of students into programs who lack superior natural intellectual talent and exclusion of naturally talented students who did not participate in test preparation or lacked the resources to do so.<ref name=\"NYT021713\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/nyregion/new-york-city-schools-struggle-to-separate-the-gifted-from-the-just-well-prepared.html|title=Schools Ask: Gifted or Just Well-Prepared?|author=Jenny Anderson|date=February 17, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt is virtually impossible to train a child for a [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] test or other gifted test.<ref name=\"hoagiesgifted\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/test_prep.htm|title=How Can I Prepare My Child for Testing?|last=Yermish|first=Aimee|work=Hoagies' Gifted Education}}</ref> Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information.<ref name= hoagiesgifted/><ref name=\"gilman\">{{cite book|title=Academic Advocacy for Gifted Children: A Parent's Complete Guide|last1=Gilman|first1=Barbara Jackson|publisher=Great Potential Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0910707886|pages=62\u201365}}</ref> It would also be disastrous if a non-gifted student was placed in a gifted program.<ref name=gilman/> Reviewing actual test questions can confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style questions is a possibility.<ref name= hoagiesgifted/>\n\nPrivate gifted assessment is usually expensive and educators recommend that parents take advantage of online screening tests to give a preliminary indication of potential giftedness.<ref name=\"shenfield\">{{cite web|url=http://www.psy-ed.com/wpblog/psychological-assessments/gifted-assessments/|title=Gifted Assessments|last=Shenfield|first=Tali|date=2014-06-30|work=Advanced Psychology}}</ref> Another way to screen for giftedness before requesting a psychological assessment is to do a curriculum-based assessment.  Curriculum-based assessment is a form of achievement testing that focuses specifically on what the child has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child's performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies between school districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.<ref name=assess/>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Add your program to the [[List of gifted and talented programmes]], not to other articles. -->\n\n*[[List of gifted and talented programmes]]\n*[[Academic elitism]]\n*[[Exceptional education]]\n*[[Rationale for gifted programs]]\n*[[Selective school]]s\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n# The latest research about gifted education can be found in the academic journals that specialize in gifted education: ''[[Gifted Child Quarterly]]'', ''[[Journal of Advanced Academics]]'', ''[[Journal for the Education of the Gifted]]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20120521020902/http://www.roeper.org/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=1222 Roeper Review]. \n# Assouline, S., and A.

An enrichment program teaches additional, related material, but keeps the student progressing through the curriculum at the same rate as other students.  For example, after the gifted students have completed the normal work in the curriculum, an enrichment program might provide them with additional information about a subject. An acceleration program advances the student through the standard curriculum faster than normal. This is done through many different approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10313|title=Types of Acceleration|website=www.davidsongifted.org|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref>\n\nThere is no standard global definition of what a gifted student is; multiple definitions exist. Most definitions select the students who are the most skilled or talented in a given area, e.g., the students with the most skill or talent in music, language, logical reasoning, or mathematics.  The percentage of students selected varies, generally with 10% or fewer being selected for gifted education programs.  However, since students vary in their aptitudes and achievements, a student who is not gifted in one area, such as music, may be considered gifted in another, such as language.  Consequently, even if all programs agreed to include only the top 5% of students in their area, more than just 5% of students would be identified as gifted.\n\n==Forms==\nAttempts to provide gifted education can be classified in several ways. Most gifted students benefit from a combination of approaches at different times.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Acceleration===\nPupils are advanced to a higher-level class covering material more suited to their abilities and preparedness. This may take the form of [[Grade skipping|skipping grades]] or completing the normal curriculum in a shorter-than-normal period of time (\"telescoping\").  Subject acceleration (also called partial acceleration) is a flexible approach that can advance a student in one subject, such as mathematics or language, without changing other studies, such as [[history]] or science. This type of acceleration is usually based upon achievement testing, rather than [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]].\n\nSome colleges offer [[Early entrance to college|early entrance programs]] that give gifted younger students the opportunity to attend college early. In the U.S., many [[community colleges]] allow advanced students to enroll with the consent of school officials and the pupil's parents.\n\n[[Academic acceleration|Acceleration]] presents gifted children with academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, and for this reason is a low-cost option from the perspective of the school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. For the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially.<ref>Nicholas Colangelo, N., Assouline, S., and Gross, M., A Nation Deceived:How Schools Hold Back America's Brightest Students, University of Iowa, Volume I, p. 2</ref>  Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, [[psychologist]] Miraca Gross reports: \"the majority of these children [retained in a typical classroom] are socially rejected [by their peers with typical academic talents], isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of [[IQ]] 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress.\"<ref>[http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586 Factors in the social adjustment and social acceptability of extremely gifted children<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190517/http://www.gt-cybersource.org/Record.aspx?NavID=2_0&rid=10586|date=2007-09-27}}</ref> These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible.<ref>Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., The Relationship of Grouping Practices to the Education of the Gifted and Talented Learner, (The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented, 1991)</ref> Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school.

Cluster teachers are specially trained in differentiating for gifted learners.  Clusters are typically used in upper elementary grades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Within a cluster group, instruction may include enrichment and extensions, higher-order thinking skills, pretesting and differentiation, compacting, an accelerated pace, and more complexity in content\n\n===Colloquium===\nLike acceleration, colloquium provides advanced material for high school students. In colloquium, students take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) courses. However, colloquium is different from AP classes because students are usually given more projects than students in AP classes. Students in colloquium also generally study topics more in depth and sometimes in a different way than students enrolled in AP classes do. Colloquium is a form that takes place in a traditional public school. In colloquium, subjects are grouped together. Subjects are taught at different times of the day; however, usually what is being taught in one subject will connect with another subject. For example, if the students are learning about colonial America in History, then they might also be analyzing text from [[The Scarlet Letter]] in English. Some schools may only have colloquium in certain subjects. In schools where colloquium is only offered in English and History, colloquium students usually take [[Advanced Placement]] courses in math and science and vice versa.\n\n===Compacting===\nIn compacting, the regular school material is compacted by pretesting the student to establish which skills and content have already been mastered.  Pretests can be presented on a daily basis (pupils doing the most difficult items on a worksheet first and skipping the rest if they are performed correctly), or before a week or longer unit of instructional time.  When a student demonstrates an appropriate level of proficiency, further repetitive practice can be safely skipped, thus reducing boredom and freeing up time for the student to work on more challenging material.\n\n===Enrichment===\nOn the primary school level, students spend all class time with their peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may be as simple as a modified [[assignment (education)|assignment]] provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as [[Odyssey of the Mind]], [[Destination Imagination]] or academic competitions such as [[Brain Bowl]], [[Future Problem Solving]], [[Science Olympiad]], [[National History Day]], [[science fair]]s, or [[spelling bee]]s. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education<ref>Taber, K. S. (2007). Enriching School Science for the Gifted Learner. London: Gatsby Science Enhancement Programme.</ref>). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like [[English studies|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], [[Philosophy]], [[Science]], etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities.  Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives.  However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.<ref>Assouline, S. and Lupkowski-Shoplik, A., ''Developing Math Talent: A Guide for Educating Gifted And Advanced Learners in Math'' (Prufrock Press), 2005.</ref>\n\n===Full-time separate classes or schools===\n''See also: [[List of gifted and talented programmes]]''\n\nSome gifted students are educated in either a separate class or a separate school. These classes and schools are sometimes called \"congregated gifted programs\" or \"dedicated gifted programs.\"\n\nSome independent schools have a primary mission to serve the needs of the academically gifted. Such schools are relatively scarce and often difficult for families to locate.  One resource for locating gifted schools in the United States can be found on the [[National Association for Gifted Children]]'s \"Resource Directory\" accessible through their home page. Such schools often need to work to guard their mission from occasional charges of elitism, support the professional growth and training of their staff, write curriculum units that are specifically designed to meet the social, emotional, and academic talents of their students, and educate their parent population at all ages.\n\nSome gifted and talented classes offer self-directed or individualized studies, where the students lead a class themselves and decide on their own task, tests, and all other assignments. These separate classes or schools tend to be more expensive than regular classes, due to smaller class sizes and lower student-to-teacher rations. [[Not-for-profit]] (non-profit) schools often can offer lower costs than for-profit schools.  Either way, they are in high demand and parents often have to pay part of the costs.\n\n===Hobby===\nActivities such as [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[creative writing]], [[sport]], [[computer games]], [[chess]], [[music]], [[dance]], foreign languages, and [[art]] give an extra intellectual challenge outside of school hours.\n\n===Homeschooling in the US===\nAn umbrella term encompassing myriad educational options for gifted children: part-time schooling; school at home; classes, groups, mentors and tutors; and [[unschooling]]. In many US states, the population of gifted students who are being [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]] is rising quite rapidly, as school districts responding to budgetary issues and standards-based policies are cutting what limited gifted education programs remain in existence, and families seek educational opportunities that are tailored to each child's unique needs\n\n=== Pull-Out ===\nGifted students are [[Gifted Pull-out|pulled out]] of a heterogeneous classroom to spend a portion of their time in a [[gifted class]]. These programs vary widely, from carefully designed half-day academic programs to a single hour each week of educational challenges. Generally, these programs are ineffective at promoting academic advancement unless the material covered contains extensions and enrichment to the core curriculum.  The majority of pull-out programs include an assortment of critical thinking drills, creative exercises, and subjects typically not introduced in standard curricula. Much of the material introduced in gifted pull-out programs deals with the study of [[logic]], and its application to fields ranging from [[philosophy]] to [[mathematics]]. Students are encouraged to apply these empirical reasoning skills to every aspect of their education both in and outside of class.\n\n===Self-pacing===\nSelf-pacing methods, such as the [[Montessori Method]], use flexible grouping practices to allow children to advance at their own pace. Self-pacing can be beneficial for all children and is not targeted specifically at those identified as gifted or talented, but it can allow children to learn at a highly accelerated rate. Directed Studies are usually based on self-pacing.\n\n===Summer Enrichment Programs (United States)===\nThese offer a variety of courses that mainly take place in the summer. Summer schools are popular in the United States. Entrance fees are required for such programs, and programs typically focus on one subject, or class, for the duration of the camp.\n\nSeveral examples of this type of program are:\n\n*[[Center for Talented Youth]]\n*[[CTYI]]\n*[[GERI: Gifted Education Resource Institute, Purdue University]]\n*[[The Johns Hopkins University]]\n\nWithin the United States, in addition to programs designed by the state, some counties also choose to form their own Talented and Gifted Programs.  Sometimes this means that an individual county will form its own TAG program; sometimes several counties will come together if not enough gifted students are present in a single county. Generally, a TAG program focuses on a specific age group, particularly the local TAG programs. This could mean elementary age, high school age, or by years such as ages 9 through 14.\n\nThese classes are generally organized so that students have the opportunity to choose several courses they wish to participate in. Courses offered often vary between subjects, but are not typically strictly academically related to that subject. For example, a TAG course that could be offered in history could be the students learning about a certain event and then acting it out in a performance to be presented to parents on the last night of the program. These courses are designed to challenge the students to think in new ways and not merely to be lectured as they are in school.\n\n==Identifying gifted children==\nThe term \"Gifted Assessment\" is typically applied to a process of using norm-referenced psychometric tests administered by a qualified psychologist or psychometrist with the goal of identifying children whose intellectual functioning is significantly advanced as compared to the appropriate reference group (i.e., individuals of their age, gender, and country). The cut-off score for differentiating this group is usually determined by district school boards and can differ slightly from area to area, however, the majority defines this group as students scoring in the top 2 percentiles on one of the accepted tests of intellectual (cognitive) functioning or IQ. Some school boards also require a child to demonstrate advanced academic standing on individualized achievement tests and/ or through their classroom performance. Identifying gifted children is often difficult but is very important because typical school teachers are not qualified to educate a gifted student. This can lead to a situation where a gifted child is bored, underachieves and misbehaves in class.<ref name=\"ERIC\">{{cite book|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530599|title=Contemporary Intellectual Assessment: Theories, Tests, and Issues.

However it does not distinguish well among those found to be gifted. Therefore, examiners prefer using a variety of tests to first identify giftedness and then further differentiate. This is often done by using individual IQ tests and then group or individual achievement tests. There is no standard consensus on which tests to use, as each test is better suited for a certain role.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|title=Assessing Intelligence in Children and Adolescents|last=Kranzler|first=John H. ; Floyd, Randy G.|work=Guilford Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016201213/http://www.guilfordpress.co.uk/books/details/9781462511211/|archive-date=2014-10-16|url-status=dead|access-date=2014-06-09}}</ref>\n\nThe two most popular tests for identifying giftedness in the school-age population are the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC IV]] and the [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales|SB5]]. The [[Wechsler Individual Achievement Test|WIAT III]] is considered the most popular academic achievement test to determine a child's aggregate learned knowledge.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nAlthough a newer WISC version, the WISC V, was developed in late 2014, the WISC IV is still the most commonplace test. It has been translated into several languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, German, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Italian. The WISC-IV assesses a child's cognitive abilities, with respect to age group. Coupled with results from other tests, the WISC accurately depicts a child's developmental and psychological needs for the future.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nThe SB5 is an intelligence test that determines cognitive abilities and can be administered to persons in virtually any age group. It assesses a series of intelligence indicators including fluid reasoning, general knowledge, quantitative reasoning, spatial processing, and working memory. The SB5 makes use of both verbal and nonverbal testing.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Deborah D.|date=1979-11-30|title=The Stanford-Binet: An Evaluation of the Technical Data Available Since the 1972 Restandardization.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ233903|journal=ERIC|volume=18|issue=3|pages=203\u20139}}</ref>\n\nThe WIAT-III cannot assess all components of learned knowledge, but does give an understanding of a child's ability to acquire skills and knowledge through formal education. This test measures aspects of the learning process that take place in a traditional school setting in reading, writing, math, and oral language. Although the WIAT-III tests a wide range of material, it is designed primarily to assess children's learning before adolescence.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\nVersions of these tests exist for each age group. However it is recommended to begin assessment as early as possible, with approximately eight years of age being the optimal time to test. Testing allows identification of specific needs of students and help to plan an education early.<ref name=\"ERIC\" /><ref name=\"poppies\" />\n\nOut-of-group achievement testing (such as taking the SAT or ACT early) can also help to identify these students early on (see [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth|SMPY]]) and is implemented by various talent search programs in use by education programs. Out-of-group testing can also help to differentiate children who have scored in the highest percentiles in a single IQ test.<ref name=\"assess\" />\n\nTesting alone cannot accurately identify every gifted child.  Teacher and parent nominations are essential additions to the objective information provided by grades and scores.  Parents are encouraged to keep portfolios of their children's work, and documentation of their early signs of gifted behavior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaegt.net.au/?page_id=753|title=The Identification of Gifted and Talented Students {{!}} AAEGT - Australian Association for the Education of the Gifted and Talented|website=www.aaegt.net.au|access-date=2016-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raisingwizards.com/#!characteristics-of-giftedness/cpqu|title=Characteristics of Gifted Children|last=Natcharian|first=Lisa|date=2015|website=Raising Wizards|publisher=Raising Wizards|access-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Studies of giftedness==\nThe development of early intelligence tests by [[Alfred Binet]] led to the Stanford-Binet IQ test developed by Lewis Terman. Terman began long-term studies of gifted children with a view to checking if the popular view \"early ripe, early rot\" was true. The Terman Genetic Studies of Genius longitudinal study has been described by successor researchers who conducted the study after Terman's death and also by an independent researcher who had full access to the study files.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up|last=Shurkin|first=Joel|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1992|isbn=978-0-316-78890-8|location=Boston (MA)|ref=harv|lay-url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-31/books/bk-1247_1_lewis-terman/2|laydate=2 June 2013|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/termanskids00joel}}</ref>\n\nModern studies by James and Kulik<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvCDzqIH3ysC|title=Grouping and Acceleration Practices in Gifted Education - Linda Brody, National Association for Gifted Children (U.S.) - Google Boeken|last1=Brody|first1=Linda E.|date=2004-03-06|isbn=9781412904292|accessdate=2012-04-14}}</ref> conclude that gifted students benefit ''least'' from working in a mixed-level class, and benefit ''most'' from learning with other similarly advanced students in accelerated or enriched classes.\n\n===Definition of giftedness===\nEducational authorities differ on the definition of giftedness: even when using the same [[IQ]] test to define giftedness, they may disagree on what gifted means - one may take up the top 2 percent of the population, another might take up the top 5 percent of a population, which may be within a state, district, or school. Within a single school district, there can be substantial differences in the distribution of measured IQ. (The IQ for the top percentile at a high-performing school may be quite different from that at a lower performing school.)\n\n=== Dr Peter Marshall ===\nDr Peter Marshall obtained his doctorate in 1995, for research carried out in this field in the years from 1986. At the time, he was the first Research Director of The Mensa Foundation for Gifted Children. His work challenged the difficult childhood hypothesis, concluding that gifted children, by and large, do not have any more difficult childhoods than mainstream children and, in fact, that where they do, their giftedness probably helps them cope better than mainstream children. His thesis is published under the title Growing up Gifted \u2013 Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project<ref>Marshall, P. (1995) Growing Up Gifted: Triangulations with the Gulbenkian Project, Ph.D. Thesis: University of Manchester</ref> and provided the material for his subsequent book Educating a Gifted Child<ref>Marshall, P (2013) Educating a Gifted Child, London: Oakley Books, {{ISBN|9780956978479}}(3).</ref>\n\nHe has acted as consultant to schools and local education authorities such as Cumbria County Council and Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley Health Authority and Thorncliffe Grammar in Barrow in Furness<ref>Mensa Magazine, March 2014, p.19</ref> and he has been chosen to give the Mensa Lecture on the Subject at Trinity College Cambridge in August 2018.<ref>Mensa Magazine, June 2018,p.11</ref>\n\nIn his book,  Educating a Gifted Child, he analyses a large range of causes of underachievement, explains the social attitudes to giftedness, lists the range of non-intellective aspects of giftedness, and explores the concepts of intelligence and IQ tests.\n\nDr Marshall is the President of The International Association for High Ability (IAFHA),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iafha.com|title=The International Association for High Ability \u2013 A resource site for High Ability Children and Adults}}</ref> which aims to help gifted individuals from all backgrounds to fulfil their potential for the benefit of themselves, their society and the human race in general.\n\nIn ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) explains that gifted children all exhibit the potential for high performance in the areas included in the United States federal definition of gifted and talented students:\n\n{{quotation|The term 'gifted and talented' when used in respect to students, children, or youth means [those who show] [[evidence]] of high performance capability in areas such as [[intellectual]], [[creativity|creative]], [[artistic]], or [[leadership]] capacity, or in specific academic fields, and who require services or activities not ordinarily provided by the [[school]] in order to fully develop such capabilities.|P.L. 103\u2013382, Title XIV, p. 388}}\n\nThe National Association for Gifted Children in the United States defines giftedness as:<ref>National Association for Gifted Children. (2011). Redefining giftedness for a new century: Shifting the paradigm [Position Paper]. http://www.nagc.org/sites/default/files/Position%20Statement/Redefining%20Giftedness%20for%20a%20New%20Century.pdf</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Gifted individuals are those who demonstrate outstanding levels of aptitude (defined as an exceptional ability to reason and learn) or competence (documented performance or achievement in top 10% or rarer) in one or more domains. Domains include any structured area of activity with its own symbol system (e.g., mathematics, music, language) and/or set of sensorimotor skills (e.g., painting, dance, sports).\n\nThe development of ability or talent is a lifelong process. It can be evident in young children as exceptional performance on tests and/or other measures of ability or as a rapid rate of learning, compared to other students of the same age, or in actual achievement in a domain. As individuals mature through childhood to adolescence, however, achievement and high levels of motivation in the domain become the primary characteristics of their giftedness. Various factors can either enhance or inhibit the development and expression of abilities.}}\n\nThis definition has been adopted in part or completely by the majority of the states in the United States. Most have some definition similar to that used in the [[State of Texas]], whose definition states:\n\n{{quotation|[The phrase] 'gifted and talented student' means a child or youth who performs at or shows the potential for performing at a remarkably high level of accomplishment when compared to others of the same age, experience, or environment, and who:\n*exhibits high performance capability in an intellectual, creative, or artistic area;\n*possesses an unusual capacity for leadership; or\n*excels in a specific academic field.|74th legislature of the State of Texas, Chapter 29, Subchapter D, Section 29.121}}\n\nThe major characteristics of these definitions are (a) the diversity of areas in which performance may be exhibited (e.g., intellectual, creative, artistic, leadership, academic), (b) the comparison with other groups (e.g., those in general education classrooms or of the same age, experience, or environment), and (c) the use of terms that imply a need for development of the gift (e.g., capability and potential).\n\n====Reliance on IQ====\nIn her book, ''Identifying Gifted Children: A Practical Guide'', Susan K. Johnsen (2004) writes that schools should use a variety of measures of students' capability and potential when identifying gifted children. These measures may include portfolios of student work, classroom observations, achievement measures, and intelligence scores. Most educational professionals accept that no single measure can be used in isolation to accurately identify every gifted child.\n\nEven if the notion of IQ is generally useful for identifying academically talented students who would benefit from further services, the question of the cutoff point for giftedness is still important. As noted above, different authorities often define giftedness differently.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Identification: The Theory and Practice of Identifying Students for Gifted and Talented Education Services|last1=Lohman|first1=David F.|last2=Foley Nicpon|first2=Megan|publisher=Prufrock|year=2012|isbn=978-1-931280-17-4|editor-last=Hunsaker|editor-first=Scott|location=Waco (TX)|pages=287\u2013386|chapter=Chapter 12: Ability Testing & Talent Identification|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://faculty.education.uiowa.edu/docs/default-source/dlohman/ability-testing-and-talent-identification.pdf?sfvrsn=0|lay-url=http://www.prufrock.com/Identification-The-Theory-and-Practice-of-Identifying-Students-for-Gifted-and-Talented-Education-Services-P1816.aspx|laydate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Classical era to Renaissance===\nGifted and talented education dates back thousands of years.

Between 1888 and 1894, Galton tested more than 7,500 individuals to measure their natural intellectual abilities. He found that if a parent deviates from the norm, so will the child, but to a lesser extent than the parent.<ref>\"Francis Galton, Sir.\" ''World of Sociology''. 2 vols. Gale Group, 2001.</ref> This was one of the earliest observed examples of [[regression toward the mean]]. Galton believed that individuals could be improved through interventions in [[heredity]], a movement he named [[eugenics]]. He categorized individuals as [[gifted]], capable, [[average]], or degenerate, and he recommended breeding between the first two categories, and forced abstinence for the latter two. His term for the most intelligent and talented people was \"eminent\". After studying England's most prominent families, Galton concluded that one's eminence was directly related to the individual's direct line of heredity.<ref>\"Francis Galton.\" ''Science and Its Times'', '''5''': 1800\u20131899. Gale Group, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Lewis Terman===\nAt [[Stanford University]] in 1918, [[Lewis Terman]] adapted [[Alfred Binet]]'s Binet-Simon [[intelligence]] test into the [[Stanford-Binet]] test, and introduced [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) scoring for the test. According to Terman, the IQ was one's mental age compared to one's chronological age, based on the mental age norms he compiled after studying a sample of children.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''American Decades''. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> He defined intelligence as \"the ability to carry on abstract thinking\".<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\" ''Encyclopedia of World Biography'', 2nd ed. 17 Vols. Gale Research, 1998.</ref> During [[World War I]] Terman was a commissioned officer of the United States Army, and collaborated with other psychologists in developing intelligence tests for new recruits to the armed forces. For the first time, intelligence testing was given to a wide population of drafted soldiers.\n\nAfter the war, Terman undertook an extensive [[longitudinal study]] of 643 children in California who scored at IQ 140 or above, the [[Genetic Studies of Genius]], continuing to evaluate them throughout their lives. Subjects of these case studies were called \"Termites\" and the studies contacted the children in 1921, and again in 1930, 1947, and 1959 after his death. Terman's studies have to date been the most extensive on high-functioning children, and are still quoted in psychological literature today. Terman claimed to have disproven common misconceptions, such as that highly intelligent children were prone to ill physical and mental health, that their intelligence burned out early in their lives, or that they either achieved greatly or underachieved.<ref>\"Lewis Madison Terman.\"Dictionary of American Biography, Supplement 6: 1956-1960.

One of the recommendations the book made was to increase services to gifted education programs, citing [[curriculum]] enrichment or acceleration specifically.

Through project-based learning, students are challenged to use higher order thinking skills. Another focus of the program is autonomous learning; students are encouraged to self-monitor, self-reflect and seek out enrichment opportunities. Entrance to the program is initiated through referral followed by a review by a screening committee. IQ tests are used but not exclusively. Students are also assessed by performance, cognitive ability tests, and motivation. There are 4 MACC's in Vancouver: grade 4/5 and grade 6/7 at Sir William Osler Elementary, grade 5/6/7 at Tecumseh Elementary, and a French Immersion grade 5/6/7 at Kerrisdale Elementary.\n\nAt a lower scale, the [[Peel District School Board]] operates its [[Regional Enhanced Program]] at [[The Woodlands School (Mississauga)|The Woodlands School]], [[Lorne Park Secondary School]], [[Glenforest Secondary School]], [[Heart Lake Secondary School]] and [[Humberview Secondary School]] to provide students an opportunity to develop and explore skills in a particular area of interest. Students identified as gifted (which the PDSB classifies as \"enhanced\") may choose to attend the nearest of these high schools instead of their assigned home high school. In the Regional Enhanced Program, enhanced students take core courses (primarily, but not limited to English, mathematics, and the sciences) in an environment surrounded by fellow enhanced peers. The classes often contain modified assignments that encourage students to be creative.\n\n===Ecuador===\nIn Ecuador, [http://www.cedapecuador.com/ Centro Ecuatoriano para el Desarrollo del Alto Potencial] started in 2018 as the first all around gifted children educational program in the country.

In his introduction to the tenth anniversary edition of his classic work Frames of Mind. The [[theory of multiple intelligences]], he says:\n\nIn the heyday of the psychometric and behaviorist eras, it was generally believed that intelligence was a single entity that was inherited; and that human beings - initially a blank slate - could be trained to learn anything, provided that it was presented in an appropriate way. Nowadays an increasing number of researchers believe precisely the opposite; that there exists a multitude of intelligences, quite independent of each other; that each intelligence has its own strengths and constraints; that the mind is far from unencumbered at birth; and that it is unexpectedly difficult to teach things that go against early 'naive' theories of that challenge the natural lines of force within an intelligence and its matching domains. (Gardner 1993: xxiii)\n\n[[Howard Gardner]] initially formulated a list of seven intelligences, but later added an eighth, that are intrinsic to the human mind: linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, musical, bodily kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, and naturalist intelligences.\nIt has become widely accepted at both local and international scales to adopt a broad definition of giftedness using multiple criteria to formulate gifted education policy.\n\n;The Mission and Principles of Gifted Education Policy in [[Hong Kong]]\n\nThe mission of gifted education is to systematically and strategically explore and develop the potential of gifted students.

The motto is motivating intelligence for social change. The school, located in central Pune, admits 80 students each year, after thorough testing, which includes two written papers and an interview. The psychology department of Jnana Prabodhini has worked on J. P. Guilford's model of Intelligence.\n\n===Iran===\n[[National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents]] ([[NODET]], also known as [[SAMPAD]],\nPersian: \u0633\u0645\u067e\u0627\u062f, which stands for \u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0644\u06cc \u067e\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0634 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u062e\u0634\u0627\u0646 in Persian) are national Middle and High Schools in Iran developed\nspecifically for the development of exceptionally talented students in Iran. [[NODET]] was first\nestablished in 1976 and re-established in 1987.\n\nAdmission to NODET schools is selective and based on a comprehensive nationwide entrance\nexamination procedure.\n\nEvery year thousands of students apply to enter the schools, from which less\nthan 5% are chosen for the 99 middle schools and 98 high-schools within the country. All applicants must have a minimum GPA of 19 (out of 20) for attending the entrance exam. In 2006, 87,081 boys and 83,596 girls from 56 cities applied, and finally 6,888 students were accepted for the 2007 middle schools. The admission process is much more selective in big cities like [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]], [[Mashhad]] and [[Karaj]] in\nwhich less than 150 students are accepted after two exams and interviews, out of over 50,000\napplicants.\n\nTop schools of NODET (and also Iran's top) are [[Allameh Helli High Schools|Allameh Helli High School]] and [[Shahid Madani High School]] (in Tabriz), [[Farzanegan High School]] located in [[Tehran]], [[Shahid Ejei High School]] located in [[Isfahan]], [[Shahid Hashemi Nejad High School]] located in [[Mashhad]] and [[Shahid Soltani School]] located in [[Karaj]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}.\nCourses taught in NODET schools are college-level in fields such as [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]] and [[English Language]]. The best teachers of the ministry of education are chosen mainly by the school's principal and faculty to teach at NODET schools. Schools mainly have only two majors (normal schools have three majors), math-physics and experimental sciences (like math-physics but having biology as the main course). Even though social sciences are taught, there is much less emphasis on these subjects due to the lack of interest in both students and the organization.\n\n===Norway===\nNorway has no centre for gifted or talented children or youth. However, there is the privately run [[Barratt Due Institute of Music]] who offers musical kindergarten, evening school and college for highly talented young musicians. There is also the public secondary school for talents in ballet at Rusel\u00f8kka school in Oslo, who admits the 15 top dancers. On athletics, Privately run Norwegian Elite Sports Gymnasium (NTG) offers secondary school for talents in five locations in Norway. This account might not be complete.\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\nThe [[Centre for the Talented Youth of Ireland]] has run in [[Dublin City University]] since 1992.\n\n===Republic of Korea===\nFollowing the Gifted Education Promotion Law (\uc601\uc7ac\uad50\uc721\uc9c4\ud765\ubc95) in the year 2000, the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (South Korea)|Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MEST)]] founded the [[National Research Center for Gifted and Talented Education]] (NRCGTE) in 2002 to ensure effective implementation of gifted education research, development, and policy.  The center is managed by the [[Korean Educational Development Institute|Korean Educational Development Institute (KEDI)]].  Presently twenty-five universities conduct gifted and talented education research in some form; for example, [[Seoul National University]] is conducting Science-gifted Education Center, and [[KAIST]] is conducting Global Institute For Talented Education (GIFTED), the Korean Society for the Gifted and Talented (\ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\uad50\uc721\ud559\ud68c) and the Korean Society for the Gifted (\uc0ac\ub2e8\ubc95\uc778 \ud55c\uad6d\uc601\uc7ac\ud559\ud68c).\n\nEducation for the scientifically gifted in Korea can be traced back to the 1983 government founding of [[Gyeonggi Science High School]].<ref>{{cite web\n| last =Kim\n| first =H.J.\n| authorlink =\n| title = A comparative study on gifted education for mathematics in Korea and foreign countries.\n| work = [[Dankook University]]\n| publisher = Dankook University (unpublished master's thesis)\n| year = 2006\n| url =\n| doi =\n}}</ref> Following three later additions ([[Korea Science Academy|Korea Science Academy of KAIST]]; [[Seoul Science High School]] and [[Daegu Science High School]]), approximately 1,500, or 1 in 1,300 (0.08 percent) of high school students are currently enrolled among its four gifted academies.  By 2008, about 50,000, or 1 in 140 (0.7 percent) of elementary and middle school students participated in education for the gifted. In 2005, a program was undertaken to identify and educate gifted children of socioeconomically underprivileged people.  Since then, more than 1,800 students have enrolled in the program.\n\nGradually the focus has expanded over time to cover informatics, arts, physical education, creative writing, humanities, and social sciences, leading to the 2008 creation of the government funded [[Korean National Institute for the Gifted Arts]].  To pluralize the need for trained professional educators, teachers undergo basic training (60 hours), advanced training (120 hours), and overseas training (60 hours) to acquire skills necessary to teach gifted youth.\n\n===Singapore===\n{{Main article|Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)}}\n\nIn Singapore, the [[Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)|Gifted Education Programme]] (GEP) was introduced in 1984 and is offered in the upper primary years (Primary 4-6, ages 10\u201312).

Warwick University decided not to reapply for the contract to run NAGTY in 2007, instead introducing its own programme, the [[International Gateway for Gifted Youth]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2007/aug/28/highereducation.schools\n|title=Why Warwick stopped running the gifted and taolented programme - Gifthorse bolts\n|author=John Crace\n|publisher=The Guardian\n|date=28 August 2007\n|accessdate=7 October 2010|author-link=John Crace (writer)\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/apr/22/schools.uk2\n|title=The future of the gifted and talented programme - The tricky issue of talent\n|author=John Crace\n|publisher=The Guardian\n|date=22 April 2008\n|accessdate=7 October 2010\n|author-link=John Crace (writer)\n}}</ref> In January 2010, the government announced that NAGTY was to be scrapped the following month.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7062061/Ministers-pull-the-plug-on-gifted-and-talented-academy.html\n|title=Ministers pull the plug on gifted and talented academy\n|author=Julie Henry\n|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]\n|date=23 January 2010\n|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, each [[state department of education]] determines if the needs of gifted students will be addressed as a mandatory function of public education. If so, the state determines the definition of which students will be identified and receive services, but may or may not determine how they shall receive services. If a state does not consider gifted education mandatory, individual districts may, thus the definition of what gifted is varies from state or [[district]].<ref>National Association for Gifted Children {{cite web|url=http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=532|title=The Big Picture}} NAGC website. Retrieved on December 31, 2007.</ref>\n\nIn contrast with [[special education]], gifted education is not regulated on a federal level, although recommendations by the [[US Department of Education]] are offered. As such, funding for services is not consistent from state to state, and although students may be identified, the extent to which they receive services can vary widely depending upon a state or district's [[budget]]. \n\nAlthough schools with higher enrollment of minority or low-income students are just as likely to offer gifted programs as other schools, differing enrollment rates across racial and ethnic groups has raised concerns about equity in gifted education in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yaluma |first1=Christopher |last2=Tyner |first2=Adam |title=Is There a Gifted Gap?

For example, [[The Mirman School]] caters to children with an IQ of 138 and above.\n\n== Commonly used terms ==\nSource: Frequently Used Terms in Gifted Education<ref>[http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=565 NAGC - Information & Resources - Glossary of Gifted Terms<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105054659/http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=565 |date=2006-11-05 }}</ref>\n\n;Affective curriculum\n:A curriculum that is designed to teach gifted students about emotions, [[self-esteem]], and [[social skills]]. This can be valuable for all students, especially those who have been grouped with much older students, or who have been rejected by their same-age, but academically typical, [[peer group|peers]].\n\n;[[Differentiated instruction|Differentiation]]\n:Modification of a gifted student\u2019s curriculum to accommodate their specific needs. This may include changing the content or ability level of the material.\n\n;Heterogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students of varied ability, preparedness, or accomplishment in a single classroom environment. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be heterogeneously grouped in math if they were randomly assigned to classes instead of being grouped by demonstrated subject mastery.  Heterogeneous grouping is sometimes claimed to provide a more effective instructional environment for less prepared students.\n\n;Homogeneous grouping\n:A strategy that groups students by specific ability, preparedness, or interest within a subject area. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school.  For example, students in fifth grade would be homogeneously grouped in math if they were assigned to classes based on demonstrated subject mastery rather than being randomly assigned. Homogeneous grouping can provide more effective instruction for the most prepared students.\n\n;[[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP)\n:A written document that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created for students with disabilities, who are required by law to have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating [[boredom]] or [[frustration]], or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a student needs to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning [[disability]] that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical [[classroom]]. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.\n\n==Justification==\nResearchers and practitioners in gifted education contend that, if education were to follow the medical maxim of \"first, do no harm,\" then no further justification would be required for providing resources for gifted education as they believe gifted children to be [[Gifted At-Risk|at-risk]]. The notion that gifted children are \"at-risk\" was publicly declared in the [[Marland report|Marland Report]] in 1972:\n<blockquote>\nGifted and Talented children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs served by the Office of Education.\n\n(pp. xi-xii)<ref name = marland/></blockquote>\nThree decades later, a similar statement was made by researchers in the field: <blockquote>\nNational efforts to increase the availability of a variety of appropriate instructional and out-of-school provisions must be a high priority since ''research indicates that many of the emotional or social difficulties gifted students experience disappear when their educational climates are adapted to their level and pace of learning''.\" [emphasis added]<ref>''The Social and Emotional Development of Gifted Children: What Do We Know?'', Edited by Maureen Neihart, Sally M. Reis, Nancy M. Robinson, and Sidney M. Moon; National Association of Gifted Children (Prufrock Press, Inc.), 2002, p. 286.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\nControversies concerning gifted education are varied and often highly politicized. They are as basic as agreeing upon the appropriateness of the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'. For example, does 'giftedness' refer to performance or potential (such as inherent intelligence)? Many students do not exhibit both at the same time.\n\nMeasures of general intelligence also remain controversial. Early IQ tests were notorious for producing higher IQ scores for privileged races and classes and lower scores for disadvantaged subgroups. Although IQ tests have changed substantially over the past half century, and many objections to the early tests have been addressed by 'culture neutral' tests (such as the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven test]]), IQ testing remains controversial. Regardless of the tests used to identify children for gifted programs, many school districts in the United States still have disproportionately more White and Asian American students enrolled in their gifted programs, while Hispanic and African American students are usually underrepresented.<ref>Yoon, S. Y., & Gentry, M. (2009) Racial and ethnic representation in gifted programs: Current status of and implications for gifted Asian American students. ''Gifted Child Quarterly, 53'', 121-136. doi:10.1177/0016986208330564</ref> However, research shows that this may be not be a fault of tests, but rather a result of the [[achievement gap in the United States]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Anderson|first2=Braydon|last3=Johnson|first3=Alyce O.|year=2013|title=The impact of race and ethnicity on the identification process for giftedness in Utah|journal=Journal for the Education of the Gifted|volume=36|issue=4|pages=487\u2013508|doi=10.1177/0162353213506065}}</ref>\n\nSome schools and districts only accept IQ tests as evidence of giftedness. This brings scrutiny to the fact that many affluent families can afford to consult with an [[educational psychologist]] to test their children, whereas families with a limited income cannot afford the test and must depend on district resources.\n\n===Appropriateness of forms of gifted education===\nThis is the most hotly debated aspect of gifted education. Some people believe that gifted education resources lack availability and flexibility. They feel that in the alternative methods of gifted education, the gifted students \"miss out\" on having a \"normal\" childhood, at least insofar as \"normal childhood\" is defined as attending school in a mixed-ability classroom. Others believe that gifted education allows gifted students to interact with peers that are on their level, be adequately challenged, and leaves them better equipped to take on the challenges of life.\n\nAnother facet of this controversy is the effectiveness of the programs dependent upon resources that are pushed more toward students who are struggling. Gifted Education is not mandated in many states, making it elective for districts to earmark money for. Many lower-achieving districts and schools must make crisis decisions on programs that are not high priorities. As a result, gifted students at these schools are not served, or not served effectively.\n\n===Class and ethnicity===\nGifted programs are often seen as being elitist in places where the majority of students receiving gifted services are from a privileged background. Identifying and serving gifted children from poverty presents unique challenges, ranging from emotional issues arising from a family's economic insecurity, to gaps in pre-school cognitive development due to the family's lack of education and time.<ref>Paul D. Slocumb and Ruby K. Payne (2000) [http://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=656 Identifying and Nurturing the Gifted Poor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114045049/https://www.nagc.org/index.aspx?id=656|date=2007-11-14}} ''Principal: The New Diversity'' May 2000, Vol. 79, No. 5 - pages 28-32</ref>\n\nIn New York City experience has shown that basing admission to gifted and talented programs on tests of any sort can result in selection of substantially more middle-class and white or Asian students and development of more programs in schools that such students attend.<ref name=\"NYT011213\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/education/in-one-school-students-are-divided-by-gifted-label-and-race.html|title=A System Divided series: Gifted, Talented and Separated: In One School, Students Are Divided by Gifted Label \u2014 and Race|author=Al Baker|date=January 12, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nAnother area of controversy has been the marginalization of gifted females with studies attributing it to self-efficacy, acculturation and biological differences in aptitude between boys and girls for advanced maths.<ref>[http://aer.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/4/598 Camilla Persson Benbow and Julian C.

A person who is intellectually advanced may or may not be advanced in other areas. Each individual student needs to be evaluated for physical, social, and emotional skills without the traditional prejudices which prescribe either \"compensatory\" weaknesses or \"matching\" advancement in these areas.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iF8BrSrOqjwC|title=Exceptionally Gifted Children|last=Gross|first=Miraca U.

This behavior is usually discouraged by educators when they recognize it.  Unfortunately, the very educators who want these children to challenge themselves and to embrace their gifts and talents are often the same people who are forced to discourage them in a mixed-ability classroom, through mechanisms like refusing to call on the talented student in class so that typical students have an opportunity to participate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nStudents who are young, enthusiastic or aggressive are more likely to attract attention and to disrupt the class by working ahead, giving the correct answers all the time, asking for new assignments, or finding creative ways to entertain themselves while the rest of the class finishes an assignment. This behavior can be mistaken for [[ADHD]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nMany parents of gifted find that it is the social-emotional aspect of their children's lives that needs support. Schools and Talent Development programs often focus on academic enrichment rather than providing time for gifted kids to have the social interaction with true peers that is required for healthy development.  National organizations such as Supporting Emotional Needs of the Gifted [[SENG]] as well as local organizations, have emerged in an effort to meet these needs.\n\nIt can also happen that some unidentified gifted students will get bored in regular class, daydream and lose track of where the class is in a lecture, and the teacher becomes convinced that the student is slow and struggling with the material.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFinally, G&T students are statistically somewhat more likely to be diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] such as [[bipolar disorder]] and to become addicted to drugs or [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Savage|first1=P.

These students can require special attention in school.\n\n===Test preparation===\nIn the United States, particularly in New York City where qualifying children as young as 4 are enrolled in enriched kindergarten classes offered by the public schools, a [[test preparation]] industry has grown up which closely monitors the nature of tests given to prospective students of gifted and talented programs. This can result in admission of significant numbers of students into programs who lack superior natural intellectual talent and exclusion of naturally talented students who did not participate in test preparation or lacked the resources to do so.<ref name=\"NYT021713\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/nyregion/new-york-city-schools-struggle-to-separate-the-gifted-from-the-just-well-prepared.html|title=Schools Ask: Gifted or Just Well-Prepared?|author=Jenny Anderson|date=February 17, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt is virtually impossible to train a child for a [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] test or other gifted test.<ref name=\"hoagiesgifted\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/test_prep.htm|title=How Can I Prepare My Child for Testing?|last=Yermish|first=Aimee|work=Hoagies' Gifted Education}}</ref> Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information.<ref name= hoagiesgifted/><ref name=\"gilman\">{{cite book|title=Academic Advocacy for Gifted Children: A Parent's Complete Guide|last1=Gilman|first1=Barbara Jackson|publisher=Great Potential Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0910707886|pages=62\u201365}}</ref> It would also be disastrous if a non-gifted student was placed in a gifted program.<ref name=gilman/> Reviewing actual test questions can confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style questions is a possibility.<ref name= hoagiesgifted/>\n\nPrivate gifted assessment is usually expensive and educators recommend that parents take advantage of online screening tests to give a preliminary indication of potential giftedness.<ref name=\"shenfield\">{{cite web|url=http://www.psy-ed.com/wpblog/psychological-assessments/gifted-assessments/|title=Gifted Assessments|last=Shenfield|first=Tali|date=2014-06-30|work=Advanced Psychology}}</ref> Another way to screen for giftedness before requesting a psychological assessment is to do a curriculum-based assessment.  Curriculum-based assessment is a form of achievement testing that focuses specifically on what the child has been exposed to in their academic career. It can be done through school or a private educational center. Although this can determine if a child's performance in school potentially signifies giftedness, there are complications. For example, if a child changes school districts or country of residence, the different terminology of curriculum could hold that child back. Secondly, discrepancies between school districts, along with public and private education, create a very wide range of potential knowledge bases.<ref name=assess/>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Add your program to the [[List of gifted and talented programmes]], not to other articles. -->\n\n*[[List of gifted and talented programmes]]\n*[[Academic elitism]]\n*[[Exceptional education]]\n*[[Rationale for gifted programs]]\n*[[Selective school]]s\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n# The latest research about gifted education can be found in the academic journals that specialize in gifted education: ''[[Gifted Child Quarterly]]'', ''[[Journal of Advanced Academics]]'', ''[[Journal for the Education of the Gifted]]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20120521020902/http://www.roeper.org/netcommunity/page.aspx?pid=1222 Roeper Review]. \n# Assouline, S., and A.

The Peking (or Beijing) of the title is not literal; if anywhere the location of the novel\u2019s main action is a \u201cdream-desert\u201d allowing Vian to play with visual extremes of searing light and heat as well as intense blackness and night. It takes place in an imaginary desert called Exopotamie where a train station and a railway line are under construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tamtambooks-tosh.blogspot.com.au/2017/05/autumn-in-peking-by-boris-vian-tamtam.html|title=The Wonderful World of TamTam Books: 'Autumn in Peking\" by Boris Vian (TamTam Books)|last=Berman|first=Tosh|date=2017-05-27|website=The Wonderful World of TamTam Books|access-date=2017-09-03}}</ref> Pestereaux argued that Peking was simply slang for Paris; an allegory of Paris post WW2 reconstruction and the insanity of its beureaucracy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rolls|first=Alistair Charles|year=1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19Q6MDo5LcMC&pg=PA103|title=The Flight of the Angels: Intertextuality in Four Novels of Boris Vian|publisher=Editions Ropodi|location=[[Atlanta, Georgia]]|page=103|isbn=90-420-0467-3}}</ref>\n\n''Autumn in Peking'' was written in 1946, a prolific year for Vian, in which he wrote three novels, ''L\u2019ecume des jours ([[Froth on the Daydream]]), [[J'irai cracher sur vos tombes]]'' (''[[I Spit on Your Graves]]'') and ''[[L'Automne \u00e0 P\u00e9kin]]'' (''Autumn in Peking'') J.
