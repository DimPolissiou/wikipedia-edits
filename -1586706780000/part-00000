It is the first main entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] since 2008's ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on [[Southern California]], the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story follows three [[criminals]] and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency and powerful crime figures. The [[open world]] design lets players [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on [[Los Angeles]].\n\nThe game is played from either a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person]] or [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A \"wanted\" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', the game's [[online multiplayer]] mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive game modes.\n\n[[Development of Grand Theft Auto V|The game's development]] began soon after ''Grand Theft Auto IV''{{'s}} release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. [[Music of Grand Theft Auto V|The game's soundtrack]] features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. It was released in September 2013 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], in November 2014 for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], and in April 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nExtensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning {{US$|800 million|long=no}} in its first day and {{US$|1 billion|long=no}} in its first three days. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, it [[Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto V|caused controversies]] related to its depiction of violence and women. Considered one of [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh]] and [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation console gaming]]'s most significant titles and among the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]], it [[List of accolades received by Grand Theft Auto V|won year-end accolades]] including [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]].

Nine years later, Michael is living under [[witness protection]] with his family in Los Santos, under the alias Michael De Santa. Across town, gangbanger Franklin Clinton is working for a corrupt [[Armenians|Armenian]] car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently [[repossession|repossess]] his son's car; the two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife Amanda sleeping with her tennis coach, he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael destroys in anger. The owner turns out to be the girlfriend of Martin Madrazo, a Mexican drug lord who demands compensation to avoid further violence. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the money, enlisting Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they perform a jewellery shop heist to pay off the debt. Trevor, who now lives in a trailer park on the outskirts of Los Santos, hears of the heist and realises that it was Michael's handiwork; Trevor had believed that Michael was killed in their botched robbery nine years ago. Trevor surprises Michael and reunites with him, after tracking down his home.\n\nAs time goes on, the personal lives of the protagonists begin to spiral out of control. Michael's increasingly disreputable behaviour prompts his family to leave him. When he becomes a [[Film producer|movie producer]] at film studio Richards Majestic, Michael comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a self-made billionaire [[venture capitalist]] and [[corporate raider]], who vows revenge after his attempts to shut down the studio are thwarted by Michael. Franklin, meanwhile, rescues his friend Lamar Davis from gangster and former friend Harold \"Stretch\" Joseph, who repeatedly attempts to kill Lamar to prove himself to his new brethren. At the same time, Trevor's reckless efforts to consolidate his control over various [[black market]]s in Blaine County see him waging war against [[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost]] outlaw motorcycle club, several Latin American street gangs, rival [[methamphetamine|meth]] dealers, hillbillies, [[private military contractor|private security firm]] Merryweather, and [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] kingpin Wei Cheng.\n\nFederal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael and demand that he perform a series of operations to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA).{{efn|In ''Grand Theft Auto V'', the FIB and IAA are fictionalised parodies of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]], respectively.<ref name=\"Tom Chick GTA V\">{{cite web |url=http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/09/21/grand-theft-auto-v-relevant-story-torture-since-zero-dark-thirty/ |title=Is Grand Theft Auto V the most relevant story about torture since Zero Dark Thirty? |authorlink=Tom Chick |last=Chick |first=Tom |date=21 September 2013 |publisher=Quarter to Three |accessdate=17 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317111446/http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/09/21/grand-theft-auto-v-relevant-story-torture-since-zero-dark-thirty/ |archivedate=17 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>}} Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA, and steal an experimental [[chemical weapon]] from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him.\n\nEventually, Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start planning their most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve. By this time, Michael reconciles with his family. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave marked for Michael. Trevor's feelings of betrayal cause friction within the group and threaten to undermine their Union Depository plans. Steve betrays Michael and Dave, and they become caught in a [[Mexican standoff]] between the FIB, IAA, and Merryweather. Trevor, feeling that he is the only one who has the right to kill Michael, comes to their aid. Despite not forgiving Michael, Trevor agrees to perform the Union Depository heist and part ways with him afterwards.\n\nThe heist is completed successfully, but Franklin is then approached separately by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin, who wants retribution for Michael's betrayal. Franklin has three choices: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a [[suicide mission]]. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, he ceases contact with the man he spares and returns to his old life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grand Theft Auto V |developer=[[Rockstar North]] |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=17 September 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] |version=1.0 |level=Something Sensible}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game |title=Grand Theft Auto V |developer=[[Rockstar North]] |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=17 September 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] |version=1.0 |level=The Time's Come}}</ref> Otherwise, the trio withstands an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Steve, Stretch, Wei, and Devin.

It is the first main entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] since 2008's ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]''. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on [[Southern California]], the [[Single-player video game|single-player]] story follows three [[criminals]] and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a government agency and powerful crime figures. The [[open world]] design lets players [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on [[Los Angeles]].\n\nThe game is played from either a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person]] or [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A \"wanted\" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. ''[[Grand Theft Auto Online]]'', the game's [[online multiplayer]] mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive game modes.\n\n[[Development of Grand Theft Auto V|The game's development]] began soon after ''Grand Theft Auto IV''{{'s}} release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' and ''[[Max Payne 3]]'' and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. [[Music of Grand Theft Auto V|The game's soundtrack]] features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. It was released in September 2013 for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]], in November 2014 for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], and in April 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nExtensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning {{US$|800 million|long=no}} in its first day and {{US$|1 billion|long=no}} in its first three days. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, it [[Controversies surrounding Grand Theft Auto V|caused controversies]] related to its depiction of violence and women. Considered one of [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh]] and [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|eighth generation console gaming]]'s most significant titles and among the [[List of video games considered the best|best video games ever made]], it [[List of accolades received by Grand Theft Auto V|won year-end accolades]] including [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]].

Nine years later, Michael is living under [[witness protection]] with his family in Los Santos, under the alias Michael De Santa. Across town, gangbanger Franklin Clinton is working for a corrupt [[Armenians|Armenian]] car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently [[repossession|repossess]] his son's car; the two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife Amanda sleeping with her tennis coach, he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael destroys in anger. The owner turns out to be the girlfriend of Martin Madrazo, a Mexican drug lord who demands compensation to avoid further violence. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the money, enlisting Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they perform a jewellery shop heist to pay off the debt. Trevor, who now lives in a trailer park on the outskirts of Los Santos, hears of the heist and realises that it was Michael's handiwork; Trevor had believed that Michael was killed in their botched robbery nine years ago. Trevor surprises Michael and reunites with him, after tracking down his home.\n\nAs time goes on, the personal lives of the protagonists begin to spiral out of control. Michael's increasingly disreputable behaviour prompts his family to leave him. When he becomes a [[Film producer|movie producer]] at film studio Richards Majestic, Michael comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a self-made billionaire [[venture capitalist]] and [[corporate raider]], who vows revenge after his attempts to shut down the studio are thwarted by Michael. Franklin, meanwhile, rescues his friend Lamar Davis from gangster and former friend Harold \"Stretch\" Joseph, who repeatedly attempts to kill Lamar to prove himself to his new brethren. At the same time, Trevor's reckless efforts to consolidate his control over various [[black market]]s in Blaine County see him waging war against [[Grand Theft Auto: The Lost and Damned|The Lost]] outlaw motorcycle club, several Latin American street gangs, rival [[methamphetamine|meth]] dealers, hillbillies, [[private military contractor|private security firm]] Merryweather, and [[Triad (organized crime)|Triad]] kingpin Wei Cheng.\n\nFederal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael and demand that he perform a series of operations to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA).{{efn|In ''Grand Theft Auto V'', the FIB and IAA are fictionalised parodies of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)]], respectively.<ref name=\"Tom Chick GTA V\">{{cite web |url=http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/09/21/grand-theft-auto-v-relevant-story-torture-since-zero-dark-thirty/ |title=Is Grand Theft Auto V the most relevant story about torture since Zero Dark Thirty? |authorlink=Tom Chick |last=Chick |first=Tom |date=21 September 2013 |publisher=Quarter to Three |accessdate=17 March 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317111446/http://www.quartertothree.com/fp/2013/09/21/grand-theft-auto-v-relevant-story-torture-since-zero-dark-thirty/ |archivedate=17 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>}} Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA, and steal an experimental [[chemical weapon]] from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him.\n\nEventually, Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start planning their most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve. By this time, Michael reconciles with his family. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave marked for Michael. Trevor's feelings of betrayal cause friction within the group and threaten to undermine their Union Depository plans. Steve betrays Michael and Dave, and they become caught in a [[Mexican standoff]] between the FIB, IAA, and Merryweather. Trevor, feeling that he is the only one who has the right to kill Michael, comes to their aid. Despite not forgiving Michael, Trevor agrees to perform the Union Depository heist and part ways with him afterwards.\n\nThe heist is completed successfully, but Franklin is then approached separately by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin, who wants retribution for Michael's betrayal. Franklin has three choices: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a [[suicide mission]]. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, he ceases contact with the man he spares and returns to his old life.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Grand Theft Auto V |developer=[[Rockstar North]] |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=17 September 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] |version=1.0 |level=Something Sensible}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game |title=Grand Theft Auto V |developer=[[Rockstar North]] |publisher=[[Rockstar Games]] |date=17 September 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] |version=1.0 |level=The Time's Come}}</ref> Otherwise, the trio withstands an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Steve, Stretch, Wei, and Devin.

All dates from the passport stamps of Saudi Arabia are written in the [[Islamic calendar|Hijra Calendar]].]]\nA '''passport stamp''' is an inked impression in a [[passport]] typically made by rubber stamp upon entering or exiting a territory.\n\nPassport stamps may occasionally take the form of sticker stamps, such as entry stamps from [[Visa policy of Japan|Japan]]. Depending on nationality, a visitor may not receive a stamp at all (unless specifically requested), such as an [[European Union|EU]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] citizen travelling to an [[Schengen Area|EU or EFTA country]], [[Visa policy of Albania|Albania]],<ref name=\"parlament.al\">[https://www.parlament.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ligj-71.pdf]</ref> or [[Visa policy of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.mvr.gov.mk/Upload/Documents/ZAKON%20ZA%20GRANI%5ENA%20KONTROLA.pdf]</ref> Most countries issue exit stamps in addition to entry stamps. A few countries issue only entry stamps, including [[Visa policy of Canada|Canada]], [[Visa policy of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Visa policy of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Visa policy of New Zealand|New Zealand]], the [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and the [[Visa policy of the United States|United States]]. \n\n[[Visa policy of Australia|Australia]], [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Visa policy of Israel|Israel]], [[Visa policy of Macau|Macau]] and [[Visa policy of South Korea|South Korea]] do not stamp passports upon entry nor exit, but issue landing slips instead. [[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned. The colour of the ink or the style of stamp may also provide such information.\n\nIn many cases passengers on [[cruise ship]]s do not receive passport stamps because the entire vessel has been cleared into port.  It is often possible to get a souvenir stamp, although this requires finding the immigration office by the dock.  In many cases officials are used to such requests and will cooperate.<ref>[https://cruiseradio.net/5-cool-places-passport-stamps/ 5 Caribbean Ports to Get Your Passport Stamped]</ref><ref>[https://garyscohen.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/cruise-tales-2015-south-and-east-caribbean-6-in-search-of-passport-stamps/ Cruise Tales \u2013 2015 South and East Caribbean #6: In Search of Passport Stamps]</ref>  Also, as noted below, some of the smallest European countries will give a stamp on request, either at their border or tourist office charging, at most, a nominal fee.\n\n==Overview of passport stamps of countries==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\n{{stack| [[File:Entry and exit stamps of Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport]] on a [[Bangladeshi passport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bangladeshi visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Bangladeshi visa in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].]]}}\nBangladesh stamps all travellers' passports upon both entry and exit. Handwritten scroll numbers on the stamp make it easier to track a person's complete journey - a Bangladeshi leaving Bangladesh would receive a scroll number upon exit; upon entry, the scroll number would be used to access related journey information of the traveller. The same is the case for foreigners, except that the scroll number is given on entry and then used on exit.\n\nThe stamps are always in black except the date, which is in red. The stamps feature an arrow at the top left corner, pointing left to denote departure, or pointing right for arrival together with a cartoon of the mode of transport at the top right corner.\n\nEntry stamps are rectangular and exit stamps are oval, exit make it visually easier to trace movements.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Bahrain====\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain entry stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''entry''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain exit stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''exit''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia bavet passport stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp at [[Bavet]] land border crossing on the Cambodia-Vietnam border.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Visa cambodia Manfred Werner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Pre-sticker visas together with older type of passport stamps at [[Siem Reap]] airport.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia exit stamp.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Exit stamp issued at [[Siem Reap International Airport]]]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====China====\n<gallery>\nFile:Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport entry stamp.jpg|Entry stamp at [[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport]] in an old [[People's Republic of China passport]].\nFile:Dongguan passport stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Dongguan]] in an old People's Republic of China passport.<br>(Noted that there were no English on stamps.)\nFile:Fuzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Fuzhou Changle International Airport]] in an old [[Thai passport]].\nFile:Guangzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] in a Thai passport.\nFile:China Visa Stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] on an [[Italian passport]].\nFile:China Immigration Stramps Beijing.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] in a [[Republic of Korea passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Hong Kong====\nThe [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] used to stamp the passports of visitors entering and leaving Hong Kong (residents using their [[Hong Kong Identity Card]] did not receive a stamp). Just prior to and after the 1997 [[Transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|transfer of sovereignty]] from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to the [[People's Republic of China]], arrival and departure stamps were identical at all ports of entry.\n\nFor the next 15 years or so, the ink colour of the stamp differentiated the [[administrative division]] of the point of entry:\n* Stamps issued within [[New Territories]] ([[Sha Tau Kok Control Point]], [[Man Kam To Control Point]], [[Lo Wu Control Point]], [[Lok Ma Chau Control Point]], [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line Control Point]] and [[Shenzhen Bay Control Point]] by land, [[Tuen Mun Ferry Pier|Tuen Mun Ferry Terminal Control Point]] by sea) are in red ink. \n* Stamps issued within [[Kowloon]] ([[Hung Hom Station|Hung Hom Control Point]] by trains, [[Ocean Terminal, Hong Kong|Ocean Terminal Control Point]] and [[Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal|China Ferry Terminal Control Point]] by sea) are in green ink.\n* Stamps issued within [[Hong Kong Island]] ([[Hong Kong\u2013Macau Ferry Terminal|Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal Control Point]], by either sea or air) are in purple ink.\n* Stamps issued within [[Islands District]] ([[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong International Airport Control Point]] by air) are in black ink.\n\nBeginning 19 March 2013, landing slips are issued to visitors on arrival in Hong Kong instead of passport stamps, and on departure from Hong Kong no slips or passport stamps are issued (being unable to present the landing slip on departure does not affect a traveller's ability to clear immigration). However, in exceptional circumstances, stamps may still be applied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.immd.gov.hk/en/topical/non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html |title=Non-stamping Immigration Clearance Arrangement for Visitors (with effect from 19 March 2013) |author=Immigration Department |accessdate=15 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal entry stamp.jpg|Entry stamp at Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal in a Thai passport.\nFile:Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal exit stamp.jpg|Exit stamp at Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal in a Thai passport.\nFile:Hong Kong passport stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hong Kong International Airport]] and the Hong Kong \u2013 Macau Ferry Terminal in an Italian passport.\nFile:Hong Kong land border.jpg|Old style entry and exit stamps at Hong Kong International Airport and [[Lo Wu Control Point]] in an old Thai passport. <br>(Noted that there were no [[Bauhinia blakeana|Bauhinia]] on stamps and exit stamps were in oval.)\nFile:Hong Kong landing slip.jpg|Landing slip since March 2013\n</gallery>\n\n====India====\n{{stack|[[File:BOM En.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp to [[India]] at [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport|Mumbai airport]] in an [[Indian passport]].]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:India passport entry stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp issued to a citizen of Germany at [[Indira Gandhi International Airport|Delhi airport]]]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:DEL ExO.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Exit stamp in an Indian passport at Delhi Airport.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:India e-Visa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|An Indian e-Visa at Delhi Airport in an Romanian passport.]]}}\nIndia uses the differentiation in passport stamp colours - entry in blue, exit in red - to quickly trace a passenger's movements.

Passports are still (as of February 2013) stamped at [[Erez Crossing]] when traveling into and out of [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. Also, the passports are still stamped (as of February 2014) at the land borders of [[Jordan River Crossing]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin Crossing]] with Jordan and [[Taba Border Crossing]] with Egypt.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Israel Taba Border Entry.JPG|Entry stamp to [[Israel]] from [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] in an [[Israeli passport]].\nFile:Israel Entry Stamp.jpg|An Israeli entry stamp in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]] at Ben Gurion Airport.\nFile:Israel - Visa entry and exit (3 months).jpg|Entry and exit stamps in a [[German passport]] at Ben Gurion Airport (entry: right; exit: left).\nFile:Israel Entry Paper.jpg|An Israeli entry paper at Ben Gurion Airport.\nFile:Israel Exit Paper.jpg|An Israeli exit paper at Ben Gurion Airport.\n</gallery>\n\n====Japan====\n{{stack|[[File:Japan Stamp Chubu Fukuoka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Former Temporary visitor landing permission sticker at [[Chubu Centrair International Airport]] and exit stamp at [[Fukuoka Airport]] in a [[Republic of Korea passport]].]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Haneda return stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Return stamp at Haneda airport in a [[Japanese passport]].]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Fukuoka re-entry stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Departure and re-entry stamps for a foreign resident of Japan in a [[British passport]].]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Jordan====\n{{stack|[[File:The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Employment Visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority]] visa in a U.S. passport.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Wadi Araba Entry.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp in a U.S. passport at [[Wadi Araba Crossing]].]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Jordan Wadi Araba Crossing exit 2010.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Exit stamp in an Israeli passport at [[Wadi Araba Crossing]]]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Laos====\n[[File:Laos.Visa.JPG|thumb|left|upright=2.3|Entry and exit stamps at the [[Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge]]]]\n{{clear}}\n\n====Macau====\nImmigration stamps applied by [[Macau]]'s immigration service under [[Portugal|Portuguese]] administration had slightly different borders depending on whether the person arrived by land, sea, or air. After the transfer of sovereignty from Portugal to China in 1999, passport stamps naming the points of entry and departure were introduced, but all in the same ink color. Beginning of 9 July 2013, the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau]] no longer stamps passport and instead, visitors will receive a printed arrival card instead.<ref>[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/45198-tens-of-thousands-of-hours-can-be-saved-by-non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html Tens of thousands of hours can be saved by non-stamping immigration clearance]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Macau Arrival Card.jpg|Arrival Card replacing existent passport stamps.\nFile:Macau Airport.jpg|Former entry stamp at [[Macau International Airport]].\nFile:Macau passport stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau]].\nFile:Taipa Macau stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal]] in a [[Philippine passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Malaysia====\nMalaysian immigration authorities apply stamps for both entry and exit in all foreign passports and non-biometric [[Malaysian passport]]s without in-built microchips. Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

However, third-country nationals who are holders of long-term visas or residence permits or are family members of EU/EEA/Swiss/British citizens are exempt from this restriction. Further, third-country nationals 'with an essential function or need' (such as healthcare workers, transport personnel, aid workers, military personnel, seasonal agricultural workers), passengers in transit, those travelling 'for imperative family reasons' and those 'in need of international protection or for other humanitarian reasons' are exempt from this restriction.<ref>COVID-19: Temporary Restriction on Non-Essential Travel to the EU ([https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2020/EN/COM-2020-115-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF COM (2020) 115, 16 March 2020])</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/mobility_en |title=Temporary non-essential travel restrictions |publisher=[[European Commission]]}}</ref> Citizens of the European micro-states (Andorra, the Holy See, Monaco and San Marino) are also exempt from this restriction.

One solution is to dedicate separate lanes to third-country nationals and to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates used by these lanes who can stamp travel documents where required: this has been adopted by the [[Finnish Border Guard]] at the automated border gates in [[Helsinki Airport]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]] and [[United States passport|United States]] [[biometric passport]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cwtjet.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Automated_Border_Control_Gates.17161248.pdf |title=How To Use The Automated Border Control Gates |work=Finnair Info |accessdate=2012-07-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018132624/http://cwtjet.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Automated_Border_Control_Gates.17161248.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-18 }}</ref><ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"> http://www.raja.fi/facts/news_from_the_border_guard/1/0/expanded_use_of_automated_border_control_gates_at_the_west_terminal_54569 </ref><ref> http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/Images_News/ABC_Conference_Report.pdf</ref> and in the [[Port of Helsinki]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include [[Russian passport|Russian citizens]],<ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"/> as well as by the Portuguese [[Servi\u00e7o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras]] at the automated border gates in [[Lisbon Airport]] where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Angolan passport|Angolan]] and [[Brazilian passport|Brazilian]] passports and holders of [[Diplomatic passport|diplomatic/service passports]]). This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of [[EGate (Italy)|eGates]] include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Israeli passport|Israeli]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United States passport|United States]] and [[Vatican passport|Vatican]] [[biometric passport]]s. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

For example, when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], only family members of [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizens who hold a residence card issued under Article 10 of [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]] '''and''' who are accompanying or joining their EU, EEA and Swiss citizen family member exercising the right of freedom of movement are exempt from having their travel documents stamped, whereas in the French overseas departments/collectivities mentioned above, more generous rules apply \u2014 when entering/leaving Guadeloupe/Martinique/Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member; when entering/leaving Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint Martin, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member and regardless of whether the residence card was issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary |title = Requesting a visa}}</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]].

Depending on nationality, a visitor may not receive a stamp at all (unless specifically requested), such as an [[European Union|EU]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] citizen travelling to an [[Schengen Area|EU or EFTA country]], [[Visa policy of Albania|Albania]],<ref name=\"parlament.al\">[https://www.parlament.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ligj-71.pdf]</ref> or [[Visa policy of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.mvr.gov.mk/Upload/Documents/ZAKON%20ZA%20GRANI%5ENA%20KONTROLA.pdf]</ref> Most countries issue exit stamps in addition to entry stamps.

[[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned. The colour of the ink or the style of stamp may also provide such information.\n\nIn many cases passengers on [[cruise ship]]s do not receive passport stamps because the entire vessel has been cleared into port.  It is often possible to get a souvenir stamp, although this requires finding the immigration office by the dock.  In many cases officials are used to such requests and will cooperate.<ref>[https://cruiseradio.net/5-cool-places-passport-stamps/ 5 Caribbean Ports to Get Your Passport Stamped]</ref><ref>[https://garyscohen.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/cruise-tales-2015-south-and-east-caribbean-6-in-search-of-passport-stamps/ Cruise Tales \u2013 2015 South and East Caribbean #6: In Search of Passport Stamps]</ref>  Also, as noted below, some of the smallest European countries will give a stamp on request, either at their border or tourist office charging, at most, a nominal fee.\n\n==Overview of passport stamps of countries==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\n{{stack| [[File:Entry and exit stamps of Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport]] on a [[Bangladeshi passport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bangladeshi visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Bangladeshi visa in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].]]}}\nBangladesh stamps all travellers' passports upon both entry and exit.

Beginning of 9 July 2013, the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau]] no longer stamps passport and instead, visitors will receive a printed arrival card instead.<ref>[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/45198-tens-of-thousands-of-hours-can-be-saved-by-non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html Tens of thousands of hours can be saved by non-stamping immigration clearance]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Macau Arrival Card.jpg|Arrival Card replacing existent passport stamps.\nFile:Macau Airport.jpg|Former entry stamp at [[Macau International Airport]].\nFile:Macau passport stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau]].\nFile:Taipa Macau stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal]] in a [[Philippine passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Malaysia====\nMalaysian immigration authorities apply stamps for both entry and exit in all foreign passports and non-biometric [[Malaysian passport]]s without in-built microchips. Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

The blue stamp at the left corner is from the [[United Arab Emirates|Emirati]] side of Wajaja.  ]]\nAs of December 2017, one who obtains a visa on arrival does not get a round entry stamp. Instead they get a rectangular, blue stamp that states the entry date and validity of the visa. This seems to, however, be the case only when arriving at [[Muscat International Airport]]. At land borders, the rectangular stamp is accompanied by a round, blue entry stamp. A round, red exit stamp is issued at all points of exit.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Pakistan====\nA circular entry stamp in black ink is applied to passports of all nationalities at the time of entry. A triangular multi colored entry stamp was used until 2015. An exit stamp is also applied to all passports when leaving the country.

As a general rule, passports of all travellers regardless of their nationality (including Filipino passport holders), need to be stamped at both entry and exit points. The attending officer also writes down the flight number and stamps the passenger's boarding pass upon departure with the same stamp that is used for departure.

Exit stamps are circular and in green. Both depict the date of entry/exit and entry stamps also state the terms of entry and permitted duration of stay.\n\nBoth entry and exit stamps do not name the point of entry/exit but indicate them by the use of letters of the alphabet - \"A\" is used for entry by air, namely through [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] or Seletar Airport; \"S\" by sea though the Singapore Cruiseship Terminal or Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal; \"T\" by land via the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Second Link|Tuas Checkpoint]]; and \"W\" by land via the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|Woodlands Checkpoint]]. The entry stamp has the letter running along the border of the stamp together with a code number while the exit stamp has a single letter marked in the center of the stamp. From 22 April 2019, foreign travellers no longer get their passports stamped when they depart from Singapore. <ref>[https://www.gov.sg/news/content/foreigners-departing-spore-will-not-have-passports-stamped-from-april-22 ]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Singapore Changi Airport entry stamp in a passport - 20040409.jpg|Entry stamp at Changi Airport in an old Thai Passport\nFile:Singapore Changi Airport exit stamp in a passport - 20091213.jpg|Exit stamp at Changi Airport\nFile:Singapore Cruise Centre entry and exit stamps in a passport - 20070415.jpg|Entry and exit by sea, at the Singapore Cruise Center.\nFile:Singapore Tuas Checkpoint entry stamp in a passport - 20071103.jpg|Entry stamp into Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint in a [[Malaysian Passport]]\nFile:Singapore Tuas Checkpoint exit stamp in a passport - 20070722.jpg|Exit stamp in a Malaysian Passport for leaving Singapore to Tanjung Kupang in Johor, Malaysia, via the Tuas Checkpoint\nFile:Woodlands entry.JPG|Entry stamp at Singapore via [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in a Malaysian Passport\nFile:Woodlands exit.JPG|Exit stamp in a Malaysian Passport for leaving Singapore to Johor Bahru via Woodlands Train Checkpoint\n</gallery>\n\n====Sri Lanka====\n<gallery>\nFile:Sri Lankan entry stamp.jpg|Entry stamp at [[Bandaranaike International Airport]]\nFile:Sri Lankan exit stamp.jpg|Exit stamp at Bandaranaike International Airport\n</gallery>\n\n====South Korea====\nEntry stamp is square shaped and stamped with magenta ink.

Beginning January 2018, landing slips are issued to visitors on arrival in South Korea instead of passport stamps, and on departure from South Korea no slips or passport stamps are issued (being unable to present the landing slip on departure does not affect a traveller's ability to clear immigration).

A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

This concession mainly applied to school groups travelling within the [[European Economic Area]], though it was also extended to some other groups, such as elderly passengers, travellers with special needs, brownie and scout groups and sports teams.

However, as third-country nationals (who do not benefit from one of the exemptions in the right-hand column above) are required to receive a passport stamp, the French Border Police will give them an information sheet when they leave metropolitan France informing them that they should present themselves to the French Border Police at the arrival airport to receive a passport stamp. On the other hand, travellers flying directly from Guadeloupe, Martinique or Saint Pierre and Miquelon to metropolitan France undergo border checks by the [[French Border Police]] both on departure and on arrival, when their travel documents will be stamped accordingly.<ref name=\"Double controle\"/>\n\nWhilst the rules for stamping travel documents of travellers arriving in and departing from the French overseas departments/collectivities mentioned above are based upon the rules which apply in [[metropolitan France]] and the [[Schengen Area]] (see the section above), important differences exist between the two sets of rules. For example, when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], only family members of [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizens who hold a residence card issued under Article 10 of [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]] '''and''' who are accompanying or joining their EU, EEA and Swiss citizen family member exercising the right of freedom of movement are exempt from having their travel documents stamped, whereas in the French overseas departments/collectivities mentioned above, more generous rules apply \u2014 when entering/leaving Guadeloupe/Martinique/Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member; when entering/leaving Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint Martin, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member and regardless of whether the residence card was issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary |title = Requesting a visa}}</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]]. Previously, entry stamps issued in French overseas departments/collectivities were rectangular, whilst exit stamps were hexagonal. Under the current design, both entry and exit stamps issued in French overseas departments/collectivities are hexagonal and have a similar design to Schengen Area stamps. The top left corner states Outre-Mer and F, and indicates the 3-digit [[INSEE code]] for the [[Departments of France|overseas department/collectivity]] where the stamp was issued (971 for [[Guadeloupe]], 972 for [[Martinique]], 975 for [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], 978 for [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]).\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Enreisestempel Guadeloupe.png|Entry stamp at the port of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre ([[Guadeloupe]]) in a Swedish passport\nFile:Guadeloupe-Stempel.png|Exit stamp at [[Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre International Airport]] ([[Guadeloupe]]) in a Swedish passport\nFile:Martinique-Stempel.png|Entry (top) and exit (bottom) stamps at the ferry dock in [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]] ([[Martinique]]) in a Swedish passport.

For example, when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], only family members of [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizens who hold a residence card issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC and who are accompanying or joining their EU, EEA and Swiss citizen family member exercising the right of freedom of movement are exempt from having their travel documents stamped, whereas in the French overseas territories in the Pacific, more generous rules apply \u2014 a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence permit issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member and regardless of whether his/her residence permit was issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] - when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas territory in the Pacific, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\"/> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas territories in the Pacific differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]]. Previously, entry stamps issued in French overseas territories in the Pacific were rectangular, whilst exit stamps were hexagonal. Under the current design, both entry and exit stamps issued in French overseas territories in the Pacific are hexagonal, and are similar in design to Schengen Area passport stamps. The top left corner states Outre-Mer and F, and indicates the 3-digit [[INSEE code]] for the [[Departments of France|overseas territory]] where the stamp was issued (988 for [[New Caledonia]]).\n\n<gallery>\nFile:French Polynesia Entry.jpg|Entry stamp at [[Fa'a'\u0101 International Airport]] in [[French Polynesia]]\nFile:French Polynesia Exit.jpg|Exit stamp at [[Fa'a'\u0101 International Airport]] in [[French Polynesia]]\nFile:New Caledonia Passport Entry Stamp.jpg|Updated Schengen style entry stamp at [[La Tontouta International Airport]] in [[New Caledonia]]\nFile:New Caledonia Passport Exit Stamp.jpg|Updated Schengen style exit stamp at [[La Tontouta International Airport]] in [[New Caledonia]]\nFile:New Caledonia - Entry.jpg|Previous style entry stamp at [[La Tontouta International Airport]] in [[New Caledonia]]\nFile:New Caledonia - Exit.jpg|Previous style exit stamp at [[La Tontouta International Airport]] in [[New Caledonia]]\nFile:New Caledonia passport stamp.jpg|Older style exit stamp at [[La Tontouta International Airport]] in [[New Caledonia]]\n</gallery>\n\n====New Zealand====\nSince March 2018, the [[New Zealand Customs Service]] ceased stamping passports for Australian permanent residents and New Zealand residents.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immigration.govt.nz/documents/visa-paks/2018-mar-23-removal-of-passport-stamps-for-new-zealand-and-australian-residents |title=Removal of passport stamps for New Zealand and Australian residents |date=23 March 2018 |publisher=[[Immigration New Zealand]] |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> General entry stamps continue to be used for temporary visa holders.\n\nOn arrival in New Zealand, travellers who are neither [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand]] nor [[Nationality law of Australia|Australian]] citizens or [[New Zealand permanent residency|permanent residents]] who are granted entry into the country will receive a 'Visitor Visa' rectangular stamp in their travel document.\n\nNew Zealand and Australian citizens do not have their passports stamped on arrival in New Zealand unless specifically requested.\n\nTravellers using  [[Automated border control system#New Zealand|eGate]] (available to holders of a [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Chinese passport|Chinese]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Dutch passport|Dutch]], [[French passport|French]], [[German passport|German]], [[Irish passport|Irish]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United Kingdom passport|United Kingdom]] or [[United States passport|United States]] [[ePassport]] aged 12 years or over) will not have their passports stamped on arrival in New Zealand.\n\nFor all travellers, passports are not stamped on departure from New Zealand regardless of nationality and whether using an immigration desk or [[SmartGate|eGate]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:New Zealand Passport Stamp.tif|General Entry stamp (given to temporary visa holders upon entry)\nFile:New Zealand Entry Stamp Hensley.png|Visitors Visa Entry stamp (for all non-NZ/Australian passport holders without residency in either country)\nFile:New Zealand Passport Stamp Resident.tif|Resident Visa Entry Stamp (no longer issued as of March 2018)\n</gallery>\n\n====Niue====\nNiue passport stamps bear the name of the country, a map outline of Niue, date and location of entry/departure.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Niue passport stamp (entry).png|Entry stamp at Niue International Airport\nFile:Niue passport stamp (exit).png|Exit stamp at Niue International Airport\n</gallery>\n\n====Vanuatu====\nThe passport stamp bears the country name, date and port of entry/departure.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Vanuatu Entry.tif|Entry stamp at Port Vila\nFile:Vanuatu Exit.tif|Exit stamp at Port Vila\n</gallery>\n\n===South America===\n\n====Argentina====\n<gallery>\nFile:ARGENTINA STAMPS.jpg|Entry and exit stamps from the Argentina-Brazil border at [[Puerto Iguazu]].

Students felt the cow leather was holy and touching the ball, made out of it, was blasphemous. Instead they played football with \u00a0a wooden clog (known as Khraav in Kashmiri) in their feet. Similarly, when boating was introduced in Mission School students did not like boating because, in Kashmiri society, boatmen weren't consider respectable members of the society. But later it was adopted and the Mission School boys became efficient paddlers and rowers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://autarmota.blogspot.com/2016/05/an-old-photograph-of-mission-school.html?m=1|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Regatta in May 1948.jpg|thumb|Regatta organised by Tyndale Biscoe School in May 1948]]\n[[File:Nehru at Regatta in May 1948.jpg|thumb|Inida's first Prime Minister visited Regatta held by Tyndale Biscoe School in May 1948 during his Kashmir Visit]]\n\n==History==\nRev. J.H. Knowles, in 1880, laid the foundation of the C.M.S. (Church Mission Society) School on the hospital premises (Modern Chest Disease Hospital, Drugjan) in Srinagar. The school was started with 5 pupils. In 1883, the number of boys in the school increased to 30.<ref name=\"tbmes.org\">{{cite web |url=https://tbmes.org/Pages?page=History}}</ref>\n\nIt was in 1890 that the Government permitted the C.M.S. to shift the school to downtown, and it was moved from the hospital premises (Drugjan) to a large house and compound on the river bank in the middle of the city at FatehKadal. As a result of this, the number of students increased to about 200 in 1890.\n[[Cecil Tyndale-Biscoe|Canon C.E. Tyndale-Biscoe]] joined the school in 1891, there were 250 pupils on the school roll. The primary school grew into a middle school and eventually into a high school. The high school was designated the Hadow Memorial School after the name of its honorary treasurer for 40 years. Eventually, five other mission schools were set up, one each in different parts of the capital city and one in Anantnag.<ref name=\"tbmes.org\"/>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Imran Raza Ansari]] - (born 1972) Politician and Religious Scholar{{Citation needed|reason-= school is not sourced in his article|date=May 2019}}\n* [[Farooq Abdullah]] - (born 1937) politician and former [[Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir]].\n* [[Agha Shaukat Ali]] - (1920-2013) Kashmiri Civil Servant turned Pakistani Politician after partition.\n* [[Masarat Alam Bhat]] - (born 1971) Kashmiri separatist leader as of 2018 General Secretary of the [[All Parties Hurriyat Conference]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/being-masarat-alam/lite/|title=Being Masrat Alam - includes Nazir Leharwal's Famous Quote 'Are you Ishfaq ?'|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* [[Thupstan Chhewang]] (born 1947) is an Indian politician\n* [[Durga Prasad Dhar]] - (1918\u20131975) prominent [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] politician and an Indian diplomat.\n* [[P.

{"title_page": "Motets by Johann Sebastian Bach, discography", "text_new": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are relatively rare. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. One approach is to have instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]''. The opposite approach is to be ''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment. It is also possible to have a compromise with some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]].\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are relatively rare. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. One approach is to have instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]''. The opposite approach is to be ''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment. It is also possible to have a compromise with some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]].\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].
