Financial information would be useful to users if such qualitative characteristics are present. When producing financial statements, the following must comply: \n'''Fundamental Qualitative Characteristics:'''\n* '''Relevance:''' Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance. Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n* '''Faithful Representation:''' Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error.\n'''Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics:'''\n* '''Verifiability:''' Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity. \n* '''Comparability:''' Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.\n* '''Understandability:''' Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.\n* '''Timeliness:''' Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.\n\n'''''''''''== Three components of financial statements ==\n\n=== [[:en:Cash flow statement|Statement of cash flows]] ===\nThe statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows:\n''Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance''\n\n<u>Example 1:</u> in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:\n*Cash inflow: $20\n*Cash outflow:$7\n*Opening balance: $5\n*'''Closing balance: $20 \u2013 $7 + $5 = $18'''\n\n<u>Example 2:</u> in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:\n*Cash inflow: $50 - ''How much WikiTables received in cash for the first table. They didn't receive cash for the second table (sold in credit terms).''\n*Cash outflow: $50 - ''How much they'd originally bought the 2 tables for.''\n*Opening balance: $0\n*'''Closing balance: $50 \u2013 2*$25 + $0 = $50\u201350=$0 '''-''' '''''Indeed, the cash flow for the month of June for WikiTables amounts to $0 and not $50.''\n\nImportant: the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of '''actual''' cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.\n\n=== [[Income statement|Statement of profit and loss]] (income statement or statement of operations) ===\nThe statement of profit or income statement represents the changes in value of a company's [[account (accountancy)|accounts]] over a set period (most commonly one [[fiscal year]]), and may compare the changes to changes in the same accounts over the previous period. All changes are summarized on the \"bottom line\" as [[net income]], often reported as \"net loss\" when income is less than zero.\n\nThe net profit or loss is determined by:\n\nSales (revenue)\n\n\u2013 [[cost of goods sold]]\n\n\u2013 selling, general, administrative expenses (SGA)\n\n\u2013 [[depreciation]]/ [[amortization]]\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> earnings before interest and taxes ([[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization|EBIT]])\n\n\u2013 interest and tax expenses\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> profit/loss\n\n=== [[Balance sheet|Statement of financial position]] (balance sheet) ===\nThe balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's [[asset]]s, [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and [[Equity (finance)|equity]] (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement. The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity in dollar amount l. This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation: ''Assets = Liabilities + Equity''. The statement can be used to help show the status of a company.\n\nAccounting standards often set out a general format that companies are expected to follow when presenting their balance sheets. [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] normally require that companies report [[current asset|current]] assets and liabilities separately from non-current amounts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iasplus.com/en-gb/standards/ias/ias1 |title=IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements |publisher=[[Deloitte|Deloitte Global]] |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>Larry M. Walther, Christopher J. Skousen, \"Long-Term Assets\", Ventus Publishing ApS, 2009</ref>\n\nCurrent assets are the most liquid assets of a firm, which can be realized in 12 months period. Current assets include:\n*[[cash]] - physical money\n*[[accounts receivable]] - revenues earned but not yet collected\n*Merchandise inventory - consists of goods and services a firm currently owns until it ends up getting sold\n*[[marketable securities]] - [[Stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] a firm has invested in other firms\n*[[prepaid expense]]s - expenses paid for in advance for use during that year\n\nNon-current assets include [[fixed asset|fixed]] or long-term assets and [[intangible asset]]s: \n*''fixed (long term) assets''\n**[[property]] \n**[[building]] \n**equipment (such as factory machinery) \n*''intangible assets''\n**copyrights\n**trademarks\n**patents\n**[[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]\n\nLiabilities include:\n*''current liabilities''\n**trade accounts payable\n**[[dividends]] payable\n**employee salaries payable\n**interest (e.g. on debt) payable\n*''long term liabilities''\n**mortgage notes payable \n**bonds payable\n\n[[Owner's equity]], sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a [[sole proprietorship]], [[partnership]], or a [[corporation]]. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows [[common stock]], and [[retained earnings]] (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Financial Accounting I|last=Malhotra|first=DK|last2=Poteau|first2=Ray|publisher=Academic Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1627517300|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== [[Statement of Retained Earnings|Statement of retained earnings]] (statement of changes in equity) ====\nThis statement is additional to the three main statements described above. It shows how the distribution of income and transfer of dividends affects the wealth of shareholders in the company. The concept of retained earnings means profits of previous years that are accumulated till current period. Basic proforma for this statement is as follows:\n\nRetained earnings at the beginning of period\n\n+ Net Income for the period\n\n- Dividends\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> Retained earnings at the end of period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of financial accounting|last=Fred.|first=Phillips|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|others=Libby, Robert., Libby, Patricia A.|isbn=9780073527109|edition= 3rd|location=Boston|oclc=457010553}}</ref>'''\n\n==Basic concepts==\n\n'''THE STABLE MEASURING  ASSUMPTION''' One of the basic principles in accounting is \u201cThe Measuring Unit principle: <blockquote>The unit of measure in accounting shall be the base money unit of the most relevant currency. This principle also assumes the unit of measure is stable; that is, changes in its general purchasing power are not considered sufficiently important to require adjustments to the basic financial statements.\u201d<ref>Paul H. Walgenbach, Norman E. Dittrich and Ernest I. Hanson, (1973), Financial Accounting, New York: Harcourt Grace Javonovich, Inc. Page 429.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorical Cost Accounting, i.e., financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units, is based on the stable measuring unit assumption under which accountants simply assume that money, the monetary unit of measure, is perfectly stable in real value for the purpose of measuring (1) monetary items not inflation-indexed daily in terms of the Daily CPI and (2) constant real value non-monetary items not updated daily in terms of the Daily CPI during low and high inflation and deflation.\n\n'''UNITS OF CONSTANT PURCHASING POWER''' The stable monetary unit assumption is not applied during hyperinflation. IFRS requires entities to implement capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\n\nFinancial accountants produce financial statements based on the accounting standards in a given jurisdiction. These standards may be the [[generally accepted accounting principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] of a respective country, which are typically issued by a national standard setter, or [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), which are issued by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).\n\nFinancial accounting serves the following purposes:\n* producing general purpose financial statements\n* producing information used by the management of a business entity for decision making, planning and performance evaluation\n* producing financial statements for meeting regulatory requirements.\n'''Objectives of Financial Accounting'''\n\n* '''Systematic recording of transactions:''' basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions (i.e. book-keeping).  These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation.\n* '''Ascertainment of result of above recorded transactions:''' accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the result of business operations for a particular period of time. If expenses exceed revenue then it is said that the business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affairs can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\n* '''Ascertainment of the financial position of business:''' businessman is not only interested in knowing the result of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular  point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business.\n* '''Providing information to the users for rational decision-making:''' accounting as a \u2018language of business\u2019 communicates the financial result of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the financial information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making.\n* '''To know the solvency position:''' by preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern\u2019s ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due.\n\n== Graphic definition ==\nThe [[accounting equation]] ([[Asset]]s = [[Liability (financial accounting)|Liabilities]] + [[Ownership equity|Owners' Equity]]) and financial statements are the main topics of financial accounting.\n\nThe [[trial balance]], which is usually prepared using the [[double-entry accounting system]], forms the basis for preparing the financial statements. All the figures in the trial balance are rearranged to prepare a [[income statement|profit & loss statement]] and [[balance sheet]]. Accounting standards determine the format for these accounts ([[Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK)|SSAP]], FRS, [[IFRS]]). Financial statements display the income and expenditure for the company and a summary of the assets, liabilities, and shareholders' or owners' equity of the company on the date to which the accounts were prepared.\n\nAssets and expenses have normal debit balances, i.e., debiting these types of accounts increases them.\n\nLiabilities, revenues, and capital have normal credit balances, i.e., crediting these increases them.\n 0 = Dr [[Asset]]s                            Cr [[Ownership equity|Owners' Equity]]                Cr [[Liability (financial accounting)|Liabilities]]  \n           .       _____________________________/\\____________________________       .\n           .      /    Cr [[Retained earnings|Retained Earnings]] (profit)         Cr [[Common stock|Common Stock]]  \\      .\n           .    _________________/\\_______________________________      .            .\n           .   / Dr [[Expenses]]       Cr Beginning [[Retained earnings|Retained Earnings]] \\     .            .\n           .

Much like signs in math: two positive numbers are added and two negative numbers are also added.  It is only when there is one positive and one negative (opposites) that you will subtract.\n\n==Versus cost accounting==\n{{see also|Cost accounting}}\n#Financial accounting aims at finding out results of accounting year in the form of Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet.

IFRS are issued by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.ifrs.org/The-organisation/Documents/2015/Who-We-Are-January-2015.pdf |title = Who We Are - January 2015 |accessdate = 28 April 2015 |website = IFRS.org |publisher = IFRS Foundation |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150501111412/http://www.ifrs.org/The-organisation/Documents/2015/Who-We-Are-January-2015.pdf |archivedate = 1 May 2015 }}</ref> With IFRS becoming more widespread on the international scene, ''consistency'' in financial reporting has become more prevalent between global organizations.\n\nWhile financial accounting is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organization or not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, [[management accounting|managerial accounting]] provides accounting information to help managers make decisions to manage the business.\n\n==Objectives==\nFinancial accounting and financial reporting are often used as synonyms.\n\n1. According to International Financial Reporting Standards: the objective of financial reporting is:\n\n<blockquote>To provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.<ref>[http://www.ifrs.org/IFRSs/Pages/IFRS.aspx IFRS Conceptual Framework(2010) Par. OB2]</ref></blockquote>\n\n2. According to the European Accounting Association:\n\n<blockquote>Capital maintenance is a competing objective of financial reporting.<ref>[http://www.ifrs.org/Current-Projects/IASB-Projects/Conceptual-Framework/Discussion-Paper-July-2013/Pages/Comment-letters.aspx European Accounting Association, Response to Question 26, Comment Letter to the Discussion Paper regarding the Review of the Conceptual Framework, on Page 2 of comment letters, dated 2014-01-24] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729084444/http://www.ifrs.org/Current-Projects/IASB-Projects/Conceptual-Framework/Discussion-Paper-July-2013/Pages/Comment-letters.aspx |date=2014-07-29 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n\nFinancial accounting is the preparation of financial statements that can be consumed by the public and the relevant stakeholders. Financial information would be useful to users if such qualitative characteristics are present. When producing financial statements, the following must comply: \n'''Fundamental Qualitative Characteristics:'''\n* '''Relevance:''' Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance. Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n* '''Faithful Representation:''' Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error.\n'''Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics:'''\n* '''Verifiability:''' Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity. \n* '''Comparability:''' Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.\n* '''Understandability:''' Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.\n* '''Timeliness:''' Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.\n\n'''''''''''== Three components of financial statements ==\n\n=== [[:en:Cash flow statement|Statement of cash flows]] ===\nThe statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows:\n''Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance''\n\n<u>Example 1:</u> in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen's cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:\n*Cash inflow: $20\n*Cash outflow:$7\n*Opening balance: $5\n*'''Closing balance: $20 \u2013 $7 + $5 = $18'''\n\n<u>Example 2:</u> in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They'd originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables' cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:\n*Cash inflow: $50 - ''How much WikiTables received in cash for the first table. They didn't receive cash for the second table (sold in credit terms).''\n*Cash outflow: $50 - ''How much they'd originally bought the 2 tables for.''\n*Opening balance: $0\n*'''Closing balance: $50 \u2013 2*$25 + $0 = $50\u201350=$0 '''-''' '''''Indeed, the cash flow for the month of June for WikiTables amounts to $0 and not $50.''\n\nImportant: the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of '''actual''' cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.\n\n=== [[Income statement|Statement of profit and loss]] (income statement or statement of operations) ===\nThe statement of profit or income statement represents the changes in value of a company's [[account (accountancy)|accounts]] over a set period (most commonly one [[fiscal year]]), and may compare the changes to changes in the same accounts over the previous period. All changes are summarized on the \"bottom line\" as [[net income]], often reported as \"net loss\" when income is less than zero.\n\nThe net profit or loss is determined by:\n\nSales (revenue)\n\n\u2013 [[cost of goods sold]]\n\n\u2013 selling, general, administrative expenses (SGA)\n\n\u2013 [[depreciation]]/ [[amortization]]\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> earnings before interest and taxes ([[Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization|EBIT]])\n\n\u2013 interest and tax expenses\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> profit/loss\n\n=== [[Balance sheet|Statement of financial position]] (balance sheet) ===\nThe balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's [[asset]]s, [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and [[Equity (finance)|equity]] (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement. The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity in dollar amount l. This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation: ''Assets = Liabilities + Equity''. The statement can be used to help show the status of a company.\n\nAccounting standards often set out a general format that companies are expected to follow when presenting their balance sheets. [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] normally require that companies report [[current asset|current]] assets and liabilities separately from non-current amounts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iasplus.com/en-gb/standards/ias/ias1 |title=IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements |publisher=[[Deloitte|Deloitte Global]] |accessdate=May 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>Larry M. Walther, Christopher J. Skousen, \"Long-Term Assets\", Ventus Publishing ApS, 2009</ref>\n\nCurrent assets are the most liquid assets of a firm, which can be realized in 12 months period. Current assets include:\n*[[cash]] - physical money\n*[[accounts receivable]] - revenues earned but not yet collected\n*Merchandise inventory - consists of goods and services a firm currently owns until it ends up getting sold\n*[[marketable securities]] - [[Stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] a firm has invested in other firms\n*[[prepaid expense]]s - expenses paid for in advance for use during that year\n\nNon-current assets include [[fixed asset|fixed]] or long-term assets and [[intangible asset]]s: \n*''fixed (long term) assets''\n**[[property]] \n**[[building]] \n**equipment (such as factory machinery) \n*''intangible assets''\n**copyrights\n**trademarks\n**patents\n**[[goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]]\n\nLiabilities include:\n*''current liabilities''\n**trade accounts payable\n**[[dividends]] payable\n**employee salaries payable\n**interest (e.g. on debt) payable\n*''long term liabilities''\n**mortgage notes payable \n**bonds payable\n\n[[Owner's equity]], sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a [[sole proprietorship]], [[partnership]], or a [[corporation]]. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows [[common stock]], and [[retained earnings]] (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Financial Accounting I|last=Malhotra|first=DK|last2=Poteau|first2=Ray|publisher=Academic Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1627517300|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== [[Statement of Retained Earnings|Statement of retained earnings]] (statement of changes in equity) ====\nThis statement is additional to the three main statements described above. It shows how the distribution of income and transfer of dividends affects the wealth of shareholders in the company. The concept of retained earnings means profits of previous years that are accumulated till current period. Basic proforma for this statement is as follows:\n\nRetained earnings at the beginning of period\n\n+ Net Income for the period\n\n- Dividends\n\n<nowiki>=</nowiki> Retained earnings at the end of period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of financial accounting|last=Fred.|first=Phillips|date=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Irwin|others=Libby, Robert., Libby, Patricia A.|isbn=9780073527109|edition= 3rd|location=Boston|oclc=457010553}}</ref>'''\n\n==Basic concepts==\n\n'''THE STABLE MEASURING  ASSUMPTION''' One of the basic principles in accounting is \u201cThe Measuring Unit principle: <blockquote>The unit of measure in accounting shall be the base money unit of the most relevant currency. This principle also assumes the unit of measure is stable; that is, changes in its general purchasing power are not considered sufficiently important to require adjustments to the basic financial statements.\u201d<ref>Paul H. Walgenbach, Norman E. Dittrich and Ernest I. Hanson, (1973), Financial Accounting, New York: Harcourt Grace Javonovich, Inc. Page 429.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorical Cost Accounting, i.e., financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units, is based on the stable measuring unit assumption under which accountants simply assume that money, the monetary unit of measure, is perfectly stable in real value for the purpose of measuring (1) monetary items not inflation-indexed daily in terms of the Daily CPI and (2) constant real value non-monetary items not updated daily in terms of the Daily CPI during low and high inflation and deflation.\n\n'''UNITS OF CONSTANT PURCHASING POWER''' The stable monetary unit assumption is not applied during hyperinflation. IFRS requires entities to implement capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\n\nFinancial accountants produce financial statements based on the accounting standards in a given jurisdiction. These standards may be the [[generally accepted accounting principles|Generally Accepted Accounting Principles]] of a respective country, which are typically issued by a national standard setter, or [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), which are issued by the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB).\n\nFinancial accounting serves the following purposes:\n* producing general purpose financial statements\n* producing information used by the management of a business entity for decision making, planning and performance evaluation\n* producing financial statements for meeting regulatory requirements.\n'''Objectives of Financial Accounting'''\n\n* '''Systematic recording of transactions:''' basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions (i.e. book-keeping).  These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation.\n* '''Ascertainment of result of above recorded transactions:''' accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the result of business operations for a particular period of time. If expenses exceed revenue then it is said that the business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affairs can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.\n* '''Ascertainment of the financial position of business:''' businessman is not only interested in knowing the result of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular  point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business.\n* '''Providing information to the users for rational decision-making:''' accounting as a \u2018language of business\u2019 communicates the financial result of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the financial information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making.\n* '''To know the solvency position:''' by preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern\u2019s ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due.\n\n== Graphic definition ==\nThe [[accounting equation]] ([[Asset]]s = [[Liability (financial accounting)|Liabilities]] + [[Ownership equity|Owners' Equity]]) and financial statements are the main topics of financial accounting.\n\nThe [[trial balance]], which is usually prepared using the [[double-entry accounting system]], forms the basis for preparing the financial statements. All the figures in the trial balance are rearranged to prepare a [[income statement|profit & loss statement]] and [[balance sheet]]. Accounting standards determine the format for these accounts ([[Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK)|SSAP]], FRS, [[IFRS]]). Financial statements display the income and expenditure for the company and a summary of the assets, liabilities, and shareholders' or owners' equity of the company on the date to which the accounts were prepared.\n\nAssets and expenses have normal debit balances, i.e., debiting these types of accounts increases them.\n\nLiabilities, revenues, and capital have normal credit balances, i.e., crediting these increases them.\n 0 = Dr [[Asset]]s                            Cr [[Ownership equity|Owners' Equity]]                Cr [[Liability (financial accounting)|Liabilities]]  \n           .       _____________________________/\\____________________________       .\n           .      /    Cr [[Retained earnings|Retained Earnings]] (profit)         Cr [[Common stock|Common Stock]]  \\      .\n           .    _________________/\\_______________________________      .            .\n           .   / Dr [[Expenses]]       Cr Beginning [[Retained earnings|Retained Earnings]] \\     .            .\n           .

Much like signs in math: two positive numbers are added and two negative numbers are also added.  It is only when there is one positive and one negative (opposites) that you will subtract.\n\n==Versus cost accounting==\n{{see also|Cost accounting}}\n#Financial accounting aims at finding out results of accounting year in the form of Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet.

The series is based on the 1974 film ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0071115|title=Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore}}</ref> The show stars [[Linda Lavin]] in the title role, a widow who moves with her young son to start life over again, and finds a job working at a roadside diner in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. Most of the episodes revolve around events at [[Mel's Diner]], where Alice is employed.\n\n== Series summary ==\nAlice Spivak Hyatt (Lavin) is an unemployed widow after her husband Donald is killed in a trucking accident, and with her young son Tommy (played by [[Alfred Lutter]] in the [[television pilot|pilot episode]], reprising his role from the film, but portrayed by [[Philip McKeon]] thereafter) heads from their [[New Jersey]] home to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue a singing career. Her car breaks down in Phoenix (from a presumed engine fire, as seen in the opening credits), and we meet her soon after she has taken a job as a waitress at Mel's Diner, on the outskirts of Phoenix. (The later seasons' exterior shots were of a real diner, named Mel's, still in operation in Phoenix). Alice works alongside Mel Sharples ([[Vic Tayback]]), the grouchy, stingy owner and cook of the greasy spoon, and fellow waitresses and friends, sassy, man-hungry Florence Jean \"Flo\" Castleberry ([[Polly Holliday]]), and neurotic, scatterbrained Vera Louise Gorman ([[Beth Howland]]).\n\nEach episode invariably started inside the diner, and most if not all subsequent scenes took place there as well. A frequent set for non-diner scenes was Alice's one-bedroom apartment in the Desert Sun apartments. (Tommy used the bedroom and Alice slept on a sleeper sofa in the living room.) Vera and Mel's studio apartments and Flo's trailer were occasionally seen. Two of the diner's biggest competitors, Barney's Burger Barn and Vinnie's House of Veal, were sometimes mentioned.\n\nThe diner had its share of regular customers through the years, such as Tommy's basketball coach Earl Hicks ([[Dave Madden]]), local trucker Chuck (Duane R. Campbell), and Henry Beesmeyer ([[Marvin Kaplan]]), a telephone repairman who always joked about Mel's cooking. Henry's oft-mentioned wife Chloe was seen in one episode, played by [[Ruth Buzzi]]. Celebrities playing either themselves or other characters (including [[Martha Raye]], [[George Burns]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Art Carney]], [[Desi Arnaz]], and [[Jerry Reed]]) were a hallmark of the show.\n\nPolly Holliday left the show to star in her own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Flo]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080216/ ''Flo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224235008/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080216/ |date=2009-02-24 }} at the Internet Movie Database</ref> In the episode airing February 24, 1980, Flo leaves to take a hostess job in [[Houston]]. On the way to Houston, Flo stops at her hometown [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (which she refers to by its moniker \"Cowtown\"). Flo decides to buy and run a failing roadhouse bar there, which she renames Flo's Yellow Rose. Polly Holliday never made a guest appearance on ''Alice'' after beginning ''Flo'', although [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]]s including Flo were shown in the final episode of ''Alice''. Vic Tayback made one guest appearance on ''Flo''.\n\n[[Diane Ladd]], who received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for her portrayal of Flo in the film version<ref name=\"Ladd IMDB\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002663/awards Diane Ladd's award page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110063218/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002663/awards |date=2009-01-10 }} at the Internet Movie Database</ref> joined the cast in 1980 as Isabelle \"Belle\" Dupree, a hard-edged but kind-hearted woman. She had been a waitress of Mel's in the past, during which the two had a romantic relationship. Despite Ladd's [[Golden Globe]]-[[List of Golden Globe Awards: Mini-series, Best Supporting Actress|winning]] performance as Belle,<ref name=\"Ladd IMDB\" /> the character was not retained for the duration of the series and was replaced early in 1981, the character making one last appearance in which she telephones the diner to inform everyone that she had taken a job as a backup singer in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. It has been said that Ladd clashed with her co-stars, and no flashbacks including Belle were shown during the series' final episode. \n[[File:Linda Lavin Celia Weston Beth Howland ALICE.jpg|left|thumb|Season 8: [[Linda Lavin]] (Alice), [[Celia Weston]] (Jolene), and [[Beth Howland]] (Vera)]]\nTheatre actress [[Celia Weston]] then joined the cast as the good-natured, boisterous truck driver Jolene Hunnicutt, who came from Myrtle Point, South Carolina.  Jolene arrives as she and her male driving partner are in the midst of an argument over his unwelcome advances, during which she throws and breaks many of Mel's dishes. Mel agrees to hire her \"temporarily\" to work off the cost of the dishes, but she stays until the end of the series. Jolene frequently mentions her grandmother, \"Granny Gums\", who had only three or four teeth. Jolene also mentions her distant relative [[Boss Hogg|Jefferson Davis \"Boss\" Hogg]], a character from the concurrent CBS series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]].'' In one episode [[Sorrell Booke]] guest stars in this role, along with fellow ''Dukes'' character [[Enos Strate|Enos]] ([[Sonny Shroyer]]).\n\nThe latter years of the show focused on some character development, such as the hasty courtship and marriage of Vera and lovable cop Elliot ([[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]]). Tommy eventually goes to college and is seen less frequently. In the final season, the character of Alice was absent several times due to Lavin's directing a number of episodes and playing the character of Mrs. Walden, Vera's wizened, abrasive landlady of arbitrary foreign origin. The final story arc began in the spring of 1985, when country singer Travis Marsh (played by Lavin's real-life husband Kip Niven), discovering that he's falling for Alice, \"kidnaps\" her to take her to Nashville, telling her it's time to follow her dream there. Bewildered at the thought of her dreams finally coming true, Alice agrees, but not without extracting a promise from Travis to drive her back to Phoenix so she can get her affairs in order, including ending her current relationship with a writer.\n\nIn the [[series finale]], which aired March 19, 1985, typical of sitcoms of the era, news of several life-changing events is revealed within a matter of minutes. After 9 years of trying, Alice finally gets a recording contract and is moving to Nashville with Travis Marsh. Vera announces she is pregnant and decides to be a full-time mother, Elliott having been promoted from officer to detective. Jolene's \"Granny Gums\" dies and leaves her enough money to open her own beauty parlor in her hometown. Besides all three waitresses suddenly leaving simultaneously, by an amazing coincidence Mel has just sold the diner for a large amount of money to a real-estate developer and must close within days. On closing day, he surprisingly gives each waitress a $5,000 farewell bonus. The remainder of the episode shows [[flashback (continuity)|flashbacks]] to humorous and major events, and many of the big stars who had appeared on the show, including [[Polly Holliday]]. Finally, while cleaning out her locker, Alice finds the \"Waitress Wanted\" sign that first drew her to the diner. The series' regular customers, including Henry, Chuck, and Earl, say their emotional farewells, followed by Elliot, and finally the principal characters Tommy, Jolene, Vera, and Alice. The last thing we see is Mel putting up the \"Closed\" sign and locking up.\n[[File:Waitress cast Alice 1976.JPG|thumb|180px|The waitresses at Mel's Diner from left: Vera (Beth Howland), Alice (Linda Lavin), Flo (Polly Holliday).]]\n\n==Ongoing gags and catchphrases==\nFlo's [[catchphrase]], \"Kiss my grits!\", enjoyed widespread popularity at the time the character appeared on ''Alice''. According to Polly Holliday, the line was originally written as, \"Kiss my honeydew!\", but did not get any laughs. (In the original film, Flo, as played by Diane Ladd, tells Mel in one scene to, \"Kiss me where the sun don't shine.\") Another of Flo's catchphrases was, \"When donkeys fly!\" Since her portrayal of Flo, Polly Holliday has refused to repeat her famous \"grits\" line.<ref>{{cite web |author=SG |url=http://www.alicehyatt.com/cast/holliday/polly.html |title=ALICE \u2013 Polly Holliday |publisher=Alicehyatt.com |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803042138/http://www.alicehyatt.com/cast/holliday/polly.html |archivedate=2010-08-03 }}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to duplicate the success of Flo's \"Kiss my grits!\", Belle began using a new put-down: \"Butter my biscuits!\". Belle often used the phrase, \"My little voice\", who called her \"Isabelle\", which she usually used when starting to tell others what she thinks is best.\n\nMel would snipe, \"Stow it!\" at anyone he had qualms with, especially his waitstaff. \"Stow it!\" was usually followed by either \"Alice\", \"Vera\", \"Flo\" \"Belle\", or \"Blondie\" (in reference to Jolene). He would also bark, \"Bag it, Blondie!\" to Jolene. He eventually gave Vera the nickname \"Dingy\" and would occasionally bellow \"Stow it, Dingy\" at her. Jolene would sometimes say, \"When pigs wear perfume.\"\n\nIn a handful of episodes, Alice put on a double-breasted suit and fedora to assume the character of husky-voiced \"Sam Butler\", a mobster she made up as a ruse to fool her intended target. Linda Lavin also played the role of Mrs. Walden in the last season, once even playing both Alice and Mrs. Walden in a split-screen dual role.\n\nPart of Mel's Diner was often destroyed, such as by Flo's crashing a truck through the front, Mel chopping down a tree which landed on the diner, Mel accidentally having the building targeted for demolition, and the waitresses crashing a [[hot air balloon]] through the roof (upon which Jolene cries, \"We went to the bad place and it looks just like Mel's!\"). In one episode, a wrecking ball destroyed the front of the diner because someone could not read Mel's handwriting.\n\nMel was a [[wiktionary:stickler|stickler]] for punctuality. In the fourth season, he installs a time clock, which ends up working to the waitresses' advantage due to significant overtime, and he finally smashes it onto the floor. Mel also had a strict rule against [[wiktionary:moonlighting|moonlighting]], often leading to one or more waitresses getting fired, but he always rehired them before the end of each episode.\n\nAlthough he had a fairly loyal clientele, Mel's food and cooking were constantly criticized by his waitresses and customers alike\u2014especially Henry, who always blamed it for his [[indigestion]]. However, Mel's [[Chili con carne|chili]] was popular and became a [[plot point]] of several episodes. During the first season, a newspaper food critic (played by [[Victor Buono]]) dropped dead while eating Mel's chili, but it turned out that tainted [[Peking Duck]] from a [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]] was to blame. Guest star [[Art Carney]] in one episode was to be the spokesman for retail distribution of Mel's Chili (\"Chili con Carney\") but backed out when he discovered Vera was a distant relative with part ownership in the venture. The popularity of Mel's Chili also led to an appearance on [[Dinah Shore]]'s talk show, which led to some bickering among the waitresses because Mel could take only one person along, but everyone ended up going. Mel refused to reveal his \"[[secret ingredient]]\" to Dinah and her TV audience during the cooking demonstration.\n\nThe shot of Vera with the \"exploding straws\" was the only one used during the opening credits for the entire run of the series, with the exception of the pilot episode, which had no scenes from Mel's Diner in the opening.\n\n== Cast ==\nOpening title cast members:\n* [[Linda Lavin]] as Alice Hyatt\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as [[Mel Sharples]] (Tayback reprised his role from the film)\n* [[Philip McKeon]] as [[Tommy Hyatt]] ([[Alfred Lutter]] had initially reprised his role from the film but was replaced after the pilot episode)\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as [[Florence Jean Castleberry|Florence Jean \"Flo\" Castleberry]] (Seasons 1\u20134: 1976\u20131980)\n* [[Beth Howland]] as Vera Louise Gorman Novak\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Isabelle \"Belle\" Dupree (Seasons 4\u20135: 1980\u20131981) (Ladd played the role of Flo in the film)\n* [[Celia Weston]] as [[Jolene Hunnicutt]] (Seasons 5\u20139: 1981\u20131985)\n* [[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]] as Elliot Novak (Season 8 recurring, Season 9 regular: 1983\u201385)\n\nOther recurring cast members:\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] as Henry Beesmeyer (diner regular who worked for the phone company) (1977\u20131985)\n* [[Dave Madden]] as Earl Hicks, a basketball coach, date to Flo and a diner customer (1978\u20131985)\n* [[Victoria Carroll]] as Marie Massey (Mel's girlfriend) (1978\u20131984)\n* [[Martha Raye]] as [[Carrie Sharples]] (Mel's mother) (1978\u20131984)\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Mona Spivak (Alice's mother) (1981\u20131982)\n* [[Robert Picardo]] as Officer Maxwell, a police officer and Elliott's partner (1982\u20131984)\n* [[Patrick Cranshaw|Pat Cranshaw]] as Andy (diner regular) (1976\u201378)\n* [[Tony Longo]] as Artie (diner regular) (1981\u20131984)\n* [[Patrick Cronin (actor)|Patrick J. Cronin]] as Jason (diner regular) (1976\u20131980)\n* Duane R. Campbell as Chuck (diner regular) (1978\u20131985)\n\nNotable guest stars include: [[Eve Arden]], [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Brice Beckham]], [[Fred Berry]], [[Sorrell Booke]] (as Boss Hogg), [[George Burns]] (as himself), [[Ruth Buzzi]] (as Chloe Beesmeyer, Henry's wife), [[Art Carney]] (as himself), [[Corey Feldman]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Joel Grey]] (as himself), [[Florence Halop]], [[Eileen Heckart]] (as Rose Hyatt, Alice's interfering mother in-law), [[Florence Henderson]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Bill Maher]], [[George Wendt]], [[Nancy McKeon]] (Philip's sister, appearing twice, in different roles), [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]], [[Donald O'Connor]] (as himself), [[Janis Paige]], [[Kelly Parsons]], [[Jerry Reed]] (as himself), [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Kim Richards]], [[Telly Savalas]] (as himself), [[Sonny Shroyer]] (as Enos Strate), and [[Jerry Stiller]].[[Jim Varney]] as (Milo Skinner)\n\n== Production information ==\nThe show's theme was called \"There's a New Girl in Town\", with music by [[David Shire]], lyrics by [[Alan Bergman]] and [[Marilyn Bergman]]; performed by Linda Lavin. Several arrangements of this tune were used throughout the series' run; the lyrics were altered after the second season.\n\nThe Mel's Diner [[theatrical set|set]] made changes over the years; in the pilot the diner contained a blue refrigerator, but in the series the refrigerator was a dirty stainless steel, then later was changed to clean and shiny stainless steel in 1979\u201381 and much later the set featured an even shinier stainless steel refrigerator and better appliances. The rest of the set, however, remained the same.\n\nThe men's and ladies' restrooms were confined to one room in the pilot and during the first season. From 1977\u201385, there were separate restrooms with \"Ladies\" and \"Men\" written on them.\n\nThe storeroom was inside the diner where the men's restroom would later be and said \"Private\" on it during the 1976\u201377 season. The storeroom from 1977 to 1985 was confined to the back of the diner. Here, the waitresses took their breaks, had their lockers, and stored their uniforms. Mel also conducted his business from this space.\n\nThe payphone was a [[touch tone]] and was located on the left of the \"Restrooms\" door in the pilot episode. For the first season, it was moved to the right of the doors that led to the kitchen section of the diner. For the second season, it was moved to the wall between the two doors that became two separate restrooms and was replaced by a phone with a rotary dial. From 1978 to 1985, the phone was a touch tone and was located at a section that was a few steps away from the entrance to the diner.\n\nIn the first season, the diner was decorated in an Aztec and cowboy motif to accommodate the feel of Arizona. For the second season, the walls had pink wallpaper with red lines on it. For the third season, the walls had wallpaper with orange leaves on it.\n\nThe giant \"14-ounce coffee cup\" sign used in later seasons was seen by a producer scouting Phoenix for an establishing shot for the show's later seasons. It was at \"Chris\u2019 Diner\" and the owner agreed to change the name to Mel's for the show.\n\nAlice's apartment remained more or less unchanged during most of the show's run; the apartments of Mel and Vera and Flo's trailer were occasionally seen. (The set for Flo's trailer was also used on the spinoff ''Flo''.)\n\nThe pilot episode was taped at [[CBS Television City]] in Hollywood, California. After this, the series was taped at The [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Studios]] in Burbank, California.\n\n== Differences in premise between the film and the television series ==\n''Alice'' had many contrasts with the film on which it was based, ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''.  The tone and style of the series differed greatly from the film, and there were a number of factual differences concerning the characters and setting.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%:\"|Film\n! style=\"width:50%:\"|Television series\n|- valign=top\n| Alice's maiden name was Graham.\n| Alice's maiden name was Spivak.\n|- valign=top\n| Alice and Tommy had previously lived in [[Socorro, New Mexico]].\n| Alice and Tommy had previously lived in northern [[New Jersey]].\n|- valign=top\n| Alice's late husband Donald was portrayed as abusive.\n| Alice's relationship with Donald is never described, but she kept a photo of him displayed on the wall of her apartment for years after his death.\n|- valign=top\n| Alice's original plans were to move back to her hometown of [[Monterey, California]], to restart her singing career.\n| Alice's original plans were to move to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to restart her singing career.\n|- valign=top\n| The restaurant where Alice becomes a waitress was called Mel & Ruby's Cafe and located in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].\n| The restaurant where Alice becomes a waitress was called Mel's Diner and located in Phoenix.

The series is based on the 1974 film ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0071115|title=Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore}}</ref> The show stars [[Linda Lavin]] in the title role, a widow who moves with her young son to start life over again, and finds a job working at a roadside diner in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. Most of the episodes revolve around events at [[Mel's Diner]], where Alice is employed.\n\n== Series summary ==\nAlice Spivak Hyatt (Lavin) is an unemployed widow after her husband Donald is killed in a trucking accident, and with her young son Tommy (played by [[Alfred Lutter]] in the [[television pilot|pilot episode]], reprising his role from the film, but portrayed by [[Philip McKeon]] thereafter) heads from their [[New Jersey]] home to [[Los Angeles]] to pursue a singing career. Her car breaks down in Phoenix (from a presumed engine fire, as seen in the opening credits), and we meet her soon after she has taken a job as a waitress at Mel's Diner, on the outskirts of Phoenix. (The later seasons' exterior shots were of a real diner, named Mel's, still in operation in Phoenix). Alice works alongside Mel Sharples ([[Vic Tayback]]), the grouchy, stingy owner and cook of the greasy spoon, and fellow waitresses and friends, sassy, man-hungry Florence Jean \"Flo\" Castleberry ([[Polly Holliday]]), and neurotic, scatterbrained Vera Louise Gorman ([[Beth Howland]]).\n\nEach episode invariably started inside the diner, and most if not all subsequent scenes took place there as well. A frequent set for non-diner scenes was Alice's one-bedroom apartment in the Desert Sun apartments. (Tommy used the bedroom and Alice slept on a sleeper sofa in the living room.) Vera and Mel's studio apartments and Flo's trailer were occasionally seen. Two of the diner's biggest competitors, Barney's Burger Barn and Vinnie's House of Veal, were sometimes mentioned.\n\nThe diner had its share of regular customers through the years, such as Tommy's basketball coach Earl Hicks ([[Dave Madden]]), local trucker Chuck (Duane R. Campbell), and Henry Beesmeyer ([[Marvin Kaplan]]), a telephone repairman who always joked about Mel's cooking. Henry's oft-mentioned wife Chloe was seen in one episode, played by [[Ruth Buzzi]]. Celebrities playing either themselves or other characters (including [[Martha Raye]], [[George Burns]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Art Carney]], [[Desi Arnaz]], and [[Jerry Reed]]) were a hallmark of the show.\n\nPolly Holliday left the show to star in her own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[Flo]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080216/ ''Flo''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224235008/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080216/ |date=2009-02-24 }} at the Internet Movie Database</ref> In the episode airing February 24, 1980, Flo leaves to take a hostess job in [[Houston]]. On the way to Houston, Flo stops at her hometown [[Fort Worth, Texas]] (which she refers to by its moniker \"Cowtown\"). Flo decides to buy and run a failing roadhouse bar there, which she renames Flo's Yellow Rose. Polly Holliday never made a guest appearance on ''Alice'' after beginning ''Flo'', although [[flashback (continuity)|flashback]]s including Flo were shown in the final episode of ''Alice''. Vic Tayback made one guest appearance on ''Flo''.\n\n[[Diane Ladd]], who received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for her portrayal of Flo in the film version<ref name=\"Ladd IMDB\">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002663/awards Diane Ladd's award page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110063218/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002663/awards |date=2009-01-10 }} at the Internet Movie Database</ref> joined the cast in 1980 as Isabelle \"Belle\" Dupree, a hard-edged but kind-hearted woman. She had been a waitress of Mel's in the past, during which the two had a romantic relationship. Despite Ladd's [[Golden Globe]]-[[List of Golden Globe Awards: Mini-series, Best Supporting Actress|winning]] performance as Belle,<ref name=\"Ladd IMDB\" /> the character was not retained for the duration of the series and was replaced early in 1981, the character making one last appearance in which she telephones the diner to inform everyone that she had taken a job as a backup singer in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. It has been said that Ladd clashed with her co-stars, and no flashbacks including Belle were shown during the series' final episode. \n[[File:Linda Lavin Celia Weston Beth Howland ALICE.jpg|left|thumb|Season 8: [[Linda Lavin]] (Alice), [[Celia Weston]] (Jolene), and [[Beth Howland]] (Vera)]]\nTheatre actress [[Celia Weston]] then joined the cast as the good-natured, boisterous truck driver Jolene Hunnicutt, who came from Myrtle Point, South Carolina.  Jolene arrives as she and her male driving partner are in the midst of an argument over his unwelcome advances, during which she throws and breaks many of Mel's dishes. Mel agrees to hire her \"temporarily\" to work off the cost of the dishes, but she stays until the end of the series. Jolene frequently mentions her grandmother, \"Granny Gums\", who had only three or four teeth. Jolene also mentions her distant relative [[Boss Hogg|Jefferson Davis \"Boss\" Hogg]], a character from the concurrent CBS series ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]].'' In one episode [[Sorrell Booke]] guest stars in this role, along with fellow ''Dukes'' character [[Enos Strate|Enos]] ([[Sonny Shroyer]]).\n\nThe latter years of the show focused on some character development, such as the hasty courtship and marriage of Vera and lovable cop Elliot ([[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]]). Tommy eventually goes to college and is seen less frequently. In the final season, the character of Alice was absent several times due to Lavin's directing a number of episodes and playing the character of Mrs. Walden, Vera's wizened, abrasive landlady of arbitrary foreign origin. The final story arc began in the spring of 1985, when country singer Travis Marsh (played by Lavin's real-life husband Kip Niven), discovering that he's falling for Alice, \"kidnaps\" her to take her to Nashville, telling her it's time to follow her dream there. Bewildered at the thought of her dreams finally coming true, Alice agrees, but not without extracting a promise from Travis to drive her back to Phoenix so she can get her affairs in order, including ending her current relationship with a writer.\n\nIn the [[series finale]], which aired March 19, 1985, typical of sitcoms of the era, news of several life-changing events is revealed within a matter of minutes. After 9 years of trying, Alice finally gets a recording contract and is moving to Nashville with Travis Marsh. Vera announces she is pregnant and decides to be a full-time mother, Elliott having been promoted from officer to detective. Jolene's \"Granny Gums\" dies and leaves her enough money to open her own beauty parlor in her hometown. Besides all three waitresses suddenly leaving simultaneously, by an amazing coincidence Mel has just sold the diner for a large amount of money to a real-estate developer and must close within days. On closing day, he surprisingly gives each waitress a $5,000 farewell bonus. The remainder of the episode shows [[flashback (continuity)|flashbacks]] to humorous and major events, and many of the big stars who had appeared on the show, including [[Polly Holliday]]. Finally, while cleaning out her locker, Alice finds the \"Waitress Wanted\" sign that first drew her to the diner. The series' regular customers, including Henry, Chuck, and Earl, say their emotional farewells, followed by Elliot, and finally the principal characters Tommy, Jolene, Vera, and Alice. The last thing we see is Mel putting up the \"Closed\" sign and locking up.\n[[File:Waitress cast Alice 1976.JPG|thumb|180px|The waitresses at Mel's Diner from left: Vera (Beth Howland), Alice (Linda Lavin), Flo (Polly Holliday).]]\n\n==Ongoing gags and catchphrases==\nFlo's [[catchphrase]], \"Kiss my grits!\", enjoyed widespread popularity at the time the character appeared on ''Alice''. According to Polly Holliday, the line was originally written as, \"Kiss my honeydew!\", but did not get any laughs. (In the original film, Flo, as played by Diane Ladd, tells Mel in one scene to, \"Kiss me where the sun don't shine.\") Another of Flo's catchphrases was, \"When donkeys fly!\" Since her portrayal of Flo, Polly Holliday has refused to repeat her famous \"grits\" line.<ref>{{cite web |author=SG |url=http://www.alicehyatt.com/cast/holliday/polly.html |title=ALICE \u2013 Polly Holliday |publisher=Alicehyatt.com |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803042138/http://www.alicehyatt.com/cast/holliday/polly.html |archivedate=2010-08-03 }}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to duplicate the success of Flo's \"Kiss my grits!\", Belle began using a new put-down: \"Butter my biscuits!\". Belle often used the phrase, \"My little voice\", who called her \"Isabelle\", which she usually used when starting to tell others what she thinks is best.\n\nMel would snipe, \"Stow it!\" at anyone he had qualms with, especially his waitstaff. \"Stow it!\" was usually followed by either \"Alice\", \"Vera\", \"Flo\" \"Belle\", or \"Blondie\" (in reference to Jolene). He would also bark, \"Bag it, Blondie!\" to Jolene. He eventually gave Vera the nickname \"Dingy\" and would occasionally bellow \"Stow it, Dingy\" at her. Jolene would sometimes say, \"When pigs wear perfume.\"\n\nIn a handful of episodes, Alice put on a double-breasted suit and fedora to assume the character of husky-voiced \"Sam Butler\", a mobster she made up as a ruse to fool her intended target. Linda Lavin also played the role of Mrs. Walden in the last season, once even playing both Alice and Mrs. Walden in a split-screen dual role.\n\nPart of Mel's Diner was often destroyed, such as by Flo's crashing a truck through the front, Mel chopping down a tree which landed on the diner, Mel accidentally having the building targeted for demolition, and the waitresses crashing a [[hot air balloon]] through the roof (upon which Jolene cries, \"We went to the bad place and it looks just like Mel's!\"). In one episode, a wrecking ball destroyed the front of the diner because someone could not read Mel's handwriting.\n\nMel was a [[wiktionary:stickler|stickler]] for punctuality. In the fourth season, he installs a time clock, which ends up working to the waitresses' advantage due to significant overtime, and he finally smashes it onto the floor. Mel also had a strict rule against [[wiktionary:moonlighting|moonlighting]], often leading to one or more waitresses getting fired, but he always rehired them before the end of each episode.\n\nAlthough he had a fairly loyal clientele, Mel's food and cooking were constantly criticized by his waitresses and customers alike\u2014especially Henry, who always blamed it for his [[indigestion]]. However, Mel's [[Chili con carne|chili]] was popular and became a [[plot point]] of several episodes. During the first season, a newspaper food critic (played by [[Victor Buono]]) dropped dead while eating Mel's chili, but it turned out that tainted [[Peking Duck]] from a [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]] was to blame. Guest star [[Art Carney]] in one episode was to be the spokesman for retail distribution of Mel's Chili (\"Chili con Carney\") but backed out when he discovered Vera was a distant relative with part ownership in the venture. The popularity of Mel's Chili also led to an appearance on [[Dinah Shore]]'s talk show, which led to some bickering among the waitresses because Mel could take only one person along, but everyone ended up going. Mel refused to reveal his \"[[secret ingredient]]\" to Dinah and her TV audience during the cooking demonstration.\n\nThe shot of Vera with the \"exploding straws\" was the only one used during the opening credits for the entire run of the series, with the exception of the pilot episode, which had no scenes from Mel's Diner in the opening.\n\n== Cast ==\nOpening title cast members:\n* [[Linda Lavin]] as Alice Hyatt\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as [[Mel Sharples]] (Tayback reprised his role from the film)\n* [[Philip McKeon]] as [[Tommy Hyatt]] ([[Alfred Lutter]] had initially reprised his role from the film but was replaced after the pilot episode)\n* [[Polly Holliday]] as [[Florence Jean Castleberry|Florence Jean \"Flo\" Castleberry]] (Seasons 1\u20134: 1976\u20131980)\n* [[Beth Howland]] as Vera Louise Gorman Novak\n* [[Diane Ladd]] as Isabelle \"Belle\" Dupree (Seasons 4\u20135: 1980\u20131981) (Ladd played the role of Flo in the film)\n* [[Celia Weston]] as [[Jolene Hunnicutt]] (Seasons 5\u20139: 1981\u20131985)\n* [[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]] as Elliot Novak (Season 8 recurring, Season 9 regular: 1983\u201385)\n\nOther recurring cast members:\n* [[Marvin Kaplan]] as Henry Beesmeyer (diner regular who worked for the phone company) (1977\u20131985)\n* [[Dave Madden]] as Earl Hicks, a basketball coach, date to Flo and a diner customer (1978\u20131985)\n* [[Victoria Carroll]] as Marie Massey (Mel's girlfriend) (1978\u20131984)\n* [[Martha Raye]] as [[Carrie Sharples]] (Mel's mother) (1978\u20131984)\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Mona Spivak (Alice's mother) (1981\u20131982)\n* [[Robert Picardo]] as Officer Maxwell, a police officer and Elliott's partner (1982\u20131984)\n* [[Patrick Cranshaw|Pat Cranshaw]] as Andy (diner regular) (1976\u201378)\n* [[Tony Longo]] as Artie (diner regular) (1981\u20131984)\n* [[Patrick Cronin (actor)|Patrick J. Cronin]] as Jason (diner regular) (1976\u20131980)\n* Duane R. Campbell as Chuck (diner regular) (1978\u20131985)\n\nNotable guest stars include: [[Eve Arden]], [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Brice Beckham]], [[Fred Berry]], [[Sorrell Booke]] (as Boss Hogg), [[George Burns]] (as himself), [[Ruth Buzzi]] (as Chloe Beesmeyer, Henry's wife), [[Art Carney]] (as himself), [[Corey Feldman]], [[Robert Goulet]], [[Joel Grey]] (as himself), [[Florence Halop]], [[Eileen Heckart]] (as Rose Hyatt, Alice's interfering mother in-law), [[Florence Henderson]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Bill Maher]], [[George Wendt]], [[Nancy McKeon]] (Philip's sister, appearing twice, in different roles), [[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]], [[Donald O'Connor]] (as himself), [[Janis Paige]], [[Kelly Parsons]], [[Jerry Reed]] (as himself), [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Kim Richards]], [[Telly Savalas]] (as himself), [[Sonny Shroyer]] (as Enos Strate), and [[Jerry Stiller]].[[Jim Varney]] as (Milo Skinner)\n\n== Production information ==\nThe show's theme was called \"There's a New Girl in Town\", with music by [[David Shire]], lyrics by [[Alan Bergman]] and [[Marilyn Bergman]]; performed by Linda Lavin. Several arrangements of this tune were used throughout the series' run; the lyrics were altered after the second season.\n\nThe Mel's Diner [[theatrical set|set]] made changes over the years; in the pilot the diner contained a blue refrigerator, but in the series the refrigerator was a dirty stainless steel, then later was changed to clean and shiny stainless steel in 1979\u201381 and much later the set featured an even shinier stainless steel refrigerator and better appliances. The rest of the set, however, remained the same.\n\nThe men's and ladies' restrooms were confined to one room in the pilot and during the first season. From 1977\u201385, there were separate restrooms with \"Ladies\" and \"Men\" written on them.\n\nThe storeroom was inside the diner where the men's restroom would later be and said \"Private\" on it during the 1976\u201377 season. The storeroom from 1977 to 1985 was confined to the back of the diner. Here, the waitresses took their breaks, had their lockers, and stored their uniforms. Mel also conducted his business from this space.\n\nThe payphone was a [[touch tone]] and was located on the left of the \"Restrooms\" door in the pilot episode. For the first season, it was moved to the right of the doors that led to the kitchen section of the diner. For the second season, it was moved to the wall between the two doors that became two separate restrooms and was replaced by a phone with a rotary dial. From 1978 to 1985, the phone was a touch tone and was located at a section that was a few steps away from the entrance to the diner.\n\nIn the first season, the diner was decorated in an Aztec and cowboy motif to accommodate the feel of Arizona. For the second season, the walls had pink wallpaper with red lines on it. For the third season, the walls had wallpaper with orange leaves on it.\n\nThe giant \"14-ounce coffee cup\" sign used in later seasons was seen by a producer scouting Phoenix for an establishing shot for the show's later seasons. It was at \"Chris\u2019 Diner\" and the owner agreed to change the name to Mel's for the show.\n\nAlice's apartment remained more or less unchanged during most of the show's run; the apartments of Mel and Vera and Flo's trailer were occasionally seen. (The set for Flo's trailer was also used on the spinoff ''Flo''.)\n\nThe pilot episode was taped at [[CBS Television City]] in Hollywood, California. After this, the series was taped at The [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Studios]] in Burbank, California.\n\n== Differences in premise between the film and the television series ==\n''Alice'' had many contrasts with the film on which it was based, ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''.  The tone and style of the series differed greatly from the film, and there were a number of factual differences concerning the characters and setting.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:50%:\"|Film\n! style=\"width:50%:\"|Television series\n|- valign=top\n| Alice's maiden name was Graham.\n| Alice's maiden name was Spivak.\n|- valign=top\n| Alice and Tommy had previously lived in [[Socorro, New Mexico]].\n| Alice and Tommy had previously lived in northern [[New Jersey]].\n|- valign=top\n| Alice's late husband Donald was portrayed as abusive.\n| Alice's relationship with Donald is never described, but she kept a photo of him displayed on the wall of her apartment for years after his death.\n|- valign=top\n| Alice's original plans were to move back to her hometown of [[Monterey, California]], to restart her singing career.\n| Alice's original plans were to move to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] to restart her singing career.\n|- valign=top\n| The restaurant where Alice becomes a waitress was called Mel & Ruby's Cafe and located in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].\n| The restaurant where Alice becomes a waitress was called Mel's Diner and located in Phoenix.
