The youngster's promising performances attracted the attention of [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] president [[Enrico Rocca]], and he was acquired by the [[Serie B]] side the following year for a notable sum of 37 million Lire, at the age of 19; Riva remained with the [[Sardinia]]n team for the rest of his career.

Roma|Roma]], and also helped the club avoid relegation, leading the team to a comfortable sixth-place finish in the table, scoring an encouraging 9 goals in 32 appearances at the age of 20. This was followed by [[1965\u201366 Serie A|eleventh]], [[1966\u201367 Serie A|sixth]], and [[1967\u201368 Serie A|ninth place]] finishes in the league between 1965 and 1968, while Riva also finished as the [[Capocannoniere|league's top-scorer]] for the first time during the [[1966\u201367 Serie A|1966\u201367 season]] with 18 goals, as the club began to build a potential title winning side around their star striker: Riva attracted several notable footballers to Cagliari, and the team during this period featured key players such as [[Enrico Albertosi]], [[Roberto Boninsegna]], [[Ricciotti Greatti]], [[Comunardo Niccolai]], [[Mario Martiradonna]], Mario Brugnera, [[Pierluigi Cera]], and [[Claudio Olinto de Carvalho|Nen\u00e9]].<ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/> Riva subsequently helped Cagliari to a second-place finish in both the [[Coppa Italia]], behind Roma, and the league, four points behind [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], during the [[1968\u201369 Serie A|1968\u201369 season]], winning the ''capocannoniere'' title for a second time with 20 goals in 29 appearances; Cagliari had been leading in the league until the 21st matchday, when a loss at home to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] caused the team to surrender their lead.<ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/>\n\nFollowing the arrival of fellow forwards [[Angelo Domenghini]] and [[Sergio Gori]] from [[F.C Internazionale Milano|Inter]] in the summer of 1969, in exchange for Boninsegna, Riva finally won his maiden career Serie A title with Cagliari during the [[1969\u201370 Serie A|1969\u201370 season]]; under the guidance of manager Manlio Scopigno and his offensive tactics, Riva led the team's front line, scoring several decisive goals that ultimately helped the club win the championship. On 15 March 1970, with Cagliari having climbed to the top of the table with six league games remaining, Riva scored two goals to help Cagliari come back twice from behind in a 2\u20132 away draw against second placed Juventus; his second, equalising goal came from a penalty, with eight minutes remaining, and the result allowed Cagliari to maintain their lead over the Turin side in Serie A. Cagliari headed into April still in first place by three points, with three matches remaining; in order to clinch the ''Scudetto'', Cagliari needed to win their next match at home against [[A.S. Bari|Bari]], while Juventus, who were still in second place, needed to lose away against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. On 12 April, Riva opened the scoring with a diving header in an eventual 2\u20130 win over Bari at the [[Stadio Amsicora]], while Juventus suffered a 2\u20130 defeat to Lazio in Rome, with goals from [[Gian Piero Ghio]] and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]]; as a result, Cagliari were crowned Serie A champions for the first time in their history, with two games to spare, also sealing a place in the [[European Cup]] the following season.<ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\"/><ref name=\"70 anni di gol\"/> This was the first time a club south of Rome had ever won the league title; Riva once again finished the season as top-scorer, with 21 goals. During this period, Riva's skill, prolific goalscoring, and decisive performances in leading a small, provincial club like Cagliari from Serie B to the Serie A title saw him become one of the best strikers in the world: he was the [[Capocannoniere|Serie A top-scorer]] on three occasions, in [[1966\u201367 Serie A|1966\u201367]], in [[1968\u201369 Serie A|1968\u201369]] and in [[1969\u201370 Serie A|1969\u201370]], and he placed 2nd in the [[1969 Ballon d'Or]], behind compatriot [[Gianni Rivera]], and 3rd in the [[1970 Ballon d'Or]], behind [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] and [[Bobby Moore]].<ref name=\"enciclopediadelcalcio\"/><ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/riva.html|title=Gigi Riva: TANTO D'ESTRO, TANTO SINISTRO|website=storiedicalcio.altervista.org|language=Italian|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"sportsjoe\"/><ref name=\"Questi 60 anni duri e felici\"/><ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\"/><ref name=\"Riva, fortuna e disgrazia\"/>\n\n=== 1970\u20131976: Final years with Cagliari ===\n{{Quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"...

He also made his debut in the [[1970\u201371 European Cup|European Cup]] that season, helping Cagliari to the second round with two goals in a 3\u20130 home win against [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]] in the first leg of the first round of the competition; he later added a third goal in the tournament in the club's 2\u20131 home victory over [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] in the first leg of the second round.<ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/> However, Riva's season was ended prematurely by a serious injury which he endured in a European qualifying match with the Italian national team in late October; in his absence, Cagliari were soon eliminated from the European Cup in the round of 16, and dropped down the domestic table, eventually finishing the season in seventh place. After recovering from his injury, Riva managed 21 goals in 30 games during the [[1971\u201372 Serie A|1971\u201372 season]], finishing the season as the second highest goalscorer in the league, and helping Cagliari to a fourth-place finish and a spot in the next season's [[1972\u201373 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].<ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/> With the departure of Scopigno, Cagliari's results declined during the next two seasons, with the club only managing low mid-table finishes, although Riva's goalscoring output still remained consistent, as he scored 12 goals during [[1972\u201373 Serie A|1972\u201373 season]], and 15 during the [[1973\u201374 Serie A|1973\u201374 season]]. Despite having already established himself as a world class player, while Cagliari struggled in the league during the mid 70s, Riva remained loyal to the Sardinian side, and turned down many bids from larger clubs, in particular from northern Italy. During his time with Cagliari, he demonstrated his attachment to the club when he refused several lucrative offers from Serie A giants Juventus in order to remain in the Sardinian capital, despite numerous rumours in the press which stated that he had already signed with the Turin side in exchange for large, record-breaking sums and several of their own players.<ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/><ref name=\"I 70 anni di Gigi Riva, la leggenda\"/><ref name=\"Questi 60 anni duri e felici\"/><ref name=\"70 anni di gol\"/>\n\nDespite his talent and goalscoring prowess, Riva's career was blighted by several major injuries, in particular with the Italian national side, and which greatly limited his playing time in later seasons; he missed 35 games in the five seasons leading up to 1971, and only appeared in 24 matches for Cagliari between 1974 and 1976, which saw an overall decline to his goalscoring rate and the club's performances during this period. During the [[1974\u201375 Serie A|1974\u201375 season]], a calf injury limited him to 8 appearances and 2 goals with the club, and on 1 February 1976, while playing in a match for Cagliari against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], Riva ruptured a tendon and tore an adductor muscle in his right thigh, following a physical shoulder challenge near the corner flag from [[Aldo Bet]], after being chased down by the Milan defender; he never successfully recovered and, despite several comeback attempts over the next year and a half, was eventually forced to retire in 1978, at the age of 33, having played his last game at the age of 31 in 1976. The injury limited Riva to only 15 appearances during the [[1975\u201376 Serie A]] season; despite his run of six goals in a span of eight games during the final season of his career, Cagliari finished in last place in the league in his absence, and were relegated to Serie B.<ref name=\"enciclopediadelcalcio\"/><ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/><ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\"/><ref name=\"Riva, fortuna e disgrazia\"/><ref name=eroi>{{cite web|url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/brera_riva.html|title=Gianni Brera: \"Per gli eroi autentici non si guasti il ricordo\"|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|author1=Gianni Brera|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref> In total, Riva scored 248 goals for club and country throughout his career in 439 appearances,<ref name=\"I 70 anni di Gigi Riva, la leggenda\"/><ref name=\"70 anni di gol\"/> scoring 164 league goals with Cagliari in 315 appearances, 156 of which came in 289 Serie A appearances.

The youngster's promising performances attracted the attention of [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] president [[Enrico Rocca]], and he was acquired by the [[Serie B]] side the following year for a notable sum of 37 million Lire, at the age of 19; Riva remained with the [[Sardinia]]n team for the rest of his career. In his [[1963\u201364 Serie B|first season]] with the club, he scored 8 goals in 26 appearances and helped Cagliari to a second-place finish in the league behind [[Varese Calcio S.S.D.|Varese]], which enabled the team to achieve promotion to the top-flight for the first time in their 40-year history.<ref name=\"enciclopediadelcalcio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediadelcalcio.it/Rivaluigi.html|title=Riva, Luigi|publisher=enciclopediadelcalcio.it|language=Italian|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"WS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/luigi-riva-cagliari-350728|title=Luigi Riva and the miracle of Cagliari\u2019s scudetto success|publisher=World Soccer|author1=Jamie Rainbow|author2=Luca Cetta|date=30 March 2014|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/><ref name=\"I 70 anni di Gigi Riva, la leggenda\"/><ref name=\"sportsjoe\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/on-the-day-he-turns-70-why-gigi-riva-remains-the-ultimate-italian-striker/991|title=On the day he turns 70, why Gigi Riva remains the ultimate Italian striker|publisher=SportsJoe|author1=Robert Redmond|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\">{{cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2015/11/riva-cagliari/|title=Luigi Riva: The Man Who Was Cagliari|publisher=forzaitalianfootball.com|author1=Marco Jackson|date=7 November 2015|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Riva, fortuna e disgrazia\">{{cite web|url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/riva_ceduto.html|title=Riva, fortuna e \"disgrazia\" del Cagliari|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"treccani\">{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luigi-riva_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=RIVA, Luigi (Gigi)|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002|language=Italian|author1=Marino Bortoletti)|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball2\">{{cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2014/11/legend-of-calcio-luigi-gigi-riva/|title=Legend Of Calcio: Luigi \u2018Gigi\u2019 Riva|publisher=forzaitalianfootball.com|author1=Marco Jackson|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 1964\u20131970: Serie A debut with Cagliari and road to the Serie A title ===\n[[File:Gigi Riva - US Cagliari (1970) - CROPPED.jpg|thumb|left|Riva with [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] in 1970.]]\n\nThe [[1964\u201365 Serie A|following season]], Riva made his [[Serie A]] debut for Cagliari on 13 September, 1964, in a 2\u20131 loss against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], and also helped the club avoid relegation, leading the team to a comfortable sixth-place finish in the table, scoring an encouraging 9 goals in 32 appearances at the age of 20. This was followed by [[1965\u201366 Serie A|eleventh]], [[1966\u201367 Serie A|sixth]], and [[1967\u201368 Serie A|ninth place]] finishes in the league between 1965 and 1968, while Riva also finished as the [[Capocannoniere|league's top-scorer]] for the first time during the [[1966\u201367 Serie A|1966\u201367 season]] with 18 goals, as the club began to build a potential title winning side around their star striker: Riva attracted several notable footballers to Cagliari, and the team during this period featured key players such as [[Enrico Albertosi]], [[Roberto Boninsegna]], [[Ricciotti Greatti]], [[Comunardo Niccolai]], [[Mario Martiradonna]], Mario Brugnera, [[Pierluigi Cera]], and [[Claudio Olinto de Carvalho|Nen\u00e9]].<ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/> Riva subsequently helped Cagliari to a second-place finish in both the [[Coppa Italia]], behind Roma, and the league, four points behind [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], during the [[1968\u201369 Serie A|1968\u201369 season]], winning the ''capocannoniere'' title for a second time with 20 goals in 29 appearances; Cagliari had been leading in the league until the 21st matchday, when a loss at home to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] caused the team to surrender their lead.<ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/>\n\nFollowing the arrival of fellow forwards [[Angelo Domenghini]] and [[Sergio Gori]] from [[F.C Internazionale Milano|Inter]] in the summer of 1969, in exchange for Boninsegna, Riva finally won his maiden career Serie A title with Cagliari during the [[1969\u201370 Serie A|1969\u201370 season]]; under the guidance of manager Manlio Scopigno and his offensive tactics, Riva led the team's front line, scoring several decisive goals that ultimately helped the club win the championship. On 15 March 1970, with Cagliari having climbed to the top of the table with six league games remaining, Riva scored two goals to help Cagliari come back twice from behind in a 2\u20132 away draw against second placed Juventus; his second, equalising goal came from a penalty, with eight minutes remaining, and the result allowed Cagliari to maintain their lead over the Turin side in Serie A. Cagliari headed into April still in first place by three points, with three matches remaining; in order to clinch the ''Scudetto'', Cagliari needed to win their next match at home against [[A.S. Bari|Bari]], while Juventus, who were still in second place, needed to lose away against [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. On 12 April, Riva opened the scoring with a diving header in an eventual 2\u20130 win over Bari at the [[Stadio Amsicora]], while Juventus suffered a 2\u20130 defeat to Lazio in Rome, with goals from [[Gian Piero Ghio]] and [[Giorgio Chinaglia]]; as a result, Cagliari were crowned Serie A champions for the first time in their history, with two games to spare, also sealing a place in the [[European Cup]] the following season.<ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\"/><ref name=\"70 anni di gol\"/> This was the first time a club south of Rome had ever won the league title; Riva once again finished the season as top-scorer, with 21 goals. During this period, Riva's skill, prolific goalscoring, and decisive performances in leading a small, provincial club like Cagliari from Serie B to the Serie A title saw him become one of the best strikers in the world: he was the [[Capocannoniere|Serie A top-scorer]] on three occasions, in [[1966\u201367 Serie A|1966\u201367]], in [[1968\u201369 Serie A|1968\u201369]] and in [[1969\u201370 Serie A|1969\u201370]], and he placed 2nd in the [[1969 Ballon d'Or]], behind compatriot [[Gianni Rivera]], and 3rd in the [[1970 Ballon d'Or]], behind [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] and [[Bobby Moore]].<ref name=\"enciclopediadelcalcio\"/><ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org/riva.html|title=Gigi Riva: TANTO D'ESTRO, TANTO SINISTRO|website=storiedicalcio.altervista.org|language=Italian|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"sportsjoe\"/><ref name=\"Questi 60 anni duri e felici\"/><ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\"/><ref name=\"Riva, fortuna e disgrazia\"/>\n\n=== 1970\u20131976: Final years with Cagliari ===\n{{Quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=\"...

He also made his debut in the [[1970\u201371 European Cup|European Cup]] that season, helping Cagliari to the second round with two goals in a 3\u20130 home win against [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]] in the first leg of the first round of the competition; he later added a third goal in the tournament in the club's 2\u20131 home victory over [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] in the first leg of the second round.<ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/> However, Riva's season was ended prematurely by a serious injury which he endured in a European qualifying match with the Italian national team in late October; in his absence, Cagliari were soon eliminated from the European Cup in the round of 16, and dropped down the domestic table, eventually finishing the season in seventh place. After recovering from his injury, Riva managed 21 goals in 30 games during the [[1971\u201372 Serie A|1971\u201372 season]], finishing the season as the second highest goalscorer in the league, and helping Cagliari to a fourth-place finish and a spot in the next season's [[1972\u201373 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]].<ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/> With the departure of Scopigno, Cagliari's results declined during the next two seasons, with the club only managing low mid-table finishes, although Riva's goalscoring output still remained consistent, as he scored 12 goals during [[1972\u201373 Serie A|1972\u201373 season]], and 15 during the [[1973\u201374 Serie A|1973\u201374 season]]. Despite having already established himself as a world class player, while Cagliari struggled in the league during the mid 70s, Riva remained loyal to the Sardinian side, and turned down many bids from larger clubs, in particular from northern Italy. During his time with Cagliari, he demonstrated his attachment to the club when he refused several lucrative offers from Serie A giants Juventus in order to remain in the Sardinian capital, despite numerous rumours in the press which stated that he had already signed with the Turin side in exchange for large, record-breaking sums and several of their own players.<ref name=\"WS\"/><ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/><ref name=\"storiedicalcio.altervista.org\"/><ref name=\"I 70 anni di Gigi Riva, la leggenda\"/><ref name=\"Questi 60 anni duri e felici\"/><ref name=\"70 anni di gol\"/>\n\nDespite his talent and goalscoring prowess, Riva's career was blighted by several major injuries, in particular with the Italian national side, and which greatly limited his playing time in later seasons; he missed 35 games in the five seasons leading up to 1971, and only appeared in 24 matches for Cagliari between 1974 and 1976, which saw an overall decline to his goalscoring rate and the club's performances during this period. During the [[1974\u201375 Serie A|1974\u201375 season]], a calf injury limited him to 8 appearances and 2 goals with the club, and on 1 February 1976, while playing in a match for Cagliari against [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], Riva ruptured a tendon and tore an adductor muscle in his right thigh, following a physical shoulder challenge near the corner flag from [[Aldo Bet]], after being chased down by the Milan defender; he never successfully recovered and, despite several comeback attempts over the next year and a half, was eventually forced to retire in 1978, at the age of 33, having played his last game at the age of 31 in 1976. The injury limited Riva to only 15 appearances during the [[1975\u201376 Serie A]] season; despite his run of six goals in a span of eight games during the final season of his career, Cagliari finished in last place in the league in his absence, and were relegated to Serie B.<ref name=\"enciclopediadelcalcio\"/><ref name=\"Riva, the Italian roar of thunder\"/><ref name=\"forzaitalianfootball\"/><ref name=\"Riva, fortuna e disgrazia\"/><ref name=eroi>{{cite web|url=http://storiedicalcio.altervista.org/blog/brera_riva.html|title=Gianni Brera: \"Per gli eroi autentici non si guasti il ricordo\"|publisher=Storie di Calcio|language=Italian|author1=Gianni Brera|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref> In total, Riva scored 248 goals for club and country throughout his career in 439 appearances,<ref name=\"I 70 anni di Gigi Riva, la leggenda\"/><ref name=\"70 anni di gol\"/> scoring 164 league goals with Cagliari in 315 appearances, 156 of which came in 289 Serie A appearances.

This browning is the result of a [[Maillard reaction]], altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. Toasting is a common method of making [[Staling|stale bread]] more [[palatability|palatable]]. Bread is often toasted using a ''[[toaster]]'', but [[toaster oven]]s are also used. Though many types of bread can be toasted the most commonly used is \"sliced bread\", referring to bread that is already sliced and bagged upon purchase and may be white, brown, multigrain, etc.\n\nToast is commonly eaten with [[butter]] or [[margarine]], and sweetened toppings, such as [[jam]] or [[Fruit preserve#Jelly|jelly]]. Regionally, savory spreads, such as [[peanut butter]] or [[yeast]] extracts, may also be popular. When buttered, toast may also be served as an accompaniment to savory dishes, especially soups or stews, or topped with heartier ingredients like eggs or [[baked beans]] as a light meal. Toast is a common [[breakfast food]]. While slices of bread are most common, [[bagel]]s and [[English muffin]]s are also toasted.\n\nScientific studies in the early 2000s found that toast may contain [[Carcinogen#Carcinogens in prepared food|carcinogen]]s ([[acrylamide]]) caused by the [[Food browning|browning process]].<ref name=\"tareke\" />\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"toast\", which means \"sliced bread singed by heat\", derives from the Latin ''torrere'', \"to burn\".<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The first reference to toast in print is in a recipe for Oyle Soppys (flavoured onions stewed in a gallon of stale beer and a pint of oil) that dates from 1430.<ref name=PhraseFinder>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-toast-of-the-town.html|title=The toast of the town|author=Martin, Gary |website=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> In the 1400s and 1500s, toast was discarded or eaten after it was used as a flavoring for drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In the 1600s, toast was still thought of as something to be put into drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In his 1602 play ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', Shakespeare gives [[Falstaff]] the line: \"Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/html/Wiv.html|title=The Merry Wives of Windsor|last=Shakespeare|first=William|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Mowat|editor-first=Barbara A.|location=|pages=125|chapter=Act 3, Scene 5|editor-last2=Werstine|editor-first2=Paul}}</ref> By the 1700s, there were references to \"toast\" as a gesture that indicates sexual attraction for a person: \"Ay, Madam, it has been your Life's whole Pride of late to be the Common Toast of every Publick Table.\"<ref name=PhraseFinder/> Toast has been used as an element of American [[haute cuisine]] since at least the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/toast-has-been-a-fad-for-150-years/#fn-1 |title=Toast Has Been A Fad For 150 Years |author=Barry-Jester, Anna Maria |date=March 29, 2016 |work=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Toaster.jpg|thumb|left|A classic two-slot toaster]]\nIn a modern home [[kitchen]], the usual method of toasting bread is by the use of a [[toaster]], an electrical appliance made for that purpose. To use a modern toaster, sliced bread is placed into the narrow slots on the top of the toaster, the toaster is tuned to the correct setting (some may have more elaborate settings than others) and a lever on the front or side is pushed down. The toast is ready when the lever pops up along with the toast. If the bread is insufficiently toasted, the [[lever]] can be pressed down again.\n\nBread toasted in a conventional toaster can \"sweat\" when it is served (i.e. water collects on the surface of the cooled toast). This occurs because moisture in the bread becomes steam while being toasted due to heat and when cooled the steam condenses into water droplets on the surface of the bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110015314/http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-01-10| website=www.toaster.org| publisher=The Toaster Museum Foundation| accessdate=14 January 2017| date=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIt can also be toasted by a conveyor toaster, which device is often used in hotels, [[restaurants]], and other food service locations. It works by having one [[heating element]] on the top and one on the bottom with a [[metal]] [[conveyor belt]] in the middle which carries the toast between the two heating elements. This allows toast to be made consistently as more slices can be added at any time without waiting for previous ones to pop up.\n\nBread can also be toasted under a [[grilling|grill]] (or broiler), in an open [[oven]], or lying on an oven rack. This \"oven toast\" is usually buttered before toasting. [[Toaster#Types|Toaster oven]]s are special small appliances made for toasting bread or for heating small amounts of other [[food]]s.\n\nBread can also be toasted by holding it near but not directly over an open flame, such as a [[campfire]] or [[fireplace]]; special toasting utensils (e.g. toasting [[fork]]s) are made for this purpose. Before the invention of modern cooking appliances such as toasters and grills, bread has been produced in ovens for millennia, toast can be made in the same oven.\n\nMany brands of [[sliced bread|ready sliced]] bread are available, some of which specifically market their suitability for toasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodbev.com/news/kingsmill-launches-loaf-of-bread-designed-specifically-for-toasting/|title=Kingsmill launches loaf of bread designed specifically for toasting|last=Desk|first=News|date=2016-11-08|website=FoodBev Media|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Consumption==\n{{anchor|Use}}\n[[File:Vegemite and jelly.jpg|thumb|right|Left: Toast with butter and [[vegemite]].

Toast with [[jam]] or [[marmalade]] is popular. A few other condiments that can be enjoyed with toast are chocolate spread, cream cheese, and peanut butter. [[Yeast extract]]s such as [[Marmite]] in the UK, New Zealand and South Africa, and [[Vegemite]] in Australia are national traditions.

This browning is the result of a [[Maillard reaction]], altering the flavor of the bread and making it firmer so that it is easier to spread toppings on it. Toasting is a common method of making [[Staling|stale bread]] more [[palatability|palatable]]. Bread is often toasted using a ''[[toaster]]'', but [[toaster oven]]s are also used. Though many types of bread can be toasted the most commonly used is \"sliced bread\", referring to bread that is already sliced and bagged upon purchase and may be white, brown, multigrain, etc.\n\nToast is commonly eaten with [[butter]] or [[margarine]], and sweetened toppings, such as [[jam]] or [[Fruit preserve#Jelly|jelly]]. Regionally, savory spreads, such as [[peanut butter]] or [[yeast]] extracts, may also be popular. When buttered, toast may also be served as an accompaniment to savory dishes, especially soups or stews, or topped with heartier ingredients like eggs or [[baked beans]] as a light meal. Toast is a common [[breakfast food]]. While slices of bread are most common, [[bagel]]s and [[English muffin]]s are also toasted.\n\nScientific studies in the early 2000s found that toast may contain [[Carcinogen#Carcinogens in prepared food|carcinogen]]s ([[acrylamide]]) caused by the [[Food browning|browning process]].<ref name=\"tareke\" />\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"toast\", which means \"sliced bread singed by heat\", derives from the Latin ''torrere'', \"to burn\".<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The first reference to toast in print is in a recipe for Oyle Soppys (flavoured onions stewed in a gallon of stale beer and a pint of oil) that dates from 1430.<ref name=PhraseFinder>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/the-toast-of-the-town.html|title=The toast of the town|author=Martin, Gary |website=phrases.org.uk|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref> In the 1400s and 1500s, toast was discarded or eaten after it was used as a flavoring for drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In the 1600s, toast was still thought of as something to be put into drinks.<ref name=PhraseFinder/> In his 1602 play ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'', Shakespeare gives [[Falstaff]] the line: \"Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.folgerdigitaltexts.org/html/Wiv.html|title=The Merry Wives of Windsor|last=Shakespeare|first=William|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Mowat|editor-first=Barbara A.|location=|pages=125|chapter=Act 3, Scene 5|editor-last2=Werstine|editor-first2=Paul}}</ref> By the 1700s, there were references to \"toast\" as a gesture that indicates sexual attraction for a person: \"Ay, Madam, it has been your Life's whole Pride of late to be the Common Toast of every Publick Table.\"<ref name=PhraseFinder/> Toast has been used as an element of American [[haute cuisine]] since at least the 1850s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/toast-has-been-a-fad-for-150-years/#fn-1 |title=Toast Has Been A Fad For 150 Years |author=Barry-Jester, Anna Maria |date=March 29, 2016 |work=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=March 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:Toaster.jpg|thumb|left|A classic two-slot toaster]]\nIn a modern home [[kitchen]], the usual method of toasting bread is by the use of a [[toaster]], an electrical appliance made for that purpose. To use a modern toaster, sliced bread is placed into the narrow slots on the top of the toaster, the toaster is tuned to the correct setting (some may have more elaborate settings than others) and a lever on the front or side is pushed down. The toast is ready when the lever pops up along with the toast. If the bread is insufficiently toasted, the [[lever]] can be pressed down again.\n\nBread toasted in a conventional toaster can \"sweat\" when it is served (i.e. water collects on the surface of the cooled toast). This occurs because moisture in the bread becomes steam while being toasted due to heat and when cooled the steam condenses into water droplets on the surface of the bread.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110015314/http://www.toaster.org/faq.html#10|url-status=dead|archive-date=2017-01-10| website=www.toaster.org| publisher=The Toaster Museum Foundation| accessdate=14 January 2017| date=2017-01-10}}</ref>\n\nIt can also be toasted by a conveyor toaster, which device is often used in hotels, [[restaurants]], and other food service locations. It works by having one [[heating element]] on the top and one on the bottom with a [[metal]] [[conveyor belt]] in the middle which carries the toast between the two heating elements. This allows toast to be made consistently as more slices can be added at any time without waiting for previous ones to pop up.\n\nBread can also be toasted under a [[grilling|grill]] (or broiler), in an open [[oven]], or lying on an oven rack. This \"oven toast\" is usually buttered before toasting. [[Toaster#Types|Toaster oven]]s are special small appliances made for toasting bread or for heating small amounts of other [[food]]s.\n\nBread can also be toasted by holding it near but not directly over an open flame, such as a [[campfire]] or [[fireplace]]; special toasting utensils (e.g. toasting [[fork]]s) are made for this purpose. Before the invention of modern cooking appliances such as toasters and grills, bread has been produced in ovens for millennia, toast can be made in the same oven.\n\nMany brands of [[sliced bread|ready sliced]] bread are available, some of which specifically market their suitability for toasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foodbev.com/news/kingsmill-launches-loaf-of-bread-designed-specifically-for-toasting/|title=Kingsmill launches loaf of bread designed specifically for toasting|last=Desk|first=News|date=2016-11-08|website=FoodBev Media|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Consumption==\n{{anchor|Use}}\n[[File:Vegemite and jelly.jpg|thumb|right|Left: Toast with butter and [[vegemite]].

Toast with [[jam]] or [[marmalade]] is popular. A few other condiments that can be enjoyed with toast are chocolate spread, cream cheese, and peanut butter. [[Yeast extract]]s such as [[Marmite]] in the UK, New Zealand and South Africa, and [[Vegemite]] in Australia are national traditions.

The plan was accepted by the Jewish Agency, and rejected by Arab leaders. The following year, the Jewish Agency declared the independence of the State of Israel, and the subsequent 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War saw Israel's establishment over most of the former Mandate territory, while the West Bank and Gaza were held by neighboring Arab states. Israel has since fought several wars with Arab countries, and since the Six-Day War in 1967 held occupied territories including the West Bank, Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip (still considered occupied after the 2005 disengagement, although some legal experts dispute this claim). It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is the world's longest military occupation in modern times. Efforts to resolve the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict have not resulted in a final peace agreement. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have been signed. On 15 November 1988, Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), in Algiers proclaimed the establishment of the State of Palestine. A year after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the Palestinian National Authority was formed to govern the areas A and B in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gaza would later be ruled by Hamas in 2007, two years after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The [[State of Palestine]] is recognised by 138 UN members and since 2012 has a status of a non-member observer state in the United Nations \u2013 which implies recognition of statehood. It is a member of the Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, G77, and the International Olympic Committee and other international bodies.\n|-\n| County\n| colspan=\"3\"|<center>There are 117 [[autonomous counties of the People's Republic of China]]</center>\n|-\n| District council\n| There are 25 [[Autonomous administrative divisions of India|autonomous district councils in India]]\n|{{Flag|India}}\n| Autonomous district councils are formed under the provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India\n|-\n| Island\n| [[Tobago]]\n| {{Flag|Trinidad and Tobago}}\n| The [[Tobago House of Assembly]] is an autonomous legislature that is responsible for the island of [[Tobago]].<ref name=\"VisitTobago\">[http://www.visittobago.gov.tt/load_page.asp?id=41 Tobago Division Of Tourism - About Tobago, Governance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710212503/http://www.visittobago.gov.tt/load_page.asp?id=41 |date=2007-07-10 }}</ref>\n|-\n| Okrug\n| colspan=\"3\"|<center>There are 6 [[autonomous okrugs of Russia]]</center>\n|-\n| [[Autonomous oblast|Oblast]]\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.svg}} [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]\n| {{flag|Russia}}\n|\n|-\n| Prefecture\n| colspan=\"3\"|<center>There are 30 [[autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China]]</center>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\" |Province\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of Jejudo.svg}} [[Jeju Province|Jeju]]\n| {{flag|Republic of Korea}}\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|''Kosovo and Metohija'']]\n| Claimed by:<br />{{flag|Serbia}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|In 2008, the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]] declared independence.

[[Gibraltar]] is a self-governing [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territory of the UK]]. Most of the other 13 British Overseas Territories also have autonomy in internal affairs through local legislatures.\n\n;New Zealand dependent territories\n\n[[New Zealand]] maintains nominal sovereignty over three [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island]] nations. The [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] are self-governing countries in [[freely associated state|free association]] with New Zealand that maintain some international relationships in their own name. [[Tokelau]] remains an autonomous dependency of New Zealand. The [[Chatham Islands]]\u2014despite having the designation of ''Territory''\u2014is an integral part of the country, situated within the New Zealand archipelago. The territory's council is not autonomous and has broadly the same powers as other local councils, although notably it can also charge levies on goods entering or leaving the islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0041/latest/DLM367666.html|title=Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 No 41 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act Contents \u2013 New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}</ref>\n\n;Dutch constituent countries\n\n[[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and [[Sint Maarten]] are autonomous countries within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], each with their own parliament. In addition they enjoy autonomy in taxation matters as well as having their own currencies.\n\n;French overseas collectivities, New Caledonia, and Corsica\n{{main|Overseas collectivities}}\nThe French constitution recognises three autonomous jurisdictions. [[Corsica]], a [[region of France]], enjoys a greater degree of autonomy on matters such as tax and education compared to mainland regions. [[New Caledonia]], a ''sui generis'' collectivity, and [[French Polynesia]], an [[overseas collectivity]], are highly autonomous territories with their own government, legislature, currency and constitution. They do not, however, have legislative powers for policy areas relating to law and order, defense, border control or university education. Other smaller overseas collectivities have a lesser degree of autonomy through local legislatures. The five overseas regions, [[French Guiana]], [[Guadaloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]] and [[R\u00e9union]], are generally governed the same as mainland regions; however, they enjoy some additional powers, including certain legislative powers for devolved areas.\n\n===Ethiopian special woredas===\nIn [[Ethiopia]], \"special woredas\" are a subgroup of ''[[woreda]]s'' (districts) that are organized around the traditional homelands of an [[Demographics of Ethiopia|ethnic]] minority, and are outside the usual hierarchy of a ''[[Regions of Ethiopia|kilil]]'', or region.

The plan was accepted by the Jewish Agency, and rejected by Arab leaders. The following year, the Jewish Agency declared the independence of the State of Israel, and the subsequent 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War saw Israel's establishment over most of the former Mandate territory, while the West Bank and Gaza were held by neighboring Arab states. Israel has since fought several wars with Arab countries, and since the Six-Day War in 1967 held occupied territories including the West Bank, Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip (still considered occupied after the 2005 disengagement, although some legal experts dispute this claim). It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem, but not the West Bank. Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories is the world's longest military occupation in modern times. Efforts to resolve the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict have not resulted in a final peace agreement. However, peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have been signed. On 15 November 1988, Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), in Algiers proclaimed the establishment of the State of Palestine. A year after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the Palestinian National Authority was formed to govern the areas A and B in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Gaza would later be ruled by Hamas in 2007, two years after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The [[State of Palestine]] is recognised by 138 UN members and since 2012 has a status of a non-member observer state in the United Nations \u2013 which implies recognition of statehood. It is a member of the Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, G77, and the International Olympic Committee and other international bodies.\n|-\n| County\n| colspan=\"3\"|<center>There are 117 [[autonomous counties of the People's Republic of China]]</center>\n|-\n| District council\n| There are 25 [[Autonomous administrative divisions of India|autonomous district councils in India]]\n|{{Flag|India}}\n| Autonomous district councils are formed under the provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India\n|-\n| Island\n| [[Tobago]]\n| {{Flag|Trinidad and Tobago}}\n| The [[Tobago House of Assembly]] is an autonomous legislature that is responsible for the island of [[Tobago]].<ref name=\"VisitTobago\">[http://www.visittobago.gov.tt/load_page.asp?id=41 Tobago Division Of Tourism - About Tobago, Governance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710212503/http://www.visittobago.gov.tt/load_page.asp?id=41 |date=2007-07-10 }}</ref>\n|-\n| Okrug\n| colspan=\"3\"|<center>There are 6 [[autonomous okrugs of Russia]]</center>\n|-\n| [[Autonomous oblast|Oblast]]\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.svg}} [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]\n| {{flag|Russia}}\n|\n|-\n| Prefecture\n| colspan=\"3\"|<center>There are 30 [[autonomous prefectures of the People's Republic of China]]</center>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\" |Province\n| {{flagicon image|Flag of Jejudo.svg}} [[Jeju Province|Jeju]]\n| {{flag|Republic of Korea}}\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|[[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|''Kosovo and Metohija'']]\n| Claimed by:<br />{{flag|Serbia}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|In 2008, the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]] declared independence.

[[Gibraltar]] is a self-governing [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territory of the UK]]. Most of the other 13 British Overseas Territories also have autonomy in internal affairs through local legislatures.\n\n;New Zealand dependent territories\n\n[[New Zealand]] maintains nominal sovereignty over three [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island]] nations. The [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] are self-governing countries in [[freely associated state|free association]] with New Zealand that maintain some international relationships in their own name. [[Tokelau]] remains an autonomous dependency of New Zealand. The [[Chatham Islands]]\u2014despite having the designation of ''Territory''\u2014is an integral part of the country, situated within the New Zealand archipelago. The territory's council is not autonomous and has broadly the same powers as other local councils, although notably it can also charge levies on goods entering or leaving the islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0041/latest/DLM367666.html|title=Chatham Islands Council Act 1995 No 41 (as at 01 July 2013), Public Act Contents \u2013 New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz}}</ref>\n\n;Dutch constituent countries\n\n[[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and [[Sint Maarten]] are autonomous countries within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], each with their own parliament. In addition they enjoy autonomy in taxation matters as well as having their own currencies.\n\n;French overseas collectivities, New Caledonia, and Corsica\n{{main article|Overseas collectivities}}\nThe French constitution recognises three autonomous jurisdictions. [[Corsica]], a [[region of France]], enjoys a greater degree of autonomy on matters such as tax and education compared to mainland regions. [[New Caledonia]], a ''sui generis'' collectivity, and [[French Polynesia]], an [[overseas collectivity]], are highly autonomous territories with their own government, legislature, currency and constitution. They do not, however, have legislative powers for policy areas relating to law and order, defense, border control or university education. Other smaller overseas collectivities have a lesser degree of autonomy through local legislatures. The five overseas regions, [[French Guiana]], [[Guadaloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]] and [[R\u00e9union]], are generally governed the same as mainland regions; however, they enjoy some additional powers, including certain legislative powers for devolved areas.\n\n===Ethiopian special woredas===\nIn [[Ethiopia]], \"special woredas\" are a subgroup of ''[[woreda]]s'' (districts) that are organized around the traditional homelands of an [[Demographics of Ethiopia|ethnic]] minority, and are outside the usual hierarchy of a ''[[Regions of Ethiopia|kilil]]'', or region.

It was released by Hudson for the [[PC Engine]] in Japan on {{start date|1989|11|17}}. It was then released by [[NEC]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in North America in 1990. It was re-released for the [[Virtual Console]] service worldwide for the [[Wii]] in 2007 and in Japan for the [[Wii U]] on April 16, 2014; it was re-released for the [[PlayStation Network]] in Japan in 2010 and in North America in 2011. The game takes place in the land of Neutopia, where the evil demon Dirth has captured Princess Aurora and has stolen the eight ancient medallions which contain the wisdom and power necessary to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the land. It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people.\n\n''Neutopia'' is widely regarded as a clone of the popular [[Nintendo]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in nearly every aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over ''Zelda'', but various shortcomings \u2013 which include long [[password (video games)|password]]s unless the system is used in conjunction with an add-on providing battery-backed RAM, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection \u2013 prevent the game from being superior to the 1986 Nintendo title.

widely regarded ''Neutopia'' as a clone of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. The PC Engine version of the game was reviewed in the February 1990 issue of German magazine Power Play, where reviewer Martin Gaksch called the game \"''Zelda'' on the PC-Engine\" and said that the \"differences between ''Zelda'' and ''Neutopia'' must be found with an [[electron microscope]]\". They said that the graphics, music, and gameplay were good, and that the only thing that kept ''Neutopia'' from being superior to ''Zelda'' was the 24-character password system and that the text was in Japanese.<ref name=\"Gaksch\" /> \n\n''Neutopia'' received much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew comparisons to ''Zelda''. Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that ''Neutopia'' was released two years before ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and said that ''Neutopia'' \"kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve\". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that \"the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield\", but he noted that the things that keep the game from being better than ''Zelda'' were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several \"head-scratching moments\" which include references to [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] as well as quotes from ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"Romano\" /> Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to ''Zelda'', including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from ''Zelda'' are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying ''Zelda'', might be better as it added additional features that set it apart.<ref name=\"vanDuyn\" /> [[Destructoid]]'s Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of ''Zelda'' to ''[[China Warrior]]''{{'}}s copying of ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'', and he pointed out what are also considered ''Zelda'' clones such as ''[[Crusader of Centy]]'' and ''[[Alundra]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ponce |first=Tony |title=Off-Brand Games: ''Neutopia'' |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |url=http://www.destructoid.com/off-brand-games-neutopia-174343.phtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529094805/http://www.destructoid.com/off-brand-games-neutopia-174343.phtml |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[GameSpot]]'s Austin Shau reviewed ''Neutopia'' in November 2007 and said progression through the game was \"quick and direct\" but was also more linear, unlike with ''Zelda''. He praised the game for its variety of environments, which he said \"helps to combat monotony\", but he noted the lack of detail in the graphics itself. He also criticized the game's sound, in which he said the background music was a series of \"grating instrumentations\" while also pointing out the low-quality TurboGrafx-16 sound chip.<ref name=\"Shau\" /> [[IGN]]'s Lucas Thomas called ''Neutopia'' \"one of the most shameless ''Legend of Zelda'' clones ever created\" in nearly every aspect. He praised one of the differences in the presence of the fire rod, which he said \"is unlike any weapon the 8-bit Link ever wielded\"; he also noted the clean, crisp graphics and a good quality soundtrack. However, he criticized another difference from ''Zelda'', that ''Neutopia'' had poor collision detection, saying that it can lead to additional damage to Jazeta, which causes the power of the fire rod to decrease and lead to the annoying \"beeping sound\" just as in ''Zelda''. In general, Thomas said that, despite its lack of originality, ''Neutopia'' is a good TurboGrafx-16 game which has deserved all the praise it has received.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n*{{cite book |title=Neutopia ''Instruction Manual'' |publisher=[[NEC]] |year=1990 |id=TGM042039057M |ref=manual}}\n*{{cite video game |title=Neutopia |developer=[[Hudson Soft]] |publisher=[[NEC]] |date=1990 |platform=[[TurboGrafx-16]] |ref=game}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=/neutopia|name=''Neutopia''}}\n\n[[Category:1989 video games]]\n[[Category:Action-adventure games]]\n[[Category:Fantasy video games]]\n[[Category:Hudson Soft games]]\n[[Category:Konami franchises]]\n[[Category:TurboGrafx-16 games]]\n[[Category:Video game clones]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Futurama episode|Neutopia (Futurama)}}\n{{good article}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Neutopia\n|image = Neutopia boxart.jpg\n|caption = North American [[TurboGrafx-16]] cover art\n|developer = [[Hudson Soft]]\n|publisher = Hudson Soft <small>(PC Engine)</small><br />[[NEC]] <small>(TurboGrafx-16)</small>\n|platforms = [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[PC Engine]], [[Virtual Console]], [[PlayStation Network]]\n|released = {{collapsible list|title={{start date|1989|11|17}}|'''PC Engine'''/'''TurboGrafx-16'''<br />{{Video game release|JP|{{Start date|1989|11|17}}|NA|1990}} '''Wii Virtual Console'''<br />{{Video game release|JP|{{Start date|2007|5|1}}|NA|{{Start date|2007|8|20}}|EU|{{Start date|2007|8|24}}}} '''PlayStation Network'''<br />{{Video game release|JP|{{Start date|2010|6|16}}|NA|{{Start date|2011|4|19}}}}'''Wii U Virtual Console'''<br />{{Video game release|JP|{{Start date|2014|4|16}}}}{{Video game release|NA|{{Start date|2017|3|2}}}}{{Video game release|EU|{{Start date|2017|3|16}}}}\n}}\n|genre = [[Action-adventure game|Action-adventure]]\n|modes = [[Single player]]\n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Neutopia'''''|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30a2|Ny\u016btopia}} is an [[overhead perspective|overhead]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure video game]] developed by [[Hudson Soft]]. It was released by Hudson for the [[PC Engine]] in Japan on {{start date|1989|11|17}}. It was then released by [[NEC]] for the [[TurboGrafx-16]] in North America in 1990. It was re-released for the [[Virtual Console]] service worldwide for the [[Wii]] in 2007 and in Japan for the [[Wii U]] on April 16, 2014; it was re-released for the [[PlayStation Network]] in Japan in 2010 and in North America in 2011. The game takes place in the land of Neutopia, where the evil demon Dirth has captured Princess Aurora and has stolen the eight ancient medallions which contain the wisdom and power necessary to maintain peace and prosperity throughout the land. It is up to the protagonist Jazeta to retrieve the eight medallions, defeat Dirth, rescue Princess Aurora, and save the land and its people.\n\n''Neutopia'' is widely regarded as a clone of the popular [[Nintendo]] game ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' in nearly every aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over ''Zelda'', but various shortcomings \u2013 which include long [[password (video games)|password]]s unless the system is used in conjunction with an add-on providing battery-backed RAM, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection \u2013 prevent the game from being superior to the 1986 Nintendo title. But overall, reviewers have called ''Neutopia'' one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library. There would eventually be a sequel to the game ''[[Neutopia II|Neutopia&nbsp;II]]'', in which Jazeta disappears and his son sets out to find him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/826/826761p1.html|title=Neutopia II Review|last=Thomas|first=Lucas M.|date=2007-10-12|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2011-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325200558/http://wii.ign.com/articles/826/826761p1.html|archive-date=2012-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''Neutopia'' takes place in the distant past in the land of Neutopia \u2013 a prosperous and peaceful land in which the people worshipped at a Sacred Shrine and were watched over by Princess Aurora.<ref name=\"Manual1\">[[#manual|Instruction manual]], p. 1.</ref> The land was divided into four contiguous areas called spheres: land, subterrain, sea, and sky.<ref name=\"4spheres\" /> The people lived in prosperity and happiness with the help of eight spiritual medallions which were controlled by the Princess and were used for good;<ref name=\"EvilEnds\">[[#game|''Neutopia'']], land sphere. \"'''Man''': Evil is everywhere now that Dirth has captured the powers of the medallions.

widely regarded ''Neutopia'' as a clone of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. The PC Engine version of the game was reviewed in the February 1990 issue of German magazine Power Play, where reviewer Martin Gaksch called the game \"''Zelda'' on the PC-Engine\" and said that the \"differences between ''Zelda'' and ''Neutopia'' must be found with an [[electron microscope]]\". They said that the graphics, music, and gameplay were good, and that the only thing that kept ''Neutopia'' from being superior to ''Zelda'' was the 24-character password system and that the text was in Japanese.<ref name=\"Gaksch\" /> \n\n''Neutopia'' received much coverage from various video gaming websites after its release on the Virtual Console, and each drew comparisons to ''Zelda''. Adam Romano from Defunct Games noted that ''Neutopia'' was released two years before ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and said that ''Neutopia'' \"kept pace with or were actually ahead of the Nintendo curve\". He said that gameplay and backgrounds remain varied and that \"the fire rod weapon is especially fun to wield\", but he noted that the things that keep the game from being better than ''Zelda'' were repetitive and frustrating dungeon exploring, boring boss battles, long passwords (for those who do not own a TurboGrafx-CD), and several \"head-scratching moments\" which include references to [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] as well as quotes from ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"Romano\" /> Marcel van Duyn from Nintendo Life noted many similarities to ''Zelda'', including the existence of 8 dungeons and medallions, the need to blow up walls or burn bushes to uncover secrets, the dungeon designs, and the need to push blocks to uncover staircases. However, he noted that what sets it apart from ''Zelda'' are the fire rod, the ability to warp with wings, and a lower difficulty level. He concluded that the game, while copying ''Zelda'', might be better as it added additional features that set it apart.<ref name=\"vanDuyn\" /> [[Destructoid]]'s Tony Ponce compared the game's copying of ''Zelda'' to ''[[China Warrior]]''{{'}}s copying of ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung-Fu Master]]'', and he pointed out what are also considered ''Zelda'' clones such as ''[[Crusader of Centy]]'' and ''[[Alundra]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ponce |first=Tony |title=Off-Brand Games: ''Neutopia'' |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |accessdate=May 20, 2011 |url=http://www.destructoid.com/off-brand-games-neutopia-174343.phtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529094805/http://www.destructoid.com/off-brand-games-neutopia-174343.phtml |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[GameSpot]]'s Austin Shau reviewed ''Neutopia'' in November 2007 and said progression through the game was \"quick and direct\" but was also more linear, unlike with ''Zelda''. He praised the game for its variety of environments, which he said \"helps to combat monotony\", but he noted the lack of detail in the graphics itself. He also criticized the game's sound, in which he said the background music was a series of \"grating instrumentations\" while also pointing out the low-quality TurboGrafx-16 sound chip.<ref name=\"Shau\" /> [[IGN]]'s Lucas Thomas called ''Neutopia'' \"one of the most shameless ''Legend of Zelda'' clones ever created\" in nearly every aspect. He praised one of the differences in the presence of the fire rod, which he said \"is unlike any weapon the 8-bit Link ever wielded\"; he also noted the clean, crisp graphics and a good quality soundtrack. However, he criticized another difference from ''Zelda'', that ''Neutopia'' had poor collision detection, saying that it can lead to additional damage to Jazeta, which causes the power of the fire rod to decrease and lead to the annoying \"beeping sound\" just as in ''Zelda''. In general, Thomas said that, despite its lack of originality, ''Neutopia'' is a good TurboGrafx-16 game which has deserved all the praise it has received.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n*{{cite book |title=Neutopia ''Instruction Manual'' |publisher=[[NEC]] |year=1990 |id=TGM042039057M |ref=manual}}\n*{{cite video game |title=Neutopia |developer=[[Hudson Soft]] |publisher=[[NEC]] |date=1990 |platform=[[TurboGrafx-16]] |ref=game}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=/neutopia|name=''Neutopia''}}\n\n[[Category:1989 video games]]\n[[Category:Action-adventure games]]\n[[Category:Fantasy video games]]\n[[Category:Hudson Soft games]]\n[[Category:Konami franchises]]\n[[Category:TurboGrafx-16 games]]\n[[Category:Video game clones]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games for Wii U]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n", "name_user": "Mausmalone", "label": "safe", "comment": "added missing comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutopia"}
