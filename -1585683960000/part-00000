The NES restarted the [[video game industry]] after the [[video game crash of 1983]], and was an international success. In 1989, Nintendo released the [[Game Boy]], which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers. In the early 1990s, Nintendo's market lead began to decrease; although the 1990 [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES) was a strong seller, the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] was a very strong contender. Nintendo and [[Sega]] would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s, as [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] became the most popular console, beating the [[Nintendo 64]], though Nintendo managed to sell more than [[Sega Saturn]].\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]], released in 1999, [[PlayStation 2]], released in 2000, and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], released in 2001, would eventually relegate Nintendo to third place in the international market, despite the release of the [[GameCube]]. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the [[Game Boy Color]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] models. Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen ([[Nintendo DS|DS]]) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the [[Wii]]); they became some of the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling consoles]] of all time. In 2010, Nintendo became the first major company to release a handheld game console with [[stereoscopic 3D]] capabilities, with the [[Nintendo 3DS|3DS]], which had very strong sales from the beginning. The [[Wii U]], released in 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted. The company's most recent console, [[Nintendo Switch]], was released in March 2017 and has now surpassed the entire lifetime sales of the Wii U.\n== Home consoles ==\n\n=== Color TV-Game ===\n{{Main|Color TV-Game}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Color-TV-Game-Blockbreaker-FL.jpg|thumb|One of five [[Color TV-Game]] consoles|215px]]The [[Color TV-Game]] is a series of five dedicated home consoles released only in Japan.

In Japan, it is known as the \"Family Computer\" (or \"Famicom\", as it is commonly abbreviated). Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the [[video game crash of 1983]] and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from [[game design]] to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted [[third-party developer]]s. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' and ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]''<!-- NOT the Mario series, which was started in arcades in Donkey Kong, and not Kirby, which was started on the GameBoy --> were started on the NES. Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October 31, 2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0710/16/news102.html|script-title=ja:\u521d\u4ee3\u300c\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3\u300d\u306a\u3069\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u7406\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u7d42\u4e86|accessdate=January 20, 2008|author=|date=October 16, 2007|work=ITmedia News|publisher=ITmedia|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |title=Nintendo of Japan dropping Hardware support for the Famicom |accessdate=January 20, 2008 |author=RyanDG |date=October 16, 2007 |publisher=Arcade Renaissance |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317164110/http://www.arcade-renaissance.com/2007/10/nintendo-of-japan-dropping-hardware.html |archivedate=March 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nintendo's classic Famicom faces end of road |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |format=Reprint |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=October 31, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105193128/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAJfrC1k8lDKLOCGJu4VonjOYxBg |archivedate=November 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nNintendo released a software-emulation-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System on November 10, 2016.

In [[Japan]] it is known as the '''Super Famicom'''. In [[South Korea]], it is known as the '''Super Comboy''' and was distributed by [[Hyundai Electronics]].\n\nThe Super NES was Nintendo's second home console, following the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. Whereas the earlier console had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of [[Asia]], the Super NES was a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and [[North America]]\u2014due in part to increased competition from [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console (released in Europe and Asia but Korea as the Mega Drive). Despite its relatively late start, the Super NES became the best selling console of the [[16-bit era]], selling 49.10 million systems worldwide.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/> The Super NES library is known for upgrading some of Nintendo's most famous franchises, and making the games even more critically acclaimed, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VI|VI]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and ''[[Super Mario World]]'', as well starting some popular franchises such as ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]'' and ''[[Mega Man X]]''.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo 64 ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 64}}\n[[File:N64-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|A [[Nintendo 64]]|215px]]\nReleased June 23, 1996, The '''Nintendo 64''', commonly called the '''N64''', and codenamed Ultra 64, was Nintendo's third home [[video game console]] for the international market.

Until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] 2000, the design project was known as ''Dolphin''\u2014this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than [[game cartridge]]s. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the [[Panasonic Q]], which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Star Fox Adventures]]'', while new franchises like ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Pikmin]]'' were born, although the former franchise had seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.

Until the console's unveiling at [[SpaceWorld]] 2000, the design project was known as ''Dolphin''\u2014this can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use [[optical disc]]s rather than [[game cartridge]]s. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the [[Panasonic Q]], which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker]]'', ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Star Fox Adventures]]'', while new franchises like ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Pikmin]]'' were born, although the former franchise had seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64.

Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \"GAME A\" and a \"GAME B\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Game Boy ===\n{{Main|Game Boy}}\n[[File:Game-Boy-Original.png|thumb|An original [[Game Boy]]|115px]]\nThe '''Game Boy''' was the first [[handheld game console]] sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the [[Game & Watch]] that had a different system for each game.

Most video games are forced to use [[Depth perception|monocular cues]] to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a [[head-mounted display]], the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for ''Virtual Boy'' in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by [[Nintendo]], however it is seen through microgames in ''[[Wario (series)#WarioWare|WarioWare]]'' games.

As of December 31, 2013, Nintendo DSi consoles have sold 41.33 million units.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo 3DS ===\n{{Main|Nintendo 3DS}}\n[[File:Nintendo-3DS-AquaOpen.png|thumb|right|An original [[Nintendo 3DS]]|215px]]\nAlthough the name and look of the device are similar to that of the DS series, the '''Nintendo 3DS''' (or shortly '''3DS''') is the successor to the DS and a brand new console. The Nintendo 3DS was released February 26, 2011.\nIt contains three cameras, two on the outside (for 3D photographs) and one internal one above the top screen. The bottom screen is a touch screen comparable to the DS bottom screens, and the top screen is Wide Screen and an autostereoscopic 3D LCD. ''[[Autostereoscopy]]'' is a process that sends different images to the left and right eyes to enable the viewer to view the screen in 3D \"without the need for special glasses\". The 3DS is said to enhance Nintendo's online experience. In 2012, the 3DS XL was released, similar to the change between the DSi and DSi XL. It has 90% larger screens and design changes such as a matte finish and the stylus in a more accessible area.\nThe [[Nintendo 2DS|2DS]] was released on October 12, 2013. It is a variant designed to be affordable without the clamshell design or 3D capabilities of the 3DS. Another redesign, the [[New Nintendo 3DS]], was released in Japan in October 2014, Australia for November 2014, and everywhere else in February 2015. It includes a C-Stick, ZR and ZL shoulder buttons, and a faster CPU, allowing for more software specifically for the New Nintendo 3DS (such as ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles 3D]]''). Like the original 3DS, the New Nintendo 3DS also has an XL form.\nAs of December 31, 2013, Nintendo has sold 42.74 million units, including 15.21 million Nintendo 3DS XLs and 2.11 million Nintendo 2DS units.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\nThe latest handheld console was the [[New Nintendo 2DS XL]], which was released in July 2017 across five different countries and is the only model still in production.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Nintendo Switch ===\n{{Main|Nintendo Switch}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Switch-wJoyCons-BlRd-Standing-FL.jpg|thumb|left|The Nintendo Switch]]\nThe Nintendo Switch is a hybrid home and portable console.

They are constituted under the [[Local Government Act 1992]], which amended the [[Local Government Act 1972]] to allow the existence of counties that do not have multiple districts. They typically allow large towns to have separate local authorities from the less urbanised parts of their counties and provide a single authority for small counties where division into districts would be impractical. Unitary authorities do not cover all of England. Most were [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|established during the 1990s]] and a further tranche were [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|created in 2009]]. Unitary authorities have the powers and functions that are elsewhere separately administered by councils of [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] and the [[non-metropolitan district]]s within them.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe term \"[[unitary authority]]\" was first used in the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] in 1969 in its current sense of a local government authority which combines the functions of a county council and a district council.<ref>[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] I. vi 73, cited in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online, draft addendum February 2003, s.v. ''unitary''.  An earlier citation, in 1936, uses the term for the [[London County Council]] in the sense of an elected council for the whole of London.</ref> Strictly speaking, the term does not necessarily mean a single level of local government within an area, because in some cases there are also [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] in the same area.\n\nAlthough the term was not applied to them, [[county borough]]s between 1889 and 1974 were effectively unitary authorities, that is, single-tier administrative units.  Before 1889, local government authorities had different powers and functions, but from medieval times some cities and towns had a high degree of autonomy as [[county corporate|counties corporate]].  Some smaller settlements also enjoyed some degree of autonomy from regular administration as [[borough]]s or [[Liberty (division)|liberties]].\n\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] created areas for local government where large towns and their rural hinterlands were administered together. The concept of unitary units was abandoned with a two-tier arrangement of county and district councils in all areas of England, except the [[Isles of Scilly]] where the small size and distance from the mainland made it impractical. In 1986 a broadly unitary system of local government was introduced in the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] and [[Greater London]], where the upper-tier authorities were abolished and their functions were split between central government, the borough councils and joint boards.<ref name=atkinson>{{ cite book |author1=Atkinson, H.  |author2=Wilks-Heeg, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Local Government from Thatcher to Blair | year=2000 | publisher=Polity}}</ref>\n\n===1990s reform===\n{{main|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\nA review in the 1990s was initiated to select non-metropolitan areas where new unitary authorities could be created.<ref name=politics_uk>{{ cite book | title=Politics UK | year=2004 | publisher=Pearson | edition=5th | author= Jones, Kavanagh, Moran & Norton}}</ref> The resulting structural changes were implemented between 1995 and 1998. Bristol, Herefordshire, the Isle of Wight and Rutland were established as counties of a single district; the district councils of Berkshire became unitary; the counties of Avon, Humberside and Cleveland were broken up to create several unitary authorities; and a number of districts were split off from their associated counties.<ref name=atkinson/> The changes caused the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] to be defined separately, as they had been before 1974. The review caused 46 unitary authorities to be created.<ref name=atkinson/>\n\n===2009 changes===\n{{main|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\nA further review was initiated in 2007 and was enacted in 2009. The review established Cornwall and Northumberland as counties of a single district; established unitary authorities in County Durham, Shropshire and Wiltshire covering the part of the county that was not already split off in the 1990s review; and divided the remainder of Bedfordshire and Cheshire into two unitary authorities. The review caused nine unitary authorities to be created.\n\n===Further reform===\n{{Seealso|2019/2020 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nIn 2016, Oxfordshire County Council put forward a 'One Oxfordshire' proposal which would see Oxford City Council and the four other district councils in Oxfordshire abolished and replaced with a single unitary county council for Oxfordshire. In 2017, Oxford City Council voiced their opposition to the proposal. A decision on whether the proposal will go ahead was to have been announced in March 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed that two unitary authorities be formed to cover the ceremonial county of [[Dorset]]. One of the authorities would consist of the existing unitary authorities of [[Borough of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Borough of Poole|Poole]] and the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the other would be composed of the remainder of the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In November 2017, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, [[Sajid Javid]] stated that he was \"minded to approve the proposals\" and a final decision to implement the two unitary authority model was confirmed in February 2018. Statutory instruments for the creation of two unitary authorities, to be named [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]] and [[Dorset Council (UK)|Dorset Council]], have been made and shadow authorities for the new council areas were formed ahead of their [[2019_structural_changes_to_local_government_in_England|creation on 1 April 2019]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111168134/contents|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dorsetareacouncils.wordpress.com/|title=Shadow Dorset Council|website=Shadow Dorset Council|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and the non-metropolitan districts of [[Aylesbury Vale]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[South Bucks]], and [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] were replaced by a single unitary authority known as [[Buckinghamshire Council]] on 1 April 2020. The existing unitary authority of [[Borough of Milton Keynes|Milton Keynes]] was not affected; from  1 April 2020, therefore, the ceremonial county of [[Buckinghamshire]] has been composed of two unitary authorities.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-46078569 Buckinghamshire unitary council plan gets go-ahead] from [[BBC News]]</ref><ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/957/contents/made The Buckinghamshire (Structural Changes) Order 2019]</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, an independent report commissioned by the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, proposed structural changes to local government in [[Northamptonshire]].

These functions are housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria. The breakdown of these services is as follows:<ref>Frequently Asked Questions on the structural reviews of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk, Boundary Commission for England</ref>\n\n{{Non-metropolitan local authority functions}}\n\n==Electoral arrangements==\nMost unitary authorities are divided into a number of multiple member [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] from which councillors are elected in the same way as in two-tier district council elections. The exceptions, which are divided into electoral divisions as in county council elections, are Cornwall, County Durham, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/help.html|title=Help using the election maps apps|website=openspace.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current list==\nMost unitary authorities are legally defined as being coterminous non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts run by a single council. While it makes no difference, they can either be run by a county council that additionally has district powers and functions, or a district council that additionally has county powers and functions. If there's a county council, the district has no council, and vice versa. Districts can additionally have the status of [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] or [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], although this has no effect on their powers or functions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

They are constituted under the [[Local Government Act 1992]], which amended the [[Local Government Act 1972]] to allow the existence of counties that do not have multiple districts. They typically allow large towns to have separate local authorities from the less urbanised parts of their counties and provide a single authority for small counties where division into districts would be impractical. Unitary authorities do not cover all of England. Most were [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|established during the 1990s]] and a further tranche were [[2009 structural changes to local government in England|created in 2009]]. Unitary authorities have the powers and functions that are elsewhere separately administered by councils of [[non-metropolitan county|non-metropolitan counties]] and the [[non-metropolitan district]]s within them.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nThe term \"[[unitary authority]]\" was first used in the [[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] in 1969 in its current sense of a local government authority which combines the functions of a county council and a district council.<ref>[[Redcliffe-Maud Report]] I. vi 73, cited in [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Online, draft addendum February 2003, s.v. ''unitary''.  An earlier citation, in 1936, uses the term for the [[London County Council]] in the sense of an elected council for the whole of London.</ref> Strictly speaking, the term does not necessarily mean a single level of local government within an area, because in some cases there are also [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] in the same area.\n\nAlthough the term was not applied to them, [[county borough]]s between 1889 and 1974 were effectively unitary authorities, that is, single-tier administrative units.  Before 1889, local government authorities had different powers and functions, but from medieval times some cities and towns had a high degree of autonomy as [[county corporate|counties corporate]].  Some smaller settlements also enjoyed some degree of autonomy from regular administration as [[borough]]s or [[Liberty (division)|liberties]].\n\nThe [[Local Government Act 1972]] created areas for local government where large towns and their rural hinterlands were administered together. The concept of unitary units was abandoned with a two-tier arrangement of county and district councils in all areas of England, except the [[Isles of Scilly]] where the small size and distance from the mainland made it impractical. In 1986 a broadly unitary system of local government was introduced in the six [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]] and [[Greater London]], where the upper-tier authorities were abolished and their functions were split between central government, the borough councils and joint boards.<ref name=atkinson>{{ cite book |author1=Atkinson, H.  |author2=Wilks-Heeg, S.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Local Government from Thatcher to Blair | year=2000 | publisher=Polity}}</ref>\n\n===1990s reform===\n{{main|Local Government Commission for England (1992)}}\nA review in the 1990s was initiated to select non-metropolitan areas where new unitary authorities could be created.<ref name=politics_uk>{{ cite book | title=Politics UK | year=2004 | publisher=Pearson | edition=5th | author= Jones, Kavanagh, Moran & Norton}}</ref> The resulting structural changes were implemented between 1995 and 1998. Bristol, Herefordshire, the Isle of Wight and Rutland were established as counties of a single district; the district councils of Berkshire became unitary; the counties of Avon, Humberside and Cleveland were broken up to create several unitary authorities; and a number of districts were split off from their associated counties.<ref name=atkinson/> The changes caused the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] to be defined separately, as they had been before 1974. The review caused 46 unitary authorities to be created.<ref name=atkinson/>\n\n===2009 changes===\n{{main|2009 structural changes to local government in England}}\nA further review was initiated in 2007 and was enacted in 2009. The review established Cornwall and Northumberland as counties of a single district; established unitary authorities in County Durham, Shropshire and Wiltshire covering the part of the county that was not already split off in the 1990s review; and divided the remainder of Bedfordshire and Cheshire into two unitary authorities. The review caused nine unitary authorities to be created.\n\n===Further reform===\n{{Seealso|2019/2020 structural changes to local government in England}}\n\nIn 2016, Oxfordshire County Council put forward a 'One Oxfordshire' proposal which would see Oxford City Council and the four other district councils in Oxfordshire abolished and replaced with a single unitary county council for Oxfordshire. In 2017, Oxford City Council voiced their opposition to the proposal. A decision on whether the proposal will go ahead was to have been announced in March 2017.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed that two unitary authorities be formed to cover the ceremonial county of [[Dorset]]. One of the authorities would consist of the existing unitary authorities of [[Borough of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Borough of Poole|Poole]] and the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], the other would be composed of the remainder of the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://futuredorset.co.uk/|title=Future Dorset - Two new authorities for Dorset|website=futuredorset.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> In November 2017, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, [[Sajid Javid]] stated that he was \"minded to approve the proposals\" and a final decision to implement the two unitary authority model was confirmed in February 2018. Statutory instruments for the creation of two unitary authorities, to be named [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council]] and [[Dorset Council (UK)|Dorset Council]], have been made and shadow authorities for the new council areas were formed ahead of their [[2019_structural_changes_to_local_government_in_England|creation on 1 April 2019]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2018/9780111168134/contents|title=The Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole (Structural Changes) Order 2018|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dorsetareacouncils.wordpress.com/|title=Shadow Dorset Council|website=Shadow Dorset Council|accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Buckinghamshire County Council]] and the non-metropolitan districts of [[Aylesbury Vale]], [[Chiltern District|Chiltern]], [[South Bucks]], and [[Wycombe District|Wycombe]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] were replaced by a single unitary authority known as [[Buckinghamshire Council]] on 1 April 2020.

These functions are housing, waste management, waste collection, council tax collection, education, libraries, social services, transport, planning, consumer protection, licensing, cemeteries and crematoria. The breakdown of these services is as follows:<ref>Frequently Asked Questions on the structural reviews of Devon, Norfolk and Suffolk, Boundary Commission for England</ref>\n\n{{Non-metropolitan local authority functions}}\n\n==Electoral arrangements==\nMost unitary authorities are divided into a number of multiple member [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] from which councillors are elected in the same way as in two-tier district council elections. The exceptions, which are divided into electoral divisions as in county council elections, are Cornwall, County Durham, the Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Shropshire and Wiltshire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/help.html|title=Help using the election maps apps|website=openspace.ordnancesurvey.co.uk|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Current list==\nMost unitary authorities are legally defined as being coterminous non-metropolitan counties and non-metropolitan districts run by a single council. While it makes no difference, they can either be run by a county council that additionally has district powers and functions, or a district council that additionally has county powers and functions. If there's a county council, the district has no council, and vice versa. Districts can additionally have the status of [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough]] or [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]], although this has no effect on their powers or functions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The location of melasma can be categorized as centrofacial, malar, or mandibular. The most common is centrofacial in which patches appear on the cheeks, nose, upper lip, forehead, and chin.

Small amounts of sun exposure can make melasma return to the skin after it has faded, which is why people with melasma often get it again and again, particularly in the summer.<ref name=AAD2017/>\n\nPregnant women often get melasma, or chloasma, known as the mask of pregnancy.

Since a small [[nodule (medicine)|nodule]] can represent anything from a harmless [[nevus]] to a [[malignant tumor]], this usage of the term is not very specific. Examples of this use of the term granuloma are the [[lesions]] known as [[vocal cord]] granuloma (known as [[contact granuloma]]), [[pyogenic granuloma]] and intubation granuloma, all of which are examples of [[granulation tissue]], not granulomas. \"Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma\" is a lesion characterized by [[keloid]]-like fibrosis in the lung, and is not granulomatous. Similarly, [[radiologists]] often use the term granuloma when they see a calcified nodule on X-ray or CT scan of the chest. They make this assumption since granulomas usually contain calcium, although the cells that form a granuloma are too tiny to be seen by a radiologist. The most accurate use of the term \"granuloma\" requires a [[pathologist]] to examine surgically removed and specially colored (stained) tissue under a microscope.\n\nHistiocytes (specifically [[histiocytes|macrophages]]) are the cells that define a granuloma. They often, but not invariably, fuse to form multinucleated giant cells ([[Langhans giant cell]]).<ref>{{cite book |title= Janeway's Immunobiology |authorlink=Kenneth Murphy |vauthors = Travers P, Walport M  |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science |page=372}}</ref> The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as \"[[Epithelioid cell|epithelioid]]\". This term refers to the vague resemblance of these macrophages to [[epithelial cells]]. Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages and their cytoplasm is typically more pink when stained with [[eosin]]. These changes are thought to be a consequence of \"activation\" of the macrophage by the offending antigen.\n\nThe other key term in the above definition is the word \"organized\" that refers to a tight, ball-like formation. The macrophages in these formations are typically so tightly clustered that the borders of individual cells are difficult to appreciate. Loosely dispersed macrophages are not considered to be granulomas.\n\nAll granulomas, regardless of cause, may contain additional cells and [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]]. These include [[lymphocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[multinucleated giant cells]], [[fibroblasts]] and [[collagen]] ([[fibrosis]]). The additional cells are sometimes a clue to the cause of the granuloma. For example, granulomas with numerous eosinophils may be a clue to [[coccidioidomycosis]] or allergic [[Bronchi|bronchopulmonary]] fungal disease, and granulomas with numerous neutrophils suggest [[blastomycosis]], [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[aspiration pneumonia]] or [[cat-scratch disease]].\n\nIn terms of the underlying cause, the difference between granulomas and other types of inflammation is that granulomas form in response to antigens that are resistant to \"first-responder\" inflammatory cells such as [[neutrophils]] and [[eosinophils]].  The antigen causing the formation of a granuloma is most often an infectious pathogen or a substance foreign to the body, but sometimes the offending antigen is unknown (as in [[sarcoidosis]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nGranulomas are seen in a wide variety of diseases, both infectious and non-infectious.<ref name=Muk7>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukhopadhyay S, Farver CF, Vaszar LT, Dempsey OJ, Popper HH, Mani H, Capelozzi VL, Fukuoka J, Kerr KM, Zeren EH, Iyer VK, Tanaka T, Narde I, Nomikos A, Gumurdulu D, Arava S, Zander DS, Tazelaar HD |title=Causes of pulmonary granulomas: a retrospective study of 500 cases from seven countries |journal= Journal of Clinical Pathology|date=Jan 2012 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=51\u201357 |pmid=22011444 |doi=10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200336}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodard1982\" /> Infections that are characterized by granulomas include [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[cryptococcosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]] and [[cat scratch disease]].

Necrosis refers to dead cells that, under the microscope, appear as a mass of formless debris with '''no nuclei present'''. A related term, \"caseation\" (literally: turning to cheese) refers to a form of necrosis that, to the unaided eye (i.e., without a microscope), appears cheese-like (\"caseous\"), and is typically (but not uniquely) a feature of the granulomas of tuberculosis. The identification of necrosis in granulomas is important because granulomas with necrosis tend to have infectious causes.<ref name=\"Muk7\" /> There are several exceptions to this general rule, but it nevertheless remains useful in day-to-day diagnostic pathology.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Necrosis in granulomas\" widths=\"300px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Granuloma 20x.jpg|Granuloma without necrosis in a lymph node of a person with sarcoidosis.\nImage:Necrogran10x.jpg|Granuloma with central necrosis in a lung of a person with tuberculosis.

It is a collection of [[immune cell]]s known as [[macrophages]].<ref name=\"Muk7\" /> Granulomas form when the [[immune system]] attempts to wall off substances it perceives as foreign but is unable to eliminate.

Since a small [[nodule (medicine)|nodule]] can represent anything from a harmless [[nevus]] to a [[malignant tumor]], this usage of the term is not very specific. Examples of this use of the term granuloma are the [[lesions]] known as [[vocal cord]] granuloma (known as [[contact granuloma]]), [[pyogenic granuloma]] and intubation granuloma, all of which are examples of [[granulation tissue]], not granulomas. \"Pulmonary hyalinizing granuloma\" is a lesion characterized by [[keloid]]-like fibrosis in the lung, and is not granulomatous. Similarly, [[radiologists]] often use the term granuloma when they see a calcified nodule on X-ray or CT scan of the chest. They make this assumption since granulomas usually contain calcium, although the cells that form a granuloma are too tiny to be seen by a radiologist. The most accurate use of the term \"granuloma\" requires a [[pathologist]] to examine surgically removed and specially colored (stained) tissue under a microscope.\n\nHistiocytes (specifically [[histiocytes|macrophages]]) are the cells that define a granuloma. They often, but not invariably, fuse to form multinucleated giant cells ([[Langhans giant cell]]).<ref>{{cite book |title= Janeway's Immunobiology |authorlink=Kenneth Murphy |vauthors = Travers P, Walport M  |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science |page=372}}</ref> The macrophages in granulomas are often referred to as \"[[Epithelioid cell|epithelioid]]\". This term refers to the vague resemblance of these macrophages to [[epithelial cells]]. Epithelioid macrophages differ from ordinary macrophages in that they have elongated nuclei that often resemble the sole of a slipper or shoe. They also have larger nuclei than ordinary macrophages and their cytoplasm is typically more pink when stained with [[eosin]]. These changes are thought to be a consequence of \"activation\" of the macrophage by the offending antigen.\n\nThe other key term in the above definition is the word \"organized\" that refers to a tight, ball-like formation. The macrophages in these formations are typically so tightly clustered that the borders of individual cells are difficult to appreciate. Loosely dispersed macrophages are not considered to be granulomas.\n\nAll granulomas, regardless of cause, may contain additional cells and [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]]. These include [[lymphocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[eosinophils]], [[multinucleated giant cells]], [[fibroblasts]] and [[collagen]] ([[fibrosis]]). The additional cells are sometimes a clue to the cause of the granuloma. For example, granulomas with numerous eosinophils may be a clue to [[coccidioidomycosis]] or allergic [[Bronchi|bronchopulmonary]] fungal disease, and granulomas with numerous neutrophils suggest [[blastomycosis]], [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[aspiration pneumonia]] or [[cat-scratch disease]].\n\nIn terms of the underlying cause, the difference between granulomas and other types of inflammation is that granulomas form in response to antigens that are resistant to \"first-responder\" inflammatory cells such as [[neutrophils]] and [[eosinophils]].  The antigen causing the formation of a granuloma is most often an infectious pathogen or a substance foreign to the body, but sometimes the offending antigen is unknown (as in [[sarcoidosis]]).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nGranulomas are seen in a wide variety of diseases, both infectious and non-infectious.<ref name=Muk7>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mukhopadhyay S, Farver CF, Vaszar LT, Dempsey OJ, Popper HH, Mani H, Capelozzi VL, Fukuoka J, Kerr KM, Zeren EH, Iyer VK, Tanaka T, Narde I, Nomikos A, Gumurdulu D, Arava S, Zander DS, Tazelaar HD |title=Causes of pulmonary granulomas: a retrospective study of 500 cases from seven countries |journal= Journal of Clinical Pathology|date=Jan 2012 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=51\u201357 |pmid=22011444 |doi=10.1136/jclinpath-2011-200336}}</ref><ref name=\"Woodard1982\" /> Infections that are characterized by granulomas include [[tuberculosis]], [[leprosy]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[cryptococcosis]], [[coccidioidomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]] and [[cat scratch disease]].

Necrosis refers to dead cells that, under the microscope, appear as a mass of formless debris with '''no nuclei present'''. A related term, \"caseation\" (literally: turning to cheese) refers to a form of necrosis that, to the unaided eye (i.e., without a microscope), appears cheese-like (\"caseous\"), and is typically (but not uniquely) a feature of the granulomas of tuberculosis. The identification of necrosis in granulomas is important because granulomas with necrosis tend to have infectious causes.<ref name=\"Muk7\" /> There are several exceptions to this general rule, but it nevertheless remains useful in day-to-day diagnostic pathology.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Necrosis in granulomas\" widths=\"300px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:Granuloma 20x.jpg|Granuloma without necrosis in a lymph node of a person with sarcoidosis.\nImage:Necrogran10x.jpg|Granuloma with central necrosis in a lung of a person with tuberculosis.

Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the [[Early Christianity|Church]], the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which sought to establish a [[Judaism|Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition]] within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]].\n\nHellenistic Judaism spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE, and became a notable ''[[religio licita]]'' after the [[Roman conquest of Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Anatolia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Judea|Judea]], and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]].\n\nAccording to [[Burton Mack]], the Christian vision of Jesus' death for the redemption of mankind was only possible in a Hellenised milieu.{{refn|group=note|{{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA136 136]}}: \"Burton Mack argues that Paul\u2019s view of Jesus as a divine figure who gives his life for the salvation of others had to originate in a Hellenistic rather than a Jewish environment.

The two most relevant are the Messiah ben Joseph and the traditional Messiah ben David.

Jewish messianism has its root in the [[apocalyptic literature]] of the 2nd century BCE to 1st century BCE, promising a future \"anointed\" leader or [[messiah]] to restore the Israelite \"[[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]]\", in place of the foreign rulers of the time. This corresponded with the [[Maccabean Revolt]] directed against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Following the fall of the [[Hasmonean]] kingdom, it was directed against the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] administration of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea Province]], which, according to [[Josephus]], began with the formation of the [[Zealots]] and [[Sicarii]] during the [[Census of Quirinius]] (6 CE), although full-scale open revolt did not occur until the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] in 66 CE.\n\n====Resurrection====\nAccording to the New Testament, some Christians reported that they [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|encountered Jesus after his crucifixion]]. They argued that he had been [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] (belief in the resurrection of the dead in the [[Messianic Age]] was a core [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] doctrine), and would [[Second Coming|soon return]] to usher in the [[Kingdom of God]] and fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]] such as the [[resurrection of the dead]] and the [[Last Judgment]].\n\n=====Resurrection experiences=====\n[[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3-9]] gives an early testimony, which was delivered to Paul,<ref>''Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition'' by John H.

According to Ehrman, some of his followers claimed to have seen him alive again, resulting in a multitude of stories which convinced others that Jesus had risen from death and was exalted to Heaven.<ref name=\"Ehrman.1april2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|Ehrman: \"What started Christianity was the Belief in the Resurrection.  It was nothing else.  Followers of Jesus came to believe he had been raised.  They did not believe it because of \u201cproof\u201d such as the empty tomb.  They believed it because some of them said they saw Jesus alive afterward.  Others who believed these stories told others who also came to believe them.  These others told others who told others \u2013 for days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, and now millennia.  Christianity is all about believing what others have said.

It is not that his body was resuscitated after a Near Death Experience.   God had exalted Jesus to heaven never to die again; he will (soon) return from heaven to rule the earth.  This is a statement of faith, not a matter of empirical proof.  Christians themselves believe it.  Non-Christians recognize it as the very heart of the Christian message.

G. Dunn: \"For ''Peter was probably in fact and effect the bridge-man'' (pontifex maximus!) ''who did more than any other to hold together the diversity of first-century Christianity.'' James the brother of Jesus and Paul, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in Gal 2, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage, which Paul lacked, and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as such a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself. But none of them, including the rest of the twelve, seem to have played any role of continuing significance for the whole sweep of Christianity\u2014though James the brother of John might have proved an exception had he been spared.\" [Italics original]</ref>\n\n===Hellenistic influences===\n[[Talmud]] scholar [[Daniel Boyarin]] has argued that Paul's theology of the spirit is more deeply rooted in Hellenistic Judaism than generally believed. In ''A Radical Jew,'' Boyarin argues that the Apostle Paul combined the life of Jesus with [[Greek philosophy]] to reinterpret the [[Hebrew Bible]] in terms of the [[Platonism|Platonic]] opposition between the [[Theory of Forms|ideal]] (which is real) and the [[Matter|material]] (which is false). Judaism is a material religion, in which membership is based not on [[belief]] but rather descent from [[Abraham]], physically marked by [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]], and focusing on [[orthopraxy|how to live this life properly]]. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal Messiah. He used this notion of Messiah to argue for a religion through which all people \u2014 not just descendants of Abraham \u2014 could worship the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]]. Unlike Judaism, which holds that it is the proper religion only of the Jews, Pauline Christianity claimed to be the proper religion for all people.<ref name=\"Boyarin 1999 ?\">Boyarin 1999 (?)</ref>\n\nBy appealing to the Platonic distinction between the material and the ideal, Paul showed how the spirit of Christ could provide ''all'' people a way to worship the God who had previously been worshipped only by Jews, Jewish [[proselytes]] and [[God-fearer]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kraabel |first=A.

With persecution by the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Christians]] from the time of the [[Constantine I and Judaism|Roman Emperor Constantine]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], Jewish Christians sought refuge [[Early centers of Christianity#Outside the Roman Empire|outside the boundaries of the Empire]], in [[Early centers of Christianity#Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and further afield.<ref>[[Hans K\u00fcng|K\u00fcng, Hans]] (2008). \"Islam: Past, Present and Future\".

In 70 CE the Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions.<ref name=\"Neusner\">Jacob Neusner 1984 ''Toah From our Sages'' Rossell Books. p. 175</ref>{{refn|group=note|Such as:<ref name=\"Neusner\"/>\n* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?\n* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?\n* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?\n* How to connect present and past traditions?\nHow people answered these questioned depended largely on their position prior to the revolt.}} After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, sectarianism largely came to an end. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the [[Early Christians]] and the [[Pharisees]] survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\". The term \"Pharisee\" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.\n\nMany historians argue that the gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s; this could help one understand their context.<!-- Why do they \"need\" to be understood in this context if this is merely what \"many historians argue\"? --><ref>Cook, Michael J.

Rabbinic Judaism saw the destruction as a chastisement for neglecting the Torah. The early Christians however saw it as God's punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus, leading to the claim that the 'true' Israel [[Supersessionism|was now the Church]]. Jews believed this claim was scandalous.<ref>[http://www.oztorah.com/2008/07/jewish-attitudes-to-gentiles-in-the-first-century/ Raymond Apple, \"Jewish attitudes to Gentiles in the First Century\"]</ref> According to Fredriksen, since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a [[New Covenant (theology)|new covenant]], they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nIn Christian circles, \"[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]\" later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, were not at first declared to be unorthodox but were later excluded and denounced. Some Jewish Christian groups, such as the [[Ebionite]]s, were considered to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and gentile converts. The Nazarenes, holding to orthodoxy except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. The Ebionites may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, \"Ebionite\" was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. There was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. It is believed that there was no direct confrontation or persecution between gentile and Judaic Christianity. However, by this time the practice of Judeo-Christianity was diluted both by internal schisms and external pressures. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref>Dauphin (1993), pp.235, 240\u2013242.</ref>\n\n===Growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Christian writings===\nGrowing anti-Jewish sentiment among early Christians is evidenced by the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], a late-1st/early-2nd century letter attributed to [[Barnabas]], the companion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], although it could be by [[Epistle of Barnabas|Barnabas of Alexandria]], or an anonymous author using the name Barnabas. In no other writing of that early time is the [[List of events in early Christianity|separation of the gentile Christians from observant Jews]] so clearly insisted upon. Christians, according to Barnabas, are the only true covenant people, and the Jewish people are no longer in [[Covenant (Biblical)|covenant with God]]. [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]] and the entire Jewish sacrificial and ceremonial system have been abolished in favor of \"the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ\". Barnabas claims that [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish scriptures]], rightly understood, serve as a foretelling of Christ and its laws often contain allegorical meanings.\n\nWhile 2nd-century [[Marcionism]] rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]] instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others.{{refn|group=note|See the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Early Christianity]].}} They held the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations, and adding other texts as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]].

Jewish Christianity is the foundation of [[Early Christianity]], which later developed into [[Christianity]]. Christianity started with [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish eschatological]] expectations, and it developed into the veneration of a deified [[Jesus]] after his earthly [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], and the post-crucifixion experiences of his followers.\n\nThe inclusion of [[gentile]]s led to a growing split between Jewish Christians and gentile Christianity. From the latter [[Great Church|\"orthodox\" Christianity]] eventually arose, while mainstream Judaism developed into [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Jewish Christians drifted apart from mainstream Judaism, eventually becoming a minority strand which had mostly disappeared by the fifth century.\n\nThe split of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] took place during the [[Early Christianity|first centuries CE]].<ref name=\"Shiffman\">{{cite web |url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/how-jewish-christians-became-christians/ |title=How Jewish Christians Became Christians |last=Shiffman |first=Lawrence H. |date=2018 |website=My Jewish Learning}}</ref><ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/christianity-2 |title=Christianity: Severance from Judaism |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2008 |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |publisher=[[American\u2013Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|AICE]] |access-date=17 December 2018 |quote=A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the [[Early Christianity|Church]], the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]). After the disappearance of the early Jewish Christian sects and the triumph of gentile Christianity, to become a Christian meant, for a Jew, to [[Apostasy in Judaism|apostatize]] and to leave the Jewish community.}}</ref> While the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE were main events, the separation was a long-term process, in which the boundaries were not clear-cut.<ref name=\"Shiffman\"/><ref name=\"JVL\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nEarly Jewish Christians referred to themselves as 'The Way' ({{lang|grc|\u1f21 \u1f41\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2}} - h\u0117 od\u00f3s), probably coming from {{bibleref|Isaiah|40:3|NIV}}, \"prepare the way of the Lord.\"{{sfn|Cwiekowski|1988|p=79-80}}{{sfn|Pao|2016|p=65}}{{refn|group=note|It appears in the Acts of the Apostles, {{bibleref|Acts|9:2|NKJV}}, {{bibleref|Acts|19:9|NKJV}} and {{bibleref|Acts|19:23|NKJV}}).

The inroads into Judaism gave rise to Hellenistic Judaism in the Jewish diaspora which sought to establish a [[Judaism|Hebraic-Jewish religious tradition]] within the culture and language of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]].\n\nHellenistic Judaism spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE, and became a notable ''[[religio licita]]'' after the [[Roman conquest of Greece]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Anatolia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], [[Roman Judea|Judea]], and [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], until its decline in the 3rd century parallel to the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]].\n\nAccording to [[Burton Mack]], the Christian vision of Jesus' death for the redemption of mankind was only possible in a Hellenised milieu.{{refn|group=note|{{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA136 136]}}: \"Burton Mack argues that Paul\u2019s view of Jesus as a divine figure who gives his life for the salvation of others had to originate in a Hellenistic rather than a Jewish environment. Mack writes, \"Such a notion [of vicarious human suffering] cannot be traced to old Jewish and/ or Israelite traditions, for the very notion of a vicarious human sacrifice was anathema in these cultures. But it can be traced to a Strong Greek tradition of extolling a noble death.\" More specifically, Mack argues that a Greek \"myth of martyrdom\" and the \"noble death\" tradition are ultimately responsible for influencing the hellenized Jews of the Christ cults to develop a divinized Jesus.\"<br /> {{harvp|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WgROZMp4zDMC&pg=PA93 93]}}further note that \"The most sophisticated and influential version of the hellenization thesis was forged within the German ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries\u2014now often referred to as the \u201cold history of religions school.\u201d Here, the crowning literary achievement in several ways is Wilhelm Bousset\u2019s 1913 work ''Kyrios Christos''.

The two most relevant are the Messiah ben Joseph and the traditional Messiah ben David. Some scholars have argued that the idea of two messiahs, one suffering and the second fulfilling the traditional messianic role, was normative to ancient Judaism, predating Jesus.

His ministry of teaching, healing the sick and disabled and performing [[Miracles of Jesus|various miracles]] culminated in his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] at the hands of the Roman authorities in Jerusalem. After his death, he appeared to his followers, [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] from death.

Jewish messianism has its root in the [[apocalyptic literature]] of the 2nd century BCE to 1st century BCE, promising a future \"anointed\" leader or [[messiah]] to restore the Israelite \"[[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]]\", in place of the foreign rulers of the time. This corresponded with the [[Maccabean Revolt]] directed against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Following the fall of the [[Hasmonean]] kingdom, it was directed against the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] administration of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea Province]], which, according to [[Josephus]], began with the formation of the [[Zealots]] and [[Sicarii]] during the [[Census of Quirinius]] (6 CE), although full-scale open revolt did not occur until the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]] in 66 CE.\n\n====Resurrection====\nAccording to the New Testament, some Christians reported that they [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|encountered Jesus after his crucifixion]]. They argued that he had been [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] (belief in the resurrection of the dead in the [[Messianic Age]] was a core [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] doctrine), and would [[Second Coming|soon return]] to usher in the [[Kingdom of God]] and fulfill the rest of [[Messianic prophecy]] such as the [[resurrection of the dead]] and the [[Last Judgment]].\n\n=====Resurrection experiences=====\n[[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3-9]] gives an early testimony, which was delivered to Paul,<ref>''Creeds of the Churches, Third Edition'' by John H. Leith (1982) {{ISBN|0804205264}} p. 12.</ref> of the atonement of Jesus and the appearances of the risen Christ to \"Cephas and the twelve\", and to \"James [...] and all the apostles\", possibly reflecting a fusion of two early Christian groups:\n{{quote|3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br />\n4 and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures;<br />\n5 and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;<br />\n6 then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep;<br />\n7 then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;<br />\n8 and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also.<ref>[[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Corinthians#15:3|1 Corinthians 15:3-9]]</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Geza Vermes, the concept of resurrection formed \"the initial stage of the belief in his exaltation\", which is \"the apogee of the triumphant Christ\".{{sfn|Vermes|2008|p=138-139}} The focal concern of the early communities is the expected return of Jesus, and the entry of the believers into the kingdom of God with a transformed body.{{sfn|Vermes|2008|p=139}}\n\nAccording to Ehrman, the resurrection experiences were a denial response to his disciples' sudden disillusionment following Jesus' death. According to Ehrman, some of his followers claimed to have seen him alive again, resulting in a multitude of stories which convinced others that Jesus had risen from death and was exalted to Heaven.<ref name=\"Ehrman.1april2018\"/>{{refn|group=note|Ehrman: \"What started Christianity was the Belief in the Resurrection.  It was nothing else.  Followers of Jesus came to believe he had been raised.  They did not believe it because of \u201cproof\u201d such as the empty tomb.  They believed it because some of them said they saw Jesus alive afterward.  Others who believed these stories told others who also came to believe them.  These others told others who told others \u2013 for days, weeks, months, years, decades, centuries, and now millennia.  Christianity is all about believing what others have said.  It has always been that way and always will be.<br /><br />Easter is the celebration of the first proclamation that Jesus did not remain dead.  It is not that his body was resuscitated after a Near Death Experience.   God had exalted Jesus to heaven never to die again; he will (soon) return from heaven to rule the earth.  This is a statement of faith, not a matter of empirical proof.  Christians themselves believe it.  Non-Christians recognize it as the very heart of the Christian message.  It is a message based on faith in what other people claimed and testified based on what others claimed and testified based on what others claimed and testified \u2013 all the way back to the first followers of Jesus who said they saw Jesus alive afterward.<ref name=\"Ehrman.1april2018\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Paula Fredriksen]], Jesus's impact on his followers was so great that they could not accept the failure implicit in his death.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Paula Fredriksen, ''From Jesus to Christ''</ref> According to Fredricksen, before his death Jesus created amongst his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and the resurrection of the dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24-29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they had no doubt that he had been resurrected, and the general resurrection of the dead was at hand.

James the brother of Jesus and Paul, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in Gal 2, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage, which Paul lacked, and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as such a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself.

Judaism is a material religion, in which membership is based not on [[belief]] but rather descent from [[Abraham]], physically marked by [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]], and focusing on [[orthopraxy|how to live this life properly]]. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal Messiah. He used this notion of Messiah to argue for a religion through which all people \u2014 not just descendants of Abraham \u2014 could worship the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]].

With persecution by the [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene Christians]] from the time of the [[Constantine I and Judaism|Roman Emperor Constantine]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], Jewish Christians sought refuge [[Early centers of Christianity#Outside the Roman Empire|outside the boundaries of the Empire]], in [[Early centers of Christianity#Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]] and further afield.<ref>[[Hans K\u00fcng|K\u00fcng, Hans]] (2008). \"Islam: Past, Present and Future\".

In 70 CE the Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions.<ref name=\"Neusner\">Jacob Neusner 1984 ''Toah From our Sages'' Rossell Books. p. 175</ref>{{refn|group=note|Such as:<ref name=\"Neusner\"/>\n* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?\n* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?\n* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?\n* How to connect present and past traditions?\nHow people answered these questioned depended largely on their position prior to the revolt.}} After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, sectarianism largely came to an end. The Zealots, Sadducees, and Essenes disappeared, while the [[Early Christians]] and the [[Pharisees]] survived, the latter transforming into Rabbinic Judaism, today known simply as \"Judaism\". The term \"Pharisee\" was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian, and the rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews.\n\nMany historians argue that the gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s; this could help one understand their context.<!-- Why do they \"need\" to be understood in this context if this is merely what \"many historians argue\"? --><ref>Cook, Michael J.

See, for example, Grayzel, ''A History of the Jews'', Penguin Books, 1984, p. 193.}}\n\nA significant contributing factor to the split was the two groups' differing theological interpretations of the Temple's destruction. Rabbinic Judaism saw the destruction as a chastisement for neglecting the Torah. The early Christians however saw it as God's punishment for the Jewish rejection of Jesus, leading to the claim that the 'true' Israel [[Supersessionism|was now the Church]]. Jews believed this claim was scandalous.<ref>[http://www.oztorah.com/2008/07/jewish-attitudes-to-gentiles-in-the-first-century/ Raymond Apple, \"Jewish attitudes to Gentiles in the First Century\"]</ref> According to Fredriksen, since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a [[New Covenant (theology)|new covenant]], they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple during the First Jewish-Roman War.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nIn Christian circles, \"[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]\" later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, were not at first declared to be unorthodox but were later excluded and denounced. Some Jewish Christian groups, such as the [[Ebionite]]s, were considered to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and gentile converts. The Nazarenes, holding to orthodoxy except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]]. The Ebionites may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, \"Ebionite\" was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp.157\u2013159.</ref>\n\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. There was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. It is believed that there was no direct confrontation or persecution between gentile and Judaic Christianity. However, by this time the practice of Judeo-Christianity was diluted both by internal schisms and external pressures. Gentile Christianity remained the sole strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref>Dauphin (1993), pp.235, 240\u2013242.</ref>\n\n===Growing anti-Jewish sentiment in Christian writings===\nGrowing anti-Jewish sentiment among early Christians is evidenced by the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], a late-1st/early-2nd century letter attributed to [[Barnabas]], the companion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], although it could be by [[Epistle of Barnabas|Barnabas of Alexandria]], or an anonymous author using the name Barnabas. In no other writing of that early time is the [[List of events in early Christianity|separation of the gentile Christians from observant Jews]] so clearly insisted upon. Christians, according to Barnabas, are the only true covenant people, and the Jewish people are no longer in [[Covenant (Biblical)|covenant with God]]. [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|Circumcision]] and the entire Jewish sacrificial and ceremonial system have been abolished in favor of \"the new law of our Lord Jesus Christ\". Barnabas claims that [[Hebrew Bible|Jewish scriptures]], rightly understood, serve as a foretelling of Christ and its laws often contain allegorical meanings.\n\nWhile 2nd-century [[Marcionism]] rejected all Jewish influence on Christianity, [[Proto-orthodox Christianity]] instead retained some of the doctrines and practices of 1st-century Judaism while rejecting others.{{refn|group=note|See the [[Biblical law in Christianity#Historical background|Historical background to the issue of Biblical law in Christianity]] and [[Early Christianity]].}} They held the [[Tanakh|Jewish scriptures]] to be authoritative and sacred, employing mostly the [[Septuagint]] or [[Targum]] translations, and adding other texts as the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon developed]]. Christian [[baptism]] was another continuation of a Judaic practice.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&letter=B&search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: \"According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab.

Some of those families carry surnames such as [[John (surname)|Youhanna]] (John), [[Hananiah (disambiguation)|Hanania]] (Ananias), [[Zion|Sahyoun]] (Zion), [[Elijah|Eliyya/Elias]] (Elijah), [[Chamoun|Chamoun/Shamoun]] (Simeon/Simon), [[Semaan|Semaan/Simaan]] (Simeon/Simon), [[Manasseh|Menassa]] (Manasseh), [[Solomon|Salamoun]]/[[Suleiman]] (Solomon), [[Joachim|Youwakim]] (Joachim), [[Zacharias (surname)|Zakariya]] (Zacharias) and others.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bar Ilan | first=Y. | title=Judaic Christianity: Extinct or Evolved?| pp=297\u2013315}}</ref>\n\n==Contemporary movements==\nIn modern days, the term \"Jewish Christian\" generally refers to ethnic Jews who have converted to or have been raised in Christianity. They are mostly members of [[Catholic]], [[Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] congregations, and are generally [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] into the Christian mainstream, although they retain a strong sense of their [[Jewish identity]]. Some Jewish Christians also refer to themselves as \"[[Hebrew Christian movement|Hebrew Christians]]\".\n\nThe [[Hebrew Christian movement]] of the 19th century was a largely [[Anglican Church|Anglican]]-led and largely integrated initiative, led by figures such as [[Michael Solomon Alexander]], [[Anglican-German Bishopric in Jerusalem#The bishopric in practice|Bishop of Jerusalem]] 1842\u20131845; some figures, such as [[Joseph Frey]], founder of the [[London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews]], were more assertive of Jewish identity and independence.\n\nThe 19th century saw at least 250,000 Jews convert to Christianity according to existing records of various societies.<ref>{{Citation | first1 = Stanley N | last1 = Gundry | first2 = Louis | last2 = Goldberg | title = How Jewish is Christianity?: 2 views on the Messianic movement | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sYfcuBdLqyEC&pg=PA24 | publisher = Google | format = Books | page = 24}}</ref> Data from the [[Pew Research Center]] has it that, as of 2013, about 1.6 million adult [[American Jews]] identify themselves as [[Christians]], most as [[Protestant]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/02/how-many-jews-are-there-in-the-united-states/|title=How many Jews are there in the United States?|work=Pew Research Center}}</ref><ref name=\"pew: portrait\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-1-population-estimates/|title=A PORTRAIT OF JEWISH AMERICANS: Chapter 1: Population Estimates|work=Pew Research Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/.premium-1.549713|title=American-Jewish Population Rises to 6.8 Million|work=haaretz}}</ref> According to the same data, most of the Jews who identify themselves as some sort of Christian (1.6 million) were raised as Jews or are Jews by ancestry.<ref name=\"pew: portrait\" /> According to a 2012 study, 17% of [[History of the Jews in Russia|Jews in Russia]] identify themselves as [[Christianity in Russia|Christians]].<ref name=\"ArenaAtlas\">[http://sreda.org/en/arena Arena \u2013 Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia].

Adherents, many of whom are ethnically Jewish, worship in congregations that include [[Hebrew prayers]]. They baptize messianic believers who are of the [[Age of accountability#Judaism|age of accountability]] (able to accept Jesus as the Messiah), often observe kosher\n[[Kashrut|dietary laws]] and [[Shabbat|Saturday as the Sabbath]]. Although they do recognize the Christian [[New Testament]] as holy scripture, most do not use the label \"Christian\" to describe themselves.\n\nThe two groups are not completely distinct; some adherents, for example, favor Messianic congregations but freely live in both worlds, such as theologian [[Arnold Fruchtenbaum]], the founder of Ariel Ministries.<ref>{{cite web|title=About us \u2013 Brief history|url=http://www.ariel.org/amcom.htm|work=Ariel Ministries|access-date=2011-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412235150/http://www.ariel.org/amcom.htm|archive-date=2015-04-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|Judaism|History|Ancient Rome}}\n* [[Hebrew Christian movement]] \u2013 a 19th-century movement of Jewish converts to Christianity acting semi-autonomously within the Anglican and other established churches.<ref>Kessler, Edward and Neil Wenborn, ed.
