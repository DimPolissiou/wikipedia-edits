{"title_page": "Demat account", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{globalize|date=April 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{Original research|date=February 2020}}\n}}\nA '''Demat account''' (short for Dematerialized account) is an account to hold financial securities (equity or debt) in electronic form. In India Demat accounts are maintained by two depository organisations, National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited. A [[depository participant]], such as a bank, acts as an intermediary between the investor and the depository.\n\nThe Demat account number is quoted for all transactions to enable electronic settlements of trades to take place. Access to the Dematerialized account requires an internet password and a transaction password. Transfers or purchases of [[Security (finance)|securities]] can then be initiated. Purchases and sales of securities on the Dematerialized account are automatically made once transactions are confirmed and completed.\n\n==Motive of Demat system==\n\nIndia adopted the Demat [https://marketknowledgehub.com/format-for-trading-account/ account] for electronic storing, wherein shares and securities are represented and maintained electronically, thus eliminating the troubles associated with paper shares. After the introduction of the depository system by [https://www.sebi.gov.in/acts/act03a.pdf the Depository Act of 1996], the process for sales, purchases and transfers of shares became significantly easier and most of the risks associated with paper certificates were mitigated.\n\nThis became easy for all the retail traders as well, after that all the retail traders can see the immediate reaction from home sitting on their computer screen, this reduces the possibility of any kind of deception in the meantime, ie the trader in the market work or Avenues of complete transparency opened up for investors\n\n==Benefits of Demat system==\n\nDemat account for shares and securities with business purpose\n\nThe benefits of Demat account are as follows:\n* Easy and convenient way to hold securities\n* Safer than paper-shares (earlier risks associated with physical certificates such as bad delivery, fake securities, delays, thefts etc. are mostly eliminated)\n* Reduced paperwork for transfer of securities\n* Reduced transaction cost\n* No \"odd lot\" problem: even one share can be sold\n* Change in address recorded with a [[depository participant]] gets registered with all companies in which investor holds securities eliminating the need to correspond with each of them separately.\n* Transmission of securities is done by the depository participant, eliminating the need for notifying companies.\n* Automatic credit into Demat account for shares arising out of bonus/split, consolidation/merger, etc.\n* A single Demat account can hold investments in both [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and [[debt]] instruments.\n* Traders can work from anywhere (e.g. even from home).\n\n; Benefit to the company:\nThe depository system helps in reducing the cost of new issues due to lower printing and distribution costs. It increases the efficiency of the registrars and transfer agents and the secretarial department of a company. It provides better facilities for communication and timely service to shareholders and investors.\n\n; Benefit to the investor:\nThe depository system reduces risks involved in holding physical certificates, e.g., loss, theft, mutilation, forgery, etc. It ensures transfer settlements and reduces delay in registration of shares. It ensures faster communication to investors. It helps avoid bad delivery problems due to signature differences, etc. It ensures faster payment on sale of shares. No stamp duty is paid on transfer of shares. It provides more acceptability and liquidity of securities.\n\n; Benefits to brokers:\nIt reduces risks of delayed settlement.\nIt ensures greater profit due to increase in volume of trading. It eliminates chances of forgery or bad delivery. It increases overall trading and [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]]. It increases confidence in their investors.\n\n==Depository participant==\n{{Main|Depository participant}}\nA depository is an institution holding a pool of pre-verified shares held in electronic mode that offers efficient settlement of transactions.\n\nIn India, National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited are two designated despositories.\n\nA depository participant is an intermediary between the investor and the depository. A depository participant is typically a financial organization like a bank, broker, financial institution, or custodian acting as an agent of the depository to make its services available to the investors. Each depository participant is assigned a unique identification number As of March 2006, there were a total of 538 depository participants registered with the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]].\n\n==Conversion of Demat==\nConverting physical records of investments into electronic records is called \"dematerialising\" of securities.\nIn order to dematerialise physical securities, investors must fill in a Demat Request Form, which is available with the depository participant and submit the same along with physical certificates. Every security has an [[ISIN|International Securities Identification Number]]. A separate request form must be filled for every identification number.\n\nThe complete process of dematerialisation is outlined below:\n* The investor surrenders the certificates for dematerialisation to the depository participant.\n* Depository participant updates the account of the investor.\n* Demat accounts are maintained by National Securities Depository Limited and Central Depository Services Limited and the banks act as intermediary.\n\n==Demat options==\n\nThere are many hundreds of depository participants offering the Demat account facility in India as of September 2011. A comparison of the fees charged by different depository participants is detailed below.\n\nThere are a few distinct advantages of having a bank as a depository participant. Having a Demat account with a bank depository participant, usually provides quick processing, accessibility, convenience, and online transaction capability to the investor. Generally, banks credit the Demat account with shares in case of purchase, or credit a savings account with the proceeds of a sale, on the third day. Banks are also advantageous because of the number of branches they have. Some banks give the option of opening a Demat account in any branch, while others restrict themselves to a select set of branches. Some private banks also provide online access to the Demat account. Hence, the investors can conveniently check online details of their holdings, transactions and status of requests through their bank's net-banking facility. A broker who acts as a depository participant may not be able to provide these services.\n\n==Fees==\n\nThere are four major charges usually levied on a Demat account: account opening fee, annual maintenance fee, custodian fee and transaction fee. Charges for all fees vary by depository participant.\n\n===Demat account-opening fee===\nThere may not be an opening account fee. Private banks do not have one, but other entities do impose an opening fee.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Annual maintenance fee===\nThis is also known as folio maintenance charges, and is generally levied in advance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is charged on annual or monthly basis.\n\n===Transaction fee===\nThe transaction fee is charged for crediting/debiting securities to and from the account on a monthly basis pay the fee to the transaction value, which is subject to a minimum amount. The fee also differs based on the kind of transaction (buying or selling). Some depository participants charge only for debiting the securities, while others charge for both. Some depository participants also charge the investor even if the instruction to buy/sell fails or is rejected. In addition, service tax is also charged by the depository participants.\n\nIn addition to the other fees, the depository participant also charges a fee for converting the shares from the physical to the electronic form or vice versa. This fee varies for both Demat (physical-to-electronic) and Remat (electronic-to-physical) requests. For Demat transactions, some depository participants charge a flat fee per request in addition to the variable fee per certificate, while others charge only the variable fee.\n\nFor instance, Stock Holding Corporation has charged Rs 25 as the request fee and Rs 3 per certificate as the variable fee. However, SBI has charged only the variable fee, as Rs 3 per certificate. Remat requests also have charges akin to that of Demat. However, variable charges for remat are generally higher than Demat.\n\nSome of the additional features (usually offered by banks) are as follows. Some depository participants offer a frequent-trader account, where they charge frequent traders at lower rates than the standard charges. Demat account holders are generally required to pay the depository participant an advance fee for each account that will be adjusted against the various service charges. The account holder needs to raise the balance when it falls below a certain amount prescribed by the depository participant. However, if the holders also hold a savings account with the depository participant, they can provide a debit authorisation to the depository participant for paying this charge. Finally, once choosing a depository participant, it would be prudent to keep all accounts with that depository participant, so that tracking of [[capital gains]] liability is easier. This is because when calculating [[capital gains tax]], the period of holding will be determined by the depository participant, and different depository participants follow different methods. For instance, ICICI Bank uses the [[fIFO and LIFO accounting|first in first out]] method to compute the period of holding. The proof of the cost of acquisition will be the contract note. The computation of capital gains is done account-wise.\n\n'''Indian Banking System'''\nFirst, an investor has to approach a depository participant and fill up an account opening form. The account opening form must be supported by copies of any one of the approved documents to serve as proof of identity and proof of address as specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. An investor must have his/her [[Permanent Account Number]] card in original at the time of opening of the account (mandate effective from April 1, 2006).\n\nAll applicants should carry original documents for verification by an authorized official of the depository participant, under his signature.\nFurther, the investor has to sign an agreement with the depository participant in a depository prescribed standard format, which details rights and duties of investor and depository participant. The depository participant should provide the investor with a copy of the agreement and schedule of charges for their future reference. The depository participant will open the account in the system and give an account number, which is also called the Beneficiary Owner Identification number.\nThe depository participant may revise the charges by giving 30 days' notice in advance. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has rationalised the cost structure for dematerialisation by removing account-opening charges, transaction charges for credit of securities, and custody charges [[vide (Latin)|vide]] circular dated January 28, 2005.\n\n==Documents required for Demat account==\nTo open a Demat account you have to provide documents which fulfill the requirements of KYC (Know Your Customer) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?wprov=sfla1]].\nA contract with a stockbroker does not have to be signed.\nGenerally the documents are:\n*Permanent account number (compulsory)\n*Bank statement (last 3 months)\n*Proof of address\n*Income tax return\n*Two colour\n*Bank crossed cheque\n*KYC [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer?wprov=sfla1]]\n*[[Aadhar card]]\n\n==Disadvantages of Demat==\n\n*Trading in securities may become uncontrolled in case of dematerialized securities.\n*It is incumbent upon the capital market regulator to keep a close watch on the trading in dematerialized securities and see to it that trading does not act as a detriment to investors.\n*For dematerialized securities, the role of key market players such as stock-brokers needs to be supervised as they have the capability of manipulating the market.\n*Multiple regulatory frameworks have to be conformed to, including the Depositories Act, Regulations and the various By-Laws[[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-law]] of various depositories.\n*Agreements are entered at various levels in the process of dematerialization. These may cause worries to the investor desirous of simplicity.\n*There is no provision to close a Demat account, which is having illiquid shares. The investor cannot close the account and he and his successors have to go on paying the charges to the participant, like annual folio charges, etc.\n*After liquidating the holdings, many Indian investors don't close their depository participant account. They are unaware that depository participants charge even on dormant accounts.\n\n==Transfer of shares between depository participants==\n\nTo transfer shares, an investor has to fill one of two kinds of Depository Instruction Slip.\nThe first check made is whether both Demat accounts are at the same depository. There are two depositories: Central Depository Service and National Securities Depository.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Demat |first1=Guide |title=Depository in India |url=https://www.traderspit.in/demat-account-complete-guide/ |website=Traders Pit}}</ref>\nIf both Demat accounts are not at the same depository, then an Inter Depository Slip has to be filled and submitted.\nFor example:\n* If there is one Demat account with the Central Depository Service and the other Demat account with the National Depository Service, then an Inter Depository Slip is needed. (In case the investor needs an Inter Depository Slip, the investor should check with the broker, since brokers usually issue them).\n* Now that the correct Depository Instruction Slip has been determined, information pertaining to the transfer transaction has to be entered: scrip name, INE number, quantity in words and figures.\n* Finally, the investor should submit that Depository Instruction Slip to the broker with signatures.\n* The transfer broker shall accept that Depository Instruction Slip in duplicate and acknowledge its receipt on duplicate copy.\n\nThe investor should submit the Depository Instruction Slip when the market is open. Accordingly, its dates of submission and execution can be same or a difference of one day is also acceptable. The investor also has to pay the broker some charges for the transfer.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.cdslindia.com/ National Securities Depository Limited website]\n* [https://nsdlcas.nsdl.com/ Central Depository Services Limited website]\n* [https://marketknowledgehub.com/ market knowledge hub]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demat Account}}\n[[Category:Securities (finance)]]\n[[Category:Stock market]]\n[[Category:Financial services in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{globalize|date=April 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2020}}\n{{Original research|date=February 2020}}\n}}\nA '''Demat account''' (short for Dematerialized account) is an account to hold financial securities (equity or debt) in electronic form.

A native of [[Philadelphia]], Wallace played [[college basketball]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] before moving on to the NBA in 1995.\n\nOriginally selected by the [[Washington Bullets]] (now known as the Washington Wizards) as the fourth pick in the [[1995 NBA draft]], Wallace was named to the All-Rookie second team following his [[1995\u201396 NBA season|first season]]. He was then traded to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] after the season. With Portland he was a key member of the Trail Blazers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals in [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]] and [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]], and was an [[NBA All-Star]] in 2000 and 2001. Wallace averaged a career best 19.4 points per game in 2002 for the Trail Blazers.\n\nDuring the [[2003-04 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]] Portland traded him to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] where he played one game before he was traded to the [[Detroit Pistons]]. With the Pistons, Wallace won the [[2004 NBA Finals|NBA championship in 2004]], but lost the [[2005 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] in the following season. Individually, Wallace was an [[NBA All-Star]] in 2006 and 2008. After the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]], Wallace left the Pistons as a free agent and signed with the [[Boston Celtics]], where he played until retiring in 2010. He returned to sign a one-year deal to play for the [[New York Knicks]] in 2012. On April 17, 2013, Wallace announced his second retirement.\n\nWallace holds the single-season record for technical fouls. In the 2000\u201301 season, Wallace received 41 technical fouls over a span of 80 games, about one technical foul for every two games.\n\n==Early life and education==\nWallace was born and raised in the [[inner city]] neighborhoods of [[Philadelphia]], where he began his basketball career and attended [[Simon Gratz High School]].<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\">https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallara01.html Rasheed Wallace NBA & ABA Statistics|Basketball-Reference.com</ref> He was named ''[[USA Today]] High School Player of the Year'' after his senior season and was selected first team All America by Basketball Times. Wallace was also a two-time Parade All-American first teamer. Despite playing time of just 19 minutes per game, Wallace averaged 16 points, 15 rebounds and seven blocks his senior year. In addition to basketball, Wallace played baseball and also ran track and [[high jump]]ed as a teenager. Wallace was outplayed by [[Darnell Robinson]] in the [[1993 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|McDonald's Game]], where his battle with Robinson caused him to get ejected from the game, but he rebounded in the Roundball Classic, getting 30 points in a losing effort. Wallace, along with Randy Livingston and Jerry Stackhouse, were considered the top three players in the 1993 class.\n\n==College career==\n[[University of North Carolina]] coach [[Dean Smith]] recruited Wallace to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] for his college years. Smith was a revered mentor both to Wallace and Wallace's eventual Detroit coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]]. Wallace has indicated that this North Carolina bond with Brown helped him adjust quickly to the Pistons system. During his brief time at North Carolina, Wallace had success in the national spotlight. He was named a second-team All-American by the AP his second year at UNC.\n\nWallace and fellow future NBA player [[Jerry Stackhouse]] helped lead the [[Tar Heels]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] in 1995. He left North Carolina to enter the [[1995 NBA draft]] after his sophomore season, being selected with the fourth pick overall by the [[Washington Bullets]].\n\n==NBA playing career==\n\n===Washington Bullets (1995\u20131996)===\nAs a rookie with the Bullets, Wallace played in 65 games, of which he started 51 for the injured [[Chris Webber]]. Wallace was selected to the rookie team for the All-Star Weekend. Late that year, he fractured his left thumb during a game against Orlando and did not return until the following season. Wallace scored 655 points and played 1,788 minutes during his rookie season in Washington.\n\n===Portland Trail Blazers (1996\u20132004)===\nAfter the season, Wallace was traded to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], along with [[Mitchell Butler]] in exchange for [[Rod Strickland]] and [[Harvey Grant]]. This move proved beneficial for both sides: Strickland averaged 17.2 ppg and 8.9 apg after the trade, helping the Bullets make the playoffs in 1997 for the first time in eight seasons, and upped those stats to 17.8 ppg and a league-leading 10.5 apg the following year.\n\nMeanwhile, Wallace ranked third in the league in field goal percentage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/fgp/19961997.html |title=Field Goal Percentage \u2013 1996\u201397 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=}}</ref> However, just as his season was gaining momentum, Wallace again broke his left thumb and was forced to miss the next month of the season,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E5DF1430F934A15751C1A960958260 |title=Blazers' Wallace Out at Least Four Weeks |date= December 27, 1996|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=}}</ref> but he returned in time for a strong performance in the first round playoff series against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], which the Trail Blazers lost.\n\nNext season, he signed a long-term contract to stay with the Trail Blazers. He began extending himself into the community more than ever, most notably with his Rasheed Wallace Foundation, but his career suffered from numerous missteps on and off the court. He set an NBA record with 38 [[technical foul]]s for the season.<ref name=\"tfoulrecord\">{{cite news |url=http://sportsline.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20070311_DET@LAC |title=Pistons fine without 'Sheed, beat Clippers behind Rip's 23 points |publisher=CBSSports.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313201510/http://www.sportsline.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20070311_DET@LAC |archivedate=March 13, 2007 }}</ref> However, he would be fifth in the league in [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] percentage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/statistics/1999/default_regular_season_leaders/LeagueLeadersFGPQuery.html?topic=0&stat=6 |title= Regular Season Field Goals Percentage |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=}}</ref> The following year, he broke his own record with 40 technicals.<ref name=\"tfoulrecord\" /> Wallace was also suspended by the NBA for seven games for threatening then-referee [[Tim Donaghy]] on an arena loading dock after a home game in 2003.

He had several notable moments in the playoffs. After the second-round elimination of the Pacers, Wallace played his best series of the postseason in the Eastern Conference finals against the top-seeded [[Miami Heat]]. After falling behind again, he again \"guaranteed success\". He shot a 50% field goal percentage and averaged 14.5 points per game in the series' seven games, and saved his hottest-shooting night to help the Pistons beat the Heat 88-82 in Game 7 on the road in Miami. Against the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the NBA Finals, Wallace was criticized for leaving [[Robert Horry]] open for the game-winning three-pointer in Game 5. Wallace's defense and clutch shooting helped the Pistons to split the series 3\u20133,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/pistons/2005-06-22-rasheed-atones_x.htm |title=Rasheed Wallace atones for Game 5 miscue |last=Nance |first=Roscoe |date=June 22, 2005 |publisher=USATODAY.com |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref> but in the final game, the Pistons lost 81\u201374.\n\nIn the 2005\u201306 season, he helped lead them to a 64\u201318 record, and the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the playoffs. The Pistons beat the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], 4\u20131 in the first round and then beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20133 in the second round of the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons played the Heat in a rematch of the previous year's Conference Finals. The Pistons lost in six games to the Miami Heat, who went on to capture their first NBA title.\n\nOn March 26, 2007, in a game against the [[Denver Nuggets]], Wallace threw up a 60-foot shot off a stolen inbound pass with 1.5 seconds remaining and banked it in from just behind halfcourt to force overtime letting out a huge roar from what was left of the Palace crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXnNZjM9BRc|title=Rasheed Wallace's Buzzer-Beater From Beyond Halfcourt|publisher=YouTube|author=NBA|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> The Pistons went on to win the game, 113\u2013109.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20070326/DENDET/recap.html |title=Wallace Hits Midcourt Shot to Force OT in Pistons Win |date=March 27, 2007 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 2007, Wallace fouled out of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals after committing a foul on [[LeBron James]] and then received two technical fouls, resulting in an automatic ejection, for arguing with a referee.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/2007-06-02-361103860_x.htm |title=Pistons' Wallace ejected from Game 6 |date=June 3, 2007 |publisher=USATODAY.com |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]], the Pistons would not re-sign [[Chris Webber]], and putting [[Antonio McDyess]] as a starting power forward, put Wallace at center. On February 10, 2008, it was announced that Wallace would be replacing Boston Celtics' injured forward Kevin Garnett in the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game]] in New Orleans.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3239663 |title=Pistons' Wallace replaces gimpy Garnett in All-Star Game |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2008}}</ref> The decision was made by NBA commissioner [[David Stern]]. This was Wallace's fourth All-Star appearance.\n\nIn the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons played Garnett and the Celtics. This marked the sixth consecutive time that the Pistons had made it to this point, and five times they had gotten there with Wallace in the lineup. Still, Detroit lost a third consecutive year in the Conference Finals, losing to Boston 4\u20132 as Wallace contributing his poor game play along with [[Tayshaun Prince]] lead the team into demise. After the game, Wallace reportedly told reporters, without taking any questions, \"It's over, man\", perhaps indicating that Pistons' General Manager [[Joe Dumars]] would break up the core of the team following the defeat. He changed his number from 36 back to his original 30, perhaps to change his and the team's fortunes, but sure enough, Dumars did indeed break up the core: at the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season, Dumars traded longtime starting point guard and 2004 Finals MVP [[Chauncey Billups]] to Denver. It was to be Wallace's last year with the team; after the season came to a close, Wallace and the Pistons decided to part ways.\n\n===Boston Celtics (2009\u20132010)===\nWallace signed a three-year contract with the [[Boston Celtics]] on July 8, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press_release/press070809-rasheed-wallace.html|title=Celtics Sign Rasheed Wallace \u2013 The Official Site of the BOSTON CELTICS|publisher=}}</ref> During the regular season, Wallace struggled, averaging career lows in points per game and rebounds per game. Also, he shot 28% on three-pointers and 40% from the field. The Celtics reached the [[2010 NBA Finals|NBA Finals in 2010]] but lost the series to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] four games to three. In Game 6 of the Finals, the Celtics' starting center [[Kendrick Perkins]] injured his right knee, so Wallace started Game 7.

A native of [[Philadelphia]], Wallace played [[college basketball]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] before moving on to the NBA in 1995.\n\nOriginally selected by the [[Washington Bullets]] (now known as the Washington Wizards) as the fourth pick in the [[1995 NBA draft]], Wallace was named to the All-Rookie second team following his [[1995\u201396 NBA season|first season]]. He was then traded to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] after the season. With Portland he was a key member of the Trail Blazers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals in [[1999 NBA Playoffs|1999]] and [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]], and was an [[NBA All-Star]] in 2000 and 2001. Wallace averaged a career best 19.4 points per game in 2002 for the Trail Blazers.\n\nDuring the [[2003-04 NBA season|2003\u201304 season]] Portland traded him to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] where he played one game before he was traded to the [[Detroit Pistons]]. With the Pistons, Wallace won the [[2004 NBA Finals|NBA championship in 2004]], but lost the [[2005 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] in the following season. Individually, Wallace was an [[NBA All-Star]] in 2006 and 2008. After the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]], Wallace left the Pistons as a free agent and signed with the [[Boston Celtics]], where he played until retiring in 2010. He returned to sign a one-year deal to play for the [[New York Knicks]] in 2012. On April 17, 2013, Wallace announced his second retirement.\n\nWallace holds the single-season record for technical fouls. In the 2000\u201301 season, Wallace received 41 technical fouls over a span of 80 games, about one technical foul for every two games.\n\n==Early life and education==\nWallace was born and raised in the [[inner city]] neighborhoods of [[Philadelphia]], where he began his basketball career and attended [[Simon Gratz High School]].<ref name=\"basketball-reference.com\">https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/wallara01.html Rasheed Wallace NBA & ABA Statistics|Basketball-Reference.com</ref> He was named ''[[USA Today]] High School Player of the Year'' after his senior season and was selected first team All America by Basketball Times. Wallace was also a two-time Parade All-American first teamer. Despite playing time of just 19 minutes per game, Wallace averaged 16 points, 15 rebounds and seven blocks his senior year. In addition to basketball, Wallace played baseball and also ran track and [[high jump]]ed as a teenager. Wallace was outplayed by [[Darnell Robinson]] in the [[1993 McDonald's All-American Boys Game|McDonald's Game]], where his battle with Robinson caused him to get ejected from the game, but he rebounded in the Roundball Classic, getting 30 points in a losing effort. Wallace, along with Randy Livingston and Jerry Stackhouse, were considered the top three players in the 1993 class.\n\n==College career==\n[[University of North Carolina]] coach [[Dean Smith]] recruited Wallace to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] for his college years. Smith was a revered mentor both to Wallace and Wallace's eventual Detroit coach [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]]. Wallace has indicated that this North Carolina bond with Brown helped him adjust quickly to the Pistons system. During his brief time at North Carolina, Wallace had success in the national spotlight. He was named a second-team All-American by the AP his second year at UNC.\n\nWallace and fellow future NBA player [[Jerry Stackhouse]] helped lead the [[Tar Heels]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] in 1995. He left North Carolina to enter the [[1995 NBA draft]] after his sophomore season, being selected with the fourth pick overall by the [[Washington Bullets]].\n\n==NBA playing career==\n\n===Washington Bullets (1995\u20131996)===\nAs a rookie with the Bullets, Wallace played in 65 games, of which he started 51 for the injured [[Chris Webber]]. Wallace was selected to the rookie team for the All-Star Weekend. Late that year, he fractured his left thumb during a game against Orlando and did not return until the following season. Wallace scored 655 points and played 1,788 minutes during his rookie season in Washington.\n\n===Portland Trail Blazers (1996\u20132004)===\nAfter the season, Wallace was traded to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]], along with [[Mitchell Butler]] in exchange for [[Rod Strickland]] and [[Harvey Grant]]. This move proved beneficial for both sides: Strickland averaged 17.2 ppg and 8.9 apg after the trade, helping the Bullets make the playoffs in 1997 for the first time in eight seasons, and upped those stats to 17.8 ppg and a league-leading 10.5 apg the following year.\n\nMeanwhile, Wallace ranked third in the league in field goal percentage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/fgp/19961997.html |title=Field Goal Percentage \u2013 1996\u201397 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=}}</ref> However, just as his season was gaining momentum, Wallace again broke his left thumb and was forced to miss the next month of the season,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E5DF1430F934A15751C1A960958260 |title=Blazers' Wallace Out at Least Four Weeks |date= December 27, 1996|publisher=New York Times |accessdate=}}</ref> but he returned in time for a strong performance in the first round playoff series against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], which the Trail Blazers lost.\n\nNext season, he signed a long-term contract to stay with the Trail Blazers. He began extending himself into the community more than ever, most notably with his Rasheed Wallace Foundation, but his career suffered from numerous missteps on and off the court. He set an NBA record with 38 [[technical foul]]s for the season.<ref name=\"tfoulrecord\">{{cite news |url=http://sportsline.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20070311_DET@LAC |title=Pistons fine without 'Sheed, beat Clippers behind Rip's 23 points |publisher=CBSSports.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313201510/http://www.sportsline.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20070311_DET@LAC |archivedate=March 13, 2007 }}</ref> However, he would be fifth in the league in [[Field goal (basketball)|field goal]] percentage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/statistics/1999/default_regular_season_leaders/LeagueLeadersFGPQuery.html?topic=0&stat=6 |title= Regular Season Field Goals Percentage |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=}}</ref> The following year, he broke his own record with 40 technicals.<ref name=\"tfoulrecord\" /> Wallace was also suspended by the NBA for seven games for threatening then-referee [[Tim Donaghy]] on an arena loading dock after a home game in 2003.

He had several notable moments in the playoffs. After the second-round elimination of the Pacers, Wallace played his best series of the postseason in the Eastern Conference finals against the top-seeded [[Miami Heat]]. After falling behind again, he again \"guaranteed success\". He shot a 50% field goal percentage and averaged 14.5 points per game in the series' seven games, and saved his hottest-shooting night to help the Pistons beat the Heat 88-82 in Game 7 on the road in Miami. Against the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the NBA Finals, Wallace was criticized for leaving [[Robert Horry]] open for the game-winning three-pointer in Game 5.

The Pistons beat the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], 4\u20131 in the first round and then beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20133 in the second round of the playoffs. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons played the Heat in a rematch of the previous year's Conference Finals. The Pistons lost in six games to the Miami Heat, who went on to capture their first NBA title.\n\nOn March 26, 2007, in a game against the [[Denver Nuggets]], Wallace threw up a 60-foot shot off a stolen inbound pass with 1.5 seconds remaining and banked it in from just behind halfcourt to force overtime letting out a huge roar from what was left of the Palace crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXnNZjM9BRc|title=Rasheed Wallace's Buzzer-Beater From Beyond Halfcourt|publisher=YouTube|author=NBA|date=April 2, 2007|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> The Pistons went on to win the game, 113\u2013109.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nba.com/games/20070326/DENDET/recap.html |title=Wallace Hits Midcourt Shot to Force OT in Pistons Win |date=March 27, 2007 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 2007, Wallace fouled out of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals after committing a foul on [[LeBron James]] and then received two technical fouls, resulting in an automatic ejection, for arguing with a referee.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/2007-06-02-361103860_x.htm |title=Pistons' Wallace ejected from Game 6 |date=June 3, 2007 |publisher=USATODAY.com |accessdate=February 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]], the Pistons would not re-sign [[Chris Webber]], and putting [[Antonio McDyess]] as a starting power forward, put Wallace at center. On February 10, 2008, it was announced that Wallace would be replacing Boston Celtics' injured forward Kevin Garnett in the [[2008 NBA All-Star Game]] in New Orleans.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3239663 |title=Pistons' Wallace replaces gimpy Garnett in All-Star Game |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2008}}</ref> The decision was made by NBA commissioner [[David Stern]]. This was Wallace's fourth All-Star appearance.\n\nIn the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons played Garnett and the Celtics. This marked the sixth consecutive time that the Pistons had made it to this point, and five times they had gotten there with Wallace in the lineup. Still, Detroit lost a third consecutive year in the Conference Finals, losing to Boston 4\u20132 as Wallace contributing his poor game play along with [[Tayshaun Prince]] lead the team into demise. After the game, Wallace reportedly told reporters, without taking any questions, \"It's over, man\", perhaps indicating that Pistons' General Manager [[Joe Dumars]] would break up the core of the team following the defeat. He changed his number from 36 back to his original 30, perhaps to change his and the team's fortunes, but sure enough, Dumars did indeed break up the core: at the beginning of the 2008\u201309 season, Dumars traded longtime starting point guard and 2004 Finals MVP [[Chauncey Billups]] to Denver. It was to be Wallace's last year with the team; after the season came to a close, Wallace and the Pistons decided to part ways.\n\n===Boston Celtics (2009\u20132010)===\nWallace signed a three-year contract with the [[Boston Celtics]] on July 8, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press_release/press070809-rasheed-wallace.html|title=Celtics Sign Rasheed Wallace \u2013 The Official Site of the BOSTON CELTICS|publisher=}}</ref> During the regular season, Wallace struggled, averaging career lows in points per game and rebounds per game. Also, he shot 28% on three-pointers and 40% from the field. The Celtics reached the [[2010 NBA Finals|NBA Finals in 2010]] but lost the series to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] four games to three. In Game 6 of the Finals, the Celtics' starting center [[Kendrick Perkins]] injured his right knee, so Wallace started Game 7. Wallace scored 11 points and was 5 of 11 from the field in the loss.<ref>{{cite web|title=Boston Celtics vs. Los Angeles- Box Score|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=300617013}}</ref> Wallace's agent Bill Strickland announced on June 25, 2010, that Wallace would likely retire from the NBA,<ref>{{cite news|last=Benbow|first=Julian|title=Agent believes Wallace is done|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2010/06/25/agent_believes_wallace_is_done/|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=June 26, 2010|date=June 25, 2010}}</ref> which was made official on August 10, following the buyout of his contract by the Celtics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nesn.com/2010/08/celtics-officially-waive-rasheed-wallace.html|title=Celtics Officially Waive Rasheed Wallace|date=August 11, 2010|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===New York Knicks (2012\u20132013)===\nOn October 3, 2012, Wallace came out of retirement, and signed with the [[New York Knicks]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Knicks sign Rasheed Wallace | work= knicksnow.com | url= http://knicksnow.com/posts/1721/knicks-sign-rasheed-wallace | accessdate= October 3, 2012 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121006195949/http://knicksnow.com/posts/1721/knicks-sign-rasheed-wallace | archivedate= October 6, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn February 27, 2013, Wallace announced that he had a broken left foot and was expected to miss eight weeks.

They made their way from China into Southeast Asia during the early 20th century. Civil war in Burma and Laos resulted in an increased flow of Akha immigrants and there are now 80,000 people living in Thailand's [[Northern Thailand|northern provinces]] of [[Chiang Rai]] and [[Chiang Mai]].<ref>Chiang Mai's Hill Peoples in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, ''Ancient Chiang Mai'' Volume 3. Chiang Mai, Cognoscenti Books, 2012.</ref> Many of their villages can be visited by tourists on trekking tours from either of these cities.\n\nThe Akha speak [[Akha language|Akha]], a language in the [[Loloish languages|Loloish (Yi) branch]] of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] family. The Akha language is closely related to [[Lisu language|Lisu]] and it is thought that the Akha who once ruled the [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]] and [[Tengchong]] plains in Yunnan before the invasion of the [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1644.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[Image:Flag of the Akha People (Thailand).svg|thumb|Flag of the Akha People in Thailand]]\nScholars agree with the Akha that they originated in China; they disagree, however, about whether the original homeland was the Tibetan borderlands, as the Akha claim, or farther south and east in Yunnan Province, the northernmost residence of present-day Akha. The historically documented existence of relations with the Shan prince of Kengtung indicates that Akha were in eastern Burma as early as the 1860s. They first entered Thailand from Burma at the turn of the 20th-century, many having fled the decades-long civil war in Burma.<ref name=Kammerer>{{cite journal|last=Kammerer|first=Cornelia Ann|journal=Gle Rubin Virtual Reference Library|year=1996|volume=5|series=East and South East Asia|pages=11\u201313|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&sort=RELEVANCE&inPS=true&prodId=GVRL&userGroupName=cuny_hunter&tabID=T003&searchId=R1&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&contentSegment=&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=3&contentSet=GALE%7CCX3458000748&&docId=GALE%7CCX3458000748&docType=GALE|accessdate=30 April 2012|title=GALE search|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref name=Levy>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Jonathan|title=The Akha and Modernization; A Quasi Legal Perspective|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhamodernization.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Population distribution and indigenous status ==\n[[File:Akha laos 11 03d.jpg|thumb|An Akha girl in Laos]]\nAkha live in villages in the mountains of southwest China, eastern [[Myanmar]], western [[Laos]], northwestern [[Vietnam]], and [[northern Thailand]]. In all these countries they are an ethnic minority. The population of the Akha today is roughly 400,000. A decline in village size in Thailand since the 1930s has been noted and attributed to the deteriorating ecological and economic situation in the mountains.<ref name=Thailine>{{cite web|url=http://www.thailine.com/thailand/english/hill-e/akha-e.htm|title=Akha|work=The Hilltribes of Thailand|publisher=Thailand Online|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha are often classified by the Chinese government as part of the [[Hani people|Hani]], an official national minority. The Akha are closely related to the Hani, but consider themselves a distinct group and often resist being subsumed under that identity.<ref name=Hilltribe>{{cite web|url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/|title=The Akha|publisher=HillTribe.org|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref> In Thailand, they are classified as one of the six [[hill tribes]], a term used for all of the various tribal peoples who migrated from China and Tibet over the past few centuries and who now inhabit the dense forests on the borders between Thailand, Laos, and Burma. Few Akha in Thailand are citizens and most are registered as aliens. There is an oft cited lack of political or state infrastructure to address Akha, or any other indigenous issues in Thailand.<ref name=Levy />\n\nThe Akha are not always treated or addressed as equals by the people whose countries they now inhabit. Speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Myanmar and Thailand refer to them as \"gaw\" or \"ekaw\" (ikaw/ikho), terms which the Akha view as derogatory. In Laos the colloquial term used by Tai speakers to refer to the Akha is \"kho\" (ko), often prefaced by the word \"kha\", which means \"slave.\"<ref name=Kammerer />\n\n== Language ==\n[[File:Akha women.jpg|thumb|Akha women c. 1900.]]\nCalled \"Avkavdawv,\" meaning \"[[Akha language]],\" by its native speakers, Akha is a tonal language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the Sino-Tibetan family. The vast majority of Akha speakers can understand the ''jeu g\u2019oe'' (\"jer way\") dialect spoken in southern China, Thailand, and Myanmar.<ref name=Kammerer /> Some basic and systematic variations in regional dialects of Akha are discussed by Paul Lewis in his ''Akha-English-Thai Dictionary''. Very few dialects of Akha do not share mutual intelligibility. The Akha have no written language, but there are several competing scripts that have been written by missionaries and other foreigners.<ref name=Hilltribe />\n\n== Akha villages and culture ==\n[[File:Maejantai Chiang Rai province 01.JPG|thumb|300px|The village of Mae Chan Tai in [[Mae Suai District]], Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, is a more modern village. Note the large coffee drying platforms.]]\nDue to rapid social and economic changes in the regions the Akha inhabit, particularly the introduction of Western modes of capitalism, attempts to continue many of the traditional aspects of Akha life are increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges, Akha people practice many elements of their traditional culture with much success.\n\nAkha society lacks a strict system of social class and is considered [[egalitarian]]. Respect is typically accorded with age and experience. Ties of patrilineal kinship and marriage alliance bind the Akha within and between communities.<ref name=Kammerer /> Village structures may vary widely from the strictly traditional to Westernized, depending on their proximity to modern towns. Like many of the hill tribes, the Akha build their villages at higher elevations in the mountains.<ref name=Akha>{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Akha |url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhaoverview.html|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAkha dwellings are traditionally constructed of logs, bamboo, and thatch and are of two types: \"low houses\", built on the ground, and \"high houses\", built on stilts. The semi-nomadic Akha, at least those who have not been moved to permanent village sites, typically do not build their houses as permanent residences and will often move their villages. Some say that this gives the dwellings a deceptively fragile and flimsy appearance, although they are quite well-built as proved over generations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indigenous Peoples of the World - The Akha|url=http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Akha |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nEntrances to all Akha villages are fitted with a wooden gate adorned with elaborate carvings on both sides depicting imagery of men and women. It is known as a \"spirit gate\". It marks the division between the inside of the village, the domain of man and domesticated animals, and the outside, the realm of spirits and wildlife. The gates function to ward off evil spirits and to entice favorable ones. Carvings can be seen on the roofs of the villager's houses as a second measure to control the flow of spirits.\n\nHouses are segregated by gender, with specific areas for men as well as a common space. This divide is said to mimic the function of the gate.<ref name=Hilltribe /> Another important feature found in most Akha villages is a tall four-posted village swing which is used in an annual ancestor offering related to the fertility of rice. The swing is built annually by an elder called a ''dzoeuh mah''.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe />\n<gallery>\nFile:Gate leading to the akha hilltribe village.jpg|An Akha \"Spirit Gate\" in Thailand\nFile:Akha Hut.JPG|Akha hut\nFile:Akha fishing.JPG|Akha fishing\nFile:Akha hilltribe, Chiang Rai Province P1110690.JPG| Akha, Chiang Rai Province\nFile:Akha village.jpg|An Akha village, with traditional thatched roofs, in northern [[Thailand]]\nFile:Akha Funeral1.JPG|Akha funeral ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n=== Traditional economy ===\n[[Image:Akha man with opium pipe.jpg|thumb|300 px|Akha man with [[opium pipe]] (1979)]]\nThe traditional form of subsistence for the Akha people has been, and remains, agriculture. The Akha grow a variety of crops including soybeans and vegetables. Rice is the most significant crop and is prominent in much of Akha culture and ritual. Most Akha plant dry-land rice, which depends solely on rainfall for moisture, but in some villages irrigation has been built to water [[paddy field]]s. Historically, some Akha villages cultivated [[opium]], but production diminished after the Thai government banned its cultivation.<ref name=Goodman-1996>{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=Jim|title=Meet the Akha|year=1996|publisher=White Lotus Co Ltd|location=Bangkok|isbn=9748496562|pages=113}}</ref>{{RP|113}}\n\nThe Akha have traditionally employed [[slash and burn]] agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, there is usually no market for land. Rights to land are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture has contributed to the Akha's semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its detrimental effects on the environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, but the quality of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.<ref name=Akha />\n\nIn addition to their agricultural work, the Akha raise livestock including pigs, chickens, ducks, goats, cattle, and water buffalo to supplement their diets and to use for their secondary products. Children usually herd the animals. Akha women gather plants from the surrounding forests as well as eggs and insects the Akha will occasionally eat or use for medicinal purposes. The women and the men will often fish in the local lakes and streams. Some villages construct bee gums with the hope that a colony will nest there and their honey subsequently harvested.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe /><ref name=Goodman-1996 />{{RP|113-115}}\n\nThe Akha are skilled hunters. Hunting is a male activity and a very popular one. It is a favorite pastime and a means of obtaining food. The barking deer is, perhaps, their favorite prey. Guns obtained from trading in the larger towns have begun to replace the use of crossbows in hunting.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Goodman-1996 />\n\n===Belief system===\n{{see also|Christianity in Ahka Villages}}\n[[File:Woman with child in Thailand..jpg|thumb|Akha woman with child (Thailand)]]\n[[File:Akha couple.JPG|thumb|Husband carrying the stem of a banana plant, to be fed to pigs]]\nAkha religion\u2014''zahv''\u2014is often described as a mixture of [[animism]] and ancestor worship that emphasizes the Akha connection with the land and their place in the natural world and cycles. Although Akha beliefs and rituals involve all of these elements, the Akha often reject the casual categorization of their practices as such saying it simplifies and reduces its meaning. The Akha way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties. Akha ethnicity is closely tied to the Akha religion. It might be said that to be considered an Akha ethnically by other Akhas is to practice the Akha religion.<ref name=Tooker>{{cite journal|last=Tooker|first=Deborah|title=Identity Systems of Highland Burma: 'Belief', Akha Zan, and a Critique of Interiorized Notions of Ethno-Religious Identity|journal=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=27|pages=799\u2013819|jstor=2804175}}</ref>\n\nThe annual ritual cycle consists of nine or twelve ancestor offerings, rice rituals, and other rites such as the building of the village gates. Many Akha rituals and festivals serve to seek \"blessings\" (''guivlahav'') from ancestors, which are according to the ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures'', \"...fertility and health in people, rice, and domesticated animals.\"<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Belief>{{cite web|title=The Akha Belief and Life System|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhabelieflife.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> Akha beliefs are passed down through generations by oral recantation. The Akha believe that the being who created earth and life gave Akha the \"Akha Zang\" (Akha Way), their guidelines for life. Akhas believe that spirits and people were born of the same mother and lived together until a quarrel led to their separation, upon which spirits went into the forest and people remained in the villages. Since then, Akha believe that the spirits have caused illness and other unwelcome disruptions of human life. The Akha year is divided into the peoples' season (dry) and the spirits' season (wet). During the latter, spirits wander into the village, so they must be driven out as part of a yearly ancestor offering. Both people and rice are considered to have souls, the flight of which causes disease.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Belief />\n\nThe most important and revered position in Akha spiritual matters is given to a village leader, whose ritual responsibilities include initiating the annual rebuilding of the village gates and the swing as well as advising and instructing villages on important matters and settling disputes. Akha villages have an expert in ironworks called the ''pa jee'' who is considered of great significance in the village and who holds the second most important position within the society.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Iron Equipment Beating |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/the-lron-equipmente-beating.php|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important festival of the year is commonly known as the Swing Festival. The four-day Akha Swing Festival comes in late-August each year and falls on the 120th day after the village has planted its rice. The Akha call the Swing Festival, ''Yehkuja'', which translates as \"eating bitter rice\", a phrase which references the previous year's dwindling rice supply incorporates the hope that monsoons will soon water the new crop. Festival activities include ritual offerings to family ancestral spirits at the ancestral altar in a corner of the women's side of the house. Offerings consist of bits of cooked food, water, and rice whiskey. The swing festival is particularly important for Akha women, who will display the clothing they spent all year making and who will show, through ornamentation, that they are becoming older and of marriageable age. Because the women dress up in their best traditional clothing and ornaments and perform traditional dances and songs for the villagers, the Swing Festival is also known as Women's New Year. The traditional New Year which falls in late-December is known as Men's New Year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Jim |url=http://www.chiangmainews.com/ecmn/viewfa.php?id=497|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Chiang Mai City Life |title=The Akha Swing Festival|date=September 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sing Ceremony |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/akha-swing.php|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha put a heavy emphasis on genealogy. An important tradition involves the recounting by Akha males of their patrilineal genealogy. During the most important ceremonies the list is recited in its entirety back over 50 generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. It is said that all Akha males should be able to do so. The recounting of this lineage plays a role in the incest taboo: If a male and female Akha find a common male ancestor within their last six generations, they are not allowed to marry.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Goodman-1996 />\n\nThe Akha have several sets of rules governing matters on life, death, marriage, and birth. Akha traditionally marry in their teens or early twenties. Polygamy is permitted. Marriages may be village endogamous or exogamous. Wife-giving and -taking relationships are central to Akha society, with wife-givers superior to wife-takers.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nTwins are considered an extremely ominous occurrence, one where spirits are considered to interfere with human matters. The Akha believed that only animals could give birth to more than one offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years or so ago, they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it. Akha men whose wives had given birth to twins would not be allowed to participate on the hunt for a specific period.<ref name=Tooker /><ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha and the Spirits|url=http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|accessdate=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610014852/http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|archive-date=10 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCertain types of death, like that caused by a tiger, are considered particularly bad; the bodies must be treated and buried in specific ways.\n\nMissionaries have been active among Akha, especially since the mid-20th century. Some Akha Christians live in separate Christian villages supported by missionary funds. Although many Akha people may be considered converts by the missionaries, nearly 100% practice some mixture of Christianity and traditional Akha beliefs.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite web|title=Joshua Project|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=10223&rog3=CH|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Dress ===\n[[File:MuangSing ThatXiengTung4 tango7174.jpg|thumb|That Xieng Tung Festival, Muang Sing, Laos. Akha young girls in the welcoming committee. On their arrival, visitors will have a color ribbon pinned to their blouse in exchange for a donation.]]\n\nThe Akha people are often noted for their very recognizable sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women are known for their embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.\n\nThe headdresses worn by the women are perhaps the most spectacular and elaborate items of Akha dress. Akha women define their age or marital status with the style of headdress worn. At roughly age 12, the Akha female exchanges her child's cap for that of a girl. A few years later she will begin to don the ''jejaw'', the beaded sash that hangs down the front of her skirt and keeps it from flying up in the breeze. During mid-adolescence she will start wearing the adult woman's headdress. Headdresses are decorated by their owner and each is unique. Silver coins, monkey fur, and dyed chicken feathers are just a few of the things that might decorate the headdress. The headdresses differ by subgroup. According to an article about the variations in Akha headdress, \"High Fashion, Hill Style\", the\n\n<blockquote>\"Ulo Akha headdress consists of a bamboo cone, covered in beads, silver studs and seeds, edged in coins (silver rupees for the rich, baht for the poor) topped by several dangling chicken feather tassels and maybe a woolen pom-pom. The Pamee Akha wear a trapezoidal colt cap covered in silver studs with coins on the beaded side flaps and long chains of linked silver rings hanging down each side. The Lomi Akha wear a round cap covered in silver studs and framed by silver balls, coins and pendants and the married women attach a trapezoidal inscribed plate at the back.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tudtu.tripod.com/hillsty1.htm|title=High Fashion, Hill Style|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n<gallery>\nFile:Akha woman, Myanmar.jpg|In Myanmar\nFile:Akha Laos 4-11-06.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha laos 11 03a.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Laos 11 03b.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Dress.JPG|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Woman.jpg|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Man in Thailand.jpg|An Akha man from Ban Mae Chan Tai, [[Chiang Rai Province]], Thailand\n</gallery>\n\n===Akha cuisine===\nThe main staple of Akha cuisine is highland rice.

In the last century, [[cotton]] and [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]] were the principal cash crops. More recent cash crops are chilies, soybeans, cabbages, and tomatoes. One or more families in a village may operate a small shop in their home selling items such as items as cigarettes and kerosene. Itinerant traders, either lowlanders or hill-dwelling Yunnan Chinese, come to buy livestock or cash crops, or to sell blankets and other goods.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nIncreasingly, the Akha find themselves, whether solicited or not, in the business of tourism, specifically [[ecotourism]]. Tourists pay a fee to Akha villages to be allowed to witness and participate in \"everyday\" Akha life, although much of what they see is often staged. The villagers dress up in their elaborate costumes and charge tourists to take photos with them. In addition to opening the village for visiting tourists, the Akha also sell their handicrafts, including hand woven baskets and even replicas of their traditional costumes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha Experience|url=http://greendiscoverylaos.com/nt-t-08.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rights, issues, and activism==\n[[File:Ahchooh Erica-Irene Daes.jpg|thumb|A representative of the Akha together with [[Erica-Irene Daes]], a driving force at the [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]], at the [[United Nations]] in New York, 2006]]\n[[File:Elderly Akha couple robbed by Thai army.jpg|thumb|Elderly Akha couple that was robbed by the [[Royal Thai Army|Thai army]]]]\n[[File:Electric.jpg|thumb|Arm wounds from having been subjected to [[electrocution]]]]\nBeing an ethnic minority with little easily accessible legal recourse, Akha everywhere have long been subject to rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nPerhaps the most important issue facing the Akha pertains to their land. The Akha relationship to land is vitally connected to the continuation of the Akha culture, but they rarely have \"official\" or state-sanctioned land rights or claims to their land as land rights are considered traditional. These conceptions of land are at odds with those held by the nation states whose land the Akha now occupy. Most Akha are not full-fledged citizens of the country they inhabit and are thus not allowed to legally purchase land, although most Akha villagers are too poor to even consider purchasing land.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIt has been reported{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} by rights groups that several land seizures of Akha land have been undertaken in the name of the Queen of Thailand. Originally a semi-nomadic people, the Akha are often relocated by the presiding national government to permanent villages, after which the government allegedly sells to logging companies and other private corporations access to lands formerly occupied by the Akha. The land onto which the Akha are displaced is almost always less fertile than their previous plots. On their new lands, the Akha can rarely produce enough food to sustain themselves and are often forced to leave and seek employment outside the villages, thus disrupting their traditional culture and economy.\n\nIn Thailand, laws have been passed that curb people's rights to the forest, including the 2007 Community Forest Act. According to the network of indigenous peoples in Thailand,\n<blockquote>\"These laws and resolutions have had severe impacts on indigenous peoples' rights to residence and land. Under these laws and resolutions millions of hectares of land have been declared as reserved and conservation forests, or protected areas. Today, 28.78% of Thailand is categorized as protected areas. As a result, thousands of farmers previously living in the forest or relying on the forest for their livelihood have been arrested and imprisoned and their lands seized. Cases have been filed against them for the so-called encroachment on government land.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/focus/section2/2010/12/indigenous-peoples-of-thailand.html|title=Indigenous Peoples of Thailand|publisher=Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite having signed and ratified the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the Thai government has not changed laws to adhere to those recommendations emphasizing respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and their full and effective participation in protected areas management and policy-making.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forest Peoples|url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas in Thailand; A Review |url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe reasons given for Akha relocations vary, but a common response on the part of the Thai government is to cite a concern for the preservation of forests and the promotion of more sustainable agricultural techniques than the slash and burn agriculture traditionally used by the Akha. The Thai government's involvement in relocation might also possibly be motivated by concerns of national security. According to international human rights lawyer Jonathan Levy,\n<blockquote>\"The Akha are identified with the opium growers who until recently dominated that portion of the \"Golden Triangle\" in Thailand. Thailand has taken steps to eradicate opium cultivation by resettling the Akha into permanent villages. However, both opium and long ingrained farming techniques are key to the complex Akha culture. While traditional opium cultivation has been suppressed, processed heroine and latest scourge, methamphetamine, is freely available from Burma. Thus Akha have become both impoverished farmers and in many cases narcotic addicts. As the Akha are resettled they come into contact with mainstream Thai culture, many Akha women are drawn to the \"easy\" money of the sex industry.\"<ref name=Levy /></blockquote>\n\nThe Akha are said to have the highest rates of addiction of all the hill tribes and are at the highest risk for contracting [[HIV]], [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], or an STD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/files/25230/11434696181167_EX_Prevention_of_HIV-AIDS_among_Ethnic_Minorities_Mekong.pdf/167%2BEX%2BPrevention%2Bof%2BHIV-AIDS%2Bamong%2BEthnic%2BMinorities%2BMekong.pdf |title=Prevention of HIV/AIDS among Ethnic Minorities of the Upper Mekong Region through Community-based Non-Formal and Formal Education|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> Measures have been undertaken by state and human rights organizations including the UNESCO Asia Pacific Regional Bureau for Education in Bangkok, and NCA in Lao PDR, to provide hill tribes, including the Akha, with \"comprehensive community-based, non-formal education\" on HIV and drug abuse prevention. In addition, detoxification clinics have been opened in the region, with particularly positive consequences for women who tend to have lower rates of addiction, but often bear the brunt of compensating for their missing partners financially and emotionally.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coehn|first=Paul|title=Opium-Reduction Programmes, Discourses of Addiction and Gender in Northwest Laos|journal=Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia|date=April 2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1\u201323 |jstor=41057073}}</ref>\n\nDespite their numbers, the Akha are the poorest of all the hill tribes. As roads bring accessibility and tourists, they provide relief from the poverty of village life, especially for the younger generations who increasingly find themselves engaged in labor outside the villages. Many villages report a population decrease as many leave to find work in the cities, often for very long periods. Many Akha complain that the younger generations are becoming increasingly less interested in traditional culture and ways and more and more susceptible to outside, mainstream, cultural influences. According to one author, where the village squares were once \"filled with the sounds of courtship songs\", radios are now more likely to play pop hits.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nAs it becomes increasingly difficult to remain self-sufficient through agriculture, and as roads open up the villages to the cities, the Akha must contend with the sometimes corrosive effects of the tourist industry. Not all Akha are happy to let tourists come in and observe village life. The Akha are often the objects of [[ecotourism]] which purports to open up remote spaces and people to Western tourists to expand their knowledge of the plight of the people and their perilous situation, and thus, expand their involvement in the fight to maintain their environment and way of life. It is pitched as \"responsible tourism\". There are many critiques{{by whom|date=September 2013}} of ecotourism as exploitative and a highly consumer-centered and contradictory activity{{clarify|What is a \"contradictory activity\" and why is it wrong?|date=September 2013}} including detrimental effects on the environment from the amount of jet engine fuel burned on the flight there and back, the additional amenities that must be built to cater to Western expectations, the pollution and garbage associated with a Western lifestyle, the disturbance of flora and fauna and a bevy of other concerns expressed by environmentalist voices.\n\nWhile ecotourism agencies claim to help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha feel{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} that they are being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people{{Who|date=September 2015}} do not see the tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive [[commercialization]] and [[commodification]] of their culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nMany Akha{{Who|date=September 2015}} complain of the missionaries that come to the villages to convert them, sometimes forcibly, to Christianity. Many Akha feel that the missionaries generalize about, or in this particular case, \"paganize\" the Akha traditional belief system, demeaning their longstanding beliefs. Some of the claims made against missionaries include the kidnapping of Akha children into orphanages and forced labor, the sterilization of Akha women and the forced or underpaid labor of Akha on farms. Many rights groups make the claim that the money spent by missionaries on building churches and furthering Christian education could be better spent on helping the Akha with medical and sanitation improvements that are greatly needed in most villages.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite AV media |title=Prisoners of A White God |people=Lichtag, Steve (director) |publisher=Twin Star |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Akha language]]\n* [[Matthew McDaniel]]\n* [[Prisoners of a White God]]\n* [[Clement Vismara]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=James C |authorlink=James C.

Few Akha in Thailand are citizens and most are registered as aliens. There is an oft cited lack of political or state infrastructure to address Akha, or any other indigenous issues in Thailand.<ref name=Levy />\n\nThe Akha are not always treated or addressed as equals by the people whose countries they now inhabit. Speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Myanmar and Thailand refer to them as \"gaw\" or \"ekaw\" (ikaw/ikho), terms which the Akha view as derogatory. In Laos the colloquial term used by Tai speakers to refer to the Akha is \"kho\" (ko), often prefaced by the word \"kha\", which means \"slave.\"<ref name=Kammerer />\n\n== Language ==\n[[File:Akha women.jpg|thumb|Akha women c. 1900.]]\nCalled \"Avkavdawv,\" meaning \"[[Akha language]],\" by its native speakers, Akha is a tonal language in the Lolo/Yi branch of the Sino-Tibetan family.

Note the large coffee drying platforms.]]\nDue to rapid social and economic changes in the regions the Akha inhabit, particularly the introduction of Western modes of capitalism, attempts to continue many of the traditional aspects of Akha life are increasingly difficult. Despite these challenges, Akha people practice many elements of their traditional culture with much success.\n\nAkha society lacks a strict system of social class and is considered [[egalitarian]]. Respect is typically accorded with age and experience. Ties of patrilineal kinship and marriage alliance bind the Akha within and between communities.<ref name=Kammerer /> Village structures may vary widely from the strictly traditional to Westernized, depending on their proximity to modern towns. Like many of the hill tribes, the Akha build their villages at higher elevations in the mountains.<ref name=Akha>{{cite web|title=An Overview of the Akha |url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhaoverview.html|accessdate=29 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAkha dwellings are traditionally constructed of logs, bamboo, and thatch and are of two types: \"low houses\", built on the ground, and \"high houses\", built on stilts. The semi-nomadic Akha, at least those who have not been moved to permanent village sites, typically do not build their houses as permanent residences and will often move their villages. Some say that this gives the dwellings a deceptively fragile and flimsy appearance, although they are quite well-built as proved over generations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Indigenous Peoples of the World - The Akha|url=http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Akha |accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nEntrances to all Akha villages are fitted with a wooden gate adorned with elaborate carvings on both sides depicting imagery of men and women. It is known as a \"spirit gate\". It marks the division between the inside of the village, the domain of man and domesticated animals, and the outside, the realm of spirits and wildlife. The gates function to ward off evil spirits and to entice favorable ones. Carvings can be seen on the roofs of the villager's houses as a second measure to control the flow of spirits.\n\nHouses are segregated by gender, with specific areas for men as well as a common space. This divide is said to mimic the function of the gate.<ref name=Hilltribe /> Another important feature found in most Akha villages is a tall four-posted village swing which is used in an annual ancestor offering related to the fertility of rice. The swing is built annually by an elder called a ''dzoeuh mah''.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe />\n<gallery>\nFile:Gate leading to the akha hilltribe village.jpg|An Akha \"Spirit Gate\" in Thailand\nFile:Akha Hut.JPG|Akha hut\nFile:Akha fishing.JPG|Akha fishing\nFile:Akha hilltribe, Chiang Rai Province P1110690.JPG| Akha, Chiang Rai Province\nFile:Akha village.jpg|An Akha village, with traditional thatched roofs, in northern [[Thailand]]\nFile:Akha Funeral1.JPG|Akha funeral ceremony\n</gallery>\n\n=== Traditional economy ===\n[[Image:Akha man with opium pipe.jpg|thumb|300 px|Akha man with [[opium pipe]] (1979)]]\nThe traditional form of subsistence for the Akha people has been, and remains, agriculture. The Akha grow a variety of crops including soybeans and vegetables. Rice is the most significant crop and is prominent in much of Akha culture and ritual. Most Akha plant dry-land rice, which depends solely on rainfall for moisture, but in some villages irrigation has been built to water [[paddy field]]s. Historically, some Akha villages cultivated [[opium]], but production diminished after the Thai government banned its cultivation.<ref name=Goodman-1996>{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=Jim|title=Meet the Akha|year=1996|publisher=White Lotus Co Ltd|location=Bangkok|isbn=9748496562|pages=113}}</ref>{{RP|113}}\n\nThe Akha have traditionally employed [[slash and burn]] agriculture, in which new fields are cleared by burning or cutting down forests and woodlands. In such a system, there is usually no market for land. Rights to land are considered traditional and established over many generations. This type of agriculture has contributed to the Akha's semi-nomadic status as villages move to clear new farmland with each successive burn cycle. The Thai government has forbidden this practice, citing its detrimental effects on the environment. The Akha have adapted to new types of subsistence farming, but the quality of their land has suffered as they are no longer allowed to expand onto new plots. In many cases, chemical fertilizers are the only option for re-fertilizing the land.<ref name=Akha />\n\nIn addition to their agricultural work, the Akha raise livestock including pigs, chickens, ducks, goats, cattle, and water buffalo to supplement their diets and to use for their secondary products. Children usually herd the animals. Akha women gather plants from the surrounding forests as well as eggs and insects the Akha will occasionally eat or use for medicinal purposes. The women and the men will often fish in the local lakes and streams. Some villages construct bee gums with the hope that a colony will nest there and their honey subsequently harvested.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Hilltribe /><ref name=Goodman-1996 />{{RP|113-115}}\n\nThe Akha are skilled hunters. Hunting is a male activity and a very popular one. It is a favorite pastime and a means of obtaining food. The barking deer is, perhaps, their favorite prey. Guns obtained from trading in the larger towns have begun to replace the use of crossbows in hunting.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Goodman-1996 />\n\n===Belief system===\n{{see also|Christianity in Ahka Villages}}\n[[File:Woman with child in Thailand..jpg|thumb|Akha woman with child (Thailand)]]\n[[File:Akha couple.JPG|thumb|Husband carrying the stem of a banana plant, to be fed to pigs]]\nAkha religion\u2014''zahv''\u2014is often described as a mixture of [[animism]] and ancestor worship that emphasizes the Akha connection with the land and their place in the natural world and cycles. Although Akha beliefs and rituals involve all of these elements, the Akha often reject the casual categorization of their practices as such saying it simplifies and reduces its meaning. The Akha way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties. Akha ethnicity is closely tied to the Akha religion. It might be said that to be considered an Akha ethnically by other Akhas is to practice the Akha religion.<ref name=Tooker>{{cite journal|last=Tooker|first=Deborah|title=Identity Systems of Highland Burma: 'Belief', Akha Zan, and a Critique of Interiorized Notions of Ethno-Religious Identity|journal=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=27|pages=799\u2013819|jstor=2804175}}</ref>\n\nThe annual ritual cycle consists of nine or twelve ancestor offerings, rice rituals, and other rites such as the building of the village gates. Many Akha rituals and festivals serve to seek \"blessings\" (''guivlahav'') from ancestors, which are according to the ''Encyclopedia of World Cultures'', \"...fertility and health in people, rice, and domesticated animals.\"<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Thailine /><ref name=Belief>{{cite web|title=The Akha Belief and Life System|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhabelieflife.html|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref> Akha beliefs are passed down through generations by oral recantation. The Akha believe that the being who created earth and life gave Akha the \"Akha Zang\" (Akha Way), their guidelines for life. Akhas believe that spirits and people were born of the same mother and lived together until a quarrel led to their separation, upon which spirits went into the forest and people remained in the villages. Since then, Akha believe that the spirits have caused illness and other unwelcome disruptions of human life. The Akha year is divided into the peoples' season (dry) and the spirits' season (wet). During the latter, spirits wander into the village, so they must be driven out as part of a yearly ancestor offering. Both people and rice are considered to have souls, the flight of which causes disease.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Belief />\n\nThe most important and revered position in Akha spiritual matters is given to a village leader, whose ritual responsibilities include initiating the annual rebuilding of the village gates and the swing as well as advising and instructing villages on important matters and settling disputes. Akha villages have an expert in ironworks called the ''pa jee'' who is considered of great significance in the village and who holds the second most important position within the society.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Iron Equipment Beating |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/the-lron-equipmente-beating.php|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most important festival of the year is commonly known as the Swing Festival. The four-day Akha Swing Festival comes in late-August each year and falls on the 120th day after the village has planted its rice. The Akha call the Swing Festival, ''Yehkuja'', which translates as \"eating bitter rice\", a phrase which references the previous year's dwindling rice supply incorporates the hope that monsoons will soon water the new crop. Festival activities include ritual offerings to family ancestral spirits at the ancestral altar in a corner of the women's side of the house. Offerings consist of bits of cooked food, water, and rice whiskey. The swing festival is particularly important for Akha women, who will display the clothing they spent all year making and who will show, through ornamentation, that they are becoming older and of marriageable age. Because the women dress up in their best traditional clothing and ornaments and perform traditional dances and songs for the villagers, the Swing Festival is also known as Women's New Year. The traditional New Year which falls in late-December is known as Men's New Year.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Jim |url=http://www.chiangmainews.com/ecmn/viewfa.php?id=497|accessdate=3 May 2012|newspaper=Chaing Mai City Life |title=The Akha Swing Festival|date=Sep 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sing Ceremony |url=http://www.hilltribe.org/akha/akha-swing.php|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Akha put a heavy emphasis on genealogy. An important tradition involves the recounting by Akha males of their patrilineal genealogy. During the most important ceremonies the list is recited in its entirety back over 50 generations to the first Akha, Sm Mi O. It is said that all Akha males should be able to do so. The recounting of this lineage plays a role in the incest taboo: If a male and female Akha find a common male ancestor within their last six generations, they are not allowed to marry.<ref name=Kammerer /><ref name=Goodman />\n\nThe Akha have several sets of rules governing matters on life, death, marriage, and birth. Akha traditionally marry in their teens or early twenties. Polygamy is permitted. Marriages may be village endogamous or exogamous. Wife-giving and -taking relationships are central to Akha society, with wife-givers superior to wife-takers.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nTwins are considered an extremely ominous occurrence, one where spirits are considered to interfere with human matters. The Akha believed that only animals could give birth to more than one offspring and therefore considered twins as beasts. Up until about 20 years or so ago, they would have been killed immediately. According to Laos locals, the practice is still common although the government is trying to discourage it. Akha men whose wives had given birth to twins would not be allowed to participate on the hunt for a specific period.<ref name=Tooker /><ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha and the Spirits|url=http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|accessdate=4 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610014852/http://www.chiangmai-chiangrai.com/hilltribe_akha.html|archive-date=10 June 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCertain types of death, like that caused by a tiger, are considered particularly bad; the bodies must be treated and buried in specific ways.\n\nMissionaries have been active among Akha, especially since the mid-20th century. Some Akha Christians live in separate Christian villages supported by missionary funds. Although many Akha people may be considered converts by the missionaries, nearly 100% practice some mixture of Christianity and traditional Akha beliefs.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite web|title=Joshua Project|url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-profile.php?peo3=10223&rog3=CH|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Dress ===\n[[File:MuangSing ThatXiengTung4 tango7174.jpg|thumb|That Xieng Tung Festival, Muang Sing, Laos. Akha young girls in the welcoming committee. On their arrival, visitors will have a color ribbon pinned to their blouse in exchange for a donation.]]\n\nThe Akha people are often noted for their very recognizable sartorial practices. Akha women spin cotton into thread with a hand spindle and weave it on a foot-treadle loom. The cloth is hand dyed with indigo. Women wear broad leggings, a short black skirt with a white beaded sporran, a loose fitting black jacket with heavily embroidered cuffs and lapels. Akha women are known for their embroidery skills. While traditional clothes are typically worn for special ceremonies, one is more likely to see Akha villagers in full traditional garb in areas that have heavy volumes of tourists, particularly in Thailand.\n\nThe headdresses worn by the women are perhaps the most spectacular and elaborate items of Akha dress. Akha women define their age or marital status with the style of headdress worn. At roughly age 12, the Akha female exchanges her child's cap for that of a girl. A few years later she will begin to don the ''jejaw'', the beaded sash that hangs down the front of her skirt and keeps it from flying up in the breeze. During mid-adolescence she will start wearing the adult woman's headdress. Headdresses are decorated by their owner and each is unique. Silver coins, monkey fur, and dyed chicken feathers are just a few of the things that might decorate the headdress. The headdresses differ by subgroup. According to an article about the variations in Akha headdress, \"High Fashion, Hill Style\", the\n\n<blockquote>\"Ulo Akha headdress consists of a bamboo cone, covered in beads, silver studs and seeds, edged in coins (silver rupees for the rich, baht for the poor) topped by several dangling chicken feather tassels and maybe a woolen pom-pom. The Pamee Akha wear a trapezoidal colt cap covered in silver studs with coins on the beaded side flaps and long chains of linked silver rings hanging down each side. The Lomi Akha wear a round cap covered in silver studs and framed by silver balls, coins and pendants and the married women attach a trapezoidal inscribed plate at the back.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tudtu.tripod.com/hillsty1.htm|title=High Fashion, Hill Style|accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n<gallery>\nFile:Akha woman, Myanmar.jpg|In Myanmar\nFile:Akha Laos 4-11-06.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha laos 11 03a.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Laos 11 03b.jpg|In Laos\nFile:Akha Dress.JPG|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Woman.jpg|In Thailand\nFile:Akha Man in Thailand.jpg|An Akha man from Ban Mae Chan Tai, [[Chiang Rai Province]], Thailand\n</gallery>\n\n===Akha cuisine===\nThe main staple of Akha cuisine is highland rice. Besides raising cattle, pigs and chickens, and growing crops such as rice, corn, a variety of vegetables, chilies and herbs, part of their ingredients comes from the forest, either gathered or hunted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akha.org/content/aboutakhalife/akhaoverview.html|title=An Overview of the Akha|website= The Akha Heritage Foundation |accessdate=1 October 2018}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Akha_cuisine_Nue-phueng_tzue-ze.JPG|''Nue phueng tzue-ze'': a sauce for on rice, made from peanuts, herbs and dried chili\nFile:Akha cuisine Sapi thong-uh.JPG|''Sapi thong-ueh'': a spicy sauce of tomato, fresh chilies, garlic, scallions, coriander/cilantro, and shallot, similar to a ''[[salsa (sauce)|salsa cruda]]''\nFile:Akha cuisine Manoh lu-uh.JPG|''Manoh lue-ueh'': sliced [[chayote]] fried with pork and garlic\nFile:Akha cuisine Hoh-pa cha-uh.JPG|Hoh-pa cha-ueh'': a soupy vegetable dish of [[kai-lan]] and pork\nFile:Akha cuisine Hoh-pa chae lu-uh.JPG|Hoh-pa chae lue-ueh'': stir-fried, pickled mustard greens\nFile:Akha cuisine Guchi chae.JPG|''Guchi chae'': fried, pickled roots of a certain type of onion\nFile:Akha cuisine Mochue cha-uh.JPG|''Mochue cha-lu'': a stew of potatoes and pork\n</gallery>\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Maejantai Chiang Rai province 08.JPG|thumb|Packing dried [[Coffea arabica|arabica coffee beans]] in Thailand]]\nAlthough primarily subsistence farmers, the Akha have long been involved in cash cropping and trade. In the last century, [[cotton]] and [[Opium poppy|opium poppies]] were the principal cash crops. More recent cash crops are chilies, soybeans, cabbages, and tomatoes. One or more families in a village may operate a small shop in their home selling items such as items as cigarettes and kerosene. Itinerant traders, either lowlanders or hill-dwelling Yunnan Chinese, come to buy livestock or cash crops, or to sell blankets and other goods.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nIncreasingly, the Akha find themselves, whether solicited or not, in the business of tourism, specifically [[ecotourism]]. Tourists pay a fee to Akha villages to be allowed to witness and participate in \"everyday\" Akha life, although much of what they see is often staged. The villagers dress up in their elaborate costumes and charge tourists to take photos with them. In addition to opening the village for visiting tourists, the Akha also sell their handicrafts, including hand woven baskets and even replicas of their traditional costumes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Akha Experience|url=http://greendiscoverylaos.com/nt-t-08.htm|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rights, issues, and activism==\n[[File:Ahchooh Erica-Irene Daes.jpg|thumb|A representative of the Akha together with [[Erica-Irene Daes]], a driving force at the [[Working Group on Indigenous Populations]], at the [[United Nations]] in New York, 2006]]\n[[File:Elderly Akha couple robbed by Thai army.jpg|thumb|Elderly Akha couple that was robbed by the [[Royal Thai Army|Thai army]]]]\n[[File:Electric.jpg|thumb|Arm wounds from having been subjected to [[electrocution]]]]\nBeing an ethnic minority with little easily accessible legal recourse, Akha everywhere have long been subject to rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nPerhaps the most important issue facing the Akha pertains to their land. The Akha relationship to land is vitally connected to the continuation of the Akha culture, but they rarely have \"official\" or state-sanctioned land rights or claims to their land as land rights are considered traditional. These conceptions of land are at odds with those held by the nation states whose land the Akha now occupy. Most Akha are not full-fledged citizens of the country they inhabit and are thus not allowed to legally purchase land, although most Akha villagers are too poor to even consider purchasing land.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIt has been reported{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} by rights groups that several land seizures of Akha land have been undertaken in the name of the Queen of Thailand. Originally a semi-nomadic people, the Akha are often relocated by the presiding national government to permanent villages, after which the government allegedly sells to logging companies and other private corporations access to lands formerly occupied by the Akha. The land onto which the Akha are displaced is almost always less fertile than their previous plots. On their new lands, the Akha can rarely produce enough food to sustain themselves and are often forced to leave and seek employment outside the villages, thus disrupting their traditional culture and economy.\n\nIn Thailand, laws have been passed that curb people's rights to the forest, including the 2007 Community Forest Act. According to the network of indigenous peoples in Thailand,\n<blockquote>\"These laws and resolutions have had severe impacts on indigenous peoples' rights to residence and land. Under these laws and resolutions millions of hectares of land have been declared as reserved and conservation forests, or protected areas. Today, 28.78% of Thailand is categorized as protected areas. As a result, thousands of farmers previously living in the forest or relying on the forest for their livelihood have been arrested and imprisoned and their lands seized. Cases have been filed against them for the so-called encroachment on government land.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/focus/section2/2010/12/indigenous-peoples-of-thailand.html|title=Indigenous Peoples of Thailand|publisher=Asia-Pacific Human Rights Information Center|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite having signed and ratified the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], the Thai government has not changed laws to adhere to those recommendations emphasizing respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and their full and effective participation in protected areas management and policy-making.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forest Peoples|url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Indigenous Peoples and Protected Areas in Thailand; A Review |url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/news/2011/01/Media%20briefing_Thailand_IPs_and_PAs_Sharing_%20Power_2011_Eng.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe reasons given for Akha relocations vary, but a common response on the part of the Thai government is to cite a concern for the preservation of forests and the promotion of more sustainable agricultural techniques than the slash and burn agriculture traditionally used by the Akha. The Thai government's involvement in relocation might also possibly be motivated by concerns of national security. According to international human rights lawyer Jonathan Levy,\n<blockquote>\"The Akha are identified with the opium growers who until recently dominated that portion of the \"Golden Triangle\" in Thailand. Thailand has taken steps to eradicate opium cultivation by resettling the Akha into permanent villages. However, both opium and long ingrained farming techniques are key to the complex Akha culture. While traditional opium cultivation has been suppressed, processed heroine and latest scourge, methamphetamine, is freely available from Burma. Thus Akha have become both impoverished farmers and in many cases narcotic addicts. As the Akha are resettled they come into contact with mainstream Thai culture, many Akha women are drawn to the \"easy\" money of the sex industry.\"<ref name=Levy /></blockquote>\n\nThe Akha are said to have the highest rates of addiction of all the hill tribes and are at the highest risk for contracting [[HIV]], [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], or an STD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/files/25230/11434696181167_EX_Prevention_of_HIV-AIDS_among_Ethnic_Minorities_Mekong.pdf/167%2BEX%2BPrevention%2Bof%2BHIV-AIDS%2Bamong%2BEthnic%2BMinorities%2BMekong.pdf |title=Prevention of HIV/AIDS among Ethnic Minorities of the Upper Mekong Region through Community-based Non-Formal and Formal Education|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> Measures have been undertaken by state and human rights organizations including the UNESCO Asia Pacific Regional Bureau for Education in Bangkok, and NCA in Lao PDR, to provide hill tribes, including the Akha, with \"comprehensive community-based, non-formal education\" on HIV and drug abuse prevention. In addition, detoxification clinics have been opened in the region, with particularly positive consequences for women who tend to have lower rates of addiction, but often bear the brunt of compensating for their missing partners financially and emotionally.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Coehn|first=Paul|title=Opium-Reduction Programmes, Discourses of Addiction and Gender in Northwest Laos|journal=Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia|date=April 2002|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1\u201323 |jstor=41057073}}</ref>\n\nDespite their numbers, the Akha are the poorest of all the hill tribes. As roads bring accessibility and tourists, they provide relief from the poverty of village life, especially for the younger generations who increasingly find themselves engaged in labor outside the villages. Many villages report a population decrease as many leave to find work in the cities, often for very long periods. Many Akha complain that the younger generations are becoming increasingly less interested in traditional culture and ways and more and more susceptible to outside, mainstream, cultural influences. According to one author, where the village squares were once \"filled with the sounds of courtship songs\", radios are now more likely to play pop hits.<ref name=Kammerer />\n\nAs it becomes increasingly difficult to remain self-sufficient through agriculture, and as roads open up the villages to the cities, the Akha must contend with the sometimes corrosive effects of the tourist industry. Not all Akha are happy to let tourists come in and observe village life. The Akha are often the objects of [[ecotourism]] which purports to open up remote spaces and people to Western tourists to expand their knowledge of the plight of the people and their perilous situation, and thus, expand their involvement in the fight to maintain their environment and way of life. It is pitched as \"responsible tourism\". There are many critiques{{by whom|date=September 2013}} of ecotourism as exploitative and a highly consumer-centered and contradictory activity{{clarify|What is a \"contradictory activity\" and why is it wrong?|date=September 2013}} including detrimental effects on the environment from the amount of jet engine fuel burned on the flight there and back, the additional amenities that must be built to cater to Western expectations, the pollution and garbage associated with a Western lifestyle, the disturbance of flora and fauna and a bevy of other concerns expressed by environmentalist voices.\n\nWhile ecotourism agencies claim to help in exposing the plight of indigenous people, many Akha feel{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} that they are being put on display for ecotourist groups, as they are encouraged or forced to wear their most elaborate ethnic clothing and perform ceremonies and rituals that have no meaning for them out of context. The Akha also participate in the regular tourist industry through the sale of their handicrafts and goods to local tourists, which they must often do under financial duress. Many of the Akha people{{Who|date=September 2015}} do not see the tourism as halting the Westernizing and globalizing pressures but, rather, as a coercive [[commercialization]] and [[commodification]] of their culture.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nMany Akha{{Who|date=September 2015}} complain of the missionaries that come to the villages to convert them, sometimes forcibly, to Christianity. Many Akha feel that the missionaries generalize about, or in this particular case, \"paganize\" the Akha traditional belief system, demeaning their longstanding beliefs. Some of the claims made against missionaries include the kidnapping of Akha children into orphanages and forced labor, the sterilization of Akha women and the forced or underpaid labor of Akha on farms. Many rights groups make the claim that the money spent by missionaries on building churches and furthering Christian education could be better spent on helping the Akha with medical and sanitation improvements that are greatly needed in most villages.<ref name=Akha /><ref>{{cite AV media |title=Prisoners of A White God |people=Lichtag, Steve (director) |publisher=Twin Star |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Akha language]]\n* [[Matthew McDaniel]]\n* [[Prisoners of a White God]]\n* [[Clement Vismara]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=James C |authorlink=James C.
