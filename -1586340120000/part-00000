The latter album was Prine's first to be charted in the US Top 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reflecting growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. Many veteran Prine fans view the release of 1978's ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' as a creative highpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Steve Goodman-produced album gave listeners songs such as \"The Hobo Song,\" \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone,\" and the title track.\n\nIn 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with \"[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]\", co-written by Prine and Goodman. The song good-naturedly spoofs stereotypical country music lyrics. Prine refused to take a songwriter's credit and the tune went to Goodman, although Goodman bought Prine a jukebox as a gift from his publishing royalties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMiLqHTvbKE|title=John Prine \u2013 You Never Even Call Me by My Name (1987)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Prine toured the U.S. and Canada with a full band featuring guitarist [[Arlen Roth]]. This was Prine's only tour with a full band.\n\nThe 1979 album ''[[Pink Cadillac (album)|Pink Cadillac]]'' features two songs produced by [[Sun Records]] founder [[Sam Phillips]], who by this time rarely did any studio work. The song \"Saigon,\" is about a Vietnam vet traumatized by the war (\"The static in my attic's gettin' ready to blow\"). During the recording, one of the guitar amps blew up (which is evident on the album). The other song Phillips produced is \"How Lucky,\" about Prine's hometown.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1981, rejecting the established model of the recording industry, which Prine felt exploited singers and songwriters, he co-founded the independent record label [[Oh Boy Records]]. His fans, supporting the project, sent him enough money to cover the costs, in advance, of his next album.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prine continued writing and recording albums throughout the 1980s. His songs continued to be covered by other artists; the country supergroup [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] recorded \"The 20th Century Is Almost Over,\" which had been written by Prine and Goodman. Steve Goodman died of leukemia in 1984 and Prine continued to perform many of Goodman's songs in concert, such as \"My Old Man.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1991, Prine released the [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''The Missing Years'', his first collaboration with producer and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|Heartbreakers]] bassist [[Howie Epstein]].

After receiving critical acclaim, Prine focused on his musical career, recording three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary, or which recollect melancholy tales from his life.\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

Highlights include the allegorical \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]],\" which includes a recitation and addresses the [[Vietnam War]], and the ballad \"Souvenirs,\" which Prine later recorded with Goodman.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSubsequent albums include ''[[Sweet Revenge (John Prine album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1973), containing such fan favorites as \"Dear Abby,\" \"Grandpa Was a Carpenter,\" and \"Christmas in Prison,\" and [[Common Sense (John Prine album)|''Common Sense'']] (1975), with \"Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\". The latter album was Prine's first to be charted in the US Top 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reflecting growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. Many veteran Prine fans view the release of 1978's ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' as a creative highpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Steve Goodman-produced album gave listeners songs such as \"The Hobo Song,\" \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone,\" and the title track.\n\nIn 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with \"[[You Never Even Called Me by My Name]]\", co-written by Prine and Goodman. The song good-naturedly spoofs stereotypical country music lyrics. Prine refused to take a songwriter's credit and the tune went to Goodman, although Goodman bought Prine a jukebox as a gift from his publishing royalties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMiLqHTvbKE|title=John Prine \u2013 You Never Even Call Me by My Name (1987)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Prine toured the U.S. and Canada with a full band featuring guitarist [[Arlen Roth]]. This was Prine's only tour with a full band.\n\nThe 1979 album ''[[Pink Cadillac (album)|Pink Cadillac]]'' features two songs produced by [[Sun Records]] founder [[Sam Phillips]], who by this time rarely did any studio work. The song \"Saigon,\" is about a Vietnam vet traumatized by the war (\"The static in my attic's gettin' ready to blow\"). During the recording, one of the guitar amps blew up (which is evident on the album). The other song Phillips produced is \"How Lucky,\" about Prine's hometown.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1981, rejecting the established model of the recording industry, which Prine felt exploited singers and songwriters, he co-founded the independent record label [[Oh Boy Records]]. His fans, supporting the project, sent him enough money to cover the costs, in advance, of his next album.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prine continued writing and recording albums throughout the 1980s. His songs continued to be covered by other artists; the country supergroup [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] recorded \"The 20th Century Is Almost Over,\" which had been written by Prine and Goodman. Steve Goodman died of leukemia in 1984 and Prine continued to perform many of Goodman's songs in concert, such as \"My Old Man.\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1991, Prine released the [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''The Missing Years'', his first collaboration with producer and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|Heartbreakers]] bassist [[Howie Epstein]].

The album contains songs such as \"Safety Joe,\" about a man who has never taken any risks in his life, and also \"Some Humans Ain't Human,\" Prine's protest piece on the album, which talks about the ugly side of [[human nature]] and includes a quick shot at President [[George W.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

''Fette biscottate'' (a cookie-like hard bread often eaten with hazelnut chocolate spread or butter and jam) and [[biscuit|biscotti]] (cookies) are commonly eaten. Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with [[barley]] coffee, or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt, and fruit juices are also common. If breakfast is eaten in a ''bar'' (coffee shop), it is composed of ''cappuccino'' and ''cornetto'' (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry).<ref>The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\nTypical Latvian breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches with toppings made of vegetables, fish, eggs, or cheese.

Very often light oat porridge is eaten too.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">And the New Scandinavian Cuisine Marcus Samuelsson {{ISBN|0618109412}}</ref> In general light, sour, and salty tasting food is common for morning meal. Latvians usually drink coffee for breakfast.\n\n===Malta===\nOn the island of [[Malta]], breakfast integrates both [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine|continental]] elements. Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, [[Swiss cheese]], and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead.

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy). Fried eggs with [[pastirma]] is also a common breakfast food in Egypt.\n\n=== Malawi ===\nFor breakfast, some children in Malawi eat porridge, [[cornbread]], savory [[fritter]]s, boiled starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, [[sweet potato]]es, or [[pumpkin]], and drink [[Sweet tea|sweet black tea]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html|title=What Kids Around the World Eat for Breakfast|last=Whitaker|first=Hannah|date=2014-10-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Morocco===\n[[File:Rghaif (detalle).jpg|thumb|right|[[Msemen]], a common breakfast in [[Moroccan cuisine]]]]\nFor breakfast, many Moroccans eat bread, harsha (semolina griddle cakes), or [[msemen]] (oiled pancakes) with olive oil, tea, and different kinds of Moroccan crepes.<ref name=\"fescooking.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine \u2013 Cooking Classes in Morocco &#124; Fes Cooking and Cultural Tours|author=Special Events|date=18 July 2013|publisher=Fescooking.com|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[Nigeria]] has over 250 different ethnic groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html|title=Africa :: Nigeria|publisher=cia.gov}}</ref> with a corresponding variety of cuisines.

Both of these cakes can be served with porridge and sugar known as ''koko''.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

Each dish is designed to be sampled and diners can go through a large selection of dim sum quickly accompanied by a generous amount of good tea. ''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast. Thus there is no single standard Indian breakfast, with items changing with regions. However, one can broadly classify breakfast varieties in India into two types: North Indian and South Indian.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

Frequently breakfast can be as simple as butter and jam on bread with tea. Iranians prefer to drink their hot black tea with sugar. Traditional cooked dishes for breakfast include [[haleem]] (wheat and chicken/lamb/turkey porridge eaten with cinnamon) or [[Khash (dish)|kale pache]] (sheep's feet, stomach, and other offal), adasi (green lentil soup), fried/boiled/soft-boiled eggs, ''omlet'' (eggs cooked in tomato sauce).\n\n===Israel===\n{{main|Israeli breakfast}}\n[[File:The 7 Breakfasts - Espresso Bar.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Israeli breakfast]]]]\nThe Israeli breakfast is a mix of culinary influences from eastern Europe, [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Yishuv]] culture, [[Maghreb cuisine|North African cuisine]], and [[Levantine cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonvoyageurs.com/2016/05/15/israeli-breakfast/|title=The Israeli breakfast \u2013 Best in the world!|last1=Gagnon|first1=Lynn|date=15 May 2016|website=BonVoyageurs|publisher=|access-date=19 May 2016}}</ref> It usually consists of a range of cheeses along with sliced vegetables, scrambled eggs (or another kind of fried egg)<ref name=\"Dubois\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GDy_1w83KEUC&pg=PA122&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22#v=onepage&q=%22Israeli%20breakfast%22&f=false|title=Cultures of the World: Israel|last=Dubois|first=Jill|last2=Rosh|first2=Mair|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|year=2004|isbn=9780761416692|location=[[Singapore]]|page=122|jfm=}}</ref><ref name=\"Marks\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gFK_yx7Ps7cC&pg=PT563&dq=%22Israeli+breakfast%22|title=Encyclopedia of Jewish Food|last=Marks|first=Gil|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=2010|isbn=9780544186316|location=[[Boston]]|jfm=|authorlink=Gil Marks}}</ref> and bread, served with spreads like butter, jam, or honey.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, [[Swiss cheese]], and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

Eating breakfast at a restaurant was unheard of until the 1990s; however cafes which serve breakfast until midday or all day are now common.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Zealand|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2002|isbn=1-74059-196-8|page=79}}</ref> The Big Breakfast is the main item at cafes, which is similar to the British cooked breakfast, except that it seldom includes black pudding. Other common menu items are: eggs done how you like, [[eggs benedict]], [[Baked beans|beans]] on toast, pancakes, cereal and yogurt, and [[smoothie]]s. Breakfast nearly always includes coffee, tea, or both, with children drinking milk either on their cereal, in a glass, or hot [[Milo (drink)|milo]]. Recent concern has been raised about the cost of milk and some families being unable to afford it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10773332|title=Fonterra takes fresh look at school milk \u2013 National \u2013 NZ Herald News|date=15 December 2011|accessdate=28 March 2012|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz}}</ref>\n\nA fast food franchise, [[McDonald's New Zealand]] offers a \"kiwi big breakfast\" which includes two sausages, hash brown, scrambled eggs, toasted muffin and choice of a small [[brewed coffee|filter coffee]], [[hot chocolate]], or tea.<ref>[http://mcdonalds.co.nz/our-food/menu/#/breakfast/kiwi-big-breakfast kiwi big breakfast]</ref> Some NGOs and charities, such as the [[New Zealand Red Cross]], provide breakfast to [[underclass]] primary school children.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0705/S00199.htm Children offered breakfast to start school day] Retrieved April 2013</ref> Survey results released in 2013 claim that nearly half of all New Zealanders skip breakfast at least once a week with almost a third of those skipping breakfast up to three times a week.<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU1302/S00224/back-to-work-back-to-schoolback-to-breakfast.htm Back to work, back to school ... back to breakfast!]</ref>\n\n==South America==\n{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Argentina===\nIn Argentina, breakfast is simple: [[Tostada (toast)|tostadas,]] often topped with butter and marmalade, or [[Croissant|medialunas]], usually served with [[milk coffee]] and orange juice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://therealargentina.com/en/keep-it-simple-a-real-argentina-breakfast/|title=Argentinean breakfast: tostadas and medialunas|website=therealargentina.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-16}}</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nBreakfast in Brazil tends to be lighter as \"Brazilians consider lunch to be a more important meal\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/what-brazilians-have-for-breakfast|title=What Brazilians Have for Breakfast|work=The Brazil Business|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}</ref> It is called ''caf\u00e9 da manh\u00e3'' in Portuguese, which translates to \u201cmorning coffee\u201d, and consists of a combination of bread, butter, jam, fruits, cheese, ham, eggs, cereal, ''[[Cheese bun|p\u00e3o de queijo]]'', cakes, coffee, milk, and fruit juice.<ref name=\":0\" /> Regional differences also exist.\n\nChildren may drink milk mixed with a small amount of coffee with their breakfasts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Gallery==\n<!--please don't add images from all possible countries;
