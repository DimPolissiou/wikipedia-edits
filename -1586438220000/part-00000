The fifth bus contained eleven passengers who were foreign nationals, had no next of kin, or were otherwise individuals no one would report as missing. The buses were contracted by Unified Dynamic Systems (UDS), a large corporation involved in many industries. After getting some information from a translator, Michaela locates a farm where UDS is experimenting on the eleven passengers, but she and Jared are chased away by armed men. Ben confronts Vance about the missing passengers, believing the NSA is behind their disappearance and threatens to tell the press. Although Vance has dossiers on the eleven passengers showing they are accounted for, he leads a team to investigate the farm location.

Following an Xer meeting, Simon advises Jared to keep an eye on Billy as he can be a loose cannon. Michaela and Drea witness Jared leaving the bar and kissing Tamara. After Drea infiltrate the bar and interacts with Billy, Michaela finds that Billy has had some arrest records. As the ruined nightclub is used for memorials, Ben's latest Calling takes him to a zen mediation center. When he brings Olive, another chanting Calling leads them underground where they find TJ still alive underground. With a warrant from Judge Trilling, Michaela secretly plants a bug in the bar, obtains evidence Jared is working with the Xers, and gives it to Bowers. Bowers privately shares the information with Jared. Saanvi kisses her former lover and fellow doctor, Alex, in a park.

Michaela states that she won't continue until she gets a [[union representative]] by her side. Jared confronts Simon about the situation, and Simon says Michaela is a threat who must be disposed of. Cal's latest Calling is shared with Ben, Grace, and a recuperating TJ, where they try to build something during what appears to be a thunderstorm outside. Thanks to some clues, they managed to pull together a makeshift ship's rigging, which briefly places them on an ancient boat from which they see Flight 828 in the sky; they also learn that the ancient mariners who tried to get rid of the Callings went mad. Alex is able to get a counter-agent injected into Saanvi as she advises her to be careful.

Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes).

It played a major role in most colonies in battling the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765.<ref>John Phillips Resch, ed., culture, and the homefront'' (MacMillan Reference Library, 2005) 1: 174-75</ref>  The group officially disbanded after the Stamp Act was repealed.

Furthermore, a unifying name helped to promote inter-Colonial efforts against Parliament and the Crown's actions.

Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative.

In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].\n\nThe Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H.

In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty. \n\n==Flags==\nIn 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-am\u00e9ricaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1\u201360|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Sons of Liberty==\n[[File:Sons of Liberty.jpg|thumb|'''1st row:''' [[Samuel Adams]] \u2022 [[Benedict Arnold]] \u2022 [[John Hancock]] \u2022 [[Patrick Henry]] \u2022 [[James Otis, Jr.]]  '''2nd row:''' [[Paul Revere]] \u2022 [[James Swan (financier)|James Swan]] \u2022 [[Alexander McDougall]] \u2022 [[Benjamin Rush]] \u2022 [[Charles Thomson]]  '''3rd row:''' [[Joseph Warren]] \u2022 [[Marinus Willett]] \u2022 [[Oliver Wolcott]] \u2022 [[Christopher Gadsden]] \u2022 [[Haym Salomon]] <br>'''Not pictured''': [[Hercules Mulligan]], [[Thomas Melvill (American patriot)|Thomas Melvill]], [[Isaac Sears]]]]\n=== Boston ===\n* [[Samuel Adams]] \u2013 political writer, [[tax collector]], cousin of [[John Adams]], fire warden.

It played a major role in most colonies in battling the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] in 1765.<ref>John Phillips Resch, ed., culture, and the homefront'' (MacMillan Reference Library, 2005) 1: 174-75</ref>  The group officially disbanded after the Stamp Act was repealed.

Furthermore, a unifying name helped to promote inter-Colonial efforts against Parliament and the Crown's actions. Their motto became \"[[No taxation without representation]].\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Lambert|title=James Habersham: loyalty, politics, and commerce in colonial Georgia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1O8bFseJBfkC&pg=PA173|year=2005|publisher=U. of Georgia Press|isbn=978-0-8203-2539-2|page=173}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Philip Dawe (attributed), The Bostonians Paying the Excise-man, or Tarring and Feathering (1774) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Bostonian Paying the Excise-Man'', 1774 British propaganda print, referring to the tarring and feathering, of Boston Commissioner of Customs [[John Malcolm (Loyalist)|John Malcolm]] four weeks after the Boston Tea Party.

Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative. This became commonly known as \"[[No Taxation without Representation]].\" Parliament insisted on its right to rule the colonies despite the fact that the colonists had no representative in Parliament.<ref>John C.

In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].\n\nThe Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===New York===\nIn December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the ''Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York,\" which formally stated that they were opposed to the [[Tea Act]] and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was \"an enemy to the liberties of America\" and that \"whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=T.

In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty. \n\n==Flags==\nIn 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.  This flag was also associated with the Sons of Liberty. Red and white were common colors of the flags, although other color combinations were used, such as green and white or yellow and white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us%5Erv.html|title=Colonial and Revolutionary War Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-librt.html#sons|title=Liberty Flags (U.S.)|website=www.crwflags.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=raven&id=raven_2004_0011_0001_0060|title=The First Navy Jack|first1=Peter|last1=Ansoff|first2=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-am\u00e9ricaine de|last2=vexillologie|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|journal=Raven: A Journal of Vexillology|volume=11|pages=1\u201360|accessdate=10 January 2018|doi=10.5840/raven2004111}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Sons of Liberty==\n[[File:Sons of Liberty.jpg|thumb|'''1st row:''' [[Samuel Adams]] \u2022 [[Benedict Arnold]] \u2022 [[John Hancock]] \u2022 [[Patrick Henry]] \u2022 [[James Otis, Jr.]]  '''2nd row:''' [[Paul Revere]] \u2022 [[James Swan (financier)|James Swan]] \u2022 [[Alexander McDougall]] \u2022 [[Benjamin Rush]] \u2022 [[Charles Thomson]]  '''3rd row:''' [[Joseph Warren]] \u2022 [[Marinus Willett]] \u2022 [[Oliver Wolcott]] \u2022 [[Christopher Gadsden]] \u2022 [[Haym Salomon]] <br>'''Not pictured''': [[Hercules Mulligan]], [[Thomas Melvill (American patriot)|Thomas Melvill]], [[Isaac Sears]]]]\n=== Boston ===\n* [[Samuel Adams]] \u2013 political writer, [[tax collector]], cousin of [[John Adams]], fire warden.

Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each losing semi-finalist as well as each finalist receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a [[third place play-off]], UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2006/08 |url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=11 July 2016 |location=2.08 |page=3 |format=PDF}}</ref> and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2010\u201312 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/euro/91/87/57/918757_download.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=4 July 2012 |location=3.08 |page=4 |format=PDF}}</ref> However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\">{{cite web |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2014\u201316 |url=https://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/Regulations/uefaorg/Regulations/02/03/92/81/2039281_DOWNLOAD.pdf |publisher=UEFA |accessdate=2 September 2016 |location=4.08 |page=11 |format=PDF}}</ref> Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n==Format==\n\n===The competition===\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\nFor 2016, the competition has increased to 24 teams. In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by [[Scotland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and the inclusion of [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]]. The new president of [[UEFA]], [[Michel Platini]], was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's Executive Committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September, it was announced by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]] through home and away [[Playoffs#Association football|play-offs]]; from [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] through a combination of both [[Tournament#Group tournaments|qualifying groups]] and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n===Qualifying===\n{{Main|UEFA European Championship qualifying}}\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]. Seeded teams include reigning champions, and other teams on the basis of their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n# Average goal difference.\n# Average number of goals scored.\n# Average number of away goals scored.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. As with most leagues, [[Three points for a win|the points are awarded as three for a win]], one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Results of all group matches:\n## Superior goal difference\n## Higher number of goals scored\n## Higher number of goals scored away from home\n## Fair play conduct.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\n===Final tournament===\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 tournament]]. They were joint hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], the winners and the highest ranked second placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, subject to qualification, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]]. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using [[UEFA coefficient|coefficients]] as a basis.\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\"/>\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the [[FIFA World Cup]], this tournament no longer has a [[third place playoff]].\n\n==Results==\n{{See also|List of UEFA European Championship finals}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;

From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\nFor 2016, the competition has increased to 24 teams. In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by [[Scotland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and the inclusion of [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]]. The new president of [[UEFA]], [[Michel Platini]], was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's Executive Committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7479293.stm |title=Uefa sets deadline over Euro 2012 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> On 25 September, it was announced by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7636495.stm |title=Uefa to expand Euro Championship |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=26 September 2008 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in [[1960 European Nations' Cup|1960]] and [[1964 European Nations' Cup|1964]] through home and away [[Playoffs#Association football|play-offs]]; from [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]] through a combination of both [[Tournament#Group tournaments|qualifying groups]] and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980]], the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n===Qualifying===\n{{Main|UEFA European Championship qualifying}}\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using [[Seed (sports)|seeding]]. Seeded teams include reigning champions, and other teams on the basis of their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n# Average goal difference.\n# Average number of goals scored.\n# Average number of away goals scored.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. As with most leagues, [[Three points for a win|the points are awarded as three for a win]], one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n# Results of all group matches:\n## Superior goal difference\n## Higher number of goals scored\n## Higher number of goals scored away from home\n## Fair play conduct.\n# Drawing of lots.\n\n===Final tournament===\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 tournament]]. They were joint hosts [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], the winners and the highest ranked second placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, subject to qualification, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualifying]]. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using [[UEFA coefficient|coefficients]] as a basis.\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.<ref name=\"regulations 2016\"/>\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progresses to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]] are employed to separate the two teams.
