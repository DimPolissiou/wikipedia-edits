It was released on June 17, 2008, by [[Capitol Records]]. During its production, Perry was dropped from two record labels and went through two canceled albums. She collaborated with producers [[Greg Wells]], [[Dr. Luke]], [[David A. Stewart]], and [[Max Martin]], among others, on the album, and wrote all of its songs with assistance of other producers and writers. The [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Ur So Gay (EP)|Ur So Gay]]'', containing the [[Ur So Gay|promotional single of the same name]], was released to generate interest in the singer and the album.\n\n''One of the Boys'' is Perry's first on a major label and first under the stage name Katy Perry, following her debut ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'', which was released under her real name on [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]]. It received mixed reception from critics, with some deeming it as being filled with \"potential hits\" and others criticizing Perry's vocal performance. Commercially, it debuted at number nine on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 47,000 copies in its first week of sales, and also peaked within the top-ten charts in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, and Switzerland. ''One of the Boys'' earned Perry two [[Grammy Award]] nominations, and has sold 7 million copies worldwide, being her 2nd highest-selling album to date. It has been certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\nThe album's lead single \"[[I Kissed a Girl]]\" became Perry's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one single; the second single \"[[Hot n Cold]]\" reached number three in the United States, while topping the charts in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria. The third single \"[[Thinking of You (Katy Perry song)|Thinking of You]]\" reached the top-thirty in the US, while the final single \"[[Waking Up in Vegas]]\" became a top-ten hit. To further promote the album, Perry embarked on three tours: the 2008 [[Warped Tour]], her first solo world tour, the [[Hello Katy Tour]], and served as an opening act in [[No Doubt]]'s [[2009 Summer Tour]].\n\n==Background==\nPerry's change in record label, and adoption of a pseudonymous surname accompanied a shift from the Christian rock of her debut album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]''.<ref>[http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ \"One of the Boys: Pop singer Katy Perry talks about her forthcoming album\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615020058/http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ |date=June 15, 2008 }}.

It was released on June 17, 2008 by [[Capitol Records]]. During its production, Perry was dropped from two record labels and went through two canceled albums. She collaborated with producers [[Greg Wells]], [[Dr. Luke]], [[David A. Stewart]], and [[Max Martin]], among others, on the album, and wrote all of its songs with assistance of other producers and writers. The [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Ur So Gay (EP)|Ur So Gay]]'', containing the [[Ur So Gay|promotional single of the same name]], was released to generate interest in the singer and the album.\n\n''One of the Boys'' is Perry's first on a major label and first under the stage name Katy Perry, following her debut ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]'', which was released under her real name on [[Pamplin Music|Red Hill Records]]. It received mixed reception from critics, with some deeming it as being filled with \"potential hits\" and others criticizing Perry's vocal performance. Commercially, it debuted at number nine on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 47,000 copies in its first week of sales, and also peaked within the top-ten charts in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, and Switzerland. ''One of the Boys'' earned Perry two [[Grammy Award]] nominations, and has sold 7 million copies worldwide, being her 2nd highest-selling album to date. It has been certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].\n\nThe album's lead single \"[[I Kissed a Girl]]\" became Perry's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one single; the second single \"[[Hot n Cold]]\" reached number three in the United States, while topping the charts in Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Austria. The third single \"[[Thinking of You (Katy Perry song)|Thinking of You]]\" reached the top-thirty in the US, while the final single \"[[Waking Up in Vegas]]\" became a top-ten hit. To further promote the album, Perry embarked on three tours: the 2008 [[Warped Tour]], her first solo world tour, the [[Hello Katy Tour]], and served as an opening act in [[No Doubt]]'s [[2009 Summer Tour]].\n\n==Background==\nPerry's change in record label, and adoption of a pseudonymous surname accompanied a shift from the Christian rock of her debut album ''[[Katy Hudson (album)|Katy Hudson]]''.<ref>[http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ \"One of the Boys: Pop singer Katy Perry talks about her forthcoming album\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615020058/http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/news/One_Of_The_Boys/30669/p1/ |date=June 15, 2008 }}.

He is god of justice therefore known as '''Dharmaraja'''. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding [[Svarga|heaven]] or the [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj is the seventeenth [[Manasputra]] of Lord [[Brahma]]. \n\nChitragupta is believed to be created from Lord Bramha's soul & mind(chitt) and thus, alloted the right to write [[Vedas]] like [[Brahmins]] with the duty of a [[Kshatriya]] (''Chitragupta  is the patron deity of [[Kayastha]]s, a Hindu caste of India and Nepal).<ref>{{Cite book |section-url=https://archive.org/details/ethnographicalno00chanrich/page/n73/mode/1up |title=Ethnographical notes on Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu |last=Gupte |first=TV |year=1904 |page=8 |section=Appendix I.(page 7) Translation of the letter addressed by the Benaras Pandits to the Peshwa Darbar|quote=\"Kayasthas are said to be of three sorts (kinds)\u2014 (1) the Chitragupta Kayasthas (2) Dhalbhaga Gatri Kshatriya Kayasthas and (3) Kayasthas of the mixed blood. The origin of Chitraguptavanshi Kayasthas is given in the Puranas. He was born from the body of Brahma while he was contemplating how he should know the good and evil acts of living beings. He was a brilliant person with pen and ink in his hands. He was known as Chitragupta and was placed near the God of death. He was appointed to record the good and evil acts of men. He was a Brahmin possessed of supra sensible knowledge. He was a god sharing the offerings at sacrifices. All the Brahmins offer him oblations of rice before taking their meals. He is called Kayastha because of his origin from the body of Brahma. Many descendants of his bearing different Gotras still exist on this earth. From this it will be seen that Kayastha Brahmins of Karhada and Khandesha are the Brahma-Kayasthas. Now about the origin of Chandraseniya Kshatriya Kayastha.....\"}}</ref>\n\nLord Brahma had many various sons and daughters in various  structures, including many seers born of his mind, such as Vashishta, Narada, and Atri, and many sons born of his body, such as Dharma, Delusion, Lust, Death, and Bharata. The story of the birth of Chitragupta is related in different ways, but he is nearly always delineated differently from the other children of Lord Brahma, and a common thread is that many Rishi's are born directly of Lord Brahma\u2019s body.\n\nIn one popular version of the creation myth of Chitragupta, it is said that Lord Brahma gave the land of the dead over to the god Yama, also known as Yamraj. Yama would become confused sometimes when dead souls would come to him, and would occasionally send the wrong souls to either heaven or hell. Lord Brahma commanded him to keep better track of everyone, and Yama declared that he could not reasonably be expected to keep track of the many people born of the eighty-four hundred thousand different life forms of planet Earth.\n\nLord Brahma, determined to solve this problem for Yama, sat in meditation for many thousands of years. Finally he opened his eyes, and a man stood before him with a sword, pen and paper. As Chitragupta was born of Brahma's body or kaya in Sanskrit, Brahma declared that his children would forever be known as Kayasthas. \nChitragupta is sometimes also referred to as the first man to use letters, and is hailed that way in the Garud Puran. He is known as being incredibly meticulous, and with his pen and paper he tracks every action of every sentient life form, building up a record of them over the course of their life so that when they die the fate of their soul can be easily determined.

Lord Brahma went into meditation. Chitragupta sprang from his body and stood before him bearing an inkpot and a pen. The god Brahma (creator) said: \"Because you are sprung from my body (kaya), therefore you shall be called Kayastha and as you existed in my body unseen I give you the name of Chitragupta. Let the Kshatriya dharma be followed by you and your progeny.\" He then assumed charge of Yamapuri. Dharmaraja married his daughter Irawati to Chitragupta and [[Sraddhadeva Manu]](Manu), son of Surya (the Sun) married his daughter Sudakhina(some people say dakshina or nandini) to him.\" Chitragupta had eight sons from the former and four from the latter and these twelve sons became the progenitors of the twelve subdivisions of the Chitraguptavansi Kayasthas, namely Saxena, Mathur, Gaur, Nigam, Ashthana, Kulshrestha, Suryadwaja, Bhatnagar, Ambastha, Shrivastava, Karna and Vaalmik.\n*'''[[Padma Purana]]''' after stating the legend says: \"Chitragupta was placed near Dharamaraj to register the good and evil actions of all sentient beings, that he was possessed of supernatural wisdom and became the partaker of sacrifices offered to the gods and fire. It is for this reason that the twice-born always give him oblations from their food. As he sprang from the body of Lord Brahma he was called Kayastha of numerous gotras on the face of the earth.\"\n*'''[[Bhavishya Purana]]''' states that God, the Creator, gave the name and duties of Chitragupta as follows: Because you have sprung from my body, therefore, you shall be called Kayastha and shall be famous in the world by the name of Chitragupta. Oh my son, let your residence be always in the region of the God of justice for the purpose of determining the merits and demerits of men.\n*'''Vignana Tantra''' says the same thing.\n*The same is the enjoinment of Lord Brahma to Chitragupta according to '''Brihat Brahma Khanda'''. He was named Kayastha having sprung from the body (kaya) of Lord Brahma. He was directed to perform all sanskars and to have writing as his profession.\n*'''[[Garuda Purana]]''' describes the imperial throne of Chitragupta in Yamapuri holding his Court and dispensing justice according to the deeds of men and maintaining their record, in the following words: (There Dharmaraja, Chitragupta, Sravana and others see all sins and virtues remaining concealed in the bodies of men).\n*'''[[The Mahabharata]] (Anusasan Parva, chapter 130)''' recites the teaching of Chitragupta requiring men to do virtuous and charitable acts and performing Yagya, saying that men are rewarded or punished according to their good or bad deeds.\n\n==Legends==\nChitragupta came into being after Brahma, the creator, having established the four varnas \u2014 [[Brahmin]](The Learned), [[Kshatriya]](The Warriors), [[Vaishya]](Merchant) and [[Shudra]](Labourer or Farmer) \u2014 ordained Dharamraj (also called Yamraj, the god of death) to keep record of the deeds \u2014 good and evil \u2014 of all life-forms born and yet to be born on earth, in the heavens above and in the lands below.

He is god of justice therefore known as '''Dharmaraja'''. Upon their death, Chitragupta has the task of deciding [[Svarga|heaven]] or the [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] for the humans, depending on their actions on the earth. Chitragupta Maharaj is the seventeenth [[Manasputra]] of Lord [[Brahma]]. Chitragupta is believed to be created from Lord Bramha's soul & mind(chitt) and thus, alloted the right to write [[Vedas]] like [[Brahmins]] with the duty of a [[Kshatriya]] (''Chitragupta  is the patron deity of [[Kayastha]]s, a Hindu caste of India and Nepal).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLord Brahma had many various sons and daughters in various  structures, including many seers born of his mind, such as Vashishta, Narada, and Atri, and many sons born of his body, such as Dharma, Delusion, Lust, Death, and Bharata. The story of the birth of Chitragupta is related in different ways, but he is nearly always delineated differently from the other children of Lord Brahma, and a common thread is that many Rishi's are born directly of Lord Brahma\u2019s body.\n\nIn one popular version of the creation myth of Chitragupta, it is said that Lord Brahma gave the land of the dead over to the god Yama, also known as Yamraj. Yama would become confused sometimes when dead souls would come to him, and would occasionally send the wrong souls to either heaven or hell. Lord Brahma commanded him to keep better track of everyone, and Yama declared that he could not reasonably be expected to keep track of the many people born of the eighty-four hundred thousand different life forms of planet Earth.\n\nLord Brahma, determined to solve this problem for Yama, sat in meditation for many thousands of years. Finally he opened his eyes, and a man stood before him with a sword, pen and paper. As Chitragupta was born of Brahma's body or kaya in Sanskrit, Brahma declared that his children would forever be known as Kayasthas. \nChitragupta is sometimes also referred to as the first man to use letters, and is hailed that way in the Garud Puran. He is known as being incredibly meticulous, and with his pen and paper he tracks every action of every sentient life form, building up a record of them over the course of their life so that when they die the fate of their soul can be easily determined. These perfect and complete documents are referred to in mystical traditions as the Akashic records, and as they contain the actions of each person from birth to death, they can be said to contain every action taken in the universe.\n\nItems associated with Chitragupta in his puja include the Sword, paper and pen, ink, honey, betel nut, matches, mustard, ginger, jaggery, sugar, sandalwood, and frankincense. A puja is often performed to Chitragupta in reverence of the four virtues he is seen to embody: justice, peace, literacy, and knowledge. Part of the Chitragupta puja also includes writing down how much money you make in your household, and how much you need to make to survive in the following year, while making offerings of turmeric, flowers, and vermilion\n\n==Family==\n\nFirst Wife: Nandini Aravati, Grand daughter of Sun God and daughter of [[Shraddhadeva Manu]].\nSons from her:\n# Dhramdhwaja, he founded [[Srivastava]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Dhramyuj, he founded Gaur [[Kayastha]]\n# Samdayalu, he founded [[Saxena]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Yugandhar, he founded [[Mathur (subcaste)|Mathur]] [[Kayastha]]\n\nSecond wife: Shobhvati, daughter of [[Yamaraj]]. \n# Sumti, he founded [[Karan Kayastha]]\n# Damodar, he founded [[Nigam]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Bhanuprakash, he founded [[Bhatnagar]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Himvaan, he founded [[Ambashtha]]  [[Kayastha]]\n# Dindayalu, he founded [[Asthana]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Sadanand, he founded [[Kulshreshtha]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Raghavram, he founded [[Valmiki]] [[Kayastha]]\n# Vibhanu, he founded Suryadhwaj [[Kayastha]]\nAll Kayastha are descendants of Brahma and hence considered as equal to brahmins but, Lord Brahma ordained the role of upholding dharna followed by Lord Chitragupta and his descendants to dispense knowledge of justice.\n\nBrahmin varna man is allowed to marry woman of Kshatriya varna according to Anuloma Marriage law of Hindus.

To the right of Yama sits Chitragupta, assigned with keeping detailed records of every human being and upon their death deciding how they are to be reincarnated, depending on their previous actions.]]\n*'''The Yama Samhita''', an extract from the 9th chapter of Ahilya Kamdhenu, a work of Hindu Law, says that Dharamaraja complained to Lord Brahma about his difficulties in performing his most responsible duties of keeping records of the deeds of men and doing justice to them. Lord Brahma went into meditation. Chitragupta sprang from his body and stood before him bearing an inkpot and a pen. The god Brahma (creator) said: \"Because you are sprung from my body (kaya), therefore you shall be called Kayastha and as you existed in my body unseen I give you the name of Chitragupta. Let the Kshatriya dharma be followed by you and your progeny.\" He then assumed charge of Yamapuri. Dharmaraja married his daughter Irawati to Chitragupta and [[Sraddhadeva Manu]](Manu), son of Surya (the Sun) married his daughter Sudakhina(some people say dakshina or nandini) to him.\" Chitragupta had eight sons from the former and four from the latter and these twelve sons became the progenitors of the twelve subdivisions of the Chitraguptavansi Kayasthas, namely Saxena, Mathur, Gaur, Nigam, Ashthana, Kulshrestha, Suryadwaja, Bhatnagar, Ambastha, Shrivastava, Karna and Vaalmik.\n*'''[[Padma Purana]]''' after stating the legend says: \"Chitragupta was placed near Dharamaraj to register the good and evil actions of all sentient beings, that he was possessed of supernatural wisdom and became the partaker of sacrifices offered to the gods and fire. It is for this reason that the twice-born always give him oblations from their food. As he sprang from the body of Lord Brahma he was called Kayastha of numerous gotras on the face of the earth.\"\n*'''[[Bhavishya Purana]]''' states that God, the Creator, gave the name and duties of Chitragupta as follows: Because you have sprung from my body, therefore, you shall be called Kayastha and shall be famous in the world by the name of Chitragupta. Oh my son, let your residence be always in the region of the God of justice for the purpose of determining the merits and demerits of men.\n*'''Vignana Tantra''' says the same thing.\n*The same is the enjoinment of Lord Brahma to Chitragupta according to '''Brihat Brahma Khanda'''. He was named Kayastha having sprung from the body (kaya) of Lord Brahma. He was directed to perform all sanskars and to have writing as his profession.\n*'''[[Garuda Purana]]''' describes the imperial throne of Chitragupta in Yamapuri holding his Court and dispensing justice according to the deeds of men and maintaining their record, in the following words: (There Dharmaraja, Chitragupta, Sravana and others see all sins and virtues remaining concealed in the bodies of men).\n*'''[[The Mahabharata]] (Anusasan Parva, chapter 130)''' recites the teaching of Chitragupta requiring men to do virtuous and charitable acts and performing Yagya, saying that men are rewarded or punished according to their good or bad deeds.\n\n==Legends==\nChitragupta came into being after Brahma, the creator, having established the four varnas \u2014 [[Brahmin]](The Learned), [[Kshatriya]](The Warriors), [[Vaishya]](Merchant) and [[Shudra]](Labourer or Farmer) \u2014 ordained Dharamraj (also called Yamraj, the god of death) to keep record of the deeds \u2014 good and evil \u2014 of all life-forms born and yet to be born on earth, in the heavens above and in the lands below. Dharamraj, however, complained, \"O Lord, how can I alone keep record of the deeds of the beings born into 84 lakh yonis <!-- Female genitalia, divine passage, womb or sacred temple ?? This was introduced 11:04, 3 April 2006 by 210.18.119.115 --> (life-forms) in the three worlds\"\n\nLord Brahma went into meditation for 11, 000 years and when he opened his eyes he saw a man holding pen and ink-pot in his hands and a sword girdled to his waist. Brahma spoke: ''\"Thou hast been created from my body (Kaya), therefore shall thy progeny be known as the Kayasthas. Thou hast been conceived in my mind (Chitta or Chitra) and in secrecy (gupta), thy name shall also be Chitragupta. Let the role of a Kshatriya be followed by thee and thy progeny \"'' Brahma then enjoined him to dispense justice and punish those who violated the dharma.\n\nIn the ''Garuda Purana'', Chitragupta is hailed as the first man to give the script.\n\n:::'''''Chitragupta namastubhyam vedaksaradatre'''''\n::: (Obeisance to Chitragupta, the giver of letters)\n\nIn the legends of Chitragupta as well as in the Vedas, he is referred to as the greatest king, while the rest are \"Rajakas,\" or little kings.\n\n\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0907\u0926 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0915\u093e \u0907\u0926\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0915\u0947 \u092f\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0940\u092e\u0928\u0941\u0964<br>\n\u092a\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0928\u094d\u092f \u0907\u0935 \u0924\u0924\u0928\u0926 \u0927\u093f \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0938\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0930\u092e\u092f\u0941\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0926\u0924\u0965 RIG VEDA Book 8/ Hymn 21/ Stanza 18\n<ref>{{Cite book|url=\nhttps://books.google.co.in/books?id=fHYnGde4BS4C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=chitra+id+raja+rigveda&source=bl&ots=qE_jNycDIZ&sig=ACfU3U32mqIyNlaPHo_IqcXEYhHmyKOaiw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjYhv-a4-DoAhUTWX0KHYXQDcEQ6AEwAHoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=chitra%20id%20raja%20rigveda&f=false}}</ref>\nThe Rig Veda mentions an invocation to be made to Chitragupta before offering sacrifice.

Unit 731 was based at the [[Pingfang]] district of [[Harbin]], the largest city in the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] (now [[Northeast China]]), and had active branch offices throughout China and Southeast Asia.\n\nIts parent program was officially known as the {{nihongo|[[Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department]] of the [[Kwantung Army]]|\u95a2\u6771\u8ecd\u9632\u75ab\u7d66\u6c34\u90e8\u672c\u90e8|Kant\u014dgun B\u014deki Ky\u016bsuibu Honbu}}. Originally set up under the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' [[military police]] of the [[Empire of Japan]], Unit 731 was taken over and commanded until the end of the war by General [[Shir\u014d Ishii]], a [[combat medic]] officer in the Kwantung Army. The facility itself was built in 1935 as a replacement for the [[Zhongma Fortress]], and to expand the capabilities for Ishii and his team. The program received generous support from the Japanese government up to the end of the war in 1945.\n\nUnit 731 and the other Units of the \"Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department\" were biological weapon production, testing, deployment and storage facilities. They routinely tested on human beings (who were referred to internally as \"logs\"). Additionally, the biological weapons were tested in the field on cities and towns in China. Estimates of those killed by Unit 731 and its related programs range up to half a million people.\n\nThe researchers involved in Unit 731 were secretly given immunity by the United States in exchange for the data they gathered through human experimentation.<ref name=\"Gold 2003 p109\">Hal Gold, ''Unit 731 Testimony'', 2003, p. 109</ref> Other researchers that the [[Red Army|Soviet forces]] managed to arrest first were tried at the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] in 1949.

Ishii organized a secret research group, the \"T\u014dg\u014d Unit\", for various chemical and biological experimentation in Manchuria. Ishii had proposed the creation of a Japanese biological and chemical research unit in 1930, after a two-year study trip abroad, on the grounds that Western powers were developing their own programs.\n\nOne of Ishii's main supporters inside the army was Colonel [[Chikahiko Koizumi]], who later became [[Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare|Japan's Health Minister]] from 1941 to 1945. Koizumi had joined a secret [[poison gas]] research committee in 1915, during [[World War I]], when he and other Imperial Japanese Army officers became impressed by the successful German use of [[chlorine gas]] at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], in which the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] suffered 5,000 deaths and 15,000 wounded as a result of the chemical attack.<ref>Williams, Peter, and Wallace, David (1989).

After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, sister chemical and biological warfare units were founded in major Chinese cities, and were referred to as Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Units.

The effects of different water temperatures were tested by bludgeoning the victim to determine if any areas were still frozen.\n\n==== Syphilis ====\nUnit members orchestrated forced sex acts between infected and non-infected prisoners to transmit the disease, as the testimony of a prison guard on the subject of devising a method for transmission of syphilis between patients shows:<blockquote>\"Infection of venereal disease by injection was abandoned, and the researchers started forcing the prisoners into sexual acts with each other. Four or five unit members, dressed in white laboratory clothing completely covering the body with only eyes and mouth visible, rest covered, handled the tests. A male and female, one infected with syphilis, would be brought together in a cell and forced into sex with each other. It was made clear that anyone resisting would be shot.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unit 731: Testimony|last=Gold|first=Hal|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=157}}</ref></blockquote>After victims were infected, they were vivisected at different stages of infection, so that internal and external organs could be observed as the disease progressed. Testimony from multiple guards blames the female victims as being hosts of the diseases, even as they were forcibly infected. Genitals of female prisoners that were infected with syphilis were called \"jam filled buns\" by guards.<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/>\n\nSome children grew up inside the walls of Unit 731, infected with syphilis. A Youth Corps member deployed to train at Unit 731 recalled viewing a batch of subjects that would undergo syphilis testing: \"one was a Chinese woman holding an infant, one was a White Russian woman with a daughter of four or five years of age, and the last was a White Russian woman with a boy of about six or seven.\"<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/> The children of these women were tested in ways similar to their parents, with specific emphasis on determining how longer infection periods affected the effectiveness of treatments.\n\n==== Rape and forced pregnancy ====\nFemale prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments. The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture. Fetal survival and damage to mother's reproductive organs were objects of interest. Though \"a large number of babies were born in captivity\", there have been no accounts of any survivors of Unit 731, children included. It is suspected that the children of female prisoners were killed after birth or aborted.<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/>\n\nWhile male prisoners were often used in single studies, so that the results of the experimentation on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:<blockquote>\"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with [[gangrene]] set in. He was about to rape her anyway, then he saw that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left and locked the door, then later went on to his experimental work.\"<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/></blockquote>\nA Japanese Youth Corps member training at Unit 731 gave later testimony that among the subjects for syphilis testing were two Siberian women with their children, a girl of four or five and a boy of six or seven.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Prisoners and victims ==\nIn 2002, [[Changde]], China, site of the plague flea bombing, held an \"International Symposium on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare\" which estimated that the number of people killed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] germ warfare and human experiments was around 580,000.<ref name=\":0\">Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, p.xii, 173.</ref> The American historian [[Sheldon H.

This took place in August 1946 and was instigated by David Sutton, assistant to the Chinese prosecutor. The Japanese defense counsel argued that the claim was vague and uncorroborated and it was dismissed by the tribunal president, Sir [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]], for lack of evidence. The subject was not pursued further by Sutton, who was probably unaware of Unit 731's activities. His reference to it at the trial is believed to have been accidental.\n\n=== Separate Soviet trials ===\nAlthough publicly silent on the issue at the Tokyo Trials, the Soviet Union pursued the case and prosecuted twelve top military leaders and scientists from Unit 731 and its affiliated biological-war prisons Unit 1644 in Nanjing, and Unit 100 in Changchun, in the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]]. Included among those prosecuted for [[war crimes]], including germ warfare, was General [[Otoz\u014d Yamada]], the commander-in-chief of the million-man [[Kwantung Army]] occupying Manchuria.\n\nThe trial of those captured Japanese perpetrators was held in [[Khabarovsk]] in December 1949. A lengthy partial transcript of the trial proceedings was published in different languages the following year by a [[Moscow]] foreign languages press, including an English language edition.<ref>''Materials on the Trial of Former Servicemen of the Japanese Army Charged with Manufacturing and Employing Bacteriological Weapons'' (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1950).

The Japanese doctors and army commanders who had perpetrated the Unit 731 experiments received sentences from the Khabarovsk court ranging from two to 25 years in a [[Siberia]]n [[Gulag|labor camp]].

In addition to the accusations of propaganda, the US also asserted that the trials were to only serve as a distraction from the Soviet treatment of several hundred thousand Japanese prisoners of war; meanwhile, the USSR asserted that the US had given the Japanese diplomatic leniency in exchange for information regarding their human experimentation. The accusations of both the US and the USSR were true, and it is believed that they had also given information to the Soviets regarding their biological experimentation for judicial leniency.<ref>http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3588&context=etd</ref> This was evidenced by the Soviet Union building a [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|biological weapons facility in Sverdlovsk]] using documentation captured from Unit 731 in Manchuria.<ref name=\"Alibek\">[[Ken Alibek]] and S.

It was responsible for some of the most notorious [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes carried out by Imperial Japan]]. Unit 731 was based at the [[Pingfang]] district of [[Harbin]], the largest city in the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] (now [[Northeast China]]), and had active branch offices throughout China and Southeast Asia.\n\nIts parent program was officially known as the {{nihongo|[[Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department]] of the [[Kwantung Army]]|\u95a2\u6771\u8ecd\u9632\u75ab\u7d66\u6c34\u90e8\u672c\u90e8|Kant\u014dgun B\u014deki Ky\u016bsuibu Honbu}}. Originally set up under the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' [[military police]] of the [[Empire of Japan]], Unit 731 was taken over and commanded until the end of the war by General [[Shir\u014d Ishii]], a [[combat medic]] officer in the Kwantung Army. The facility itself was built in 1935 as a replacement for the [[Zhongma Fortress]], and to expand the capabilities for Ishii and his team. The program received generous support from the Japanese government up to the end of the war in 1945.\n\nUnit 731 and the other Units of the \"Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department\" were biological weapon production, testing, deployment and storage facilities. They routinely tested on human beings (who were referred to internally as \"logs\"). Additionally, the biological weapons were tested in the field on cities and towns in China. Estimates of those killed by Unit 731 and its related programs range up to half a million people.\n\nThe researchers involved in Unit 731 were secretly given immunity by the United States in exchange for the data they gathered through human experimentation.<ref name=\"Gold 2003 p109\">Hal Gold, ''Unit 731 Testimony'', 2003, p. 109</ref> Other researchers that the [[Red Army|Soviet forces]] managed to arrest first were tried at the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] in 1949.

Ishii organized a secret research group, the \"T\u014dg\u014d Unit\", for various chemical and biological experimentation in Manchuria. Ishii had proposed the creation of a Japanese biological and chemical research unit in 1930, after a two-year study trip abroad, on the grounds that Western powers were developing their own programs.\n\nOne of Ishii's main supporters inside the army was Colonel [[Chikahiko Koizumi]], who later became [[Minister of Health, Labour, and Welfare|Japan's Health Minister]] from 1941 to 1945. Koizumi had joined a secret [[poison gas]] research committee in 1915, during [[World War I]], when he and other Imperial Japanese Army officers became impressed by the successful German use of [[chlorine gas]] at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], in which the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] suffered 5,000 deaths and 15,000 wounded as a result of the chemical attack.<ref>Williams, Peter, and Wallace, David (1989).

After the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937, sister chemical and biological warfare units were founded in major Chinese cities, and were referred to as Epidemic Prevention and Water Supply Units.

The effects of different water temperatures were tested by bludgeoning the victim to determine if any areas were still frozen.\n\n==== Syphilis ====\nUnit members orchestrated forced sex acts between infected and non-infected prisoners to transmit the disease, as the testimony of a prison guard on the subject of devising a method for transmission of syphilis between patients shows:<blockquote>\"Infection of venereal disease by injection was abandoned, and the researchers started forcing the prisoners into sexual acts with each other. Four or five unit members, dressed in white laboratory clothing completely covering the body with only eyes and mouth visible, rest covered, handled the tests. A male and female, one infected with syphilis, would be brought together in a cell and forced into sex with each other. It was made clear that anyone resisting would be shot.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unit 731: Testimony|last=Gold|first=Hal|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=157}}</ref></blockquote>After victims were infected, they were vivisected at different stages of infection, so that internal and external organs could be observed as the disease progressed. Testimony from multiple guards blames the female victims as being hosts of the diseases, even as they were forcibly infected. Genitals of female prisoners that were infected with syphilis were called \"jam filled buns\" by guards.<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/>\n\nSome children grew up inside the walls of Unit 731, infected with syphilis. A Youth Corps member deployed to train at Unit 731 recalled viewing a batch of subjects that would undergo syphilis testing: \"one was a Chinese woman holding an infant, one was a White Russian woman with a daughter of four or five years of age, and the last was a White Russian woman with a boy of about six or seven.\"<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/> The children of these women were tested in ways similar to their parents, with specific emphasis on determining how longer infection periods affected the effectiveness of treatments.\n\n==== Rape and forced pregnancy ====\nFemale prisoners were forced to become pregnant for use in experiments. The hypothetical possibility of vertical transmission (from mother to child) of diseases, particularly syphilis, was the stated reason for the torture. Fetal survival and damage to mother's reproductive organs were objects of interest. Though \"a large number of babies were born in captivity\", there have been no accounts of any survivors of Unit 731, children included. It is suspected that the children of female prisoners were killed after birth or aborted.<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/>\n\nWhile male prisoners were often used in single studies, so that the results of the experimentation on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:<blockquote>\"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with [[gangrene]] set in. He was about to rape her anyway, then he saw that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface. He gave up the idea, left and locked the door, then later went on to his experimental work.\"<ref name=\"gold-testimony\"/></blockquote>\nA Japanese Youth Corps member training at Unit 731 gave later testimony that among the subjects for syphilis testing were two Siberian women with their children, a girl of four or five and a boy of six or seven.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n== Prisoners and victims ==\nIn 2002, [[Changde]], China, site of the plague flea bombing, held an \"International Symposium on the Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare\" which estimated that the number of people killed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] germ warfare and human experiments was around 580,000.<ref name=\":0\">Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, p.xii, 173.</ref> The American historian [[Sheldon H.

Most or all Units had branch offices, which were also often referred to as \"Units.\" The term '''Unit 731''' can refer to the Harbin complex itself, or it can refer to the organization and its branches, sub-Units and their branches.\n\nThe Unit 731 complex covered {{convert|6|km2|spell=in|abbr=off}} and consisted of more than 150 buildings. The design of the facilities made them hard to destroy by bombing. The complex contained various factories. It had around 4,500 containers to be used to raise [[flea]]s, six cauldrons to produce various chemicals, and around 1,800 containers to produce biological agents. Approximately {{convert|30|kg|abbr=off}} of bubonic plague bacteria could be produced in a few days.\n\nSome of Unit 731's satellite (branch) facilities are in still use by various Chinese industrial companies. A portion has been preserved and is open to visitors as a War Crimes Museum.\n\n=== Branches ===\nUnit 731 had branches in [[Linkou County|Linkou]] (Branch 162), [[Mudanjiang]], [[Hailin]] (Branch 643), [[Sunwu County|Sunwu]] (Branch 673), [[Toan]] and [[Hailar District|Hailar]] (Branch 543).<ref name=\"trialmaterials\" />{{rp|60,84,124,310}}\n\n=== Tokyo ===\nA medical school and research facility belonging to Unit 731 operated in the [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] District of [[Tokyo]] during World War II.

Ministries in Tokyo ordered the destruction of all incriminating materials, including those in Pingfan. Potential witnesses, such as the 300 remaining prisoners were either gassed or fed poison while the 600 Chinese and Manchurian laborers were shot.

Sanders was a highly regarded microbiologist and a member of America's military center for biological weapons. Sanders' duty was to investigate Japanese biological warfare activity.

This took place in August 1946 and was instigated by David Sutton, assistant to the Chinese prosecutor. The Japanese defense counsel argued that the claim was vague and uncorroborated and it was dismissed by the tribunal president, Sir [[William Webb (judge)|William Webb]], for lack of evidence. The subject was not pursued further by Sutton, who was probably unaware of Unit 731's activities. His reference to it at the trial is believed to have been accidental.\n\n=== Separate Soviet trials ===\nAlthough publicly silent on the issue at the Tokyo Trials, the Soviet Union pursued the case and prosecuted twelve top military leaders and scientists from Unit 731 and its affiliated biological-war prisons Unit 1644 in Nanjing, and Unit 100 in Changchun, in the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]]. Included among those prosecuted for [[war crimes]], including germ warfare, was General [[Otoz\u014d Yamada]], the commander-in-chief of the million-man [[Kwantung Army]] occupying Manchuria.\n\nThe trial of those captured Japanese perpetrators was held in [[Khabarovsk]] in December 1949. A lengthy partial transcript of the trial proceedings was published in different languages the following year by a [[Moscow]] foreign languages press, including an English language edition.<ref>''Materials on the Trial of Former Servicemen of the Japanese Army Charged with Manufacturing and Employing Bacteriological Weapons'' (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1950).

The Japanese doctors and army commanders who had perpetrated the Unit 731 experiments received sentences from the Khabarovsk court ranging from two to 25 years in a [[Siberia]]n [[Gulag|labor camp]]. The United States refused to acknowledge the trials, branding them communist propaganda.<ref>Takashi Tsuchiya. \"The Imperial Japanese Experiments in China\".

Oxford University Press, 2011.</ref> The sentences doled out to the Japanese perpetrators were unusually lenient for Soviet standards, and all but one of the defendants returned to Japan by the 1950s (with the remaining prisoner committing suicide inside his cell). In addition to the accusations of propaganda, the US also asserted that the trials were to only serve as a distraction from the Soviet treatment of several hundred thousand Japanese prisoners of war; meanwhile, the USSR asserted that the US had given the Japanese diplomatic leniency in exchange for information regarding their human experimentation. The accusations of both the US and the USSR were true, and it is believed that they had also given information to the Soviets regarding their biological experimentation for judicial leniency.<ref>http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3588&context=etd</ref> This was evidenced by the Soviet Union building a [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|biological weapons facility in Sverdlovsk]] using documentation captured from Unit 731 in Manchuria.<ref name=\"Alibek\">[[Ken Alibek]] and S.

One graduate of [[Unit 1644]], Masami Kitaoka, continued to do experiments on unwilling Japanese subjects from 1947 to 1956 while working for Japan's National Institute of Health Sciences.

No findings of fact were made about the existence of human experimentation, but the decision of the court was that reparations are determined by international treaties and not by national court cases.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn August 2002, the Tokyo district court ruled for the first time that Japan had engaged in biological warfare. Presiding judge Koji Iwata ruled that the Unit 731, on the orders of the Imperial Japanese Army headquarters, used bacteriological weapons on Chinese civilians between 1940 and 1942, spreading diseases including plague and typhoid in the cities of [[Quzhou]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Changde]]. However, he rejected the victims' claims for compensation on the grounds that they had already been settled by international peace treaties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/aug/28/artsandhumanities.japan|title=Japan guilty of germ warfare against thousands of Chinese|last=Watts|first=Jonathan|date=2002-08-28|website=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2003, a member of the [[House of Representatives of Japan]] filed an inquiry.

In a 1998 correspondence letter between the DOJ and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Eli Rosenbaum, director of OSI, stated that this was due to two factors. (1) While most documents captured by the U.S. in Europe were microfilmed before being returned to their respective governments, the Department of Defense decided to not microfilm its vast collection of documents before returning them back to the Japanese government. (2) The Japanese government has also failed to grant the OSI meaningful access to these and related records after the war, while European countries, on the other hand, have been largely cooperative.<ref>https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3720697/DOJ-Copy-Cooper-1998-Correspondence.pdf</ref> The cumulative effect of which is that information pertaining to identifying these individuals is, in effect, impossible to recover.\n\n====Books====\n* ''Forest Sea'' ([[Polish language|Pol.]] ''Le\u015bne morze'') (1960), a novel by a Polish writer and educator [[Igor Newerly]].

The project endeavors to deliver a Just and Prosperous middle income Kenya by the year 2030.\n\nKenya is spearheading the development of Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor Project to strengthen the country's position as a gateway and a transport and logistics hub to the East African sub-region and the Great Lakes region to facilitate trade, promote regional economic integration and interconnectivity between African countries. The project is managed by the LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority (LCDA), which is domiciled under the Presidency.\n\n===Mandate of LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority===\nIn March 2013, the LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority (LCDA) was established through the Presidential Order Kenya Gazette Supplement No. 51, Legal Notice No. 58, The LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority Order 2013 to plan, coordinate and manage the implementation of the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project. The Authority is domiciled in The Presidency in accordance with the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The LCDA is headed by Mr. Silvester Kasuku, MBS, CMILT, Director General/ Chief Executive Officer and Amb, Dr. Francis Muthaura, EGH, Chairman of the Board of the Authority. The functions of the Authority are as follows:\n\n*i.\tPlan, coordinate and sequence LAPSSET Corridor projects in collaboration with implementing ministries and agencies;\n*ii.\tCoordinate implementation of LAPSSET Corridor projects across implementing ministries and agencies;\n*iii.\tProvide leadership, direction and guidance in operations and implementation of the LAPSSET Corridor;\n*iv.\tEnsure implementation of all decisions and resolutions of the government;\n*v.\tMobilize funds to project components using a variety of resources including budgetary resources from government, donor loans, infrastructure bonds and private finance;\n*vi.\tIn collaboration with National and County government department, build the capacity of LAPSSET Corridor towns to manage urban growth resulting from LAPSSET Corridor investments;\n*vii.\tPromote the competitiveness and use of the LAPSSET Corridor for the transport of goods and people; and\n*viii.\tProvide a forum for all stakeholders of the LAPSSET Corridor.\n\nThe LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority is the policy, implementation, operational coordination and technical oversight organ for the LAPSSET Corridor Project. The LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority has the inter-ministerial coordination committees composed of relevant ministries.\n\n====LAPSSET Corridor Projects====\nThe Corporation is mandated to manage the development of the following infrastructure project components which are key Transport, Energy and Communication investments;\n*1.Lamu Port at Manda Bay ([http://www.constructafrica.com/news/kenya-seeks-21-trillion-funding-lamu-port-construction 32 Berths] including Associated Infrastructure)\n*2.Standard Gauge Railway Line from Lamu \u2013 Isiolo - South Sudan (Juba) \u2013 Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) \n*3.

The High Grand falls will be used to create a manmade Lake at its dam with a view to controlling perennial flooding within the lower Tana Basin. More importantly the LAPSSET Corridor infrastructure is being developed as a critical enabler meant to spur growth of other sectors of the economy within the Corridor.  Of great significance is the rich agricultural value chain spanning over ten different economic crops whose implementation has begun with the establishment of mega irrigation schemes.\n\nAlready both local and international agricultural investors are keen on taking investment opportunities in this area and respective County Governments within the corridor have started receiving enquiries from some of the interested investors.\n\nThe LAPSSET Program therefore presents an investment opportunity that may be considered by the private sector investors including Pension, Insurance and saving Funds among other investors.\n\n===Economic Viability of LAPSSET Program===\nProject studies that were completed in 2011 on the LAPSSET Corridor project components showed great economic viability with most of the project components registering High Economic Internal Rates of Return of between 17% and 23.4% compared to acceptable industry minimum standard of 10% for infrastructure projects as shown in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: LAPSSET Corridor Project Components with accompanying cost implications\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- align=left\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|No\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Item\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Quantity\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Cost (USD) millions\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|EIRR %\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|1||Lamu port||32 berths||3,095 || 23.4 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|2||Railway||1,710&nbsp;km||7,099 || 17.8 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|3||Highway||880&nbsp;km||1,398 || 12.9 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|4||Crude Oil Pipeline||2,240&nbsp;km||3,949 || 21.6 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|5||Product Oil Refinery||120,000bpd||2,800 || 13.9 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|6||Resort Cities||3 Lots||1,214 || 20.8 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|7||Airports||3 Lots||506 || 20.7 ||\n|}\n\n'''Services'''\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- align=left\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|No\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Item\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Quantity\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Cost (USD) millions\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Cost (KES) trillions\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|1||High Grand Falls (Hydro + Water)||1 Lot||2,110 || ||  \n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|2||Associated Infrastructure|| ||2,500 ||  ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n| ||Total cost || ||24,524 || 2,403 ||\n\n|}\n\nNote 1: Both all and each project components are judged as viable in view of national economy as EIRRs computed are more than 12%, which is opportunity cost.\n\nNote 2: Cargoes are generated by the Corridor itself. Higher figures than the above table can be realized.\n\nFrom the statistics provided, it is therefore evident that if the government structured the projects into bankable bundles, it would attract private sector investors to participate and invest in the projects.\n\n===Cost of LAPSSET Program===\nThe seven key infrastructure project components of the LAPSSET Corridor Program require substantial amounts of resources with a budget estimate of US$24.5 billion, equivalent to KES 2 trillion at current exchange rates in construction costs. It is estimated that Lamu Port with its 22 berths alone will cost approximately US$3.1 billion, the Railway US$7.1 billion while the crude oil pipeline will cost a further estimate of US$3 billion for Lamu to Lokichar trunk line alone.\n\nIndeed, the figures indicated above are of no mean task and cannot be left to the Government\u2019s limited resources alone. The Government has prioritised the participation of private sector in the development of LAPSSET Corridor infrastructure through infrastructure bonds and equity participation among other money market instruments. There is already significant private sector interest being registered towards the implementation of these project components hence the need has arisen for the government to structure and package bankable projects that are investor ready for uptake by private sector.\n\n==Status of implementation of LAPSSET corridor projects==\nThe government undertook ground breaking for the LAPSSET Corridor Program at Lamu Port site on 2 March 2012, after which it commenced construction activities of various infrastructural facilities and services aimed at progressing implementation of LAPSSET Corridor Project. The ongoing construction works for various project activities are summarized below.\n\n===Lamu Port===\nLAPSSET Corridor Project is on course and so far construction activities for various facities at Lamu Port site are ongoing with progress for Lamu Port Building and Port Police and security facilities having achieved a completion rate of 95%.\n\n*i)\tPort Building: 95% complete. \n*ii)\tPolice Station: 95% complete.\n*iii)\tDesign review ongoing for the first three berths, with construction to begin in July 2014\n*iv)\tThe physical development plan and survey for the Port area has been completed.\n\nThe Government has so far allocated KES 4.2 billion in preparation for the commencement of construction works for the first three berths. The government is also in the process of mobilising more resources from its own revenue resources as well as from private sector investors through equity and debt including bonds while mobilisation of more funds through equity and debt participation by investor for the construction of the first three berths and its associated infrastructure. These three berths are being constructed by China Communications Construction Company at a cost of nearly $480 million, and will [http://www.joc.com/international-trade-news/infrastructure-news/africa-infrastructure-news/kenya%E2%80%99s-lamu-port-slated-2020-opening_20161130.html reportedly be opened] by 2020.\n\n===LAPSSET  Highway Component===\nThe LAPSSET highway component has been categorized in sections as indicated below:\n\n*Lamu \u2013 Garissa (D568)\t\t-\t250&nbsp;km\n*Garissa \u2013 Isiolo (C81,D586,B9)\t-\t423&nbsp;km\n*Isiolo \u2013 Moyale (A2)\t\t-\t505&nbsp;km\n*Isiolo\u2013Nadapal \t\t- \t721&nbsp;km\n\n====Isiolo \u2013 Marsabit \u2013 Moyale, A2====\nIt is important to note that significant progress has been made on the ongoing construction  of LAPSSET Highway component, particularly the 505&nbsp;km Isiolo-Moyale A2 Road costing approximately KES 46 billion and being funded jointly by the African Development Bank, European Union and the Government of Kenya. Indeed, Kenyans and Ethiopians will soon be able to enjoy improved transport and logistics services and transact business between Addis Ababa, Lamu and Nairobi.\n\n====Isiolo \u2013 Merille (136&nbsp;km)====\n\nThe Isiolo \u2013 Merille River Road, constitutes the first section of the 505&nbsp;km road from Isiolo to Moyale which is part of the road linking Tunduma in Southern Tanzania with Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.\n\nThe project construction works are complete. This project was funded by the [[African Development Bank]] at a cost of KES 6,318,130,428.27.\n\n====Merille River \u2013 Marsabit (121&nbsp;km)====\n\nThis road constitutes the second section of the 505&nbsp;km road from Isiolo to Moyale and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The road begins at Merille River and runs in a northerly direction and terminates at Marsabit. The construction works for this section has progressed at 10% having commenced in January 2013 and is scheduled for completion by January 2016 and is being funded by the [[European Union]]. The project will cost a total sum of KES 13.73 billion.\n\n====Marsabit \u2013 Turbi (123&nbsp;km)====\n\nThe road begins in Marsabit at the junction with the road C82 and runs in a northerly direction and terminates in Turbi constituting the third section of the 505&nbsp;km road from Isiolo to Moyale and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The construction works for this section has progressed to 47.4% having commenced in April 2011 and is being funded by the African Development Bank and is expected to be completed by March 2014. The project will cost a total sum of KES 13 billion.\n\n====Turbi \u2013 Moyale (125&nbsp;km)====\n\nConstruction works have progressed to 11.5% completion having commenced in October 2012 for a period of 36 months. This section is being funded by the African Development Bank and is expected to be completed in December 2015.\n\nIn addition to the above the Government of Kenya and the Government of South Sudan, working together with the World Bank recently completed feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs for the Lokichar - Nadapal \u2013 Torit - Juba Road whose construction works will begin soon once finances are mobilised. This road project does present an opportunity for private sector participation.\n\nFurthermore, the Government of Kenya is currently considering mechanisms for participation by private sector investors to deliver the Lokichar - Isiolo - Garissa - Lamu Road and Lamu - Garsen Road through Engineering, Procurement, Finance and Construct (EPC). Delivery of the road provides immediate road connection between Lamu Port and Juba and Addis Ababa.\n\n*i.

Awaiting mobilization of resources for construction.\n\n===Crude Oil Pipeline===\n\nContinued discovery of oil resources with the region has emboldened plans by regional Governments that are connected by the LAPSSET Corridor to build a crude oil pipeline between Lamu Port and Kenya\u2019s oil fields in Turkana Basin and Uganda\u2019s oil fields at Lake Albert\u2019s Basin and South Sudan oil fields. The Government of Kenya is soon putting up an Expression of Interest to competitively select the appropriate investors for the development of the crude oil pipeline.\n\n===Electric Power Supply===\nIn addition to the above the Government has prioritised the provision of appropriate infrastructural service aimed at supporting the massive investments planned for the LAPSSET Corridor. The Government has just completed the electric power connection for the Lamu Port of 220 kV transmission line from Rabai through Malindi and Garsen to Lamu.\n\nConstruction of electric power transmission line has commenced to deliver electric power connection to key LAPSSET Corridor areas such as Garissa, Isiolo and Turkana.  Already construction of 132 kV transmission line from Seven Folks/Kindaruma to Garissa is ongoing; construction of 132 kV transmission line from Mount Kenya region to Isiolo is ongoing. Plans for the construction of 400 kV transmission line from Lake Turkana to Suswa are at an advanced stage while plans are ongoing for the construction of 220 kV line from Garsen to Garissa.\n\n* Rabai \u2013 Lamu 220 kV Transmission Line completed\n* Garsen 220 kV Transmission Line to commence soon\n* Lake Turkana \u2013 Suswa 400 kV Transmission Line to commence\n* Lamu \u2013 Garissa \u2013 Isiolo \u2013 Lokichar 220 kV Transmission Line planned\n* Kindaruma \u2013 Garissa 132 kV Transmission line to complete construction by Dec 2014\n* Masinga \u2013 Isiolo 132 kV Transmission line to complete construction by Dec 2014\n* Kamburu \u2013 Isiolo 220 kV Transmission Line to complete Construction by Dec 2014\n\n===Airports===\nThe government has embarked on improving facilities at the three airports to provide for air travel services in the interim to enhance accessibility to the corridor. Improvement works on [[Lokichogio Airport]] were completed in the recent past and is already operational with scheduled flights landing at the airport.\n\nProvision of airport facilities will strengthen buildup of air transport and logistics services along the corridor in readiness for the construction of the three international airports at the three locations in the future.\n\n[[Kenya Civil Aviation Authority]] has already made plans to establish air transport safety, security and surveillance facilities and services to strengthen air transport and logistics in northern Kenya.\n\n====Manda Lamu Airport====\n\nThe government recently completed lengthening of [[Manda Airport|Lamu Manda Island Airport]] runway from 1.1&nbsp;km to 2.3&nbsp;km. Improvement works are already complete for the airport terminal building. Preparations are at an advanced stage towards the construction of a parallel taxiway and aircraft apron area to improve capacity of the airport. These improvements will enhance the capacity of Manda Lamu Airport that already has a strong scheduled flights clientele.\n\n====Isiolo Airport====\n\nThe Government has completed construction works on the 1.2&nbsp;km [[Isiolo Airport]] runway. Construction works are currently ongoing for Airport Terminal Building which is scheduled for completion by end of 2014. [[Kenya Airports Authority]] has made plans to operationalise the airport once facilities are in place by mid 2014.\n\n===Provision of Social Infrastructure, Services and Security===\nIn addition to the ongoing physical works in to planned projects along the LAPSSET Corridor, the Government has commenced a comprehensive plan for the provision of social infrastructure and services so as to give LAPSSET Project a deserving human face. Panning for these social infrastructure and services will ensure that schools, health centres, towns, water and sanitation services, security services and other social amenities are provided at an optimal level to make LAPSSET Corridor areas secure, desirable, liveable and working environment and a place to nurture Kenya\u2019s future generations.\n\n==Recent developments in the LAPSSET corridor project area==\n\nSince conclusion of the LAPSSET study, oil discoveries have been made in the Turkana area in Kenya with current recoverable crude oil reserves estimated at 600 Million Barrels.\n\nWith these developments, the original plan and design for the crude oil pipeline has to be reviewed to accommodate these new discoveries. The Pipeline will now evacuate crude oil from Lokichar Oil fields in Kenya, Lake Albert Oil fields in [[Uganda]] and oil fields in South Sudan. As such considerations are being made to commence construction of crude oil pipeline from Lokichar to Lamu Port to evacuate Kenyan oil as more preparations are made to complete negotiations on the construction of joining crude oil pipelines from Uganda and South Sudan oil fields.\n\nIn this event, the Lokichar to Lamu crude oil pipelines will be the trunk crude pipeline to accommodate crude oil from Uganda and South Sudan. Crude oil terminal tank farms will therefore be built at Lokichar and Lamu to manage the logistics of pumping crude oil through the pipeline as well as into the loading into ships for export.  As a result, the governments of South Sudan and Kenya are preparing for the admission of the Uganda Crude Oil Pipeline component into the LAPSSET Corridor Crude Oil Pipeline Project.\n \nAs a way forward, the tripartite Heads of State Infrastructure Summit held in Uganda on 20 February 2014, agreed to allow Kenya to proceed with the Expression of interest for the development of the crude oil pipeline between Lamu and Lokichar oil fields to evacuate Kenyan oil as well as prepare for the construction of connecting lines from South Sudan\u2019s and Ugandan Oil fields.\n\nIn order to support the development of the crude oil pipeline, the Government has identified the need to simultaneously construct the Lamu-Lokichar Road alongside the pipeline. As an early delivery strategy, the Ministries of Energy and Petroleum as well as Transport and Infrastructure have adopted an integrated approach for the development of the crude oil pipeline and the road from Lamu-Lokichar.\n\n== Participating countries ==\n\nParticipating countries include:\n\n*{{flag|Kenya}}\n*{{flag|South Sudan}}\n*{{flag|Ethiopia}}\n*{{flag|Uganda}} <ref>{{cite web|url=http://k24tv.co.ke/?p=6448 |title=All The Time |publisher=K24 Tv |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}</ref>\n\n==Funding==\nThe [[Development Bank of South Africa]] will fund construction of LAPSSET to KES 126 billion (US$1.5 billion).<ref name=\"IntellBriefs CCCC\">{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=David|title=China Communications Construction Company Wins Lamu Port Phase 1 Contract|url=http://intelligencebriefs.com/?p=3550|publisher=Intelligence Briefs|accessdate=27 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424092536/http://intelligencebriefs.com/?p=3550|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Lamu Port and Manda Bay==\nLamu Port is expected to consist of 32 berths when complete, will cost US $3.5 billion and be 1,000 acres in size.<ref name=\"nation\" /> The port will be a deep water port at 18 metres depth.\n\nFrom bids requested by the Kenyan Government, the first phase of the port will include 3 deep water berths with a capability of handling ships with a [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] capacity of up to 100,000 tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kagai |first=Danson |url=http://www.constructionkenya.com/1706/government-asks-for-lamu-bids/ |title=Kenya Asks for Lamu Bids |publisher=Constructionkenya.com |date=20 September 2010|accessdate=2015-02-28}}</ref> The port will be built at Manda Bay and is expected to be operational starting December 2012.<ref name=\"conkenya\" />\n\nA consortium of companies led by [[China Communications Construction Company]](CCCC) was reported to have won the bid for construction of the first three berths at Lamu port.

Kenya's other transport corridor is the [[Mombasa]] - [[Uganda]] transport corridor that passes through [[Nairobi]] and much of the [[Great Rift Valley, Kenya|Northern Rift]]. Some basic LAPSSET infrastructure has been built (a police station and harbor office in [[Lamu]] and lengthening of the [[Manda Airport|Lamu airport]] runway). The construction of LAPSSET's main components (ports, pipelines, roads, railways) is currently ongoing with construction of the first berth at Lamu Port completed in October, 2019 <sup>(situation as per October 2019).<ref>See: [https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/economy/Lamu-Port-s-first-berth-now-complete/3946234-5225024-7in7t1/index.html], businessdailyafrica.com, Tuesday, August 6, 2019 11:23</ref></sup>. Although the project is not formally stalled, its short to medium term success looks increasingly unlikely. Insecurity and political instability in Kenya are mostly to blame for this, as are more commercially viable alternative pipeline options through [[Tanzania]] or [[Ethiopia]]. The low [[oil]] prices since 2015 also affect LAPSSET's commercial prospects.<ref>See: [http://globalriskinsights.com/2016/01/east-africas-pipeline-politics-in-2016/ East Africa\u2019s pipeline politics in 2016], Global Risk Insights, 15 January 2016.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe project will involve the following components:<ref>{{cite web|title=Lamu Port \u2013 Taking Shape \u00ab Architecture Kenya|url=http://architecturekenya.com/2010/09/05/lamu-port-taking-shape/ |accessdate=13 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425023229/http://architecturekenya.com/2010/09/05/lamu-port-taking-shape/ |archivedate=25 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n* A port at Manda Bay, [[Lamu]]\n* Standard gauge ({{railgauge|1435 mm}}) railway line to [[Juba]] and [[Addis Ababa]], the [[South Sudan]]ese and [[Ethiopia]]n capitals respectively.\n* Road network\n* Oil pipelines (South Sudan and Ethiopia)\n* Oil refinery at [[Bargoni]]\n* Three airports\n* Three resort cities ([[Lamu]], [[Isiolo]] and [[Lake Turkana]] shores)\n\nThe project was initially conceived in 1975 but never took off due to various reasons.

The project endeavors to deliver a Just and Prosperous middle income Kenya by the year 2030.\n\nKenya is spearheading the development of Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor Project to strengthen the country's position as a gateway and a transport and logistics hub to the East African sub-region and the Great Lakes region to facilitate trade, promote regional economic integration and interconnectivity between African countries. The project is managed by the LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority (LCDA), which is domiciled under the Presidency.\n\n===Mandate of LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority===\nIn March 2013, the LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority (LCDA) was established through the Presidential Order Kenya Gazette Supplement No. 51, Legal Notice No. 58, The LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority Order 2013 to plan, coordinate and manage the implementation of the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor Project. The Authority is domiciled in The Presidency in accordance with the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The LCDA is headed by Mr. Silvester Kasuku, MBS, CMILT, Director General/ Chief Executive Officer and Amb, Dr. Francis Muthaura, EGH, Chairman of the Board of the Authority. The functions of the Authority are as follows:\n\n*i.\tPlan, coordinate and sequence LAPSSET Corridor projects in collaboration with implementing ministries and agencies;\n*ii.\tCoordinate implementation of LAPSSET Corridor projects across implementing ministries and agencies;\n*iii.\tProvide leadership, direction and guidance in operations and implementation of the LAPSSET Corridor;\n*iv.\tEnsure implementation of all decisions and resolutions of the government;\n*v.\tMobilse funds to project components using a variety of resources including budgetary resources from government, donor loans, infrastructure bonds and private finance;\n*vi.\tIn collaboration with National and County government department, build the capacity of LAPSSET Corridor towns to manage urban growth resulting from LAPSSET Corridor investments;\n*vii.\tPromote the competitiveness and use of the LAPSSET Corridor for the transport of goods and people; and\n*viii.\tProvide a forum for all stakeholders of the LAPSSET Corridor.\n\nThe LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority is the policy, implementation, operational coordination and technical oversight organ for the LAPSSET Corridor Project. The LAPSSET Corridor Development Authority has the inter-ministerial coordination committees composed of relevant ministries.\n\n====LAPSSET Corridor Projects====\nThe Corporation is mandated to manage the development of the following infrastructure project components which are key Transport, Energy and Communication investments;\n*1.Lamu Port at Manda Bay ([http://www.constructafrica.com/news/kenya-seeks-21-trillion-funding-lamu-port-construction 32 Berths] including Associated Infrastructure)\n*2.Standard Gauge Railway Line from Lamu \u2013 Isiolo - South Sudan (Juba) \u2013 Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) \n*3. Highways from Lamu \u2013 Isiolo - South Sudan (Juba) \u2013 Ethiopia (Addis Ababa)\n*4.Crude Oil Pipeline from Lamu \u2013 Isiolo \u2013 Nakodok/Nadapal (South Sudan), and Product Oil Pipeline from Isiolo \u2013 Moyale \u2013 Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)\n*5. International Airports at Lamu, Isiolo, and Lokichogio;\n*6.Resort Cities at Lamu, Isiolo and Lake Turkana\n*7.Merchant Oil Refinery at Isiolo.\n*8.\tServices  related infrastructure Project Components namely;\n**a.\tMalindi \u2013 Garsen Road\n**b.\tHigh Grand Falls Multipurpose Dam\n***i.\tWater Supply\n***ii.\tPower Supply; and\n**c.\tFibre Optic Cable / Communication\n**d.\tOther generated and attracted investments in commercial and manufacturing sectors along the LAPSSET Corridor.\n\nIn addition to this the project is also spearheading the development of associated infrastructure sub projects in particular the High Grand Falls that is envisaged to produce 500MW of power and provide water to Lamu city, Lamu Port and metropolis and  irrigation of mega farms planned for the Tana Delta among other areas within the Corridor. The High Grand falls will be used to create a manmade Lake at its dam with a view to controlling perennial flooding within the lower Tana Basin. More importantly the LAPSSET Corridor infrastructure is being developed as a critical enabler meant to spur growth of other sectors of the economy within the Corridor.  Of great significance is the rich agricultural value chain spanning over ten different economic crops whose implementation has begun with the establishment of mega irrigation schemes.\n\nAlready both local and international agricultural investors are keen on taking investment opportunities in this area and respective County Governments within the corridor have started receiving enquiries from some of the interested investors.\n\nThe LAPSSET Program therefore presents an investment opportunity that may be considered by the private sector investors including Pension, Insurance and saving Funds among other investors.\n\n===Economic Viability of LAPSSET Program===\nProject studies that were completed in 2011 on the LAPSSET Corridor project components showed great economic viability with most of the project components registering High Economic Internal Rates of Return of between 17% and 23.4% compared to acceptable industry minimum standard of 10% for infrastructure projects as shown in Table 1 below.\n\nTable 1: LAPSSET Corridor Project Components with accompanying cost implications\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- align=left\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|No\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Item\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Quantity\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Cost (USD) millions\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|EIRR %\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|1||Lamu port||32 berths||3,095 || 23.4 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|2||Railway||1,710&nbsp;km||7,099 || 17.8 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|3||Highway||880&nbsp;km||1,398 || 12.9 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|4||Crude Oil Pipeline||2,240&nbsp;km||3,949 || 21.6 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|5||Product Oil Refinery||120,000bpd||2,800 || 13.9 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|6||Resort Cities||3 Lots||1,214 || 20.8 ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|7||Airports||3 Lots||506 || 20.7 ||\n|}\n\n'''Services'''\n{| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse\"\n|- align=left\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|No\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Item\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Quantity\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Cost (USD) millions\n! style=\"width:30%;\"|Cost (KES) trillions\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|1||High Grand Falls (Hydro + Water)||1 Lot||2,110 || ||  \n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|2||Associated Infrastructure|| ||2,500 ||  ||\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n| ||Total cost || ||24,524 || 2,403 ||\n\n|}\n\nNote 1: Both all and each project components are judged as viable in view of national economy as EIRRs computed are more than 12%, which is opportunity cost.\n\nNote 2: Cargoes are generated by the Corridor itself. Higher figures than the above table can be realized.\n\nFrom the statistics provided, it is therefore evident that if the government structured the projects into bankable bundles, it would attract private sector investors to participate and invest in the projects.\n\n===Cost of LAPSSET Program===\nThe seven key infrastructure project components of the LAPSSET Corridor Program require substantial amounts of resources with a budget estimate of US$24.5 billion, equivalent to KES 2 trillion at current exchange rates in construction costs. It is estimated that Lamu Port with its 22 berths alone will cost approximately US$3.1 billion, the Railway US$7.1 billion while the crude oil pipeline will cost a further estimate of US$3 billion for Lamu to Lokichar trunk line alone.\n\nIndeed, the figures indicated above are of no mean task and cannot be left to the Government\u2019s limited resources alone. The Government has prioritised the participation of private sector in the development of LAPSSET Corridor infrastructure through infrastructure bonds and equity participation among other money market instruments. There is already significant private sector interest being registered towards the implementation of these project components hence the need has arisen for the government to structure and package bankable projects that are investor ready for uptake by private sector.\n\n==Status of implementation of LAPSSET corridor projects==\nThe government undertook ground breaking for the LAPSSET Corridor Program at Lamu Port site on 2 March 2012, after which it commenced construction activities of various infrastructural facilities and services aimed at progressing implementation of LAPSSET Corridor Project. The ongoing construction works for various project activities are summarized below.\n\n===Lamu Port===\nLAPSSET Corridor Project is on course and so far construction activities for various facities at Lamu Port site are ongoing with progress for Lamu Port Building and Port Police and security facilities having achieved a completion rate of 95%.\n\n*i)\tPort Building: 95% complete. \n*ii)\tPolice Station: 95% complete.\n*iii)\tDesign review ongoing for the first three berths, with construction to begin in July 2014\n*iv)\tThe physical development plan and survey for the Port area has been completed.\n\nThe Government has so far allocated KES 4.2 billion in preparation for the commencement of construction works for the first three berths. The government is also in the process of mobilising more resources from its own revenue resources as well as from private sector investors through equity and debt including bonds while mobilisation of more funds through equity and debt participation by investor for the construction of the first three berths and its associated infrastructure. These three berths are being constructed by China Communications Construction Company at a cost of nearly $480 million, and will [http://www.joc.com/international-trade-news/infrastructure-news/africa-infrastructure-news/kenya%E2%80%99s-lamu-port-slated-2020-opening_20161130.html reportedly be opened] by 2020.\n\n===LAPSSET  Highway Component===\nThe LAPSSET highway component has been categorized in sections as indicated below:\n\n*Lamu \u2013 Garissa (D568)\t\t-\t250&nbsp;km\n*Garissa \u2013 Isiolo (C81,D586,B9)\t-\t423&nbsp;km\n*Isiolo \u2013 Moyale (A2)\t\t-\t505&nbsp;km\n*Isiolo\u2013Nadapal \t\t- \t721&nbsp;km\n\n====Isiolo \u2013 Marsabit \u2013 Moyale, A2====\nIt is important to note that significant progress has been made on the ongoing construction  of LAPSSET Highway component, particularly the 505&nbsp;km Isiolo-Moyale A2 Road costing approximately KES 46 billion and being funded jointly by the African Development Bank, European Union and the Government of Kenya. Indeed, Kenyans and Ethiopians will soon be able to enjoy improved transport and logistics services and transact business between Addis Ababa, Lamu and Nairobi.\n\n====Isiolo \u2013 Merille (136&nbsp;km)====\n\nThe Isiolo \u2013 Merille River Road, constitutes the first section of the 505&nbsp;km road from Isiolo to Moyale which is part of the road linking Tunduma in Southern Tanzania with Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.\n\nThe project construction works are complete. This project was funded by the [[African Development Bank]] at a cost of KES 6,318,130,428.27.\n\n====Merille River \u2013 Marsabit (121&nbsp;km)====\n\nThis road constitutes the second section of the 505&nbsp;km road from Isiolo to Moyale and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The road begins at Merille River and runs in a northerly direction and terminates at Marsabit. The construction works for this section has progressed at 10% having commenced in January 2013 and is scheduled for completion by January 2016 and is being funded by the [[European Union]]. The project will cost a total sum of KES 13.73 billion.\n\n====Marsabit \u2013 Turbi (123&nbsp;km)====\n\nThe road begins in Marsabit at the junction with the road C82 and runs in a northerly direction and terminates in Turbi constituting the third section of the 505&nbsp;km road from Isiolo to Moyale and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. The construction works for this section has progressed to 47.4% having commenced in April 2011 and is being funded by the African Development Bank and is expected to be completed by March 2014. The project will cost a total sum of KES 13 billion.\n\n====Turbi \u2013 Moyale (125&nbsp;km)====\n\nConstruction works have progressed to 11.5% completion having commenced in October 2012 for a period of 36 months. This section is being funded by the African Development Bank and is expected to be completed in December 2015.\n\nIn addition to the above the Government of Kenya and the Government of South Sudan, working together with the World Bank recently completed feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs for the Lokichar - Nadapal \u2013 Torit - Juba Road whose construction works will begin soon once finances are mobilised. This road project does present an opportunity for private sector participation.\n\nFurthermore, the Government of Kenya is currently considering mechanisms for participation by private sector investors to deliver the Lokichar - Isiolo - Garissa - Lamu Road and Lamu - Garsen Road through Engineering, Procurement, Finance and Construct (EPC). Delivery of the road provides immediate road connection between Lamu Port and Juba and Addis Ababa.\n\n*i. Lamu \u2013 Garissa (D568) 250&nbsp;km), Garissa \u2013 Isiolo (C81,D586,B9) (423&nbsp;km) and Isiolo - Ginyang for EPC mode\n*ii.

Awaiting mobilization of resources for construction.\n\n===Crude Oil Pipeline===\n\nContinued discovery of oil resources with the region has emboldened plans by regional Governments that are connected by the LAPSSET Corridor to build a crude oil pipeline between Lamu Port and Kenya\u2019s oil fields in Turkana Basin and Uganda\u2019s oil fields at Lake Albert\u2019s Basin and South Sudan oil fields. The Government of Kenya is soon putting up an Expression of Interest to competitively select the appropriate investors for the development of the crude oil pipeline.\n\n===Electric Power Supply===\nIn addition to the above the Government has prioritised the provision of appropriate infrastructural service aimed at supporting the massive investments planned for the LAPSSET Corridor. The Government has just completed the electric power connection for the Lamu Port of 220 kV transmission line from Rabai through Malindi and Garsen to Lamu.\n\nConstruction of electric power transmission line has commenced to deliver electric power connection to key LAPSSET Corridor areas such as Garissa, Isiolo and Turkana.  Already construction of 132 kV transmission line from Seven Folks/Kindaruma to Garissa is ongoing; construction of 132 kV transmission line from Mount Kenya region to Isiolo is ongoing. Plans for the construction of 400 kV transmission line from Lake Turkana to Suswa are at an advanced stage while plans are ongoing for the construction of 220 kV line from Garsen to Garissa.\n\n* Rabai \u2013 Lamu 220 kV Transmission Line completed\n* Garsen 220 kV Transmission Line to commence soon\n* Lake Turkana \u2013 Suswa 400 kV Transmission Line to commence\n* Lamu \u2013 Garissa \u2013 Isiolo \u2013 Lokichar 220 kV Transmission Line planned\n* Kindaruma \u2013 Garissa 132 kV Transmission line to complete construction by Dec 2014\n* Masinga \u2013 Isiolo 132 kV Transmission line to complete construction by Dec 2014\n* Kamburu \u2013 Isiolo 220 kV Transmission Line to complete Construction by Dec 2014\n\n===Airports===\nThe government has embarked on improving facilities at the three airports to provide for air travel services in the interim to enhance accessibility to the corridor. Improvement works on [[Lokichogio Airport]] were completed in the recent past and is already operational with scheduled flights landing at the airport.\n\nProvision of airport facilities will strengthen buildup of air transport and logistics services along the corridor in readiness for the construction of the three international airports at the three locations in the future.\n\n[[Kenya Civil Aviation Authority]] has already made plans to establish air transport safety, security and surveillance facilities and services to strengthen air transport and logistics in northern Kenya.\n\n====Manda Lamu Airport====\n\nThe government recently completed lengthening of [[Manda Airport|Lamu Manda Island Airport]] runway from 1.1&nbsp;km to 2.3&nbsp;km. Improvement works are already complete for the airport terminal building. Preparations are at an advanced stage towards the construction of a parallel taxiway and aircraft apron area to improve capacity of the airport. These improvements will enhance the capacity of Manda Lamu Airport that already has a strong scheduled flights clientele.\n\n====Isiolo Airport====\n\nThe Government has completed construction works on the 1.2&nbsp;km [[Isiolo Airport]] runway. Construction works are currently ongoing for Airport Terminal Building which is scheduled for completion by end of 2014. [[Kenya Airports Authority]] has made plans to operationalise the airport once facilities are in place by mid 2014.\n\n===Provision of Social Infrastructure, Services and Security===\nIn addition to the ongoing physical works in to planned projects along the LAPSSET Corridor, the Government has commenced a comprehensive plan for the provision of social infrastructure and services so as to give LAPSSET Project a deserving human face. Panning for these social infrastructure and services will ensure that schools, health centres, towns, water and sanitation services, security services and other social amenities are provided at an optimal level to make LAPSSET Corridor areas secure, desirable, liveable and working environment and a place to nurture Kenya\u2019s future generations.\n\n==Recent developments in the LAPSSET corridor project area==\n\nSince conclusion of the LAPSSET study, oil discoveries have been made in the Turkana area in Kenya with current recoverable crude oil reserves estimated at 600 Million Barrels.\n\nWith these developments, the original plan and design for the crude oil pipeline has to be reviewed to accommodate these new discoveries. The Pipeline will now evacuate crude oil from Lokichar Oil fields in Kenya, Lake Albert Oil fields in [[Uganda]] and oil fields in South Sudan. As such considerations are being made to commence construction of crude oil pipeline from Lokichar to Lamu Port to evacuate Kenyan oil as more preparations are made to complete negotiations on the construction of joining crude oil pipelines from Uganda and South Sudan oil fields.\n\nIn this event, the Lokichar to Lamu crude oil pipelines will be the trunk crude pipeline to accommodate crude oil from Uganda and South Sudan. Crude oil terminal tank farms will therefore be built at Lokichar and Lamu to manage the logistics of pumping crude oil through the pipeline as well as into the loading into ships for export.  As a result, the governments of South Sudan and Kenya are preparing for the admission of the Uganda Crude Oil Pipeline component into the LAPSSET Corridor Crude Oil Pipeline Project.\n \nAs a way forward, the tripartite Heads of State Infrastructure Summit held in Uganda on 20 February 2014, agreed to allow Kenya to proceed with the Expression of interest for the development of the crude oil pipeline between Lamu and Lokichar oil fields to evacuate Kenyan oil as well as prepare for the construction of connecting lines from South Sudan\u2019s and Ugandan Oil fields.\n\nIn order to support the development of the crude oil pipeline, the Government has identified the need to simultaneously construct the Lamu-Lokichar Road alongside the pipeline. As an early delivery strategy, the Ministries of Energy and Petroleum as well as Transport and Infrastructure have adopted an integrated approach for the development of the crude oil pipeline and the road from Lamu-Lokichar.\n\n== Participating countries ==\n\nParticipating countries include:\n\n*{{flag|Kenya}}\n*{{flag|South Sudan}}\n*{{flag|Ethiopia}}\n*{{flag|Uganda}} <ref>{{cite web|url=http://k24tv.co.ke/?p=6448 |title=All The Time |publisher=K24 Tv |date= |accessdate=2015-02-28}}</ref>\n\n==Funding==\nThe [[Development Bank of South Africa]] will fund construction of LAPSSET to KES 126 billion (US$1.5 billion).<ref name=\"IntellBriefs CCCC\">{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=David|title=China Communications Construction Company Wins Lamu Port Phase 1 Contract|url=http://intelligencebriefs.com/?p=3550|publisher=Intelligence Briefs|accessdate=27 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424092536/http://intelligencebriefs.com/?p=3550|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Lamu Port and Manda Bay==\nLamu Port is expected to consist of 32 berths when complete, will cost US $3.5 billion and be 1,000 acres in size.<ref name=\"nation\" /> The port will be a deep water port at 18 metres depth.\n\nFrom bids requested by the Kenyan Government, the first phase of the port will include 3 deep water berths with a capability of handling ships with a [[deadweight tonnage|deadweight]] capacity of up to 100,000 tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kagai |first=Danson |url=http://www.constructionkenya.com/1706/government-asks-for-lamu-bids/ |title=Kenya Asks for Lamu Bids |publisher=Constructionkenya.com |date=20 September 2010|accessdate=2015-02-28}}</ref> The port will be built at Manda Bay and is expected to be operational starting December 2012.<ref name=\"conkenya\" />\n\nA consortium of companies led by [[China Communications Construction Company]](CCCC) was reported to have won the bid for construction of the first three berths at Lamu port.
