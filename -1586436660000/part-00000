It tells the fictional story of three student filmmakers\u2014[[Heather Donahue]], [[Michael C. Williams]], and [[Joshua Leonard]]\u2014who hike in the Black Hills near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]] in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The three disappeared, but their equipment and footage is discovered a year later. The purportedly \"recovered footage\" is the film the viewer sees.\n\nMyrick and S\u00e1nchez conceived of a fictional legend of the Blair Witch in 1993. They developed a 35-page screenplay with the dialogue to be [[improvisation|improvised]]. A [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] call advertisement in ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]'' magazine was prepared by the directors; Donahue, Williams and Leonard were cast. The film entered production in October 1997, with the [[principal photography]] taking place in [[Maryland]] for eight days. About 20 hours of footage was shot, which was edited down to 82 minutes.\n\nWhen ''The Blair Witch Project'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 1999, its promotional marketing campaign listed the actors as either \"missing\" or \"deceased\". Owing to its successful run at Sundance, [[Artisan Entertainment]] bought the film's distribution rights for $1.1&nbsp;million. The film had a limited release on July 14, 1999, before expanding to a wider release starting July 30. While critical reception was mostly positive, audience reception was split.\n\nThe film is heavily credited with reviving the [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage technique]] which was later used by similarly successful horror films such as ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' and ''[[Cloverfield]]''. A [[sleeper hit]], ''The Blair Witch Project'' grossed nearly $250&nbsp;million worldwide on a modest budget of $60,000, making it one of the most successful [[independent film]]s of all time. The film launched a [[Blair Witch|media franchise]], which includes two sequels (''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|Book of Shadows]]'' and ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''), novels, comic books, and video games.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn October 1994, film students [[Heather Donahue|Heather]], [[Michael C. Williams|Mike]], and [[Joshua Leonard|Josh]] set out to produce a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], and interview residents about the legend. Locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a [[hermit]] who lived in the woods and kidnapped seven children in the 1940s, supposedly killing all of them on the orders of the witch. The students explore the woods in north Burkittsville to research the legend. They meet two fishermen, one of whom warns them that the woods are haunted. He tells them of a young girl named Robin Weaver who went missing in 1888; when she returned three days later, she talked about \"an old woman whose feet never touched the ground.\" The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century. Their bodies later disappeared.\n\nThey camp for the night, and the next day, find an old cemetery with seven small [[cairn]]s. That night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping. The following day, they try to hike back to the car but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. They again hear twigs snapping. In the morning, they find that three cairns have been built around their tent. Heather learns her map is missing. Mike reveals he kicked the map into a creek out of frustration, which prompts the other two to attack him in rage as they realize they are now lost. They decide to head south, using Mike's compass, and discover humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. They again hear strange sounds that night, including children laughing. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.\n\nUpon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime. They come across a river identical to one they crossed earlier and realize they have walked in a circle. Josh suffers a breakdown because of the dire situation and disappears the next morning. Heather and Mike try in vain to find him before proceeding. That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams but are unable to locate him. They theorize that his screams are a fabrication by the witch to draw them out of their tent.\n\nThe next day, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks tied with fabric from Josh's shirt. She also finds blood-soaked scraps of his shirt as well as teeth, hair, and a piece of his tongue. Although distraught, she chooses not to tell Mike. That night, she records herself apologizing to her family and to Mike's and Josh's families, taking responsibility for their predicament.\n\nThey again hear Josh's agonized cries and follow them to an abandoned house containing demonic symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Trying to find Josh, they go to the basement, where an unseen force attacks Mike, causing him to drop his camera. Heather enters the basement screaming, and her camera captures Mike standing in a corner. The unseen force attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera as well and the footage ends.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of ''The Blair Witch Project'' began in 1993.<ref name = \"onion\"/> While film students at the [[University of Central Florida]], Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez were inspired to make the film after realizing that they found [[documentaries]] on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both. In order to produce the project, they, along with [[Gregg Hale (producer)|Gregg Hale]], Robin Cowie and Michael Monello, started [[Haxan Films]]. The namesake for the production company is [[Benjamin Christensen]]'s 1922 [[silent film|silent]] documentary horror film ''[[H\u00e4xan]]'' (English: ''Witchcraft Through the Ages'').<ref name=\"villagevoice1\">{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Anthony |title=Season of the Witch |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=July 14, 1999 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9928,kaufman,7024,1.html |accessdate=September 26, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303170002/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9928%2Ckaufman%2C7024%2C1.html |archivedate=March 3, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\nMyrick and S\u00e1nchez developed a 35-page screenplay for their fictional film, intending dialogue to be [[improvisation|improvised]].

The film entered production in October 1997. The [[principal photography]] took place in [[Maryland]] for eight days, overseen by cinematographer [[Neal Fredericks]]. About 20 hours of footage was shot; this was edited to 82 minutes.\n\nIn developing the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-[[anagram]]s: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is [[Edward Kelley]], a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, began as an anagram for [[Rasputin]].<ref name=\"makingofpt1\">{{cite news|last1=Rock |first1=Ben |authorlink=Ben Rock |title=The Making of The Blair Witch Project: Part 1 \u2013 Witch Pitch |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/180272/making-blair-witch-project-part-1-witch-pitch/ |accessdate=March 19, 2017 |publisher=[[Dread Central]] |date=August 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230161548/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/180272/making-blair-witch-project-part-1-witch-pitch/ |archivedate=December 30, 2016 |df= }}</ref> The Blair Witch is said to be, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Burkittsville]]) for [[witchcraft]] in 1785.\n\nThe directors incorporated that part of the legend, along with allusions to the [[Salem witch trials]] and [[Arthur Miller]]'s 1953 play ''[[The Crucible]]'', to play on the themes of injustice done to those who were classified as witches.<ref name=\"witch\">{{cite web|last=Aloi |first=Peg |title=Blair Witch Project \u2013 an Interview with the Directors |publisher=[[The Witches' Voice]] |date=July 11, 1999 |url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usma&c=media&id=2416 |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525160439/http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usma&c=media&id=2416 |archivedate=May 25, 2006 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe directors also cited influences such as the television series ''[[In Search of...

It tells the fictional story of three student filmmakers\u2014[[Heather Donahue]], [[Michael C. Williams]], and [[Joshua Leonard]]\u2014who hike in the Black Hills near [[Burkittsville, Maryland]] in 1994 to film a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. The three disappeared, but their equipment and footage is discovered a year later. The purportedly \"recovered footage\" is the film the viewer sees.\n\nMyrick and S\u00e1nchez conceived of a fictional legend of the Blair Witch in 1993. They developed a 35-page screenplay with the dialogue to be [[improvisation|improvised]]. A [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] call advertisement in ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]'' magazine was prepared by the directors; Donahue, Williams and Leonard were cast. The film entered production in October 1997, with the [[principal photography]] taking place in [[Maryland]] for eight days. About 20 hours of footage was shot, which was edited down to 82 minutes.\n\nWhen ''The Blair Witch Project'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 1999, its promotional marketing campaign listed the actors as either \"missing\" or \"deceased\". Owing to its successful run at Sundance, [[Artisan Entertainment]] bought the film's distribution rights for $1.1 million. The film had a limited release on July 14, 1999, before expanding to a wider release starting July 30. While critical reception was mostly positive, audience reception was split.\n\nThe film is heavily credited with reviving the [[Found footage (film technique)|found-footage technique]] which was later used by similarly successful horror films such as ''[[Paranormal Activity]]'' and ''[[Cloverfield]]''. A [[sleeper hit]], ''The Blair Witch Project'' grossed nearly $250 million worldwide on a modest budget of $60,000, making it one of the most successful [[independent film]]s of all time. The film launched a [[Blair Witch|media franchise]], which includes two sequels (''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2|Book of Shadows]]'' and ''[[Blair Witch (film)|Blair Witch]]''), novels, comic books, and video games.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nIn October 1994, film students [[Heather Donahue|Heather]], [[Michael C. Williams|Mike]], and [[Joshua Leonard|Josh]] set out to produce a documentary about the fabled Blair Witch. They travel to [[Burkittsville, Maryland]], and interview residents about the legend. Locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a [[hermit]] who lived in the woods and kidnapped seven children in the 1940s, supposedly killing all of them on the orders of the witch. The students explore the woods in north Burkittsville to research the legend. They meet two fishermen, one of whom warns them that the woods are haunted. He tells them of a young girl named Robin Weaver who went missing in 1888; when she returned three days later, she talked about \"an old woman whose feet never touched the ground.\" The students hike to Coffin Rock, where five men were found ritualistically murdered in the 19th century. Their bodies later disappeared. \n\nThey camp for the night, and the next day, find an old cemetery with seven small [[cairn]]s. That night, they hear the sound of twigs snapping. The following day, they try to hike back to the car but are unable to find it before dark and make camp. They again hear twigs snapping. In the morning, they find that three cairns have been built around their tent. Heather learns her map is missing. Mike reveals he kicked the map into a creek out of frustration, which prompts the other two to attack him in rage as they realize they are now lost. They decide to head south, using Mike's compass, and discover humanoid stick figures suspended from trees. They again hear strange sounds that night, including children laughing. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they flee in panic and hide in the woods until dawn.\n\nUpon returning to their tent, they find that their possessions have been rifled through, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime. They come across a river identical to one they crossed earlier and realize they have walked in a circle. Josh suffers a breakdown because of the dire situation and disappears the next morning. Heather and Mike try in vain to find him before proceeding. That night, they hear Josh's agonized screams but are unable to locate him. They theorize that his screams are a fabrication by the witch to draw them out of their tent.\n\nThe next day, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks tied with fabric from Josh's shirt. She also finds blood-soaked scraps of his shirt as well as teeth, hair, and a piece of his tongue. Although distraught, she chooses not to tell Mike. That night, she records herself apologizing to her family and to Mike's and Josh's families, taking responsibility for their predicament.\n\nThey again hear Josh's agonized cries and follow them to an abandoned house containing demonic symbols and children's bloody hand-prints on the walls. Trying to find Josh, they go to the basement, where an unseen force attacks Mike, causing him to drop his camera. Heather enters the basement screaming, and her camera captures Mike standing in a corner. The unseen force attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera as well and the footage ends.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nDevelopment of ''The Blair Witch Project'' began in 1993.<ref name = \"onion\"/> While film students at the [[University of Central Florida]], Daniel Myrick and Eduardo S\u00e1nchez were inspired to make the film after realizing that they found [[documentaries]] on paranormal phenomena scarier than traditional horror films. The two decided to create a film that combined the styles of both. In order to produce the project, they, along with [[Gregg Hale (producer)|Gregg Hale]], Robin Cowie and Michael Monello, started [[Haxan Films]]. The namesake for the production company is [[Benjamin Christensen]]'s 1922 [[silent film|silent]] documentary horror film ''[[H\u00e4xan]]'' (English: ''Witchcraft Through the Ages'').<ref name=\"villagevoice1\">{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Anthony |title=Season of the Witch |work=[[The Village Voice]] |date=July 14, 1999 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9928,kaufman,7024,1.html |accessdate=September 26, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303170002/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9928%2Ckaufman%2C7024%2C1.html |archivedate=March 3, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\nMyrick and S\u00e1nchez developed a 35-page screenplay for their fictional film, intending dialogue to be [[improvisation|improvised]].

The film entered production in October 1997. The [[principal photography]] took place in [[Maryland]] for eight days, overseen by cinematographer [[Neal Fredericks]]. About 20 hours of footage was shot; this was edited to 82 minutes.\n\nIn developing the mythology behind the film, the creators used many inspirations. For instance, several character names are near-[[anagram]]s: Elly Kedward (The Blair Witch) is [[Edward Kelley]], a 16th-century mystic, and Rustin Parr, the fictional 1940s child-murderer, began as an anagram for [[Rasputin]].<ref name=\"makingofpt1\">{{cite news|last1=Rock |first1=Ben |authorlink=Ben Rock |title=The Making of The Blair Witch Project: Part 1 \u2013 Witch Pitch |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/180272/making-blair-witch-project-part-1-witch-pitch/ |accessdate=March 19, 2017 |publisher=[[Dread Central]] |date=August 1, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230161548/http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/180272/making-blair-witch-project-part-1-witch-pitch/ |archivedate=December 30, 2016 |df= }}</ref> The Blair Witch is said to be, according to legend, the ghost of Elly Kedward, a woman banished from the Blair Township (latter-day [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Burkittsville]]) for [[witchcraft]] in 1785.\n\nThe directors incorporated that part of the legend, along with allusions to the [[Salem witch trials]] and [[Arthur Miller]]'s 1953 play ''[[The Crucible]]'', to play on the themes of injustice done to those who were classified as witches.<ref name=\"witch\">{{cite web|last=Aloi |first=Peg |title=Blair Witch Project \u2013 an Interview with the Directors |publisher=[[The Witches' Voice]] |date=July 11, 1999 |url=http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usma&c=media&id=2416 |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525160439/http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usma&c=media&id=2416 |archivedate=May 25, 2006 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe directors also cited influences such as the television series ''[[In Search of...

He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew members on the ship before the accident. Lister survived the accident, as he was in stasis for smuggling an unquarantined cat on board. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on [[Fiji]] (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\">Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 19\u201324.</ref> He likes [[Indian food]], especially chicken [[vindaloo]], which is a recurring theme in the series.\n* [[Arnold Rimmer|Arnold Judas Rimmer]] Bsc Ssc (\"Bronze swimming certificate\" and \"Silver swimming certificate\"), played by [[Chris Barrie]], was the second-lowest-ranking member of the crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, [[bureaucratic]], [[neuroticism|neurotic]] coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself) except Lister. Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 24\u201330.</ref> because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become his swashbuckling dimensional counterpart, Ace Rimmer. Along with the ''Red Dwarf'' ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with [[Death (personification)|Death]] at the end of the series, whom he kicks in the groin. From ''Back to Earth'' onwards, he is once again a hologram, although to what circumstances lead to this is never elaborated.\n[[File:Red Dwarf cast.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], and [[Kryten]] as they appeared in 2009's ''Back to Earth'']]\n* The [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], played by [[Danny John-Jules]], is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating, and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew in early episodes.

Holly has a functional [[IQ]] of 6000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs. Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed \"computer senility\" before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe \"with whom he'd once fallen madly in love\".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 35\u201338.</ref> Following an absence in series VI and the majority of series VII, Holly is back as his original male persona, being reset by the [[Nanarchy|nanobots who stole ''Red Dwarf'']]. From ''Back to Earth'' to series XII, Holly is absent once again due to Lister's bath overflowing [[offscreen]], caused by him rushing out when hearing Kochanski had left, which got into Holly's circuity causing him to malfunction and go offline.\n* [[Kristine Kochanski]] (originally portrayed by [[Clare Grogan]] before [[Chlo\u00eb Annett]] took on the role from series VII) was initially a ''Red Dwarf'' navigation officer whom Lister had a crush on (later retroactively altered to be his ex-girlfriend) and whose memory he had cherished ever since.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\"/> In one [[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|episode]], the crew happens upon an alternative dimension where Kochanski survived the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident.

Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her. Lister is advised by fans of the television series to find her in \"the next series\" and to make amends. Despite not making an appearance in the immediate series, she is mentioned at various points by Lister with hopes of reuniting with her.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Trojan |episode-link=Trojan (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |city= |date=4 October 2012 |season= |series-no=X |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe first series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in 1988.

The increasing science-fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor.

The series VII episode titled \"[[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|Ouroboros]]\" derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the [[Ouroboros|same name]]. The third episode of series VI \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\" was based on the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe series explores many science-fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the [[grandfather paradox]]), the question of [[determinism]] and [[free will]] (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near-certainty of the human species' [[extinction]] some time in the far future.\n\n[[Extraterrestrial life|Aliens]] do not feature in the series, as Grant and Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually addressed with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' ([[GELF]]), an artificially created creature.

These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos: for series III (the first-ever release), \"Bodyswap\" and \"Timeslides\" were swapped round, so that the latter could receive top billing on the second VHS volume; for the second VHS volume of series I, \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being \"Waiting for God\" which shared its name with the title of [[Waiting for God (TV series)|another comedy series]] (set in a retirement home); and for series V, \"[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]\" and \"[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]\" were given top billing on their respective video release, which completely re-organised the order of episodes from that in which they were originally broadcast.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf series V Aftermath\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath |title=Red Dwarf series V Aftermath |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230342/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=5&subsectionID=aftermath |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context.

With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes, to give an idea of the basic plot and character dynamics, alongside proposed future episodes, remakes of episodes from the original show.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Llewellyn did not participate in the re-shoot, though clips from the British version were used to show the character. Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Farrell found work almost immediately afterwards with ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', in which she was cast as [[Jadzia Dax]]. Similarly, one year later [[Jane Leeves]] was cast in ''[[Frasier]]'' as [[Daphne Moon]].\n\nThe cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of ''Red Dwarf USA'', particularly the part of Lister, who is portrayed in the British version as a likeable slob, but in the U.S. version as somewhat clean-cut. In the 2004 documentary ''Dwarfing USA'', [[Danny John-Jules]] said the only actor who could have successfully portrayed an American Lister was [[John Belushi]]. In a 2009 interview on ''[[Kevin Pollak's Chat Show]]'', Bierko said that casting him as Lister was a \"huge mistake,\" and also said a \"John Belushi-type\" would have been better suited to the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?p=68 |title=Episode 28 \u2013 Craig Bierko |website=[[Kevin Pollak's Chat Show]] Archive |date=2 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102021746/http://www.kevinpollakschatshow.com/archive/?p=68 |archivedate=2 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe American pilot has been heavily bootlegged, but it has never been broadcast on TV in any country.

In addition to the television episodes, there are four novels, a radio version adapted from the audiobooks, two unaired [[television pilot|pilot episodes]] for an American version of the show, tie-in books, magazines and other merchandise.\n\nSet on the eponymous mining spaceship, the main characters are [[Dave Lister]], initially the last-known human alive, and [[Arnold Rimmer]], a [[hologram]] of Lister's deceased bunkmate. The other members of the crew are [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], a life form which evolved from the descendants of Lister's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein; [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]], ''Red Dwarf''{{'s}} computer (series I\u2013V, VIII and briefly in the final episodes of VII, XII); [[Kryten]], a service mechanoid (series II\u2013present); and [[Kristine Kochanski]], an alternative-reality version of Lister's love interest (series VII\u2013VIII).\n\nOne of the series' highest accolades came in 1994, when an episode from the sixth series, \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\", won an International [[Emmy Award]] in the Popular Arts category, and in the same year the series was also awarded \"Best BBC Comedy Series\" at the [[British Comedy Awards]].<ref>{{cite web

It has not been confirmed whether the Rimmer onboard ship is the one who originally left, the revived version, or a third incarnation entirely; however, episodes have alluded to him remembering events from both previous incarnations' lives.\n\n==Characters and actors==\n{{Main|List of Red Dwarf characters}}\n* [[Dave Lister]], played by [[Craig Charles]], is a genial [[Scouser]] and self-described bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew members on the ship before the accident. Lister survived the accident, as he was in stasis for smuggling an unquarantined cat on board. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on [[Fiji]] (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\">Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 19\u201324.</ref> He likes [[Indian food]], especially chicken [[vindaloo]], which is a recurring theme in the series.\n* [[Arnold Rimmer|Arnold Judas Rimmer]] Bsc Ssc (\"Bronze swimming certificate\" and \"Silver swimming certificate\"), played by [[Chris Barrie]], was the second-lowest-ranking member of the crew while they were all alive. He is a fussy, [[bureaucratic]], [[neuroticism|neurotic]] coward who, by failing to replace a drive plate properly, is responsible for the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident that kills the entire crew (including himself) except Lister. Nevertheless, Holly chose him to be the ship's one available hologram<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 24\u201330.</ref> because he considered him the person most likely to keep Lister sane. During Series VII, Rimmer leaves the dimension shared by his crewmates to become his swashbuckling dimensional counterpart, Ace Rimmer. Along with the ''Red Dwarf'' ship and its crew, Rimmer is resurrected at the start of Series VIII by nanobots. He comes face to face with [[Death (personification)|Death]] at the end of the series, whom he kicks in the groin. From ''Back to Earth'' onwards, he is once again a hologram, although to what circumstances lead to this is never elaborated.\n[[File:Red Dwarf cast.jpg|thumb|right|From left to right: [[Dave Lister|Lister]], [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], [[Arnold Rimmer|Rimmer]], and [[Kryten]] as they appeared in 2009's ''Back to Earth'']]\n* The [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], played by [[Danny John-Jules]], is a humanoid creature who evolved from the offspring of Lister's smuggled pet cat Frankenstein. Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating, and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew in early episodes. He becomes more influenced by his human companions over time, and begins to resemble a stylish, self-centred human. It is later revealed that, unlike his human companions, he has a \"cool\" sounding pulse, six nipples, and colour-coordinated internal organs.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 30\u201334.</ref>\n* [[Kryten]], full name Kryten 2X4B-523P (played by [[Robert Llewellyn]] from series III onwards, and as a one-off appearance in series II by [[David Ross (actor)|David Ross]]), was rescued by the crew from the crashed spaceship ''Nova 5'' in series II, upon which he had continued to serve the ship's crew despite their having been dead for thousands or even millions of years.

His change in appearance between the two actors is explained away by an accident involving Lister's spacebike and Lister having to repair him.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 38\u201342.</ref>\n* [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] (played by [[Norman Lovett]] in series I, II, VIII, The Promised Land and a guest appearance in each of series VII and XII; and [[Hattie Hayridge]] in series III to V), is the ship's computer. Holly has a functional [[IQ]] of 6000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs. Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed \"computer senility\" before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe \"with whom he'd once fallen madly in love\".<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 35\u201338.</ref> Following an absence in series VI and the majority of series VII, Holly is back as his original male persona, being reset by the [[Nanarchy|nanobots who stole ''Red Dwarf'']]. From ''Back to Earth'' to series XII, Holly is absent once again due to Lister's bath overflowing [[offscreen]], caused by him rushing out when hearing Kochanski had left, which got into Holly's circuity causing him to malfunction and go offline.\n* [[Kristine Kochanski]] (originally portrayed by [[Clare Grogan]] before [[Chlo\u00eb Annett]] took on the role from series VII) was initially a ''Red Dwarf'' navigation officer whom Lister had a crush on (later retroactively altered to be his ex-girlfriend) and whose memory he had cherished ever since.<ref name=\"Howarth & Lyons 1993 p. 19-24\"/> In one [[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|episode]], the crew happens upon an alternative dimension where Kochanski survived the ''Red Dwarf'' cadmium II accident. She joins Lister and the crew after the link to her own dimension collapses.<ref name=\"Series VII review at DVD Active\"/> By the first episode of the ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'' specials, Lister believes her dead, but it is later revealed that Kryten (the sole witness to her \"death\") had lied to Lister. Kochanski had instead fled the ship in a Blue Midget when it became clear Lister's complete lack of self-respect and indulgence on excesses was slowly killing him, which greatly depressed her.

The increasing science-fiction elements of the series were treated seriously by creators Rob Grant and Doug Naylor. Satire, parody and drama were alternately woven into the episodes, referencing other television series, films and books.

The series VII episode titled \"[[Ouroboros (Red Dwarf)|Ouroboros]]\" derives its name and theme from the ancient mythological snake by the [[Ouroboros|same name]]. The third episode of series VI \"[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]\" was based on the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].\n\nThe series explores many science-fiction staples such as time-travel paradoxes (including the [[grandfather paradox]]), the question of [[determinism]] and [[free will]] (on several episodes), the pursuit of happiness in virtual reality and, crucially to the show's premise of Lister being the last human, the near-certainty of the human species' [[extinction]] some time in the far future.\n\n[[Extraterrestrial life|Aliens]] do not feature in the series, as Grant and Naylor decided very early in the process that they did not want aliens involved. This is usually addressed with Rimmer's belief in extraterrestrial life being shot down, such as a vessel he believes to be an alien ship turning out to be a garbage pod. However, there are non-human life forms such as evolutions of Earth species (e.g. the Cat race), robotic or holo-life forms created by humans, and a kind of 'Genetically Engineered Life Form' ([[GELF]]), an artificially created creature.

These videos were named after the first episode of the three presented on the tape, as was typical with other BBC video releases at the time. However, on occasions the BBC decided to ignore the original running order and use the most popular episodes from the series to maximise sales of the videos: for series III (the first-ever release), \"Bodyswap\" and \"Timeslides\" were swapped round, so that the latter could receive top billing on the second VHS volume; for the second VHS volume of series I, \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" was given top billing, even though the original broadcast order was retained; this was due to the leading episode being \"Waiting for God\" which shared its name with the title of [[Waiting for God (TV series)|another comedy series]] (set in a retirement home); and for series V, \"[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]\" and \"[[Quarantine (Red Dwarf)|Quarantine]]\" were given top billing on their respective video release, which completely re-organised the order of episodes from that in which they were originally broadcast.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf series V Aftermath\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?seriesID=5&sectionID=behind-the-scenes&subsectionID=aftermath |title=Red Dwarf series V Aftermath |website=RedDwarf.co.uk |accessdate=7 January 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081124230342/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&seriesID=5&subsectionID=aftermath |archivedate=24 November 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Future releases would increasingly observe authenticity with the 'original broadcast' context.

According to Llewellyn and Naylor, the cast were not satisfied with Linwood Boomer's script. Grant and Naylor rewrote the script, but although the cast preferred the re-write, the script as filmed was closer to Boomer's version. The pilot episode includes footage from the UK series in its title sequence, although it did not retain the logo or the theme music of the UK series. During filming of the pilot, the audience reaction was good and it was felt that the story had been well received.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/>\n\nThe studio executives were not entirely happy with the pilot, especially the casting, but decided to give the project another chance with Grant and Naylor in charge.<ref>Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 227.</ref> The intention was to shoot a \"promo video\" for the show in a small studio described by the writers as \"a garage\".<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> New cast members were hired for the roles of Cat (now depicted as female) and Rimmer,<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> [[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]] and Anthony Fusco, respectively.<ref name=\"Resume\">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |title=Red Dwarf (1992) |website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218085224/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103521 |archivedate=18 February 2017}}</ref> This meant that, unlike the original British series, the cast was all Caucasian, which Charles referred to as \"White Dwarf\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |title=Red Dwarf USA unaired pilot |date=February 2010 |website=The Red Dwarf Section |accessdate=28 June 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909061544/http://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/reddw/o/usa/index.html |archivedate=9 September 2016}}</ref> Chris Barrie was asked to play Rimmer in the second pilot, but he declined. With a small budget and deadline, new scenes were quickly shot and mixed in with existing footage of the pilot and UK series V episodes, to give an idea of the basic plot and character dynamics, alongside proposed future episodes, remakes of episodes from the original show.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Llewellyn did not participate in the re-shoot, though clips from the British version were used to show the character. Despite the re-shoots and re-casting, the option on the pilot was not picked up.<ref name=\"Red Dwarf USA\"/> Farrell found work almost immediately afterwards with ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', in which she was cast as [[Jadzia Dax]]. Similarly, one year later [[Jane Leeves]] was cast in ''[[Frasier]]'' as [[Daphne Moon]].\n\nThe cast of both the British and American versions criticised the casting of ''Red Dwarf USA'', particularly the part of Lister, who is portrayed in the British version as a likeable slob, but in the U.S. version as somewhat clean-cut.

This was the band's first album to present singles, which were \"[[Trigger (song)|Trigger]]\" and \"Cloud Connected\".\n\n==Track listing==\nAll lyrics written by [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]].\n{{tracklist\n| total_length = 51:39\n| title1 = Reroute to Remain\n| length1 = 3:53\n| title2 = System\n| length2 = 3:39\n| title3 = Drifter\n| length3 = 3:10\n| title4 = [[Trigger (song)|Trigger]]\n| length4 = 4:58\n| title5 = Cloud Connected\n| length5 = 3:40\n| title6 = Transparent\n| length6 = 4:03\n| title7 = Dawn of a New Day\n| length7 = 3:40\n| title8 = Egonomic\n| length8 = 2:36\n| title9 = Minus\n| length9 = 3:45\n| title10 = Dismiss the Cynics\n| length10 = 3:38\n| title11 = Free Fall\n| length11 = 3:58\n| title12 = Dark Signs\n| length12 = 3:20\n| title13 = Metaphor\n| length13 = 3:39\n| title14 = Black & White\n| length14 = 3:33\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Japanese & korean reissue\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Album\n| title15 = Colony (Live) \n| extra15 = ''[[Colony (In Flames album)|Colony]]''\n| length15 = 5:11\n| total_length = 56:50\n}}\n{{Tracklist\n| headline = 2010 re-release\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Note\n| title15   = Watch Them Feed\n| length15  = 3:12\n| title16   = [[Land of Confusion]]\n| note16 = [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] cover\n| length16  = 3:22\n| title17   = Cloud Connected (Club Connected remix)\n| length17  = 4:11\n}}\n\n==Credits==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n===In Flames===\n*[[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] \u2013 vocals; [[lyrics]] (1\u201315, 17), co-[[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]\n*[[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] \u2013 [[lead guitar]]; [[music composition|music]] (1\u201315, 17)\n*[[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] \u2013 [[rhythm guitar]]; music (1\u201315, 17)\n*[[Peter Iwers]] \u2013 [[bass guitar]]\n*[[Daniel Svensson]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Other personnel===\n*Helena Lindsj\u00f6 \u2013 co-lyrics (1 and 10)\n*\u00d6rjan \u00d6rnkloo \u2013 keyboards, programming, mixing\n*[[Teddy M\u00f6ller]] \u2013 drum tech\n*Daniel Bergstrand \u2013 mixing\n*[[Niklas Sundin]] ([[Cabin Fever Media]]) \u2013 art direction, design, photography, translation on \"Colony\"\n*Cymbal-Simon \u2013 cymbals\n*\u524d\u7530\u5cb3\u5f66 (Takehiko Maeda) \u2013 japanese liner notes\n\n{{col-3}}\n===Featured Artists on ''Metaphor'' ===\n*Maria Gauffin \u2013 [[backing vocals]]\n*Fiol-Olof \u2013 [[violin]]\n\n===Writers of ''Land of Confusion''===\n*[[Phil Collins]]\n*[[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]]\n*[[Mike Rutherford]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nDespite initially receiving a mixed response from fans, the album received mostly favorable reviews.

During her 2014 breakout season, Bouchard was noted for her ability to hit the ball hard, flat, and early on the rise, allowing her to defeat multiple top 10 players and run deep into Grand Slams. However, since then, an unwillingness to alter her aggressive game has led to frequent struggles on the court, and a fall through the rankings. She has been noted for her \"stubbornness\", which can cause a multitude of unforced errors, especially on return. Her serve is solid, but not particularly strong, and is liable to break down under pressure, leading to a relatively high double fault count. Her movement causes problems on court, and her footwork sometimes lacks speed and precision, meaning that she struggles against all-court players who have variety such as [[Anastasija Sevastova]]. Her forehand technique has been criticised, due to the fact that it has been developed to allow Bouchard to hit the ball early: the condensed forehand swing reduces the amount of control and strength she has over her forehand, and also reduces the amount of momentum that can be generated through the swing, resulting in a forehand that produces a large number of errors.\n\n==Endorsements, sponsors and equipment==\nFollowing her breakout grand slam final appearance at the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|2014 Wimbledon Championships]], Bouchard signed a three-year endorsement deal with [[Coca-Cola]], following earlier agreements with [[Rogers Communications]] and equipment sponsors [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Babolat]].<ref name=\"G&M11\">she has recently been sponsored by Yonex  {{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/bouchard-eyes-wimbledon-silverware-as-sponsorship-battle-heats-up/article19454540|title=Eugenie Bouchard eyes Wimbledon title as sponsorship battle heats up|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> The following summer in June 2015, Bouchard signed a 10-year partnership with [[Aviva Canada]].<ref name=\"Aviva\">{{cite web|url=https://www.avivacanada.com/article/aviva-canada-announces-partnerships-tennis-star-genie-bouchard-tennis-canada-and-rogers-cup|title=Aviva Canada announces partnerships with tennis star Genie Bouchard, Tennis Canada and Rogers Cup|publisher=AvivaCanada.com|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBouchard was ranked No.1 by [[SportsPro]] in their \"World's 50 Most Marketable Athletes 2015 list\", toppling the likes of [[Neymar]], [[Stephen Curry|Steph Curry]] and [[Usain Bolt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2470913-eugenie-bouchard-neymar-top-sportspros-most-marketable-athletes-list|title=Eugenie Bouchard, Neymar Top SportsPro's Most Marketable Athletes List|last=Chiari|first=Mike|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Bouchard's slump in form during 2017 and 2018, it was reported that numerous sponsors had cut ties with her, including Colgate, Aviva, Usana and racquet sponsor Babolat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/17/other_sports/1521299709_134359.html|title=Eugenie Bouchard: Why is the Canadian losing sponsorship?|last=AS|first=Diario|date=2018-03-17|website=AS.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> It was also reported that as of March 2018, Nike is paying Bouchard zero dollars as her compensation is strictly performance and rankings based at this point in her contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/tennis/as-agent-and-sponsors-dump-eugenie-bouchard-onetime-star-faces-uncertain-future|title=As agent and sponsors dump Eugenie Bouchard, onetime star faces uncertain future {{!}} National Post|last=Sports|last2=Tennis|date=2018-03-13|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBouchard has a fraternal twin sister, Beatrice, who is six minutes older.

With an early exit at the Australian Open, Bouchard opted to compete at the [[2019 Oracle Challenger Series \u2013 Newport Beach \u2013 Women's Singles|Oracle Challenger Series]] on the [[WTA 125K series]] tour (WTA's secondary level professional tour circuit). Seeded third, Bouchard progressed to the quarter-finals at the event, where she was defeated by compatriot [[Bianca Andreescu]].\n\nIn February, Bouchard was awarded a wildcard into the Premier 5 tournament in [[2019 Dubai Tennis Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Dubai]]. Bouchard defeated [[Vera Lapko]] in the first round before losing to third-seed [[Simona Halep]] in the second round. The loss to Halep would begin a huge losing streak for Bouchard and some of the worst form since her initial slump in 2015. Bouchard failed to win a match at [[2019 BNP Paribas Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Indian Wells]], [[2019 Miami Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Miami]], [[2019 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]], [[2019 Eastbourne International \u2013 Women's Singles|Eastbourne]], [[2019 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], [[2019 Ladies Open Lausanne \u2013 Singles|Lausanne]], [[2019 Citi Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Washington]], [[2019 Rogers Cup \u2013 Women's Singles|Rogers Cup]], [[2019 Odlum Brown Vancouver Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Vancouver]] and [[2019 Bronx Open \u2013 Singles|New York]] to extend her losing streak to 11 matches across WTA main tour, qualifying and [[ITF Women's Circuit|ITF circuit]] matches. At the [[2019 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles|US Open]], Bouchard's losing streak extended to 12 matches with a straight sets defeat to twelfth seed [[Anastasija Sevastova]]. Bouchard's ranking fell outside the world's top 150 following her loss at the US Open. \n\nBouchard returned in late September at the [[2019 Central Coast Pro Tennis Open \u2013 Singles|Central Coast Pro Tennis Open]] on the ITF circuit. Seeded third, Bouchard crashed out of the tournament in the opening round to world no. 272 Gabriela Talaba, a little known Romanian player with zero top-200 wins prior to the tournament. The loss extended Bouchard's losing streak to 13 matches. Following her continued poor results, Bouchard's ranking slumped to 224 in the world. Bouchard returned to the singles circuit at the [[2019 Oracle Challenger Series \u2013 Houston \u2013 Women's Singles|Oracle Challenger Series]] in Houston on the WTA 125K series tour. At the event, Bouchard ended her 13-match losing streak and won her first match at any level in nine-months, defeating [[Valentini Grammatikopoulou]] in straight sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/tennis-briefs-eugenie-bouchard-bounces-back-greek-freak-gets-his-revenge/news-story/a0747eabd8faad7390d323cb71210c56|title=Bouchard breaks painful dry spell|date=2019-11-11|website=NewsComAu|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> Bouchard also won through her second round match against eighth-seed [[Francesca Di Lorenzo]] after Di Lorenzo retired a break down in the second set.

During her 2014 breakout season, Bouchard was noted for her ability to hit the ball hard, flat, and early on the rise, allowing her to defeat multiple top 10 players and run deep into Grand Slams. However, since then, an unwillingness to alter her aggressive game has led to frequent struggles on the court, and a fall through the rankings. She has been noted for her \"stubbornness\", which can cause a multitude of unforced errors, especially on return. Her serve is solid, but not particularly strong, and is liable to break down under pressure, leading to a relatively high double fault count. Her movement causes problems on court, and her footwork sometimes lacks speed and precision, meaning that she struggles against all-court players who have variety such as [[Anastasija Sevastova]]. Her forehand technique has been criticised, due to the fact that it has been developed to allow Bouchard to hit the ball early: the condensed forehand swing reduces the amount of control and strength she has over her forehand, and also reduces the amount of momentum that can be generated through the swing, resulting in a forehand that produces a large number of errors.\n\n==Endorsements, sponsors and equipment==\nFollowing her breakout grand slam final appearance at the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|2014 Wimbledon Championships]], Bouchard signed a three-year endorsement deal with [[Coca-Cola]], following earlier agreements with [[Rogers Communications]] and equipment sponsors [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Babolat]].<ref name=\"G&M11\">she has recently been sponsored by Yonex  {{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/bouchard-eyes-wimbledon-silverware-as-sponsorship-battle-heats-up/article19454540|title=Eugenie Bouchard eyes Wimbledon title as sponsorship battle heats up|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> The following summer in June 2015, Bouchard signed a 10-year partnership with [[Aviva Canada]].<ref name=\"Aviva\">{{cite web|url=https://www.avivacanada.com/article/aviva-canada-announces-partnerships-tennis-star-genie-bouchard-tennis-canada-and-rogers-cup|title=Aviva Canada announces partnerships with tennis star Genie Bouchard, Tennis Canada and Rogers Cup|publisher=AvivaCanada.com|accessdate=December 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBouchard was ranked No.1 by [[SportsPro]] in their \"World's 50 Most Marketable Athletes 2015 list\", toppling the likes of [[Neymar]], [[Stephen Curry|Steph Curry]] and [[Usain Bolt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2470913-eugenie-bouchard-neymar-top-sportspros-most-marketable-athletes-list|title=Eugenie Bouchard, Neymar Top SportsPro's Most Marketable Athletes List|last=Chiari|first=Mike|website=Bleacher Report|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Bouchard's slump in form during 2017 and 2018, it was reported that numerous sponsors had cut ties with her, including Colgate, Aviva, Usana and racquet sponsor Babolat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/17/other_sports/1521299709_134359.html|title=Eugenie Bouchard: Why is the Canadian losing sponsorship?|last=AS|first=Diario|date=2018-03-17|website=AS.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> It was also reported that as of March 2018, Nike is paying Bouchard zero dollars as her compensation is strictly performance and rankings based at this point in her contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/tennis/as-agent-and-sponsors-dump-eugenie-bouchard-onetime-star-faces-uncertain-future|title=As agent and sponsors dump Eugenie Bouchard, onetime star faces uncertain future {{!}} National Post|last=Sports|last2=Tennis|date=2018-03-13|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBouchard has a fraternal twin sister, Beatrice, who is six minutes older.
