As the climate changes, distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to new areas and transmit illnesses to regions which may not have experienced them otherwise. Epidemics are also made more likely after severe weather events, such as heavy rainfall or flooding. Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as [[Ebola virus disease|ebola]]. Melting permafrost also threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for many years, as was the case in August 2016 when a thawed reindeer carcass that was almost a century old infected several individuals in [[Siberia]] with [[anthrax]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.contagionlive.com/news/the-ripple-effect-of-climate-change-on-epidemic-risk|title=The Ripple Effect of Climate Change on Epidemic Risk|website=ContagionLive|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Food scarcity ===\nMany plants have a maximum temperature at which they can grow, and climate change may mean that new pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before.

There have been several explanations put forward for these changes, but the prevailing paradigm is that these changes were a result of changes in ocean currents, specifically the northward transport of heat by the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] (AMOC). One example of this is the [[Younger Dryas]], in which a rapid decline in temperature, recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10\u00b0C (7.2 to 18\u00b0F) over just a few decades, is thought to have been caused by the melting of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Stieglitz|first=Jean|date=2017-01-03|title=The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Abrupt Climate Change|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83\u2013104|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|issn=1941-1405}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that recent climate change has caused a 15-20% slowing of the [[Gulf Stream]], a current which transports warm water from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] towards north-west Europe, due to a melting of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/gulf-stream-is-slowing-down-faster-than-ever-scientists-say-10128700.html|title=Gulf Stream is slowing down faster than ever, scientists say|date=|work=Independent|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Although it is likely to continue to slow, it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream could come to a complete halt this century, if ever.

A 200-year drought caused cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] to be abandoned; the [[Khmer Empire]] collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the [[Little Ice Age]] made it more difficult for [[Vikings]] to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMore recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in [[Syria]], leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence.

Studies have shown that extreme weather events can damage economies, lower food production and raise inequality, which can increase risks of violence when combined with other factors.

In other areas rainfall is reduced, and overall the world experiences more extreme floods and droughts as a result of climate change. Warmer air also results in higher rainfall and less snowfall and an increase in evaporation rates.

This has many impacts including the cooling of the Earth and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts. These pollutants also lead to the formation of [[smog]] and [[acid rain]] and cause various [[Respiratory disease|respiratory diseases]].

It described this as the \"[[Hothouse Earth]]\" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, arguing that decisions taken over the next decade could influence the climate of the planet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies. The report also states that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if the goal outlined in the [[Paris Agreement]] to limit warming to 1.5-2.0\u00b0C (2.7-3.6\u00b0F) is achieved.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Point of collapse ===\nEven in mid-range scenarios of around 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events, large-scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources, and collapsing ecosystems could lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion people who currently live in major coastal cities would need to be relocated due to sea-level rise.

As the climate changes, distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to new areas and transmit illnesses to regions which may not have experienced them otherwise. Epidemics are also made more likely after severe weather events, such as heavy rainfall or flooding. Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as [[Ebola virus disease|ebola]]. Melting permafrost also threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for many years, as was the case in August 2016 when a thawed reindeer carcass that was almost a century old infected several individuals in [[Siberia]] with [[anthrax]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.contagionlive.com/news/the-ripple-effect-of-climate-change-on-epidemic-risk|title=The Ripple Effect of Climate Change on Epidemic Risk|website=ContagionLive|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Food scarcity ===\nMany plants have a maximum temperature at which they can grow, and climate change may mean that new pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before.

A 200-year drought caused cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] to be abandoned; the [[Khmer Empire]] collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the [[Little Ice Age]] made it more difficult for [[Vikings]] to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMore recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in [[Syria]], leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence. Poor governance and [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies also contributed to the resulting [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]] and societal collapse in 2011.<ref name=\":72\" />\n\nAlthough the entire planet is affected by climate change, the worst impacts will be felt by the world's poorest countries, and these countries are both more likely to face the effects of societal collapse and more likely to face such effects sooner.

Climate change can also lead to heavier rainfall in some areas, leading to rapid movement of water to the oceans and reducing the capacity of people to use and store it. In other areas rainfall is reduced, and overall the world experiences more extreme floods and droughts as a result of climate change. Warmer air also results in higher rainfall and less snowfall and an increase in evaporation rates. Different regions will be affected to different degrees, but the IPCC predicts that around one billion people in dry areas of the world may face increasing water scarcity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/30/climate-change-water|title=How will climate change impact on water security?|last=Institute|first=Grantham|date=2012-12-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|last2=London|first2=Imperial College|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/working-group/wg2/|title=Working Group II \u2014 IPCC|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n== Research shortcomings ==\nLarge-scale changes to the Earth system such as tipping points and possible [[abrupt climate change]] are usually not included in climate models and impact assessments.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenfacts.org/en/impacts-global-warming/l-2/index.htm#0|title=Impacts of a 4\u00b0C global warming: 1.

These may also lead to abrupt climate change. As of December 2019, current global climate policies could take the planet to between 2.3\u00b0C and 4.1\u00b0C (4.14-7.38\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels by 2100, while current pledges and targets would take the planet to between 2.3\u00b0C and 3.5\u00b0C (4.14-6.3\u00b0F).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://climateactiontracker.org/|title=Home {{!}} Climate Action Tracker|website=climateactiontracker.org|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Tipping points ===\n{{Further information|Tipping points in the climate system}}\nIt is more likely that the Earth will cross tipping points and/or trigger abrupt climate change as it approaches and surpasses 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some of these tipping points may lead to accelerated global warming and [[runaway climate change]].

This has many impacts including the cooling of the Earth and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts. These pollutants also lead to the formation of [[smog]] and [[acid rain]] and cause various [[Respiratory disease|respiratory diseases]].

It described this as the \"[[Hothouse Earth]]\" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, arguing that decisions taken over the next decade could influence the climate of the planet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies. The report also states that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if the goal outlined in the [[Paris Agreement]] to limit warming to 1.5-2.0\u00b0C (2.7-3.6\u00b0F) is achieved.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Point of collapse ===\nEven in mid-range scenarios of around 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events, large-scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources, and collapsing ecosystems could lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion people who currently live in major coastal cities would need to be relocated due to sea-level rise.

In 1912, American promoter [[Guy Weadick]] organized his first rodeo and festival, known as the Stampede. He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick's festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the '''Calgary Exhibition and Stampede'''.\n\nOrganized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world's richest rodeos, one of Canada's largest festivals, and a significant tourist attraction for the city.  Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada.  However, both have been the target of increasing international criticism by [[animal welfare]] groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as [[animal rights]] organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.\n\nCalgary's national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the \"Stampede City\", carries the informal nickname of \"Cowtown\", and the local [[Canadian Football League]] team is called the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]].  The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don [[western wear]], and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and [[barbecue]]s. By mid-April 2020, discussions were being held as to whether the event would be postponed or canceled that year due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/its-just-a-matter-of-time-stampede-vendors-fear-the-worst-as-2020-events-fate-still-up-in-air/ |title='It\u2019s just a matter of time': Stampede vendors fear the worst as 2020 event's fate still up in air |date=15 April 2020 |publisher=Calgary Herald |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Program for 1912 Calgary Stampede.jpg|thumb|right|The Program for the 1912 Calgary Stampede featuring the [[The Big Four (Calgary)|Big Four]]: Burns, Lane, Cross, and McLean.

Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent [[Canadian dollar|C$]]145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack.<ref name=\"Dixon29\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=29}}</ref> It held a lavish parade as well as [[rodeo]], horse racing, and [[trick roping]] competitions as part of the event.<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />  The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.<ref name=\"Dixon29\" />\n\n[[Guy Weadick]], an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the \"wild west\" than the shows he was a part of.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=30}}</ref> He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans,<ref name=\"CHWeadickVision\">{{citation |last=Seskus |first=Tony |url=https://calgaryherald.com/homes/stampede/6479984/story.html |title=Guy Weadick's grand vision |work=Calgary Herald |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> but with the assistance of local livestock agent H.

However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=22}}</ref> Businessmen in [[Winnipeg]] convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially.

Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. However, declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson's proposals at their 1922 annual meeting.<ref name=\"Kennedy28\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=28}}</ref>  Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis.

Weadick encouraged the city's residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the \"wild west\".<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />  Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time: Mayor [[George Harry Webster|George Webster]] followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six-day event to accommodate street parties.<ref name=\"Dixon36\" /> The new sport of [[chuckwagon racing]] was introduced and proved immediately popular.<ref>{{citation |title=2009 Calgary Stampede Evening Show Program |publisher=Calgary Stampede |page=8}}</ref> 138,950 people attended and the event earned a profit.<ref name=\"Dixon36\" />  Over 167,000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently.<ref name=\"Dixon38\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=38}}</ref>\n\nAttendance grew annually throughout the 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but the onset of the [[Great Depression]] resulted in attendance declines and financial losses. After consecutive years of losses in 1930 and 1931, the exhibition board was forced to make cutbacks, a decision that strained the relationship between the board and Weadick.<ref name=\"Kennedy41\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=41}}</ref>  Furthering the divide was Weadick's growing resentment of the board's control of what he considered his event.  The issue came to a head in 1932 when Weadick and Richardson engaged in a loud argument over the situation, ending with Weadick's threat to quit entirely.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=110}}</ref> One month later, the exhibition board announced that it had relieved him of his duties.<ref name=\"Kennedy41\" /> Angered by the decision, Weadick sued the exhibition board for $100,000, citing breach of contract and unfair dismissal.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=111}}</ref>  His claim was upheld in courts, but he was awarded only $2,750 plus legal fees.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=42}}</ref>  Embittered by the events, Weadick remained at odds with the board for 20 years until he was invited to the 1952 Stampede as an honoured guest and parade marshal.<ref>{{harvnb|Livingstone|1996|p=120}}</ref>\n\nAt least seven movies were filmed at the Stampede by 1950.

Mayors of Calgary and city aldermen have sat on the Stampede Board of Governors at the same time they occupied public office, and the Stampede's ability to convince wealthy and influential citizens to volunteer their time has allowed the organization to gain a high-profile within the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=151}}</ref>  The Stampede operates on city-owned land, pays no property tax on its lease, and typically faces little to no political interference from City Hall.<ref>{{harvnb|Foran|2008|p=150}}</ref>  It operates as a non-profit entity with all income reinvested into the park.

In 1912, American promoter [[Guy Weadick]] organized his first rodeo and festival, known as the Stampede. He returned to Calgary in 1919 to organize the Victory Stampede in honour of soldiers returning from World War I. Weadick's festival became an annual event in 1923 when it merged with the Calgary Industrial Exhibition to create the '''Calgary Exhibition and Stampede'''.\n\nOrganized by thousands of volunteers and supported by civic leaders, the Calgary Stampede has grown into one of the world's richest rodeos, one of Canada's largest festivals, and a significant tourist attraction for the city.  Rodeo and chuckwagon racing events are televised across Canada.  However, both have been the target of increasing international criticism by [[animal welfare]] groups and politicians concerned about particular events as well as [[animal rights]] organizations seeking to ban rodeo in general.\n\nCalgary's national and international identity is tied to the event. It is known as the \"Stampede City\", carries the informal nickname of \"Cowtown\", and the local [[Canadian Football League]] team is called the [[Calgary Stampeders|Stampeders]].  The city takes on a party atmosphere during Stampede: office buildings and storefronts are painted in cowboy themes, residents don [[western wear]], and events held across the city include hundreds of pancake breakfasts and [[barbecue]]s. By mid April 2020, discussion were being held as to whether the event would be postponed or cancelled that year due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/its-just-a-matter-of-time-stampede-vendors-fear-the-worst-as-2020-events-fate-still-up-in-air/ |title='It\u2019s just a matter of time': Stampede vendors fear the worst as 2020 event's fate still up in air |date=15 April 2020 |publisher=Calgary Herald |access-date=16 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Program for 1912 Calgary Stampede.jpg|thumb|right|The Program for the 1912 Calgary Stampede featuring the [[The Big Four (Calgary)|Big Four]]: Burns, Lane, Cross, and McLean.

Seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to promote itself, the city spent [[Canadian dollar|C$]]145,000 to build six new pavilions and a racetrack.<ref name=\"Dixon29\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=29}}</ref> It held a lavish parade as well as [[rodeo]], horse racing, and [[trick roping]] competitions as part of the event.<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />  The exhibition was a success, drawing 100,000 people to the fairgrounds over seven days despite an economic recession that afflicted the city of 25,000.<ref name=\"Dixon29\" />\n\n[[Guy Weadick]], an American trick roper who participated in the Dominion Exhibition as part of the [[Miller Brothers 101 Ranch]] Real Wild West Show, returned to Calgary in 1912 in the hopes of establishing an event that more accurately represented the \"wild west\" than the shows he was a part of.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=30}}</ref> He initially failed to sell civic leaders and the Calgary Industrial Exhibition on his plans,<ref name=\"CHWeadickVision\">{{citation |last=Seskus |first=Tony |url=https://calgaryherald.com/homes/stampede/6479984/story.html |title=Guy Weadick's grand vision |work=Calgary Herald |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2012-06-09}}</ref> but with the assistance of local livestock agent H.

However, the Big Four were not interested in hosting another such event.<ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=22}}</ref> Businessmen in [[Winnipeg]] convinced Weadick to host his second Stampede in their city, but the show failed financially.

Richardson was convinced that it could be a profitable annual event but found little support for the concept within the board of directors of the Calgary Industrial Exhibition. However, declining attendance and mounting financial losses forced the exhibition board to reconsider Richardson's proposals at their 1922 annual meeting.<ref name=\"Kennedy28\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|1965|p=28}}</ref>  Richardson proposed merging the two events on a trial basis.

Weadick encouraged the city's residents to dress in western clothes and decorate their businesses in the spirit of the \"wild west\".<ref name=\"GuysDream\" />  Civic leaders truly supported the event for the first time: Mayor [[George Harry Webster|George Webster]] followed the costume suggestion and allowed downtown roads to be closed for two hours each morning of the six-day event to accommodate street parties.<ref name=\"Dixon36\" /> The new sport of [[chuckwagon racing]] was introduced and proved immediately popular.<ref>{{citation |title=2009 Calgary Stampede Evening Show Program |publisher=Calgary Stampede |page=8}}</ref> 138,950 people attended and the event earned a profit.<ref name=\"Dixon36\" />  Over 167,000 people attended in 1924 and the success guaranteed that the Stampede and Exhibition would be held together permanently.<ref name=\"Dixon38\">{{harvnb|Dixon|Read|2005|p=38}}</ref>\n\nAttendance grew annually throughout the 1920s, peaking at 258,496 in 1928, but the onset of the [[Great Depression]] resulted in attendance declines and financial losses.

He completed his school education from Leo Thirteenth High school, Alleppey and St. Ephrem's School, Mannanam. During his college life he had represented [[Kerala University]] football team.

Later on, [[Kunchacko]] of [[Udaya Studios]], Alleppey, identified his talent and gave him a role to act in his film ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' in which he acted as villain against the Evergreen Hero, [[Prem Nazir]]. This happened to be the first film in Malayalam in which a villain fights with the hero without a dupe and that role was performed with aplomb by Sasikumar. Subsequently, in addition to acting in several films produced by Udaya Studios he worked as the Assistant director of Kunchacko in those films. It was Kunchacko who identified that Sasikumar had in his repertoire the necessary talent and skills required for a director of movies.\n\nLater on, he joined [[Merryland Studios]], owned by the veteran director-producer [[P. Subramaniam]]. It was under his tutelage that Sasikumar was transformed into a great director. While in Merryland he worked with many renowned actors of that time, including T. K. Balachandran, Prem Nazir and [[Thikkurissi Sukumaran Nair]]. He worked as associate director to P. Subramaniam in addition to acting in some roles himself. Sasikumar still considers P.Subramanyam as a fatherly icon who had showered upon him fatherly affection and regards during his tenure at Merryland. The first independent film directed by Sasikumar was a documentary, namely ONAKKAZHCHA for [[Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited|Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT)]] regarding the use and effectiveness of fertilizers in agriculture.\n\n===Peak years===\nFollowing the advice of his friend [[Prem Nazir]], Sasikumar went to [[Chennai]] in the 1960s. He directed ''[[Thommante Makkal]]'' and ''[[Porter Kunjali]]'' for Thomas Pictures in 1965. He also directed, along with P. A. Thomas, the movie ''[[Kudumbini]]'' (1964) for Thomas Pictures, which received a Certificate of Merit at the annual [[National Film Awards]]. Subsequently, he directed an [[art film]],  ''[[Kavalam Chundan (film)|Kavalam Chundan]]'', which was a flop. As a result,a dejected Sasikumar decided to give up film direction and return to Kerala to join his father's oil mill business. It was Prem Nazir who encouraged him to return to Chennai where he directed the commercial film ''[[Jeevitha Yaathra]]'' which became a major hit. After this, Sasikumar understood that he couldn't make an art film like ''Kavalam Chundan'' with producers' money. But after his change of style from art to commercial films he never looked back.\n\nSasikumar went on to direct a long list of films, most of which succeeded at the box office. He was fondly called '''Hitmaker''' by the Malayalam film fraternity. Along with Prem Nazir he helped many producers who had lost their land and jewellery through movie production. Sasikumar holds the record for the maximum number of hit films made in Malayalam. Eighty-four films which he directed had Prem Nazir as hero (a world record) and in 1977 he directed 15 films which all fared well at the box office (world record ). [[Sathyan (actor)|Sathyan]], [[Prem Nazir]], [[Adoor Bhasi]], [[S. P. Pillai]], [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]], [[Jose Prakash]], [[Sheela]], [[Vijayasree]], [[K.R.Vijaya]], [[Sharada (actress)|Sharada]], [[Vidhubala]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], Sreelatha, [[Jayabharathi]], [[Sreevidya]], [[Nanditha Bose]], [[Unni Mary]], [[Kamal Hassan]], [[Sukumaran]], [[M. G. Soman|Soman]], Ravikumar, [[Jayan]], Vincent, [[Sobhana]], [[Shankar (actor)|Shankar]], [[Mammootty]] and [[Mohanlal]] all acted in his films. [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]], who had acted in the role of a mother in his old movie ''Thommante Makkal'' which had a story with a Christian background acted in the same movie, remade with a Hindu background and retitled ''Swanthamevide Banthamevide'' taking the same role after 25 years. Some years later, Sasikumar remade the same movie under the title \"Raja Vazhcha\". It was Sasikumar who introduced a new sophisticated villain to the Malayalam film world in the form of \"Silver Head\" enacted by Jose Prakash in one of his old films. During his long career in film he has directed more than 140 films in Malayalam and one film in Tamil. The trio consisting of Sasikumar, Sreekumaran Thampy and M.K Arjunan was the rage of the period 1969\u20131980.\n\n===Acting===\nSasikumar acted in small roles in films like ''[[Thiramala]], Sreerama Pattabhishekam, Velakkaran, [[Thommante Makkal]], Seetha, [[Snehadeepam]], Umma, [[Bhakta Kuchela (1961 film)|Bhakta Kuchela]], [[Snapaka Yohannan]], Kattumaina, [[Visappinte Vili]], [[Oral Koodi Kallanayi]]'' etc. He has also written the story, cinema script and dialogue for many of his films.\n\n==Style==\nSasikumar's films were not meant for active analysis by the intelligentsia or the critics, but for the common man especially the working class who sought some solace and relief from the hard and harsh realities of everyday life. His films occupied a special niche in this regard by providing wholesome entertainment to the masses. The themes of these films generally dealt with the problems of the common man and the injustice prevalent in society.\n\n==Collaborators==\nSasikumar launched the career of Malayalam film music composer [[Ravindran]] with his film ''Choola''. The renowned Malayalam music director [[M. K. Arjunan]] became popular after scoring music for Sasikumar's movie ''[[Rest House (film)|Rest House]]''. Other films had music by other well-known composers \u2013 [[Devarajan]], [[A. T. Ummer]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], [[Shyam (composer)|Shyam]], [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] and [[M. S. Viswanathan]]. His lyricists included [[Vayalar Rama Varma]], [[Sreekumaran Thampy]], [[O. N. V. Kurup]], [[P. Bhaskaran]] and K. Jayakumar, but Sreekumaran Thampy has been the lyricist in most of his films. All the songs in his film ''Devadasi'' of which the music was scored by Salil Chowdhury became great hits even though the film was not released on account of some problems with its producer, Adoor Padmakumar.\n\n[[Senthil]], the famous comedian in Tamil films, was introduced to film audiences through the film \"Ithikkara Pakki\" and Jagathy Sreekumar, a comedian of Malayalam films, through his film \"Chattambi Kalyani\". Jayabharathy was introduced to the Malayalam film world by Sasikumar through his movie \"Pen Makkal\". His assistants Crossbelt Mani, Baby, [[P. G. Viswambharan]], [G. Prem Kumar][[Thampi Kannanthanam]], and Asokan became successful independent directors later on. Some of the artists whom he had actively promoted and supported during his heyday have now become national icons and awardees. If cinema is considered a medium of entertainment Sasikumar has been an immense success. He created movies as per the zeitgeist. He gave the people of those times what they wanted and what they expected of him. And they wanted to see his movies again and again.\n\n==World records==\n* Maximum number of films directed by any director: 141\n* Maximum number of films having the same actor as hero : 84 ([[Prem Nazir]])\n* Maximum number of films directed in a year by any director in world cinema : 15 films in 1977\n\nThe Kerala state Government honoured him in the year 2013 by conferring on him the coveted [[J. C. Daniel Award]] for his manifold contributions to the Malayalam cinema.\n\n==Death==\nSasikumar suffered from age-related health problems towards the end of his life. He lost his wife following a period of brief illness and his son died subsequently following a heart attack. He died at a hospital in Kochi on 17 July 2014 at the age of 87. He was buried according to Christian rites at St. Michael's Church [[Alappuzha]], his home-town. This doyen of Malayalam cinema is survived by his two children Usha John and Sheela Robin.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n#''[[Kudumbini]]'' (1964 Sasikumar and P. A.

He completed his school education from Leo Thirteenth High school, Alleppey and St. Ephrem's School, Mannanam. During his college life he had represented [[Kerala University]] football team.

Later on, [[Kunchacko]] of [[Udaya Studios]], Alleppey, identified his talent and gave him a role to act in his film ''[[Visappinte Vili]]'' in which he acted as villain against the Evergreen Hero, [[Prem Nazir]]. This happened to be the first film in Malayalam in which a villain fights with the hero without a dupe and that role was performed with aplomb by Sasikumar. Subsequently, in addition to acting in several films produced by Udaya Studios he worked as the Assistant director of Kunchacko in those films. It was Kunchacko who identified that Sasikumar had in his repertoire the necessary talent and skills required for a director of movies.\n\nLater on, he joined [[Merryland Studios]], owned by the veteran director-producer [[P. Subramaniam]]. It was under his tutelage that Sasikumar was transformed into a great director. While in Merryland he worked with many renowned actors of that time, including T. K. Balachandran, Prem Nazir and [[Thikkurissi Sukumaran Nair]]. He worked as associate director to P. Subramaniam in addition to acting in some roles himself. Sasikumar still considers P.Subramanyam as a fatherly icon who had showered upon him fatherly affection and regards during his tenure at Merryland. The first independent film directed by Sasikumar was a documentary, namely ONAKKAZHCHA for [[Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited|Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore Limited (FACT)]] regarding the use and effectiveness of fertilizers in agriculture.\n\n===Peak years===\nFollowing the advice of his friend [[Prem Nazir]], Sasikumar went to [[Chennai]] in the 1960s. He directed ''[[Thommante Makkal]]'' and ''[[Porter Kunjali]]'' for Thomas Pictures in 1965. He also directed, along with P. A. Thomas, the movie ''[[Kudumbini]]'' (1964) for Thomas Pictures, which received a Certificate of Merit at the annual [[National Film Awards]]. Subsequently, he directed an [[art film]],  ''[[Kavalam Chundan (film)|Kavalam Chundan]]'', which was a flop. As a result,a dejected Sasikumar decided to give up film direction and return to Kerala to join his father's oil mill business. It was Prem Nazir who encouraged him to return to Chennai where he directed the commercial film ''[[Jeevitha Yaathra]]'' which became a major hit. After this, Sasikumar understood that he couldn't make an art film like ''Kavalam Chundan'' with producers' money. But after his change of style from art to commercial films he never looked back.\n\nSasikumar went on to direct a long list of films, most of which succeeded at the box office. He was fondly called '''Hitmaker''' by the Malayalam film fraternity. Along with Prem Nazir he helped many producers who had lost their land and jewellery through movie production. Sasikumar holds the record for the maximum number of hit films made in Malayalam. Eighty-four films which he directed had Prem Nazir as hero (a world record) and in 1977 he directed 15 films which all fared well at the box office (world record ). [[Sathyan (actor)|Sathyan]], [[Prem Nazir]], [[Adoor Bhasi]], [[S. P. Pillai]], [[Madhu (actor)|Madhu]], [[Jose Prakash]], [[Sheela]], [[Vijayasree]], [[K.R.Vijaya]], [[Sharada (actress)|Sharada]], [[Vidhubala]], [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], Sreelatha, [[Jayabharathi]], [[Sreevidya]], [[Nanditha Bose]], [[Unni Mary]], [[Kamal Hassan]], [[Sukumaran]], [[M. G. Soman|Soman]], Ravikumar, [[Jayan]], Vincent, [[Sobhana]], [[Shankar (actor)|Shankar]], [[Mammootty]] and [[Mohanlal]] all acted in his films. [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]], who had acted in the role of a mother in his old movie ''Thommante Makkal'' which had a story with a Christian background acted in the same movie, remade with a Hindu background and retitled ''Swanthamevide Banthamevide'' taking the same role after 25 years. Some years later, Sasikumar remade the same movie under the title \"Raja Vazhcha\". It was Sasikumar who introduced a new sophisticated villain to the Malayalam film world in the form of \"Silver Head\" enacted by Jose Prakash in one of his old films. During his long career in film he has directed more than 140 films in Malayalam and one film in Tamil. The trio consisting of Sasikumar, Sreekumaran Thampy and M.K Arjunan was the rage of the period 1969\u20131980.\n\n===Acting===\nSasikumar acted in small roles in films like ''[[Thiramala]], Sreerama Pattabhishekam, Velakkaran, [[Thommante Makkal]], Seetha, [[Snehadeepam]], Umma, [[Bhakta Kuchela (1961 film)|Bhakta Kuchela]], [[Snapaka Yohannan]], Kattumaina, [[Visappinte Vili]], [[Oral Koodi Kallanayi]]'' etc. He has also written the story, cinema script and dialogue for many of his films.\n\n==Style==\nSasikumar's films were not meant for active analysis by the intelligentsia or the critics, but for the common man especially the working class who sought some solace and relief from the hard and harsh realities of everyday life. His films occupied a special niche in this regard by providing wholesome entertainment to the masses. The themes of these films generally dealt with the problems of the common man and the injustice prevalent in society.\n\n==Collaborators==\nSasikumar launched the career of Malayalam film music composer [[Ravindran]] with his film ''Choola''. The renowned Malayalam music director [[M. K. Arjunan]] became popular after scoring music for Sasikumar's movie ''[[Rest House (film)|Rest House]]''. Other films had music by other well-known composers \u2013 [[Devarajan]], [[A. T. Ummer]], [[Salil Chowdhury]], [[Shyam (composer)|Shyam]], [[Johnson (composer)|Johnson]] and [[M. S. Viswanathan]]. His lyricists included [[Vayalar Rama Varma]], [[Sreekumaran Thampy]], [[O. N. V. Kurup]], [[P. Bhaskaran]] and K. Jayakumar, but Sreekumaran Thampy has been the lyricist in most of his films. All the songs in his film ''Devadasi'' of which the music was scored by Salil Chowdhury became great hits even though the film was not released on account of some problems with its producer, Adoor Padmakumar.\n\n[[Senthil]], the famous comedian in Tamil films, was introduced to film audiences through the film \"Ithikkara Pakki\" and Jagathy Sreekumar, a comedian of Malayalam films, through his film \"Chattambi Kalyani\". Jayabharathy was introduced to the Malayalam film world by Sasikumar through his movie \"Pen Makkal\". His assistants Crossbelt Mani, Baby, [[P. G. Viswambharan]], [G. Prem Kumar][[Thampi Kannanthanam]], and Asokan became successful independent directors later on. Some of the artists whom he had actively promoted and supported during his heyday have now become national icons and awardees. If cinema is considered a medium of entertainment Sasikumar has been an immense success. He created movies as per the zeitgeist. He gave the people of those times what they wanted and what they expected of him. And they wanted to see his movies again and again.\n\n==World records==\n* Maximum number of films directed by any director: 141\n* Maximum number of films having the same actor as hero : 84 ([[Prem Nazir]])\n* Maximum number of films directed in a year by any director in world cinema : 15 films in 1977\n\nThe Kerala state Government honoured him in the year 2013 by conferring on him the coveted [[J. C. Daniel Award]] for his manifold contributions to the Malayalam cinema.\n\n==Death==\nSasikumar suffered from age-related health problems towards the end of his life. He lost his wife following a period of brief illness and his son died subsequently following a heart attack. He died at a hospital in Kochi on 17 July 2014 at the age of 87. He was buried according to Christian rites at St. Michael's Church [[Alappuzha]], his home-town. This doyen of Malayalam cinema is survived by his two children Usha John and Sheela Robin.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n#''[[Kudumbini]]'' (1964 Sasikumar and P. A.
