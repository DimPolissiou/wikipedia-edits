Henry took [[Winchester College]] as his model, visiting on many occasions, borrowing its statutes and removing its headmaster and some of the scholars to start his new school.\n\nWhen Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land. The group of [[feoffee]]s appointed by the king to receive forfeited lands of the [[Alien priory|Alien Priories]] for the endowment of Eton were as follows:<ref>Watts, John, ''Henry VI and the Politics of Kingship'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=qTP4CF_boeoC&pg=PA169#v=twopage&q&f=false pp. 169\u201370], quoting Calendar of [[Patent Rolls]] 1436\u201341, pp. 454, 471.</ref>\n* [[Henry Chichele|Archbishop Chichele]]\n* Bishop Stafford\n* Bishop Lowe\n* Bishop Ayscough\n* [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole, 1st Marquess of Suffolk]] (1396\u20131450) (later Duke of Suffolk)\n* [[John Somerset]] (d. 1454), [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and the king's doctor\n* [[Thomas Beckington]] (c. 1390\u20131465), Archdeacon of Buckingham, the king's secretary and later [[Lord Privy Seal|Keeper of the Privy Seal]]\n* [[Richard Andrew]] (d. 1477), first Warden of [[All Souls College, Oxford]], later the king's secretary\n* [[Adam Moleyns]] (d. 1450), [[Clerk of the Council]]\n* John Hampton (d. 1472) of Kniver, Staffordshire, an [[Esquire of the Body]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingswinford.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/com/kinver/kinverchurch.htm |title=Kinver Church \u2013 kingswinford.org |publisher= |accessdate=4 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225020702/http://www.kingswinford.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/com/kinver/kinverchurch.htm |archivedate=25 February 2015  }}</ref>\n* James Fiennes, another member of the [[Royal Household]]\n* William Tresham, another member of the Royal Household\n\nIt was intended to have formidable buildings (Henry intended the [[nave]] of the [[Eton College Chapel|College Chapel]] to be the longest in Europe) and several religious [[relic]]s, supposedly including a part of the [[True Cross]] and the [[Crown of Thorns]].<ref name=lrb>{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Charles|title=At Eton|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n05/charles-hope/at-eton|accessdate=28 February 2013 |newspaper=London Review of Books|date=7 March 2013}}</ref> He persuaded the then [[Pope]], [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]], to grant him a privilege unparalleled anywhere in England: the right to grant [[indulgence]]s to [[penitent]]s on the [[Feast of the Assumption]]. The college also came into possession of one of England's [[English Apocalypse manuscripts|Apocalypse manuscripts]].\n\nHowever, when Henry was deposed by [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] in 1461, the new King annulled all grants to the school and removed most of its assets and treasures to [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], on the other side of the [[River Thames]]. Legend has it that Edward's mistress, [[Jane Shore]], intervened on the school's behalf. She was able to save a good part of the school,<ref>Nevill. p.5.</ref> although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced.\n\nConstruction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long,<ref>Nevill, p.5.</ref> with 18, or possibly 17, bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed. Only the [[choir (architecture)|Quire]] of the intended building was completed. Eton's first Headmaster, [[William Waynflete]], founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously Head Master of [[Winchester College]],<ref>Nevill, p.4.</ref> built the ante-chapel that completed the chapel. The important wall paintings in the chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, were built between 1441 and 1460.<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, Buildings of England \u2013 Buckinghamshire</ref>\n\nAs the school suffered reduced income while still under construction, the completion and further development of the school has since depended to some extent on wealthy benefactors. Building resumed when [[Roger Lupton]] was [[Provost (education)|Provost]], around 1517. His name is borne by the big [[gatehouse]] in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century \"leaving portraits\" are kept.\n\n\"After Lupton's time, nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel\".<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit. p.119.</ref> This was remodelled later and completed in 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725\u201329, by Thomas Rowland. It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.\n\n=== 19th century onwards ===\nIn the 19th century, the architect [[John Shaw Jr]] (1803\u20131870) became surveyor to Eton. He designed New Buildings (1844\u201346),<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit.</ref> Provost [[Francis Hodgson]]'s addition to providing better accommodation for collegers, who until then had mostly lived in Long Chamber, a long first-floor room where conditions were inhumane.<ref>Extracts from c. 20 of ''A History of Eton College'' by Maxwell Lyte:<br>These rooms contained little besides wooden bedsteads and bureaus. Chairs and tables [were] for the privileged few, and the wind whistled through the gaping casements.

The lower boys had to fetch water from the pump for [the seniors]. They themselves had neither washstands nor basins...New boys were tossed in blankets until about 1832. In 1834, \"the inmates of a workhouse are better fed than the scholars of Eton ...

In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's ''C'est ici qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9 la bataille de Waterloo'' (\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won\").\n\nAs with other public schools,<ref>The Boy's Own Paper Nov 1915 to September 1919</ref> a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarise privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.<ref>Arthur C. Benson, Hugh, Memoirs of a Brother, chapter eight</ref> The project of establishing an \"Eton Mission\" in the crowded district of [[Hackney Wick]] in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and it lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at [[Dorney]]) would be more realistic. However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by [[G. F. Bodley]] was erected; many Etonians visited and stimulated among other things the [[Eton Manor Boys' Club]], a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the [[59 Club]] for motorcyclists.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13350, England, Rudermannschaft.jpg|thumb|right|Pupils at Eton College dressed as members of various rowing crews taking part in the \"Procession of Boats\" on the River Thames during the \"Fourth of June\" celebrations 1932]]\nThe very large and ornate School Hall and School Library (by L. K. Hall) were erected in 1906\u201308 across the road from Upper School as the school's memorial to the Etonians who had died in the [[Boer War]]. Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the [[World War I|Great War]]. A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in [[World War II]] and blew out many windows in the Chapel. The college commissioned replacements by [[Evie Hone]] (1949\u201352) and by [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and [[Patrick Reyntiens]] (1959 onward).\n\nAmong headmasters of the 20th century were [[Cyril Alington]], [[Robert Birley]] and [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]].

This has been attributed to a number of factors, including the dissolution of the house lists, which allowed Old Etonians to register their sons at birth, in 1990, harder entrance examinations as the emphasis on academic attainment increased, a sharp rise in school fees increasingly beyond the means of many UK families, and increased applications from international, often very wealthy, families.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=de Bellaigue, Christopher|authorlink=Christopher de Bellaigue|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/features/eton-and-the-making-of-a-modern-elite|title=Eton and the making of a modern elite|magazine=[[1843 Magazine]]|date=August\u2013September 2016|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== School terms ==\n<!--[[Half (Eton)]] redirects here-->\nThere are three academic terms<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etoncollege.com/Michaelmas.aspx |title= The Michaelmas Half |publisher =Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> (known as halves)<ref>McConnell, p.30</ref> in the year:\n* The ''[[Michaelmas]] Half'', from early September to mid-December. New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.\n* The ''[[Lent]] Half'', from mid-January to late March.\n* The ''Summer Half'', from late April to late June or early July.\n\nThey are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.\n\n== Boys' houses ==\n\n=== King's Scholars ===\n{{Main|King's Scholar}}\nOne boarding house, ''College'', is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90 per cent of full fees, depending on their means. Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship. The name 'King's Scholars' refers to the foundation of the school by King Henry VI in 1440. The original school consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.\n\nKing's Scholars are entitled to use the letters 'KS' after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their [[tailcoat]]s, giving them the nickname 'tugs' (Latin: ''togati'', wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a [[surplice]] in Chapel. The house is looked after by the [[Master in College]]. Having succeeded in the examination, they include many of the most academically gifted boys in the school.\n\n=== Oppidans ===\nAs the school grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in boarding-houses within the town of Eton, outside the college's original buildings. These students became known as Oppidans, from the [[Latin]] word ''[[oppidum]]'', meaning \"town\".<ref>McConnell, pp.19\u201320</ref> The houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries the housemasters started to rely more for administrative purposes on a senior female member of staff, known as a \"dame\", who became responsible for the physical welfare of the boys. (Some houses had previously been run by dames without a housemaster.) Each house typically contains about 50 boys. Although classes are organised on a school basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their house.\n\nNot all boys who pass the college election examination choose to become King's Scholars, which involves living in \"College\" with its own ancient traditions, wearing a gown, and therefore a degree of separation from the other boys. If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan houses, they are known as [[Oppidan Scholar]]s.<ref>McConnell, p.177</ref> [[Oppidan Scholar|Oppidan scholarships]] may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in school and external examinations. To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career. Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] ''OS''.\n\nEach Oppidan house is usually referred to by the initials (forenames and surname) of its current housemaster, a senior teacher (\"beak\"), or more formally by his surname alone, not by the name of the building in which it is situated. Houses occasionally swap buildings according to the seniority of the housemaster and the physical desirability of the building. The names of buildings occupied by houses are used for few purposes other than a correspondence address. They are: Godolphin House, Jourdelay's (both built as such c. 1720),<ref name=autogenerated1>Pevsner op. cit.</ref> Hawtrey House, [[Richard Durnford|Durnford]] House (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.\n\n=== House structure ===\n[[File:MK17840 Eton College.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Front of Eton College]]\nIn addition to the house master, each house has a house captain and a house captain of games. Some houses have more than one. House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens. The old term, \"Library\", survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen. Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as \"Debate\".\n\nThere are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05\u20138:30&nbsp;p.m. These are known as \"Prayers\", due to their original nature. The house master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.\n\nFor much of Eton's history, junior boys had to act as \"fags\", or servants, to older boys. Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, \"Boy, Up!\" or \"Boy, Queue!\", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as [[fagging]], were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from the school office.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThere are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports.\n\n== Head Masters: 1442\u2013present ==\n{{Main|List of Head Masters of Eton College}}\n\n== Uniform ==\n[[File:Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester 4909925573 1cfc8ea5c0 o.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] in 1914 dress of a junior Eton pupil, wearing a top hat, neck-tie and \"bum-freezer\", none of which are now worn]]\nThe School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or [[morning coat]]) and black [[waistcoat]], a starched [[false-collar|stiff collar]] and black pinstriped trousers. Most pupils wear a white \"[[Necktie|tie]]\" which is a narrow strip of cloth folded over the joint of the collar to hide the collar stud, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar (\"Stick-Ups\"). There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see [[Eton College#Prefects|School Prefects]] and [[#King's Scholars|King's Scholars]] sections.\n\nThe long-standing belief that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1820<ref>Nevill, p.33.</ref> is unfounded. In 1862 headmaster [[Edward Balston]], in an interview with the [[Clarendon Commission]], noted little in the way of uniform.\n\n<blockquote>Lord Clarendon: One more question, which bears in some degree upon other schools, namely with regard to the dress. The boys do not wear any particular dress at Eton?\nEdward Balston: No, with the exception that they are obliged to wear a white neckcloth.\n\nLord Clarendon: Is the colour of their clothes much restricted?\n\nEdward Balston: We would not let them wear for instance a yellow coat or any other colour very much out of the way.\n\nLord Clarendon: If they do not adopt anything very extravagant either with respect to colour or cut you allow them to follow their own taste with respect to the choice of their clothes?\n\nEdward Balston: Yes.\n\nLord Lyttelton: They must wear the common round hat?\nEdward Balston: Yes.<ref>(1864).''Report of Her Majesty\u2019s Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Revenues and Management of Certain Colleges and Schools and the Studies Pursued and Instruction Given Therein; with an Appendix and Evidence, Vol. III.

The oldest classroom still in use, \"Lower School\", dates from the 15th century.\n\nEvery evening, about an hour and a quarter, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/Work.aspx |title=work |publisher =Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening.

In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts. The most prestigious is the [[Newcastle Scholarship]], awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics. Also of note is the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C block ([[Year Twelve|Year 12]]); and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject. Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; the Rorie Mackenzie Prize for Modern Languages; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize and the Wilder Prize for Theology. Prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.\n\nVarious benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad. These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.\n\n== Incentives and sanctions ==\nEton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work. An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a \"Show Up\", to be shown to the boy's tutors as evidence of progress.<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\">McConnell, p.84</ref> If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be \"Commended for Good Effort\" to the Head Master (or Lower Master).\n\nIf any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be \"Sent Up For Good\",<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\" /> storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.\n\nThe opposite of a Show Up is a \"Rip\".<ref>McConnell, pp.82\u201383</ref> This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature. Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a \"White Ticket\", a form of a progress report which must be signed at intervals by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or [[School punishment#Writing lines|writing lines]]. In recent times,{{when|date=April 2012}} a milder form of the rip, 'sign for information', colloquially known as an \"info\", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy's housemaster and tutor.\n\nInternal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas half (i.e. autumn term) for all pupils, and in the Summer half for those in the first, second and fourth years (i.e. those not taking a full set of public examinations). These internal examinations are called \"Trials\".<ref>McConnell, pp.85\u201389</ref>\n\nA boy who is late for any division or other appointments may be required to sign \"Tardy Book\", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35 am and 7:45 am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).<ref>McConnell, p.42</ref> Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is placed \"on the Bill\", which involves him being summoned by the sudden entry of a prefect into one of his divisions, who announces in a loud and formal tone that at a given time a certain pupil must attend the office of the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.<ref name=\"McConnell, pp.83-84\">McConnell, pp.83\u201384</ref> The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or [[Rustication (academia)|rustication]] (suspension) or in former times, beating. Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils may claim it as a \"run\" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration, provided they report their intention so to do at the school office.\n\nA traditional punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin [[hexameters]]. Offenders were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, [[Georgics]] (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6351331.stm |title=Cameron defiant over drug claims |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.\n\n=== Corporal punishment ===\nEton used to be renowned for its use of [[school corporal punishment|corporal punishment]], generally known as \"beating\".

Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a [[birching]] on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held.  [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]], Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with [[caning]], also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office.<ref>Onyeama, Dillibe (1972). ''Nigger at Eton''. London: Leslie Frewin. p.100. {{ISBN|978-0-85632-003-3}}</ref> Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane offenders over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see [[Eton college#Prefects|Eton Society]] below) in the form of a \"Pop-Tanning\", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.<ref>Cheetham, Anthony; Parfit, Derek (1964). ''Eton Microcosm''. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. {{OCLC|7396426}}</ref>\n\nChenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, [[Michael McCrum]], retained private corporal punishment by masters but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underwear down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master. By the mid-1970s, the only people allowed to administer caning were the Head Master and the Lower Master.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dixon, Mark |title=An Eton Schoolboy's Album |year=1985 |publisher=Debrett's |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/etonschoolboysal0000dixo/page/95 95] |isbn=978-0-905649-78-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/etonschoolboysal0000dixo/page/95 }}</ref>\n\n== Prefects ==\nIn addition to the masters, the following three categories of senior boys are entitled to exercise School discipline.

It is thus truly an elite within an elite. It is a driving ambition of many capable Eton schoolboys to be elected to Pop, and many high-performers who are refused entry to this elite consider their careers at Eton a failure. [[Boris Johnson]] was a member of Pop, whilst [[David Cameron]] (unlike his elder brother [[Alexander Cameron (barrister)|Alexander]]) failed to be elected, a fact which possibly fed their later political rivalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-best-of-enemies-david-cameron-vs-boris-johnson-2335578.html|title=The best of enemies: David Cameron vs Boris Johnson|date=11 August 2011|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Members of Pop wear white and black [[houndstooth]]-checked trousers, a starched stick-up collar and white bow-tie, and are entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats, often of their own design. Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas<ref>Nevill, p.35.</ref> or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building. However, this tradition has died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events, and generally maintain order. Notable ex-members of Pop include [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]; [[Eddie Redmayne]]; and [[Boris Johnson]].\n* <span id=\"SixthFormSelect\">'''Sixth Form Select:'''</span> an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King's Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars.<ref>McConnell, pp.57, 129\u2013137</ref> Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats.

Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the [[didgeridoo]]. The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.

There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 \"independent\" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years. The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.\n\nIn recent years, the School has put on a musical version of ''[[The Bacchae]]'' (October 2009) as well as productions of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (May 2010), ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' (February 2011), ''[[Joseph K]]'' (October 2011), ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (May 2012), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (October 2012), ''[[London Assurance]]'' (May 2013), ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'' (October 2013), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (May 2014), \"[[Antigone]]\" (October 2015), \"[[The Government Inspector]]\" (May 2016) and \"[[Romeo and Juliet]]\" (May 2017). On top of this, every three years, the School holds a fringe-style School Play Festival, where students and teachers write, direct and act in their own plays, hosted over the period of a week. The most recent one was held in October 2016, which hosted a wide variety of plays, from a double bill of two half an hour plays, to a serialised radio drama, written by a boy in F block (the youngest year.)\n\nOften girls from surrounding schools, such as [[St. George's School, Ascot|St George's, Ascot]], [[St Mary's School Ascot]], [[Windsor Girls' School]] and [[Heathfield St Mary's School]], are cast in female roles.

Henry took [[Winchester College]] as his model, visiting on many occasions, borrowing its statutes and removing its headmaster and some of the scholars to start his new school.\n\nWhen Henry VI founded the school, he granted it a large number of endowments, including much valuable land.

Legend has it that Edward's mistress, [[Jane Shore]], intervened on the school's behalf. She was able to save a good part of the school,<ref>Nevill. p.5.</ref> although the royal bequest and the number of staff were much reduced.\n\nConstruction of the chapel, originally intended to be slightly over twice as long,<ref>Nevill, p.5.</ref> with 18, or possibly 17, bays (there are eight today) was stopped when Henry VI was deposed.

Building resumed when [[Roger Lupton]] was [[Provost (education)|Provost]], around 1517. His name is borne by the big [[gatehouse]] in the west range of the cloisters, fronting School Yard, perhaps the most famous image of the school. This range includes the important interiors of the Parlour, Election Hall, and Election Chamber, where most of the 18th century \"leaving portraits\" are kept.\n\n\"After Lupton's time, nothing important was built until about 1670, when Provost Allestree gave a range to close the west side of School Yard between Lower School and Chapel\".<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, op. cit. p.119.</ref> This was remodelled later and completed in 1694 by Matthew Bankes, Master Carpenter of the Royal Works. The last important addition to the central college buildings was the College Library, in the south range of the cloister, 1725\u201329, by Thomas Rowland. It has a very important collection of books and manuscripts.\n\n=== 19th century onwards ===\nIn the 19th century, the architect [[John Shaw Jr]] (1803\u20131870) became surveyor to Eton.

In 1889, Sir William Fraser conflated this uncorroborated remark with the one attributed to him by Count Charles de Montalembert's ''C'est ici qu'a \u00e9t\u00e9 gagn\u00e9 la bataille de Waterloo'' (\"It is here that the Battle of Waterloo was won\").\n\nAs with other public schools,<ref>The Boy's Own Paper Nov 1915 to September 1919</ref> a scheme was devised towards the end of the 19th century to familiarise privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas.<ref>Arthur C.

However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by [[G. F.

Many tablets in the cloisters and chapel commemorate the large number of dead Etonians of the [[World War I|Great War]]. A bomb destroyed part of Upper School in [[World War II]] and blew out many windows in the Chapel.

This has been attributed to a number of factors, including the dissolution of the house lists, which allowed Old Etonians to register their sons at birth, in 1990, harder entrance examinations as the emphasis on academic attainment increased, a sharp rise in school fees increasingly beyond the means of many UK families, and increased applications from international, often very wealthy, families.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=de Bellaigue, Christopher|authorlink=Christopher de Bellaigue|url=https://www.1843magazine.com/features/eton-and-the-making-of-a-modern-elite|title=Eton and the making of a modern elite|magazine=[[1843 Magazine]]|date=August\u2013September 2016|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== School terms ==\n<!--[[Half (Eton)]] redirects here-->\nThere are three academic terms<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.etoncollege.com/Michaelmas.aspx |title= The Michaelmas Half |publisher =Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> (known as halves)<ref>McConnell, p.30</ref> in the year:\n* The ''[[Michaelmas]] Half'', from early September to mid-December. New boys are now admitted only at the start of the Michaelmas Half, unless in exceptional circumstances.\n* The ''[[Lent]] Half'', from mid-January to late March.\n* The ''Summer Half'', from late April to late June or early July.\n\nThey are called halves because the school year was once split into two halves, between which the boys went home.\n\n== Boys' houses ==\n\n=== King's Scholars ===\n{{Main|King's Scholar}}\nOne boarding house, ''College'', is reserved for 70 King's Scholars, who attend Eton on scholarships provided by the original foundation and awarded by examination each year; King's Scholars pay up to 90 per cent of full fees, depending on their means. Of the other pupils, up to a third receive some kind of bursary or scholarship. The name 'King's Scholars' refers to the foundation of the school by King Henry VI in 1440. The original school consisted of the 70 Scholars (together with some Commensals) and the Scholars were educated and boarded at the foundation's expense.\n\nKing's Scholars are entitled to use the letters 'KS' after their name and they can be identified by a black gown worn over the top of their [[tailcoat]]s, giving them the nickname 'tugs' (Latin: ''togati'', wearers of gowns); and occasionally by a [[surplice]] in Chapel. The house is looked after by the [[Master in College]]. Having succeeded in the examination, they include many of the most academically gifted boys in the school.\n\n=== Oppidans ===\nAs the school grew, more students were allowed to attend provided that they paid their own fees and lived in boarding-houses within the town of Eton, outside the college's original buildings. These students became known as Oppidans, from the [[Latin]] word ''[[oppidum]]'', meaning \"town\".<ref>McConnell, pp.19\u201320</ref> The houses developed over time as a means of providing residence for the Oppidans in a more congenial manner, and during the 18th and 19th centuries the housemasters started to rely more for administrative purposes on a senior female member of staff, known as a \"dame\", who became responsible for the physical welfare of the boys. (Some houses had previously been run by dames without a housemaster.) Each house typically contains about 50 boys. Although classes are organised on a school basis, most boys spend a large proportion of their time in their house.\n\nNot all boys who pass the college election examination choose to become King's Scholars, which involves living in \"College\" with its own ancient traditions, wearing a gown, and therefore a degree of separation from the other boys. If they choose instead to belong to one of the 24 Oppidan houses, they are known as [[Oppidan Scholar]]s.<ref>McConnell, p.177</ref> [[Oppidan Scholar|Oppidan scholarships]] may also be awarded for consistently performing with distinction in school and external examinations. To gain an Oppidan Scholarship, a boy must have either three distinctions in a row or four throughout his career. Within the school, an Oppidan Scholar is entitled to use the [[post-nominal letters]] ''OS''.\n\nEach Oppidan house is usually referred to by the initials (forenames and surname) of its current housemaster, a senior teacher (\"beak\"), or more formally by his surname alone, not by the name of the building in which it is situated. Houses occasionally swap buildings according to the seniority of the housemaster and the physical desirability of the building. The names of buildings occupied by houses are used for few purposes other than a correspondence address. They are: Godolphin House, Jourdelay's (both built as such c. 1720),<ref name=autogenerated1>Pevsner op. cit.</ref> Hawtrey House, [[Richard Durnford|Durnford]] House (the first two built as such by the Provost and Fellows, 1845,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> when the school was increasing in numbers and needed more centralised control), The Hopgarden, South Lawn, Waynflete, Evans's, Keate House, Warre House, Villiers House, Common Lane House, Penn House, Walpole House, Cotton Hall, Wotton House, Holland House, Mustians, Angelo's, Manor House, Farrer House, Baldwin's Bec, The Timbralls, and Westbury.\n\n=== House structure ===\n[[File:MK17840 Eton College.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Front of Eton College]]\nIn addition to the house master, each house has a house captain and a house captain of games. Some houses have more than one. House prefects were once elected from the oldest year, but this no longer happens. The old term, \"Library\", survives in the name of the room set aside for the oldest year's use, where boys have their own kitchen. Similarly, boys in their penultimate year have a room known as \"Debate\".\n\nThere are entire house gatherings every evening, usually around 8:05\u20138:30&nbsp;p.m. These are known as \"Prayers\", due to their original nature. The house master and boys have an opportunity to make announcements, and sometimes the boys provide light entertainment.\n\nFor much of Eton's history, junior boys had to act as \"fags\", or servants, to older boys. Their duties included cleaning, cooking, and running errands. A Library member was entitled to yell at any time and without notice, \"Boy, Up!\" or \"Boy, Queue!\", and all first-year boys had to come running. The last boy to arrive was given the task. These practices, known as [[fagging]], were partially phased out of most houses in the 1970s. Captains of house and games still sometimes give tasks to first-year boys, such as collecting the mail from the school office.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThere are many inter-house competitions, mostly in sports.\n\n== Head Masters: 1442\u2013present ==\n{{Main|List of Head Masters of Eton College}}\n\n== Uniform ==\n[[File:Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester 4909925573 1cfc8ea5c0 o.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]] in 1914 dress of a junior Eton pupil, wearing a top hat, neck-tie and \"bum-freezer\", none of which are now worn]]\nThe School is known for its traditions, including a uniform of black tailcoat (or [[morning coat]]) and black [[waistcoat]], a starched [[false-collar|stiff collar]] and black pinstriped trousers. Most pupils wear a white \"[[Necktie|tie]]\" which is a narrow strip of cloth folded over the joint of the collar to hide the collar stud, but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar (\"Stick-Ups\"). There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see [[Eton College#Prefects|School Prefects]] and [[#King's Scholars|King's Scholars]] sections.\n\nThe long-standing belief that the present uniform was first worn as mourning for the death of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1820<ref>Nevill, p.33.</ref> is unfounded.

The oldest classroom still in use, \"Lower School\", dates from the 15th century.\n\nEvery evening, about an hour and a quarter, known as Quiet Hour, is set aside, during which boys are expected to study or prepare work for their teachers if not otherwise engaged.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etoncollege.com/Work.aspx |title=work |publisher =Eton College |year=2008}}</ref> Some Houses, at the discretion of the House Master, may observe a second Quiet Hour after prayers in the evening.

In addition, many subjects and activities have specially endowed prizes, several of which are awarded by visiting experts. The most prestigious is the [[Newcastle Scholarship]], awarded on the strength of an examination, consisting of two papers in philosophical theology, moral theory and applied ethics. Also of note is the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Coutts Prize, awarded on the results of trials and AS-level examinations in C block ([[Year Twelve|Year 12]]); and the Huxley Prize, awarded for a project on a scientific subject. Other specialist prizes include the Newcastle Classical Prize; the Rosebery Exhibition for History; the Queen's Prizes for French and German; the Duke of Newcastle's Russian Prize; the Beddington Spanish Prize; the Strafford and Bowman Shakespeare Prizes; the Tomline and Russell Prizes in Mathematics; the Sotheby Prize for History of Art; the Waddington Prize for Theology and Philosophy; the Birley Prize for History; the Rorie Mackenzie Prize for Modern Languages; The Lower Boy Rosebery Prize and the Wilder Prize for Theology. Prizes are awarded too for excellence in such activities as painting, sculpture, ceramics, playing musical instruments, musical composition, declamation, silverwork, and design.\n\nVarious benefactions make it possible to give grants each year to boys who wish, for educational or cultural reasons, to work or travel abroad. These include the Busk Fund, which supports individual ventures that show particular initiative; the C. M. Wells Memorial Trust Fund, for the promotion of visits to classical lands; the Sadler Fund, which supports, among others, those intending to enter the Foreign Service; and the Marsden Fund, for travel in countries where the principal language is not English.\n\n== Incentives and sanctions ==\nEton has a well-established system for encouraging boys to produce high-standard work. An excellent piece of work may be rewarded with a \"Show Up\", to be shown to the boy's tutors as evidence of progress.<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\">McConnell, p.84</ref> If, in any particular term, a pupil makes a particularly good effort in any subject, he may be \"Commended for Good Effort\" to the Head Master (or Lower Master).\n\nIf any boy produces an outstanding piece of work, it may be \"Sent Up For Good\",<ref name=\"McConnell, p.84\" /> storing the effort in the College Archives for posterity. This award has been around since the 18th century. As Sending Up For Good is fairly infrequent, the process is rather mysterious to many of Eton's boys. First, the master wishing to Send Up For Good must gain the permission of the relevant Head of Department. Upon receiving his or her approval, the piece of work will be marked with Sent Up For Good and the student will receive a card to be signed by House Master, tutor and division master.\n\nThe opposite of a Show Up is a \"Rip\".<ref>McConnell, pp.82\u201383</ref> This is for sub-standard work, which is sometimes torn at the top of the page/sheet and must be submitted to the boy's housemaster for signature. Boys who accumulate rips are liable to be given a \"White Ticket\", a form of a progress report which must be signed at intervals by all his teachers and may be accompanied by other punishments, usually involving doing domestic chores or [[School punishment#Writing lines|writing lines]]. In recent times,{{when|date=April 2012}} a milder form of the rip, 'sign for information', colloquially known as an \"info\", has been introduced, which must also be signed by the boy's housemaster and tutor.\n\nInternal examinations are held at the end of the Michaelmas half (i.e. autumn term) for all pupils, and in the Summer half for those in the first, second and fourth years (i.e. those not taking a full set of public examinations). These internal examinations are called \"Trials\".<ref>McConnell, pp.85\u201389</ref>\n\nA boy who is late for any division or other appointments may be required to sign \"Tardy Book\", a register kept in the School Office, between 7:35 am and 7:45 am, every morning for the duration of his sentence (typically three days).<ref>McConnell, p.42</ref> Tardy Book may also be issued for late work. For more serious misdeeds, a boy is placed \"on the Bill\", which involves him being summoned by the sudden entry of a prefect into one of his divisions, who announces in a loud and formal tone that at a given time a certain pupil must attend the office of the Head Master, or Lower Master if the boy is in the lower two years, to talk personally about his misdeeds.<ref name=\"McConnell, pp.83-84\">McConnell, pp.83\u201384</ref> The most serious misdeeds may result in expulsion, or [[Rustication (academia)|rustication]] (suspension) or in former times, beating. Conversely, should a master be more than 15 minutes late for a class, traditionally the pupils may claim it as a \"run\" and absent themselves for the rest of its duration, provided they report their intention so to do at the school office.\n\nA traditional punishment took the form of being made to copy, by hand, Latin [[hexameters]]. Offenders were frequently set 100 hexameters by Library members, or, for more serious offences, [[Georgics]] (more than 500 hexameters) by their House Masters or the Head Master.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6351331.stm |title=Cameron defiant over drug claims |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2007 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref> The giving of a Georgic is now extremely rare, but still occasionally occurs.\n\n=== Corporal punishment ===\nEton used to be renowned for its use of [[school corporal punishment|corporal punishment]], generally known as \"beating\".

Until 1964, offending boys could be summoned to the Head Master or the Lower Master, as appropriate, to receive a [[birching]] on the bare posterior, in a semi-public ceremony held in the Library, where there was a special wooden birching block over which the offender was held.  [[Anthony Chenevix-Trench]], Head Master from 1964 to 1970, abolished the birch and replaced it with [[caning]], also applied to the bare buttocks, which he administered privately in his office.<ref>Onyeama, Dillibe (1972). ''Nigger at Eton''. London: Leslie Frewin. p.100. {{ISBN|978-0-85632-003-3}}</ref> Chenevix-Trench also abolished corporal punishment administered by senior boys. Previously, House Captains were permitted to cane offenders over the seat of the trousers. This was a routine occurrence, carried out privately with the boy bending over with his head under the edge of a table. Less common but more severe were the canings administered by Pop (see [[Eton college#Prefects|Eton Society]] below) in the form of a \"Pop-Tanning\", in which a large number of hard strokes were inflicted by the President of Pop in the presence of all Pop members (or, in earlier times, each member of Pop took it in turns to inflict a stroke). The culprit was summoned to appear in a pair of old trousers, as the caning would cut the cloth to shreds. This was the most severe form of physical punishment at Eton.<ref>Cheetham, Anthony; Parfit, Derek (1964). ''Eton Microcosm''. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. {{OCLC|7396426}}</ref>\n\nChenevix-Trench's successor from 1970, [[Michael McCrum]], retained private corporal punishment by masters but ended the practice of requiring boys to take their trousers and underwear down when bending over to be caned by the Head Master.

It is thus truly an elite within an elite. It is a driving ambition of many capable Eton schoolboys to be elected to Pop, and many high-performers who are refused entry to this elite consider their careers at Eton a failure. [[Boris Johnson]] was a member of Pop, whilst [[David Cameron]] (unlike his elder brother [[Alexander Cameron (barrister)|Alexander]]) failed to be elected, a fact which possibly fed their later political rivalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/the-best-of-enemies-david-cameron-vs-boris-johnson-2335578.html|title=The best of enemies: David Cameron vs Boris Johnson|date=11 August 2011|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=27 August 2019}}</ref> Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Members of Pop wear white and black [[houndstooth]]-checked trousers, a starched stick-up collar and white bow-tie, and are entitled to wear flamboyant waistcoats, often of their own design. Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas<ref>Nevill, p.35.</ref> or sit on the wall on the Long Walk, in front of the main building. However, this tradition has died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events, and generally maintain order. Notable ex-members of Pop include [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]]; [[Eddie Redmayne]]; and [[Boris Johnson]].\n* <span id=\"SixthFormSelect\">'''Sixth Form Select:'''</span> an academically selected prefectorial group consisting, by custom, of the 10 senior King's Scholars and the 10 senior Oppidan Scholars.<ref>McConnell, pp.57, 129\u2013137</ref> Members of Sixth Form Select are entitled to wear silver buttons on their waistcoats.

During this half, Collegers also play the [[Eton wall game]]; this game received national publicity when it was taken up by [[Prince Harry]].

Many instruments are taught, including obscure ones such as the [[didgeridoo]]. The School participates in many national competitions; many pupils are part of the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], and the School gives scholarships for dedicated and talented musicians.

There are about 8 or 9 house productions each year, around 3 or 4 \"independent\" plays (not confined solely to one house, produced, directed and funded by Etonians) and three school plays, one specifically for boys in the first two years, and two open to all years. The School Plays have such good reputations that they are normally fully booked every night.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Productions also take place in varying locations around the School, varying from the sports fields to more historic buildings such as Upper School and College Chapel.\n\nIn recent years, the School has put on a musical version of ''[[The Bacchae]]'' (October 2009) as well as productions of ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (May 2010), ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' (February 2011), ''[[Joseph K]]'' (October 2011), ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (May 2012), ''[[Macbeth]]'' (October 2012), ''[[London Assurance]]'' (May 2013), ''[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]'' (October 2013), ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (May 2014), \"[[Antigone]]\" (October 2015), \"[[The Government Inspector]]\" (May 2016) and \"[[Romeo and Juliet]]\" (May 2017). On top of this, every three years, the School holds a fringe-style School Play Festival, where students and teachers write, direct and act in their own plays, hosted over the period of a week. The most recent one was held in October 2016, which hosted a wide variety of plays, from a double bill of two half an hour plays, to a serialised radio drama, written by a boy in F block (the youngest year.)\n\nOften girls from surrounding schools, such as [[St. George's School, Ascot|St George's, Ascot]], [[St Mary's School Ascot]], [[Windsor Girls' School]] and [[Heathfield St Mary's School]], are cast in female roles.

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin script was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Pala'wan script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" B1 Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha''') which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage: straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''suyat'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

And the other one \" \u1734\" was introduced by Antoon Postma. \n\n=== Punctuation and spelling ===\nBaybayin writing makes use of only two punctuation marks (originally only one), the Philippine single ({{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}) (acting today as a comma, or verse splitter in poetry) and double punctuation ({{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}) (main punctuation, acting today as a period or end of paragraph), which are similar to single and double danda signs in other Brahmic scripts. These signs (which may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes) are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used on traditional supports, but is common today.\n\n=== Example sentences ===\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170c\u170b\u1705\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u1708\u1704\u1714\u1703\u1703\u1702\u1708\u170f\u1700\u1708\u1714\u1735 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u170b\u1704\u1714 \u1709\u1703\u1711\u1712\u1708\u1711\u1713\u1708\u1714\u1736}}\n*: ''Yamang \u2018di nagkakaunawaan, ay mag-pakahinahon.''\n*: Remain calm in disagreements.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u1704\u1714\u1706\u1708\u1712\u170b\u1714 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u170a\u1712\u1707\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''Magtanim ay 'di bir\u00f2.''\n*: Planting is not a joke.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u170b\u1711\u170e\u1712\u1708\u1714 \u1703\u1712\u1706 \u1711\u1705\u1714\u1704\u1705\u1714 \u1710 \u1709\u1713\u170b\u1713\u1706\u1712 \u1700\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u1713\u1711\u1713\u1703\u1714 \u1703\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''M\u00e1mahalin kit\u00e1 hangg\u00e1ng sa pumut\u00ed ang buh\u00f3k ko.''\n*: I will love you until my hair turns white.\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E;

A Gujarati origin for scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a South Sulawesi script, probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of coda consonant markers in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have coda consonants, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin script was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Pala'wan script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. One theory is that \"Baybayin\" got its name from a place or a word \"baybay,\" or seashore in ancient Tagalog and present Waray dialect (Casal,CNN).\n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" B1 Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==== Old Sumatran \"Malay\" scripts ====\nAnother hypothesis states that a script or script used to write one of the Malay languages was adopted and became Baybayin. In particular, the [[Pallava]] script from Sumatra is attested to the 7th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |title=Bahasa Melayu Kuno |website=Bahasa Malaysia Online Learning Resource |accessdate=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226183127/http://www.bahasa-malaysia-simple-fun.com/bahasa-melayu-kuno.html |archivedate=26 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==== Old Assamese ====\nThe [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]] was a precursor to ''[[devan\u0101gar\u012b]]''. This hypothesis states that a version of this script was introduced to the Philippines via [[Bengal]], before ultimately evolving into ''baybayin''.\n\n==== Cham ====\nFinally, an early Cham script from [[Champa]] \u2014 in what is now southern [[Vietnam]] and southeastern [[Cambodia]] \u2014 could have been introduced or borrowed and adapted into Baybayin.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha''') which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letterforms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage: straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n====Pre-colonial and colonial usage====\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''suyat'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''suyat'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\nIt is used in the most current [[Banknotes of the Philippine peso#New Generation Currency series (current)|New Generation Currency series of the Philippine peso]] issued in the last quarter of 2010.

The film was directed by [[Tony Randel]], who also co-wrote the script with Peter Atkins, and stars [[Gary Daniels]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Isako Washio]] and [[Malcolm McDowell]]. A [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the film was produced by [[Toei Video]] which featured the cast of the 1980s anime television series reprising their roles.\n\nThe film, which loosely adapts the first story arc of the original manga, centers on [[Kenshiro|Ken]] (Daniels), the lone master of the \"[[Hokuto Shinken|North Star]]\" martial art school, who wanders the post-apocalyptic Earth in search of his nemesis Lord Shin, the man who killed his master and kidnapped his fiancee. Meanwhile, Shin rules as dictator of the city of Southern Cross with his personal army known as the Crossmen, who are given orders to hunt down Kenshiro.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the aftermath of [[World War III]], the world has plunged into anarchy and chaos. Water is scarce and what is left of the human race scrounges for survival. Two opposing martial arts schools, North Star and Southern Cross, both devoted to bringing order to the world, were previously thrown into disarray after Southern Cross adept Shin turned against his masters and summarily executed North Star master Ryuken, leaving his son Kenshiro as the sole heir to the North Star. Shin then sought Kenshiro himself, defeated him and left him for dead after carving his chest with seven scars in the shape of the [[Big Dipper]]. Shin also abducted Kenshiro's fiancee and their shared love interest Julia, segregating her in his tower. Since then, Shin rules the land with an iron fist through a militia called the Crossmen, led by Jackal, a ruthless henchman whose bulging head is held in leather bandages after Kenshiro disfgured him in an earlier fight.\n\nBack in the current time, Kenshiro, who survived Shin's aggression, wanders the wasteland aimlessly. After killing a gang led by bandit Zeed, who attacked the homestead that had given him shelter for the night, Kenshiro continues on towards the town of Paradise Valley, home to one of the few remaining sources of pure water, where the villagers are organizing a resistance against the Crossmen's incursions. There, he meets orphan siblings Bat and Lynn. After using a pressure point technique to restore Lynn's sight, which she lost after watching her parents murdered by Crossmen, Kenshiro departs, ignoring Lynn's plea to remain and protect them. Bat follows Kenshiro to talk him into returning to town, to no avail.\n\nThe Crossmen raid Paradise Valley and occupy it, commandeering the well. Jackal orders Lynn's execution for sedition, but halts it after she threateningly mentions Kenshiro, taking her prisoner instead to extort Kenshiro's whereabouts. As Lynn's screams from afar ring inside Kenshiro's head, Kenshiro turns back: he and Bat infiltrate the occupied town and free Lynn, but Bat is mortally wounded in a fight against Jackal. Kenshiro spares Jackal and sends him back to Shin to announce his arrival.\n\nBy Shin's order, Jackal takes Julia to the tower's basement to hide her from Kenshiro. There, he engages in a [[cat-and-mouse game]] in an attempt to rape and kill Julia. Kenshiro breaks into Shin's tower and confronts him in the throne room. As Kenshiro gains the upper hand in the ensuing showdown, Shin lies about Julia's fate and takes advantage of Kenshiro's shock to overpower him. However, after noticing a bud that has sprouted from a seed he had given Julia long before, Kenshiro regains hope and defeats Shin, killing him. After freeing herself from Jackal by removing his bandages and causing his head to swell and explode, Julia rejoins Kenshiro. The surviving Crossmen bow to Kenshiro and Julia in deference.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Gary Daniels]] as [[Kenshiro]]\n* [[Costas Mandylor]] as Lord Shin\n* [[Chris Penn]] as Jackal\n* [[Isako Washio]] as Julia\n* [[Melvin Van Peebles]] as Asher\n* [[Downtown Julie Brown]] as Charlie\n* [[Dante Basco]] as Bat\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Paul McCarthy\n* [[Clint Howard]] as Stalin\n* [[Big Van Vader]] as Goliath\n* Paulo Tocha as Stone\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as Ryuken\n* Nalona Herron as Lynn\n* Bill Nagel as Miner\n* Andre Rosey Brown as Sandman\n* Rowena Guinness as Jill McCarthy\n* Michael Charles Friedman as Neuter\n* Nils Allen Stewart as Zeed\n* [[Tony Halme]] as Kemp\n* [[David \"Shark\" Fralick]] as Man at Palace\n* [[George Kee Cheung]] as Neville\n* [[Michael Franco]] as AWOL Crossman A\n* David Loo as AWOL Crossman B\n* [[Susan French]] as Old Woman\n* [[Chris DeRose]] as Oswald\n* [[Darryl Chan]] as Novack\n* [[Marisa Coughlan]] as Jenny\n* Kate Geer as Mother\n}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was not reviewed by many mainstream critics, and it got mixed reviews from fans and online critics.

The film was directed by [[Tony Randel]], who also co-wrote the script with Peter Atkins, and stars [[Gary Daniels]], [[Costas Mandylor]], [[Chris Penn]], [[Isako Washio]] and [[Malcolm McDowell]]. A [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of the film was produced by [[Toei Video]] which featured the cast of the 1980s anime television series reprising their roles.\n\nThe film, which loosely adapts the first story arc of the original manga, centers on [[Kenshiro|Ken]] (Daniels), the lone master of the \"[[Hokuto Shinken|North Star]]\" martial art school, who wanders the post-apocalyptic Earth in search of his nemesis Lord Shin, the man who killed his master and kidnapped his fiancee. Meanwhile, Shin rules as dictator of the city of Southern Cross with his personal army known as the Crossmen, who are given orders to hunt down Kenshiro.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the aftermath of [[World War III]], the world has plunged into anarchy and chaos. Water is scarce and what is left of the human race scrounges for survival. Two opposing martial arts schools, North Star and Southern Cross, both devoted to bringing order to the world, were previously thrown into disarray after Southern Cross adept Shin turned against his masters and summarily executed North Star master Ryuken, leaving his son Kenshiro as the sole heir to the North Star. Shin then sought Kenshiro himself, defeated him and left him for dead after carving his chest with seven scars in the shape of the [[Big Dipper]]. Shin also abducted Kenshiro's fiancee and their shared love interest Julia, segregating her in his tower. Since then, Shin rules the land with an iron fist through a militia called the Crossmen, led by Jackal, a ruthless henchman whose bulging head is held in leather bandages after Kenshiro disfgured him in an earlier fight.\n\nBack in the current time, Kenshiro, who survived Shin's attack, wanders the wasteland aimlessly. After killing a gang led by bandit Zeed, who attacked the homestead that has given him shelter for the night, Kenshiro continues on towards the town of Paradise Valley, home to one of the few remaining sources of pure water, where the villagers are organizing a resistance against the Crossmen's incursions. There, he meets orphan siblings Bat and Lynn. After using a pressure point technique to restore Lynn's sight, which she lost after watching her parents murdered by Crossmen, Kenshiro departs, ignoring Lynn's plea to remain and protect them. Bat follows Kenshiro to talk him into returning to town, to no avail.\n\nThe Crossmen raid Paradise Valley and occupy it, commandeering the well. Jackal orders Lynn's execution for sedition, but halts it after she threateningly mentions Kenshiro, taking her prisoner instead to extort Kenshiro's whereabouts. As Lynn's screams from afar ring inside Kenshiro's head, Kenshiro turns back: he and Bat infiltrate the occupied town and free Lynn, but Bat is mortally wounded in a fight against Jackal. Kenshiro spares Jackal and sends him back to Shin to announce his arrival.\n\nBy Shin's order, Jackal takes Julia to the tower's basement to hide her from Kenshiro. There, he engages in a [[cat-and-mouse game]] in an attempt to rape and kill Julia. Kenshiro breaks into Shin's tower and confronts him in the throne room. As Kenshiro gains the upper hand in the ensuing showdown, Shin lies about Julia's fate and takes advantage of Kenshiro's shock to overpower him. However, after noticing a bud that has sprouted from a seed he had given Julia long before, Kenshiro regains hope and defeats Shin, killing him.

founded by members of the [[Moravian Church]] in 1756 and was named after a castle (mentioned form of name is German; [[Czech language|Czech]] name of this castle is ''[[Litice Castle|Litice]]'') in [[Bohemia]] near the village  of [[Kunvald]] where the ancient Bohemian Brethren's Church had been founded in 1457. The roots of the Moravian Brethren's Church date back to the ancient Bohemian Brethren's Church.\n\nFor a century, only Moravians were permitted to live in Lititz. Until the middle of the 19th century, only members of the congregation could own houses; others were required to lease. The lease-system was abolished in 1855, just five years before the beginning of the Civil War. More information can be found in the book ''A Brief History of Lititz Pennsylvania'' by Mary Augusta Huevener, published in 1947.\n\nDuring a part of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], the Brethren's House, built in 1759, was used as a hospital. A number of soldiers died and were buried here. Lititz is also home to Linden Hall School, the oldest all-girls boarding school in the United States. Located adjacent to the Moravian Church on {{convert|47|acre|ha}} of land, Linden Hall School was founded by the Moravians in 1746, a decade before the borough was incorporated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Linden Hall |url=http://www.lindenhall.org/content_09.aspx?cat=History |work=Linden Hall History |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002160747/http://www.lindenhall.org/content_09.aspx?cat=History |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nLititz has held a town-wide celebration of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] since 1813. Tourists and residents from the region attend the annual Queen of Candles Pageant and fireworks display in Lititz Springs Park. The park itself is extravagantly decorated each year, with wooden beams and trestles placed from side to side of the stone-walled stream and stretching nearly the entire length of the park. The trestles are fitted with sockets for white candles. Musical performances take place throughout the day. In the evening, the first candle is lit by the year's Queen of Candles pageant winner. The park also hosts festivities for children and food offerings comparable to those at a county fair. The 4th of July parade is sponsored by Lititz Lions.\n\nAnother summer event is the annual art show sponsored by the Village Art Association of Lititz and the craft show sponsored by the Lititz Rotary Club, which extends from the Lititz Springs Park out into Broad Street (PA-501) and Main Street (PA-772).  Annually, the Saturday before Columbus Day is Chocolate Walk, a much-anticipated downtown event hosted by the Kiwanis Club of Lititz Area.\n\nDuring 2006 a year-long celebration was held commemorating the 250th anniversary of the naming of the town.  Some of the major events included a service and commemoration ceremony in Lititz Springs Park on Sunday June 11, the official naming ceremony on Monday June 12, a fountain show in the park called \"Symphonic Springs\" during August 20\u201326th, and a New Year's celebration.\n\nLititz is often named in lists of \"delightfully-named towns\" in [[Pennsylvania Dutchland]], along with [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania|Intercourse]], [[Blue Ball, Pennsylvania|Blue Ball]], [[Mount Joy, Pennsylvania|Mount Joy]], [[Bareville]], [[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania|Bird-in-Hand]] and [[Paradise, Pennsylvania|Paradise]].<ref>''Ward's Quarterly'' 1965; 1:109.</ref><ref>Anderson, William Charles, ''Home sweet home has wheels, or, Please don't tailgate the real estate,'' 1979, 209.</ref><ref>''Museums Journal'' 2006; 106: 1\u20136, 61.</ref><ref>''Rand McNally's Vacation and Travel Guide,'' Rand McNally and Company, 1978, 52.</ref><ref>Mencken, Henry Louis, \"Raven Ioor McDavid,\" ''The American language,'' 1938.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Lititz was announced the winner of Budget Travel's \"America's Coolest Small Towns\" competition from among 15 other finalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budgettravel.com/contest/americas-coolest-small-towns-2013,14/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509023648/http://www.budgettravel.com/contest/americas-coolest-small-towns-2013,14/|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 May 2013|title=America's Coolest Small Towns 2013 - Travel Deals, Travel Tips, Vacation Ideas - Budget Travel|date=9 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLititz is located at {{Coord|40|9|17|N|76|18|12|W|type:city}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nPennsylvania Routes [[Pennsylvania Route 772|772]] (Orange and Main Streets) and [[Pennsylvania Route 501|501]] (Broad Street) run through the town.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.3|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\n==Law and government==\n[[File:Ralph Miller has guarded the Lititz water works for sixteen years,8d10756v.jpg|thumb|Ralph Miller guarded the Lititz water works for sixteen years.

founded by members of the [[Moravian Church]] in 1756 and was named after a castle (mentioned form of name is German; [[Czech language|Czech]] name of this castle is ''[[Litice Castle|Litice]]'') in [[Bohemia]] near the village  of [[Kunvald]] where the ancient Bohemian Brethren's Church had been founded in 1457. The roots of the Moravian Brethren's Church date back to the ancient Bohemian Brethren's Church.\n\nFor a century, only Moravians were permitted to live in Lititz. Until the middle of the 19th century, only members of the congregation could own houses; others were required to lease. The lease-system was abolished in 1855, just five years before the beginning of the Civil War. More information can be found in the book ''A Brief History of Lititz Pennsylvania'' by Mary Augusta Huevener, published in 1947.\n\nDuring a part of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], the Brethren's House, built in 1759, was used as a hospital. A number of soldiers died and were buried here. Lititz is also home to Linden Hall School, the oldest all-girls boarding school in the United States. Located adjacent to the Moravian Church on {{convert|47|acre|ha}} of land, Linden Hall School was founded by the Moravians in 1746, a decade before the borough was incorporated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Linden Hall |url=http://www.lindenhall.org/content_09.aspx?cat=History |work=Linden Hall History |accessdate=June 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002160747/http://www.lindenhall.org/content_09.aspx?cat=History |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nLititz has held a town-wide celebration of [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] since 1813. Tourists and residents from the region attend the annual Queen of Candles Pageant and fireworks display in Lititz Springs Park. The park itself is extravagantly decorated each year, with wooden beams and trestles placed from side to side of the stone-walled stream and stretching nearly the entire length of the park. The trestles are fitted with sockets for white candles. Musical performances take place throughout the day. In the evening, the first candle is lit by the year's Queen of Candles pageant winner. The park also hosts festivities for children and food offerings comparable to those at a county fair. The 4th of July parade is sponsored by Lititz Lions.\n\nAnother summer event is the annual art show sponsored by the Village Art Association of Lititz and the craft show sponsored by the Lititz Rotary Club, which extends from the Lititz Springs Park out into Broad Street (PA-501) and Main Street (PA-772).  Annually, the Saturday before Columbus Day is Chocolate Walk, a much-anticipated downtown event hosted by the Kiwanis Club of Lititz Area.\n\nDuring 2006 a year-long celebration was held commemorating the 250th anniversary of the naming of the town.  Some of the major events included a service and commemoration ceremony in Lititz Springs Park on Sunday June 11, the official naming ceremony on Monday June 12, a fountain show in the park called \"Symphonic Springs\" during August 20\u201326th, and a New Year's celebration.\n\nLititz is often named in lists of \"delightfully-named towns\" in [[Pennsylvania Dutchland]], along with [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania|Intercourse]], [[Blue Ball, Pennsylvania|Blue Ball]], [[Mount Joy, Pennsylvania|Mount Joy]], [[Bareville]], [[Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania|Bird-in-Hand]] and [[Paradise, Pennsylvania|Paradise]].<ref>''Ward's Quarterly'' 1965; 1:109.</ref><ref>Anderson, William Charles, ''Home sweet home has wheels, or, Please don't tailgate the real estate,'' 1979, 209.</ref><ref>''Museums Journal'' 2006; 106: 1\u20136, 61.</ref><ref>''Rand McNally's Vacation and Travel Guide,'' Rand McNally and Company, 1978, 52.</ref><ref>Mencken, Henry Louis, \"Raven Ioor McDavid,\" ''The American language,'' 1938.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Lititz was announced the winner of Budget Travel's \"America's Coolest Small Towns\" competition from among 15 other finalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budgettravel.com/contest/americas-coolest-small-towns-2013,14/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509023648/http://www.budgettravel.com/contest/americas-coolest-small-towns-2013,14/|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 May 2013|title=America's Coolest Small Towns 2013 - Travel Deals, Travel Tips, Vacation Ideas - Budget Travel|date=9 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLititz is located at {{Coord|40|9|17|N|76|18|12|W|type:city}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nPennsylvania Routes [[Pennsylvania Route 772|772]] (Orange and Main Streets) and [[Pennsylvania Route 501|501]] (Broad Street) run through the town.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|2.3|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\n==Law and government==\n[[File:Ralph Miller has guarded the Lititz water works for sixteen years,8d10756v.jpg|thumb|Ralph Miller guarded the Lititz water works for sixteen years.

Campbell Bruce and dramatizes the [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape|1962 prisoner escape]] from the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|maximum security prison]] on [[Alcatraz Island]]. The film stars [[Clint Eastwood]], and features [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Jack Thibeau]] and [[Larry Hankin]]. [[Danny Glover]] appears in his film debut. ''Escape from Alcatraz'' marks the fifth and final collaboration between Siegel and Eastwood, following ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'' (1968), ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'' (1971) and ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971).\n\n==Plot==\nIn early 1960, [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]] ([[Clint Eastwood]]), a prisoner with an exceptional I.Q. who has absconded from other facilities, arrives at the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|maximum security prison]] on [[Alcatraz Island]]. Soon after arriving, he is summoned to the office of the warden ([[Patrick McGoohan]]), who curtly informs him that Alcatraz is unique within the U.S. prison system for its exceedingly high level of security and that no inmate has ever successfully escaped. During the conversation, the warden fails to notice Morris steal one of the nail clippers on the desk.\n\nOver the next several days, Morris makes acquaintances with a few inmates, including the eccentric Litmus (Frank Ronzio), who is fond of desserts; English ([[Paul Benjamin]]), a black inmate serving two life sentences for killing two white men in self-defence; and the elderly Doc ([[Roberts Blossom]]), who paints portraits and once grew [[chrysanthemum]]s at Alcatraz. Morris also makes an enemy of a rapist called Wolf ([[Bruce M. Fischer]]), who tries to harass him in the showers and later attacks him in the prison yard with a knife; both men are imprisoned in isolation in [[Solitary confinement|the hole]]. Morris is released while Wolf stays. When the warden discovers that Doc has painted an ungainly caricature of him, as well as other policemen on the island itself, he permanently removes Doc's painting privileges; in response, a depressed Doc hacks off his own fingers with a hatchet from the prison workshop and is led away.

Campbell Bruce and dramatizes the [[June 1962 Alcatraz escape|1962 prisoner escape]] from the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|maximum security prison]] on [[Alcatraz Island]]. The film stars [[Clint Eastwood]], and features [[Patrick McGoohan]], [[Fred Ward]], [[Jack Thibeau]] and [[Larry Hankin]]. [[Danny Glover]] appears in his film debut. ''Escape from Alcatraz'' marks the fifth and final collaboration between Siegel and Eastwood, following ''[[Coogan's Bluff (film)|Coogan's Bluff]]'' (1968), ''[[Two Mules for Sister Sara]]'' (1970), ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'' (1971) and ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971).\n\n==Plot==\nIn early 1960, [[Frank Morris (prisoner)|Frank Morris]] ([[Clint Eastwood]]), a prisoner with an exceptional I.Q. who has absconded from other facilities, arrives at the [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|maximum security prison]] on [[Alcatraz Island]]. Soon after arriving, he is summoned to the office of the warden ([[Patrick McGoohan]]), who curtly informs him that Alcatraz is unique within the U.S. prison system for its exceedingly high level of security and that no inmate has ever successfully escaped. During the conversation, the warden fails to notice Morris steal one of the nail clippers on the desk. \n\nOver the next several days, Morris makes acquaintances with a few inmates, including the eccentric Litmus (Frank Ronzio), who is fond of desserts; English ([[Paul Benjamin]]), a black inmate serving two life sentences for killing two white men in self-defence; and the elderly Doc ([[Roberts Blossom]]), who paints portraits and once grew [[chrysanthemum]]s at Alcatraz. Morris also makes an enemy of a rapist called Wolf ([[Bruce M. Fischer]]), who tries to harass him in the showers and later attacks him in the prison yard with a knife; both men are imprisoned in isolation in [[Solitary confinement|the hole]]. Morris is released while Wolf stays. When the warden discovers that Doc has painted an ungainly caricature of him, as well as other policemen on the island itself, he permanently removes Doc's painting privileges; in response, a depressed Doc hacks off his own fingers with a hatchet from the prison workshop and is led away. Later, Morris encounters [[bank robbery|bank robber]] brothers [[John Anglin (criminal)|John]] and [[Clarence Anglin]] ([[Fred Ward]] and [[Jack Thibeau]]), who are his old friends from another prison sentence, and he makes the acquaintance of prisoner Charley Butts ([[Larry Hankin]]). Morris notices that the concrete around the grille in his cell is weak and can be chipped away, which evolves into an escape plan. Over the next few months, Morris, the Anglins, and Butts dig through the walls of their cells with spoons (which have been soldered into makeshift shovels), make [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] dummies to act as decoys, and construct a raft out of raincoats. \n\nLater, during mealtime, Morris places a chrysanthemum at the table in honor of Doc, but the warden stops by and crushes it, causing a provoked and angry Litmus to suffer a heart attack. Later, the warden requests a shakedown of Morris's cell and finds nothing unusual. However, he issues orders for Morris to be relocated to a different cell as soon as possible. Wolf has been released from solitary confinement and prepares to attack Morris again, but English is able to intercept him, with English implying that his gang will beat up Wolf. That night, the inmates decide to leave. Morris, the Anglins and Butts plan to meet in the passageway and escape. Butts loses his nerve and fails to rendezvous with them. He later changes his mind but is too late and returns to his cell where he sulks over his missed opportunity. Carrying the flotation gear, Morris and the Anglins access the roof and avoid the searchlights. From there, they scramble down the side of the building into the prison yard, climb over a barbed-wire fence, and make their way to the shoreline of the island, where they inflate the raft. The three men depart from Alcatraz, partially submerged in the water, clinging to the raft and using their legs as the primary propelling force. \n\nThe following morning, the escape is discovered and a massive manhunt ensues.

The Warden is then informed by his aide that he has been summoned to catch the next plane to Washington to face his superiors: it is left up to the audience as to whether the escapees succeeded or not.<ref name=\"Hughes152\">Hughes, p.152</ref>\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n{{see also|June 1962 Alcatraz escape attempt}}\nThe film's final scene implied some hint that the escape was successful, but in fact it remains a mystery as to whether the escapees succeeded or not.<ref name=\"NYTimes_June2012\">{{Citation\n  | last = McFadden\n  | first = Robert D.\n  | title = Tale of 3 Inmates Who Vanished From Alcatraz Maintains Intrigue 50 Years Later\n  | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]\n  | location = New York, NY\n  | volume = \n  | issue = \n  | date = June 9, 2012\n  | page = \n  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/us/anniversary-of-a-mystery-at-alcatraz.html \n  | accessdate = June 9, 2012\n}}</ref> Circumstantial evidence uncovered in the early 2010s seemed to suggest that the men had survived, and that contrary to the official FBI report of the escapees' raft never being recovered and no car thefts being reported, a raft was discovered on nearby [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] with footprints leading away (similar to the fictional scene in the movie where the Warden finds a chrysanthemum that was possibly left by the escapees), and a 1955 blue Chevrolet was stolen after the escape by three men, who may have been Morris and the Anglins.<ref name=\"auto6\">{{Cite web|url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/02/08/investigator-says-1962-alcatraz-escapees-likely-survived/|title=Investigator Says 1962 Alcatraz Escapees Likely Survived|date=February 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTimes_June2012\" /><ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2013/06/19/alcatraz-escapees-sister-returns-to-robbery-scene/|title=Alcatraz escapee's sister returns to robbery scene|first=Associated|last=Press &#124;|date=June 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe character Charlie Butts was based on a fourth inmate, Allen West, who did participate in the real escape, but was left behind when he couldn't remove his ventilator grille on the night of the escape.

In [[World War I]] he was one of the first to die in the [[South-West Africa Campaign|campaign]] in [[South-West Africa]].\n\n==Career==\nEdward Dyke's father was a cashier in [[Cape Government Railways]] and in that respect Dyke followed in his father's footsteps; he was a railway employee most of his life. At first he was stationed at the Cape and later in the Transvaal. Possibly however, he merely used his salaried employment as means to more adventurous pursuits. Nearly all his spare time, he devoted to camping and mountaineering, and he had fought in the Second Boer War as a young man.  Eventually, at the outbreak of the First World War, he enlisted as a Trooper in the [[Light Horse Regiment|Imperial Light Horse Regiment]].\n\n==Botanical achievements==\nIn his spare time during his working life, he climbed the [[Cape Peninsula]] mountains, the [[Hottentots-Holland]] mountains, and nearby ranges, all of which are spectacular examples of [[Fynbos]], including [[Peninsula Granite Fynbos]], [[Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos]] and a number of related [[biome]]s. Later, when the railway administration moved to [[Johannesburg]], he continued his explorations in various parts of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains, as well as on visits to Lesotho. On such excursions he collected avidly and sent specimens to Dr [[Rudolf Marloth]]. He extended his explorations to other regions as well; for example, while climbing the Cockscomb Mountains in the [[Winterberg, Eastern Cape|Winterberg]] range near [[Uitenhage]] he discovered a hitherto unrecognised species of ''[[Protea]]'', later named ''Protea dykei'' Phill (now seen as a synonym of ''Protea rupicola''). On [[Hex River Mountains|Matroosberg]] in the [[Hex River Mountains]], he discovered a new species of \"everlasting\", flowers that in those days were generally included in the genus ''[[Helichrysum]]''.  That species was described by [[Harry Bolus]] under the name ''Helichrysum dykei'' Bolus. The genus has since been split however, and the species has been assigned to another genus, as ''[[Syncarpha]] dykei'' (Bolus) B. Nord. Dyke's name also appears in the names of [[Erica]] dykei L. Bolus (= Erica thodei Gilg) and [[Lessertia (plant)|Lessertia]] dykei L. Bolus.\n\nNot content with discovering and documenting plant life, Dyke also grew an extensive collection of [[Karoo]] plants in his own garden.\n\n==Death and contemporary assessment==\nWhile on patrol in [[Walvis Bay]] he was mortally wounded and died shortly afterwards on 21 January 1915, aged 42, one of the first victims of the campaign in South West Africa.\n\nDr Marloth, in his obituary for the Mountain Club Journal, mentions the last delivery he received from Dyke: 50 species of plants collected during a week of camping on [[Mont-Aux-Sources]].

It was the smallest of the townships with its boundaries being defined by the [[Conestoga River]], [[Manor Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manor Township]], the [[Little Conestoga Creek]], [[East Hempfield Township, Pennsylvania|(East) Hempfield Township]], and [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]]. A two-mile square was later cut out of the northern part of Lancaster Township to create the county seat of Lancaster City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twp.lancaster.pa.us/townshipHistory/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225163149/http://www.twp.lancaster.pa.us/townshipHistory/history.htm |archivedate=2008-12-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the county caused an influx of people to come to Lancaster City, and Lancaster Township, its closest suburb, received many people too, with many people living here and working in the city. As Lancaster became larger and more prominent, larger roads and railroads needed to extend out to its suburbs, including Lancaster Township. The town even had its own canal, the Conestoga Navigation Canal on the Conestoga River.\n\nLancaster Township's growth was slow but steady, with about 150 people joining the community each decade prior to 1900. Since then, as the [[Industrial Revolution]] came to a close, Lancaster Township has been transformed into a mostly residential municipality.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land. It is bounded by the [[Conestoga River]] to the south and east, and its tributary, the [[Little Conestoga Creek]] to the west.\n\nMost of the township lies to west and south of the city of Lancaster, but smaller exclaves of the township lies to the east and southeast of the city. Its neighboring municipalities are [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]], the city of Lancaster, [[East Lampeter Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|East Lampeter Township]], [[Pequea Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Pequea Township]], the borough of [[Millersville, Pennsylvania|Millersville]], [[Manor Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manor Township]], and [[East Hempfield Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|East Hempfield Township]].<ref>[[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania#Municipalities]]</ref><ref>http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/general_ref/cousub_outline/cen2k_pgsz/pa_cosub.pdf</ref>\n\nThe township also surrounds the village of [[Bausman, Pennsylvania|Bausman]], an [[unincorporated community]] that has its own post office and ZIP code (17504),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=EYL&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=usps+zip+code+17504&fb=1&gl=us&hq=usps&hnear=zip+code+17504&cid=13792037763032435499&dtab=2&ei=UaYUS_OfCcfblAf54KTTBQ&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAoQnQIwAA|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}</ref> while the township is covered by 17603 and 17602.\n\nThe township is home to President [[James Buchanan]]'s summer residence, [[Wheatland (Lancaster)|Wheatland]], located at 1120 Marietta Avenue.

It was the smallest of the townships with its boundaries being defined by the [[Conestoga River]], [[Manor Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manor Township]], the [[Little Conestoga Creek]], [[East Hempfield Township, Pennsylvania|(East) Hempfield Township]], and [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]]. A two-mile square was later cut out of the northern part of Lancaster Township to create the county seat of Lancaster City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twp.lancaster.pa.us/townshipHistory/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225163149/http://www.twp.lancaster.pa.us/townshipHistory/history.htm |archivedate=2008-12-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe creation of the county caused an influx of people to come to Lancaster City, and Lancaster Township, its closest suburb, received many people too, with many people living here and working in the city. As Lancaster became larger and more prominent, larger roads and railroads needed to extend out to its suburbs, including Lancaster Township. The town even had its own canal, the Conestoga Navigation Canal on the Conestoga River.\n\nLancaster Township's growth was slow but steady, with about 150 people joining the community each decade prior to 1900. Since then, as the [[Industrial Revolution]] came to a close, Lancaster Township has been transformed into a mostly residential municipality.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|6.0|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land. It is bounded by the [[Conestoga River]] to the south and east, and its tributary, the [[Little Conestoga Creek]] to the west.\n\nMost of the township lies to west and south of the city of Lancaster, but smaller exclaves of the township lies to the east and southeast of the city. Its neighboring municipalities are [[Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manheim Township]], the city of Lancaster, [[East Lampeter Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|East Lampeter Township]], [[Pequea Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Pequea Township]], the borough of [[Millersville, Pennsylvania|Millersville]], [[Manor Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Manor Township]], and [[East Hempfield Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|East Hempfield Township]].<ref>[[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania#Municipalities]]</ref><ref>http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/general_ref/cousub_outline/cen2k_pgsz/pa_cosub.pdf</ref>\n\nThe township also surrounds the village of [[Bausman, Pennsylvania|Bausman]], an [[unincorporated community]] that has its own post office and ZIP code (17504),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=EYL&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=usps+zip+code+17504&fb=1&gl=us&hq=usps&hnear=zip+code+17504&cid=13792037763032435499&dtab=2&ei=UaYUS_OfCcfblAf54KTTBQ&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAoQnQIwAA|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps}}</ref> while the township is covered by 17603 and 17602.\n\nThe township is home to President [[James Buchanan]]'s summer residence, [[Wheatland (Lancaster)|Wheatland]], located at 1120 Marietta Avenue.

Spears was a retired Brigadier General of the British Army, and served as a Member of the British House of Commons. From 1917 to 1920 he was head of the British Military Mission in Paris.\n\n==Family and early life==\nSpears was born of British parents at 7 chauss\u00e9e de la Muette in the fashionable district of [[Passy]] in Paris on 7 August 1886; France would remain the land of his childhood. His parents, Charles McCarthy Spiers and Melicent Marguerite Lucy Hack, were British residents of France. His paternal grandfather was the noted [[lexicographer]], [[Alexander Spiers]], who had published an English-French and French-English dictionary in 1846.<ref name=Egremont>{{cite book |last= Egremont |first= Max |title= Under Two Flags |year=1997|publisher= Phoenix \u2013 Orion Books |location= London |isbn=0-7538-0147-7| pages = 1\u20132 }}</ref> The work was extremely successful and adopted by the University of France for French Colleges.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n  | title = General English and French Dictionary (Google Book Search)\n  | publisher = Google\n  | year = 2006\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NroPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22alexander+spiers%22&output=html&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=0_2\n  | accessdate =  11 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nEdward Louis Spears changed his name from Spiers to Spears in 1918. He claimed that the reason was his irritation at the mispronunciation of Spiers, yet it is possible that he wanted an English looking name \u2013 something more in keeping with his rank as a brigadier-general and head of the British Military Mission to the French War Office. He denied that he was of Jewish stock, but his great-grandfather had been an Isaac Spiers of Gosport who married Hannah Moses, a shopkeeper of the same town.<ref>Egremont, pp. 2, 82.</ref> His ancestry was no secret. In 1918 the French ambassador in London described him as \"a very able and intriguing Jew who insinuates himself everywhere.\"<ref>Julian Jackson, The Fall of France, Oxford 2003, 91.</ref>\n\nHis parents separated while he was a child, and his maternal grandmother played an important role during his formative years. The young Louis (the name used by his friends) was often on the move, usually with his grandmother \u2013 Menton, Aix-les-Bains, Switzerland, Brittany and Ireland. He had contracted [[diphtheria]] and [[typhoid]] as an infant and was considered delicate. However, after two years at a tough boarding school in Germany, his physical condition improved and he became a strong swimmer and an athlete.<ref>Egremont, pp. 4, 6.</ref>\n\n== Army service before First World War ==\n[[File:Old war office.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Old War Office Building in London. It was here that Spears, the bilingual young subaltern, worked with French counterparts developing a joint Anglo-French codebook.]]\nIn 1903, he joined the Kildare [[Militia]], the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. In the mess, he acquired the nickname of Monsieur Beaucaire after a play about an urbane Frenchman. The nickname stuck and he was called this by both of his wives, the first of whom would often shorten it to B. In 1906 he was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] in the regular army with the 8th Royal Irish Hussars. Spears did not conform to the conventional image of a young army officer. In the same year that he was commissioned, he published a translation of a French general's book, ''Lessons of the [[Russo-Japanese War]]''. His upbringing with a succession of tutors meant that he had not learned to mix, and so he did not easily adapt to life in an officers' [[mess]]. He could be tactless and argumentative and became an outsider \u2013 something he would remain all his life. In 1911, he worked at the [[War Office]] developing a joint Anglo-French codebook. In 1914, he published ''Cavalry Tactical Schemes'', another translation of a French military text. In May of the same year, he was sent to Paris to work alongside the French at their Ministry of War with orders to make contact with British agents in Belgium. With the outbreak of war in August 1914, on the orders of his colonel at the War Office, Spears left Paris for the front. Later he would proudly claim that he had been the first British officer at the front.<ref>Egremont, pp. 6\u201322.</ref>\n\n== First World War ==\n\n===Mutual misunderstanding===\n[[File:General Sir John French in Paris, Bain photograph.jpg|thumb|left|Field Marshal French in Paris \u2013 the Commander of the BEF in France spoke French poorly]] Cooperation between the French and British armies was severely hampered by a lack of linguistic competence among British and French officers. General [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]], a [[staff officer]] acting as a liaison officer to the French Army, had been said to declare that he saw 'no reason for an officer knowing any language except his own'. According to one story, when Field Marshal [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]], the commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] at the start of the [[First World War]], had spoken (then as a general) from a prepared French text at manoeuvres in France in 1910, his accent was so bad that his listeners thought he was speaking in English!<ref>Egremont, p. 23.</ref>\n\nDuring the First World War, British soldiers unable to pronounce French words came up with their own (often humorous) versions of place names \u2013 the town of [[Ypres]] (''Ieper'' in Flemish) was known as 'Wipers'.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Battlefield Colloquialisms of the Great War (WW1) by Paul Hinckley\n |url         = http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~davidt/z_ww1_slang/index_bak.htm\n |accessdate  = 6 April 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414234838/http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~davidt/z_ww1_slang/index_bak.htm\n |archivedate = 14 April 2008\n|df          = dmy\n}}</ref> Yet French place names were also a problem for senior officers. In the spring of 1915, Spears was ordered to pronounce French place names in an English way otherwise General Robertson, the new Chief of Staff, would not be able to understand them.<ref>Egremont, p. 41.</ref>\n\nOn the French side, few of the commanders spoke good English with the exception of Generals Nivelle and [[Ferdinand Foch]]. It was in this linguistic fog that the bilingual young [[subaltern]], made his mark. Although only a junior officer (a lieutenant of Hussars), he would get to know senior British and French military and political figures (Churchill, French, Haig, Joffre, P\u00e9tain, Reynaud, Robertson etc.)  \u2013 a fact that would stand him in good stead during later life.<ref>Egremont, pp. 6, 22, 41, 43.</ref>\n\n=== First liaison duties \u2013 French Fifth Army ===\n[[File:Charles Lanrezac.gif|thumb|right|General Charles Lanrezac, Commander of Fifth French Army \u2013 Spears' first liaison job was an attachment to this officer early in the war]] Sent first to the [[Ardennes]] on 14 August 1914, his job was to liaise between Field Marshal Sir [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and General [[Charles Lanrezac]], commander of the [[French Fifth Army]]. The task was made more difficult by Lanrezac's obsession with secrecy and an arrogant attitude towards the British. The Germans were moving fast and the allied commanders had to make decisions quickly, without consulting each other; their headquarters were also on the move and could not keep their counterparts up to date with their locations. In today's age of radio communication, it is hard to believe that such vital information was often relayed personally by Spears, who travelled by car between the headquarters along roads clogged with refugees and retreating troops.<ref>Egremont, pp. 23, 25, 30.</ref>\n\nCommanders were aware that wireless communications were insecure and so often preferred the traditional, personal touch for liaison work. And as far as the telephone was concerned, Spears refers to 'exasperating delays'; sometimes, he was even put through to the advancing Germans by mistake. On these occasions he pretended to be German to extract information, but failed as his German was not sufficiently convincing.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Telephones, Telegraphs and Automobiles: The Response of British Commanders to New Communications Technologies in 1914 by Nikolas Gardner.\n |url         = http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/Gardner.pdf\n |accessdate  = 9 April 2008\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20040107193311/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/Gardner.pdf\n |archivedate = 7 January 2004\n|df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n====An army is saved====\nOn 23 August, General Lanrezac made a sudden decision to retreat \u2013 a manoeuvre that would have dangerously exposed the British forces on his flank. Spears was able to inform Sir John French in the nick of time \u2013 the action of a young liaison officer had saved an army. The following day, Spears amazed himself by his audacious language when urging General Lanrezac to launch a counter-attack, \"Mon G\u00e9neral, if by your action the British Army is annihilated, England will never pardon France, and France will not be able to afford to pardon you.\"  In September, Spears again showed that he was not afraid to speak his mind. When General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], Lanrezac's successor, had heard (incorrectly) that the British were in retreat, the French officer said 'some unacceptable things concerning the British commander-in-chief in particular and the British in general'. Spears confronted Franchet d'Esperey's chief-of-staff for an apology, which was duly given. At the suggestion of his young liaison officer, Sir John French visited Franchet d'Esperey a few days later to clear up the misunderstanding. Spears remained with the French Fifth Army during the [[First Battle of the Marne]], riding on horseback behind Franchet d'Esperey when [[Reims]] was liberated on 13 September.<ref>Egremont, pp. 28\u201329, 34.</ref>\n\n=== Liaison duties \u2013 French Tenth Army ===\n[[File:Fisher&Churchill.jpg|thumb|right|When Winston Churchill (seen here with Admiral 'Jackie' Fisher) lost his post as First Lord of the Admiralty after the failure of the Gallipoli campaign, he served on the western front. Spears escorted him during his first visit and they became friends \u2013 a relationship that would see Spears appointed WSC's special representative to de Gaulle and the Free French in the Second World War.]] Spears remained with Franchet d'Esperey after the Battle of the Marne until his posting at the end of September 1914 as liaison officer with the [[French Tenth Army]], which was now under General de Maud'huy near [[Arras]]. The two men got on well \u2013 Maud'huy referring to him as 'my friend Spears', and insisting that they ate together. It was at the recommendation of the new commander that Spears was made a 'Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]'. In January 1915, he was wounded for the first time and repatriated to convalesce in London. He was [[mentioned in dispatches]] and again commended by Maud'huy \u2013 as a result he was awarded the [[Military Cross]].<ref>Egremont, pp. 38\u201340.</ref>\n\n====Meets Winston Churchill \u2013 a friendship is forged====\nAgain at the front in April 1915, he accompanied [[Winston Churchill]], then [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], on a tour of inspection.<ref name=\"Egremont, p.81\">Egremont, p. 81.</ref> Frequently the only Englishman in a French officers' mess, Spears could feel lonely and isolated and had to endure criticism of his country. The general feeling in France was that Britain should be doing more.<ref>Egremont, pp. 42, 50.</ref>\n\nWhen he returned to France after treatment for a second wound which he had incurred in August 1915 (there would be a total of four during the war), he found General Sir Douglas Haig, who was in command of the British First Army, and General d'Urbal, the new commander of the French Tenth Army, at loggerheads; it was his task to improve the relationship. Then on 5 December, the [[Dardanelles Campaign]] having failed, Winston Churchill arrived in France seeking a command on the western front. He had lost his post of [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] and wanted to temporarily leave the political arena. The two men became friends and Churchill suggested that if he were to be given command of a brigade, Spears might join him as his brigade major. However, Churchill was instead given command of a battalion. In any case, Spears' work in liaison was too highly valued and there was no question that he would be allowed to join Churchill.<ref>Egremont, pp. 43, 48, 49.</ref>\n\n====Fear of mental breakdown====\nHe got to know General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who had distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Verdun]] in 1916 and said of him, \"I like P\u00e9tain, whom I know well.\"  Prior to the [[Battle of the Somme]], he hoped that he would no longer have to face criticism of the British. However, when the British failed and took heavy losses, there were hints that they could not stand shell fire. He began to doubt his fellow countrymen \u2013 had they lost the vigour and courage of their forebears?  In August 1916, subjected to emotional buffeting from both sides, he feared he might suffer a breakdown.<ref>Egremont, p. 48.</ref>\n\n=== General Staff \u2013 liaison between French Ministry of War and War Office in London ===\nIn May 1917, Spears became a major and was promoted to General Staff Officer 1st Grade prior to taking up a high-level appointment in Paris, where he was to liaise between the French Ministry of War and the [[War Office]] in London. In less than three years, this young officer had got to know many influential figures on both sides of the Channel. He found Paris full of intrigues, with groups of officers and officials conspiring against each other. Spears exploited the confusion to his advantage and created an independent position for himself.<ref>Egremont, pp. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\nWithin days, Spears was dining at the French War Ministry with a group of VIPs \u2013 the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], the Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Sir [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|William Robertson]], [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe]], War Minister [[Paul Painlev\u00e9]] and Major-General [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Maurice]], who was the British Director of Military Operations. His brief was to report directly to the War Office in London, bypassing the military attach\u00e9. On 17 May, General P\u00e9tain, the new French Commander in Chief, told Spears that he wished Lt-General Henry Wilson, who had been closely associated with Petain's disgraced predecessor [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]], to be replaced as the chief British liaison officer. Realising this would make Wilson his enemy, Spears protested but was overruled.<ref>Egremont, p. 55.</ref>\n\n====Reports on French mutinies and resentment====\nBy 22 May 1917 he had learned of the mutinies in the French Army and travelled to the front to make an assessment. The mutinies had first rumbled during the slaughter at [[Verdun]] the previous year (especially during the costly counterattacks by Nivelle and Mangin) and had erupted in earnest after the failure of the Nivelle Offensive in the spring of 1917. Spears was called to London to report on French morale to the War Policy Cabinet Council \u2013 a heavy responsibility. Spears recorded in a 1964 BBC interview that Lloyd George asked repeatedly for assurances that the French would recover. At one point Spears said\n\u201cYou can shoot me if I am wrong \u2013 I know how important it is and will stake my life on it.\" Lloyd George was still not satisfied: \u201cWill you give me your word of honour as an officer and a gentleman that the French Army will recover?\u201d. Spears was so stung by this that he replied \"The fact that you ask me that shows you know the meaning of neither\".<ref>Egremont, pp. 56\u201358.</ref>\n\nSpears heard of French dissatisfaction which was expressed on 7 July at a secret parliamentary session. Left wing deputies declared that the British had suffered 300,000 casualties as opposed to 1,300,000 by the French. Furthermore, they were holding a front of {{convert|138|km|mi}}, whereas the French held {{convert|474|km|mi}}.<ref>Egremont, p. 59.</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Hughes Wilson, British general, photo portrait standing in uniform.jpg|thumb|General Henry Wilson \u2013 within days of taking up his post in Paris, Major Spears was told by General P\u00e9tain that he wished Wilson to be replaced. Spears protested but was overruled; thereafter Wilson would bear a grudge against him.]] In the wake of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], efforts were made to revive the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and detach Bulgaria from the [[Central Powers]]. In Paris, Spears worked to promote these ends and received the added task of liaising with the Polish army.<ref>Egremont, p. 66.</ref>\n\n====Introduces Churchill to Clemenceau====\nIn November 1917, [[Georges Clemenceau]] became Prime Minister of France and restored a will to fight. Spears reported that Clemenceau, who spoke English fluently, was 'markedly pro English'; he was sure that France would last out to the bitter end. Clemenceau had told Spears that he could come to see him at any time \u2013 and this he duly did, taking his friend Winston Churchill \u2013 now Minister of Munitions \u2013 to meet the so-called 'Tiger of France'.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Portrait \u2013 Georges Cl\u00e9menceau (1841\u20131929)\n |url         = http://multisites.phpnet.org/alaurent/biographie/france/clemenceau.htm\n |accessdate  = 7 April 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20040611072002/http://multisites.phpnet.org/alaurent/biographie/france/clemenceau.htm\n |archivedate = 11 June 2004\n|df          = dmy\n}}</ref>\nSpears became aware of Clemenceau's ruthlessness \u2013 'probably the most difficult and dangerous man I have ever met' \u2013 and told London that he was 'out to wreck' the [[Supreme War Council]] at Versailles, France, being bent on its domination.<ref>Egremont, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n[[File:Georges Clemenceau.jpg|thumb|left|Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister of France from 16 November 1917 to 20 January 1920. He supported Spears when Foch tried to have him removed. Known as 'The Tiger of France', he was a formidable character \u2013 Spears would later refer to what he had said of himself, \"I had a wife, she abandoned me; I had children, they turned against me; I had friends, they betrayed me. I have only my claws left, and I use them.\"]]\n\n====Intrigues in Paris====\nGeneral [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]] reported Spears as 'one to make mischief'. At the first meeting of the Supreme War Council in December 1917, Spears took the role as a master of ceremonies, interpreting and acting as a go-between. In January 1918, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and was told he would be made a brigadier-general \u2013 the rank that he retained after the war. However, one month later he feared for his career when his enemy, Henry Wilson, replaced General Sir William Robertson as [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]].<ref>Egremont, pp. 68\u201369, 73.</ref>\n\nFebruary 1918 saw more intrigues in Paris. General [[Ferdinand Foch]], an ally and friend of General Henry Wilson, would be nominated Allied Supreme Commander in the northern French town of Doullens on 26 March 1918.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Culture.fr \u2013 le portail de la culture \n |url=http://www.culture.fr/sections/regions/picardie/organisme/JEP-ORGS21768?typeSearch=bibliotheques&SearchableText=&SearchWhere=\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610114552/http://www.culture.fr/sections/regions/picardie/organisme/JEP-ORGS21768?typeSearch=bibliotheques&SearchableText=&SearchWhere=\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=10 June 2011\n |accessdate=7 April 2008 \n}}</ref>\nFoch was concerned at the friendship between his General Alphonse Georges and Louis Spears. Fearing that the latter would know too much, Foch said he would deny the Englishman access to diplomatic dispatches. However, this never came about because Spears played his ace card \u2013 the close relationship which he enjoyed with Georges Clemenceau. His adversary General Henry Wilson, the new Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was advised by Foch to 'get rid of Spears'. The complications continued with Spears fighting to maintain his position \u2013 telling Wilson that the antagonism of Foch stemmed from personal resentment, and calling upon support from his friend, Winston Churchill. Spears argued that he was attached to Clemenceau and not to Foch \u2013 thus his position in Paris was assured, a fact confirmed in due course in a letter from Henry Wilson.<ref>Egremont, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe German offensive of March 1918 forced the allies back and Paris came under artillery bombardment. Mutual recrimination followed, with Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig]] raging 'because the French don't help more'; and the French failing to understand 'why the British can't hold'. Paris was a nest of vipers. Both sides were wary of Spears \u2013 the French ambassador in London believing him to be a Jew and an intriguer who had wormed his way into the trust of [[Paul Painlev\u00e9]] (War Minister in the summer of 1917 when Spears had replaced Wilson in French confidence, later Prime Minister from 12 September to 16 November 1917), and that he had passed secrets to the British. By the same token, Spears pointed a finger at Professor Alfred Mantoux, claiming that he was giving information to the French socialist, [[Albert Thomas (minister)|Albert Thomas]]. However, Henry Wilson noted that 'Spears is jealous of Mantoux, who is his successful rival as an interpreter.'  By the end of May, the Germans were at the [[River Marne]] and even Clemenceau turned against Spears. The reason according to Lord Derby, the new ambassador to Paris, was that he 'finds out and tells our government things that Clemenceau does not wish them to know'.<ref>Egremont, pp. 77\u201380.</ref>\n\nIn September 1918, the Germans were in retreat and although praise for Britain came from Foch, the French press was off-hand. Bad feeling towards the British persisted after the armistice on 11 November 1918. In his victory speech to the [[Chamber of Deputies]], Clemenceau did not even mention the British \u2013 'calculated rudeness' according to Spears.<ref name=\"Egremont, p.81\"/>\n\n== Romance and marriage ==\n\n=== Jessie Gordon ===\nIn 1908, as a young cavalry officer, Spears suffered concussion after being knocked unconscious during a game of polo. He was treated in London and fell in love with Jessie Gordon, one of the two women running the nursing home where he was a patient. This affair would last for several years \u2013 often causing him distress.<ref>Egremont, pp. 9\u201310, 39\u201340, 46.</ref>\n\n=== Mary 'May' Borden-Turner ===\n[[File:Strathearn Place 12-London-W2.JPG|thumb|12 Strathearn Place \u2013 the London home of Louis and May before, during and after the Second World War.

When Spears first met Mary \u2013 'May' as she was known \u2013 she had used her money to set up a field hospital for the French army. The attraction was mutual and by the spring of 1917 she and Louis had become lovers. They were married at the British consulate in Paris some three months after her divorce in January 1918.<ref>Egremont, pp. 62, 77.</ref> Their only child, Michael, was born in 1921. He contracted [[osteomyelitis]] when he was a teenager and ill health would dog him throughout his life. He nevertheless won a scholarship to Oxford and entered the Foreign Office.

The unit was staffed with British nurses and French doctors. May and her unit served in France until the German [[Blitzkrieg]] in June 1940 forced them to evacuate to Britain via [[Arcachon]]. From May 1941, with funds provided by the [[British War Relief Society]] in New York, the medical unit served with [[Free French]] forces in the Middle East, North Africa, Italy and France.<ref>Borden, pp. 13, 116\u2013117, inside front cover.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lady Spears (May Borden) and Sir Edward Spears in the Lebanon, 1942.jpg|thumb|Lady Spears (centre) with Sir Edward Spears (left) in December 1942 in Lebanon on the steps of their residence \u2013 that of the First British Minister to the Levant.

However, vehicles from May's Anglo-French ambulance unit took part \u2013 Union Jacks and Tricolours side by side as usual. De Gaulle heard wounded French soldiers cheering, \"Voil\u00e0 Spears!  Vive Spears!\" and ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British members repatriated. May commented, \"A pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.\".<ref name=\"GILBERT\">{{Cite book |last = Gilbert| first = Martin| title = The Day the War Ended|year = 1995|publisher = HarperCollins|place= London|isbn =0-00-711622-5|page= 397 }}</ref> May wrote to General de Gaulle protesting at his order, and speaking in the name of the French officers who had been attached to her unit. The general replied, denying that her unit had been dissolved because of the flying of the British flag; he maintained that a decision had already been taken to dissolve six of the nine mobile surgical units attached to his forces. May's reply of 5 July was bitter: 'From you I have had no recognition since February 1941 [...] but our four years with the 1st Free French Division have bound to us the officers and men of that Division with bonds that can never be broken.'<ref>Borden, pp. 295\u2013296.</ref> Mary Borden died on 2 December 1968; her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' pays tribute to her humanitarian work during both world wars and describes her as 'a writer of very real and obvious gifts'.\n\n=== Nancy Maurice ===\nSpears resigned his commission in June 1919, thus bringing to an end his post as Head of the Military Mission in Paris. In October of the same year, the former Director of Military Operations in Paris, Sir Frederick Maurice, passed through the city accompanied by his daughter, Nancy. Unlike most girls of her background and station, Nancy had had a good education and was a trained secretary. She agreed to act as Spears' secretary on a temporary basis. However, she would become indispensable and remain in the post for 42 years. Their work brought them close and an affair developed.\n\nWhen he returned to the Levant in the spring of 1942 after sick leave in Britain, she accompanied him as his secretary. With her good head for commerce, she proved invaluable when he became chairman of the [[Ashanti Goldfields Corporation]] in West Africa after the war. When May died in December 1968, Nancy expected a speedy marriage but Louis prevaricated. They married on 4 December 1969 at [[St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge|St Paul's Church]], Knightsbridge, and Nancy thus became the second Lady Spears. Nancy died in 1975.<ref>Egremont, pp. 91\u201393, 113, 237, 305, 316.</ref>\n\n== Inter-war years ==\n\n===Business and political links with Czechoslovakia===\nIn 1921, Spears went into business with a Finnish partner \u2013 their aim was to establish trading links in the newly founded republic of [[Czechoslovakia]]. On a visit to Prague, he met [[Eduard Benes]], the Prime Minister, and [[Jan Masaryk]], son of the President; at the same time he came into contact with officials at the Czech Finance Ministry.<ref>Egremont, p. 98.</ref> His business relations in Prague developed further when, in 1934, Spears became chairman of the British [[Bata Shoes|Bata]] shoe company, which, in turn, was part of the international concern of the same name. He later became a director of the merchants, J. Fisher, which had trade links with Czechoslovakia, and a director of a Czech steel works. Yet his business successes found no favour with certain members of the Conservative Party \u2013 especially those with anti-Semitic views. [[Duff Cooper]] said of him: \"He's the most unpopular man in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House]]. Don't trust him: he'll let you down in the end.\" <ref>Egremont, pp. 136\u20137.</ref>\n\nHis visits to Czechoslovakia and friendship with its political figures strengthened his resolve to bolster support for the young republic in both London and Paris. He was violently opposed to the [[Munich agreement]] of 1938, which saw the [[Sudetenland]] handed over to Germany. When he heard the news of the occupation, he wept openly and declared that he had never felt so ashamed and heartbroken. His views brought him into opposition with Conservatives who were broadly in favour of the Munich agreement. Yet it cannot be denied that there was an element of self-interest in his espousal of the Czech cause \u2013 he stood to lose his business interests and an annual income of some \u00a32,000 if the country broke up.<ref>Egremont, pp. 139\u2013141.</ref>\n\n===Member of Parliament===\nSpears was twice a member of parliament (MP) \u2013 from 1922 to 1924 at [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]] and from 1931 to 1945 at [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]]. His pro-French views in the Commons earned him the nickname of 'the Member for Paris'.<ref name=\"berthonbook\">{{cite book |last= Berthon |first= Simon|title= Allies at War |year= 2001 |publisher= HarperCollins|location= London|isbn= 0-00-711622-5 |page= 80 }}</ref>\n\n====Loughborough====\nIn December 1921, Spears was adopted at Loughborough as the parliamentary candidate for the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal Party]]. He was elected unopposed in 1922 because the Labour candidate had failed to hand in his nomination papers in time, and the Conservatives had agreed not to put up a candidate to oppose him. With Winston Churchill in hospital and unable to campaign at [[Dundee]], Spears and his wife took on the job, but Churchill was defeated. As a gesture of friendship, Spears offered to give up his seat at Loughborough \u2013 an offer which Churchill declined. His maiden speech, in February 1923, was critical of both the Foreign Office and the Embassy in Paris. He spoke out against the French occupation of the [[Ruhr]] in the House of Commons later the same month. In December, there was another election, with Spears retaining his seat as a National Liberal.<ref>Egremont, pp. 100\u2013106, 111.</ref> However, at the election in October 1924, he was beaten into third place by the Conservative and Labour candidates.<ref>Egremont, p. 113.</ref> There followed two further attempts \u2013 both unsuccessful. The first was at a by-election at [[Bosworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bosworth]] in 1927, then at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in June 1929.<ref>Egremont, p. 114.</ref>\n\n====Carlisle====\nAt the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|General Election]] in October 1931, Spears stood as a National Conservative candidate and was elected Member of Parliament for [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]].<ref>Egremont, p. 124.</ref> In June 1935, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] resigned as Prime Minister of the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] to be succeeded by the Conservative, [[Stanley Baldwin]]. At the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|general election in November 1935]], he again stood as a National Conservative candidate at Carlisle and was returned with a reduced majority.<ref>Egremont, p. 133.</ref> At Spears' house in 1934, there was held the first meeting of a cross-party group which would later become the European Study Group. Its members included [[Robert Boothby]], Joshiah Wedgwood and [[Clement Attlee]]. Spears became its chairman in 1936; it would become a focus for those [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] who were suspicious of the European policies of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government.<ref>Egremont, p. 127.</ref>\n\n=== First World War books ===\n''Liaison 1914'', was published in September 1930 with a foreword by [[Winston Churchill]]. This personal account of his experiences as a liaison officer from July to September 1914 was well received. The preface states: 'The object of this book is to contribute something to the true story of the war, and to vindicate the role of the British Expeditionary Force in 1914.'<ref>''Liaison 1914'', Author's Preface to the First Edition, Cassell 1999, xxxi.</ref> As far as the French were concerned, [[Charles Lanrezac]] came in for heavy criticism but there was praise for Marshals [[Franchet d'Esperey]] and [[Joseph Joffre]]. On the British side, Spears wrote favourably of [[George Macdonogh|General Macdonough]], who, as a colonel, had recruited him for military intelligence in 1909, and of Field Marshal Sir John French. ''Liaison 1914'' describes vividly the horrors of war \u2013 the shoeless refugees, the loss of comrades and the devastated landscape. Two years later, a French translation was also successful, the only dissent coming from the son of General Lanrezac, who denied Spears' account of his father's rudeness to Sir John French. The French politician [[Paul Reynaud]], who would later serve briefly as Prime Minister of France from 21 March to 16 June 1940, took the book as an illustration of how France must not allow herself to become separated from Britain. ''Liaison 1914'' was published again in the US in May 1931 and received high praise.<ref>Egremont, pp. 24, 119\u2013120, 123, 125.</ref>\n\nIn 1939 Spears published ''Prelude to Victory'', an account of the early months of 1917, containing a famous account of the Calais Conference in which Lloyd George had attempted to place the British forces under the command of General [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]]. With war looming once again, Spears wrote that given time constraints he had chosen to concentrate on the period with the greatest lessons for Anglo-French relations. The book also contains a foreword by [[Winston Churchill]], stating that Spears had not, in his view, been entirely fair to Lloyd George's wish to see Britain abstain from major offensives until the Americans were present in force.<ref>Spears 1939, pp. 11, 15.</ref>\n\n=== Opposes appeasement ===\nSpears became a member of the so-called 'Eden Group' of anti-[[appeasement]] [[backbench]] MPs. This group, known disparagingly by the Conservative [[whip (politics)|whips]] as 'The Glamour Boys', formed around [[Anthony Eden]] when he had resigned as Foreign Secretary in February 1938 in protest at the opening of negotiations with Italy by the Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Given his long-standing friendship with [[Winston Churchill]], it was not surprising that Spears also joined the latter's group of anti-appeasers, known as 'The Old Guard'.

In [[Strasbourg]], he had the idea of floating mines linked together by cables down the [[Rhine]] \u2013 an action to be carried out on the declaration of war to damage bridges. Initially sceptical about the plan, Churchill would later approve it under the code name of [[Operation Royal Marine]], but claim that it had been his own idea.<ref name=Spears>{{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |title= Prelude to Dunkirk |year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London| page =10 }}</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n\n=== Phoney War ===\nDuring the [[Phoney War]], Spears favoured a [[hawkish]] policy; lamenting that Britain and France were not doing 'anything more warlike than dropping leaflets'. He urged active support for the Poles and wanted Germany to be bombed; he was set to speak in the House in this vein but was dissuaded \u2013 much to his later regret.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nAs Chairman of the Anglo-French Committee of the House of Commons, he fostered links with his friends across the Channel, and in October 1939 led a delegation of MPs on a visit to the [[Chamber of Deputies of France]] when they were taken to the [[Maginot Line]].<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, p. 38.</ref>\n\nFour months later, Spears was sent to France to check on [[Operation Royal Marine]] for Winston Churchill, returning with him in April. Thousands of mines were to be released into the Rhine by the Royal Navy to destroy bridges and disrupt river traffic. The operation was vetoed by the French for fear of reprisals, but a postponement was finally agreed.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 96\u201399, 73, 101.</ref>\n\nOn 10 May 1940, [[Operation Royal Marine]] was launched, producing the results that Spears had prophesied. However, by then the German blitzkrieg was underway and the success, as Churchill noted, was lost in the 'deluge of disaster' that was the fall of France.<ref>\n{{cite news\n  | title = Rear-Admiral Roger Wellby (obituary)\n  | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph\n  | date = 3 December 2003\n  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/12/04/db0401.xml\n  | accessdate =  11 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Churchill's Personal Representative to the French Prime Minister ===\n\n====Spears leaves for Paris====\nOn 22 May 1940, Spears was summoned to [[10 Downing Street]]. With British and French forces retreating before the German [[Blitzkrieg]], and confused and contradictory reports arriving from across the Channel, Winston Churchill had decided to send Spears as his personal representative to [[Paul Reynaud]], the Prime Minister of France, who was also acting as Minister of Defence. Three days later, having managed to find the various pieces of his uniform which he had not worn since leaving the army in 1919, he left by plane for Paris holding the rank of major general.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 153\u2013154, 176.</ref>\n\n====Doubts about P\u00e9tain====\nDuring the chaos and confusion of the allied retreat, Spears continued to meet senior French political and military figures. He put forward the view that tanks could be halted by blowing up buildings; he also urged that [[prefects]] should not leave their [[departments of France|departments]] without first ensuring that all petrol had been destroyed. On 26 May, he met Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]; the old man reminisced about their time together during the First World War and 'treated him like a son'. Yet it seemed that the Marshal 'in his great age, epitomised the paralysis of the French people'. He became aware of the difficulties of re-creating a liaison organisation; in 1917 his mission had been established over several years. Starting again from scratch, the task seemed 'as impossible as to recall the dead'.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 219, 224, 234.</ref>\n\n====Weygand's pessimism and Belgian capitulation====\nDuring a visit to London on Sunday 26 May, the French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] had reported to Churchill the view of the new Commander-in-Chief General [[Maxime Weygand]] that the struggle had become hopeless. On 27 May, Churchill demanded an immediate report from Spears, who was told to resist such defeatism. Reynaud referred to 'mortal danger' with reference to a possible attack by the Italians, who had not yet entered the war; Spears' view was that the French army in the Alps was strong and that the only danger from the Italians would be if they interfered with the transport of troops from North Africa. Yet perversely, Italian intervention might be good for allied morale: 'our combined fleets would whip them around the Mediterranean'. Reynaud and Spears argued, the former calling for more British air support, the latter, exasperated, asking, \"Why don't you import Finns and Spaniards to show the people how to resist an invader?\" <ref>A reference to the spirited resistance of Finland to the Russian invasion of November 1939 in the [[Winter War]], and that of the [[Guerrilla warfare in the Peninsular War|Spanish guerrillas]] to [[Napoleon]].</ref> He went on to compare unfavourably the spirit of Paris in 1940 with that which he had known in 1914. That evening, Spears and the British Ambassador were summoned to the Ministry of War \u2013 news of the sudden Belgian surrender had infuriated Reynaud, P\u00e9tain and Weygand; Spears was briefly encouraged, but then irritated by Weygand's criticism of [[Lord Gort]], the commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. At the end of the day, Spears noted that he 'sensed a break in the relationship between the two nations; they were 'no longer one'.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 237\u2013239, 244\u2013251.</ref>\n\n====Invasion of Britain could be repulsed====\nOn 28 May, Reynaud asked the British Ambassador, Sir [[Ronald Hugh Campbell]] and Spears for their view regarding a direct appeal for help to the USA. Sir Ronald declined to comment, but Spears said it had no chance of success; America would not declare war overnight and, in any case, it was not within the President's power. The prospect of an attempted German invasion across the Channel was of some comfort to Reynaud for it would give the French breathing space. Far from feeling intimidated, Spears welcomed the prospect: 'it did not even occur to me that we could not deal successfully with an attempted invasion. It would be wonderful indeed if the Nazi forces ventured on our own element, the sea'. During a discussion with [[Georges Mandel]] (Interior Minister, and one of the few hawks in the French Cabinet), he was told that [[Lebrun]], the President of the Republic was weeping with despair. Mandel reported the criticism of Weygand and General [[Joseph Vuillemin]] (Commander of the French air force) over insufficient British air support; Vuillemin doubted that his air force could withstand the losses it was sustaining.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 253, 261\u2013263.</ref>\n\n====Discussions about Dunkirk, Narvik and Italy at Supreme War Council in Paris====\nOn 31 May 1940, Churchill flew to Paris with Clement Attlee and Generals [[John Dill]] ([[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]]) and [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|\"Pug\" Ismay]] for a meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]]<ref name=Jackson>{{cite book |last= Jackson |first= Julian |title= The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940|year=2004|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 9780192805508| page =82 }}</ref> to discuss the deteriorating military situation with a French delegation consisting of Reynaud, P\u00e9tain and Weygand. Three main points were considered: [[Narvik]], the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the prospect of an [[Italian invasion of France]]. Spears did not take part in the discussions but was present 'taking voluminous notes'. It was agreed that British and French forces at Narvik be evacuated without delay \u2013 France urgently needed the manpower. Spears was impressed with the way that Churchill dominated the meeting. Dunkirk was the main topic, the French pointing out that 'out of 200,000 British 150,000 had been evacuated, whereas out of 200,000 Frenchmen only 15,000 had been taken off'. Churchill promised that now British and French soldiers would leave together 'bras dessus, bras dessous' \u2013 arm in arm. Italian entry into the war seemed imminent, with Churchill urging the bombing of the industrial north by British aircraft based in southern France while at the same time trying to gauge whether the French feared retaliation. Spears guessed that he was trying to assess the French will to fight. With the agenda completed, Churchill spoke passionately about the need for the two countries to fight on, or 'they would be reduced to the status of slaves for ever'. Spears was moved 'by the emotion that surged from Winston Churchill in great torrents'.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 253, 292\u2013314.</ref>\n\nDuring discussions after the meeting, a group formed around Churchill, P\u00e9tain and Spears. One of the French officials mentioned the possibility of France seeking a separate peace. Speaking to P\u00e9tain, Spears pointed out that such an event would provoke a blockade of France by Britain and the bombardment of all French ports in German hands. Churchill declared that Britain would fight on whatever happened.<ref>Egremont, p. 170.</ref>\n\n====Returns to London with message for Churchill====\n[[File:De havilland DH95 Flamingo.jpg|thumb|right|The [[de Havilland Flamingo]] transport aircraft. Churchill's personal Flamingo, in which he flew to and from France during the crisis of May and June 1940, was operated by [[No. XXIV Squadron RAF]].]]On 7 June, with the Germans advancing on Paris, Spears flew to London in Churchill's personal aircraft bearing a personal message from Reynaud to the British Prime Minister. The French were requesting British divisions, and fighter squadrons to be based in France. In reply, Spears had inquired how many French troops were being transferred from North Africa. In London, he was asked whether the French would, as Cl\u00e9menceau had said, \"Fight outside Paris, inside Paris, behind Paris.\"  His view was that they would not permit the destruction of that beautiful city, but this was contradicted on 11 June by a French government spokesman who told the ''Daily Telegraph'' that Paris would never be declared an open city. (The following day General Weygand issued orders declaring that the capital was not to be defended.)<ref name=\"The Fall of France\">{{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |title= The Fall of France |year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London| pages =110\u2013123, 148}}</ref>\n\n====Accompanies Churchill to conference at Briare====\n[[File:Chateau muguet breteau 45 retouche.jpg|thumb|left|Chateau du Muguet at Briare, HQ of General Weygand and venue of the conference on 11 June 1940]] On 11 June, Spears returned to France with Churchill, Eden, Generals Dill and Ismay and other staff officers. A meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]] had been arranged with Reynaud, who had been forced to leave Paris, at [[Briare]] near Orleans, which was now the HQ of General Weygand. Also present was General [[Charles de Gaulle]]; Spears had not met him before and was impressed with his bearing. As wrangling continued over the level of support from Britain, Spears suddenly became aware that 'the battle of France was over and that no one believed in miracles'. The next day Weygand's catastrophic account of the military situation reinforced his pessimism. Despite assurances from Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the British were worried that the powerful French fleet might fall into German hands. With the conference drawing to a close, it dawned on Spears that the two countries were 'within sight of a cross-roads at which the destinies of the two nations might divide'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 137\u2013171.</ref>\n\n====Spears argues with P\u00e9tain \u2013 departure for Tours====\nHe remained at Briare after Churchill had left for London on 12 June; later that day he argued with Marshal P\u00e9tain, who maintained that an armistice with Germany was now inevitable, complaining that the British had left France to fight alone. Spears referred to Churchill's words of defiance at the meeting, feeling that some of the French might remain in the struggle if they could be made to believe that Britain would fight on. The Marshal replied, \"You cannot beat Hitler with words.\" He began to feel estrangement from P\u00e9tain, whose attitude, for the first time in their relationship, savoured of hostility. His concern was now to link up with the Ambassador, [[Sir Ronald Hugh Campbell]], and he set out by car for [[Tours]]. On the way they drove through crowds of refugees, many of whom had become stranded when their cars ran out of fuel. At the Chateau de Chissey high above the River Cher, he found Reynaud and his ministers struggling to govern France, but with insufficient telephone lines and in makeshift accommodation. Again he met de Gaulle, 'whose courage was keen and clear, born of love of, and inspired by, his country'. Later in the day, he heard to his astonishment that Reynaud had left for Tours because Churchill was flying over for another meeting. In the confusion, neither Spears nor Sir Ronald had been informed. Fearful that he might not arrive in time, he set off at once along roads choked with refugees.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 172\u2013197.</ref>\n\n====Last-ditch talks at Tours====\n[[File:Prefecture Tours.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Pr\u00e9fecture at Tours \u2013 scene of crisis talks.]] What would prove to be the final meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]] took place at the [[Pr\u00e9fecture]] in Tours on 13 June. When Spears arrived, the British delegation \u2013 Churchill, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], Sir [[Alexander Cadogan]] and General 'Pug' Ismay \u2013 were already there. The French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, was accompanied by [[Paul Baudoin]], a member of the War Committee. Spears found the atmosphere quite different from that at Briare, where Churchill had expressed good will, sympathy and sorrow; now it was like a business meeting, with the British keenly appraising the situation from its own point of view. Reynaud declared that unless immediate help was assured by the US, the French government would have to give up the struggle. He acknowledged that the two countries had agreed never to conclude a separate peace<ref>At a meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]] held in London on 28 March 1940.</ref> \u2013 but France was physically incapable of carrying on. The news was received by the British with shock and horror; Spears' feelings were expressed by the exclamation marks which he scrawled in his notes. Spears noted Churchill's determination as he said, \"We must fight, we will fight, and that is why we must ask our friends to fight on.\" Prime Minister Reynaud acknowledged that Britain would continue the war, affirming that France would also continue the struggle from North Africa, if necessary \u2013 but only if there were a chance of success. That success could come only if America were prepared to join the fray. The French leader called for British understanding, asking again for France to be released from her obligation not to conclude a separate peace now that she could do no more. Spears passed a note to Churchill proposing an adjournment \u2013 a suggestion that was taken up.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 199\u2013213.</ref>\n\nThe British walked around the sodden garden of the prefecture, Spears reporting that Reynaud's mood had changed since that morning, when he had spoken of his resistance to the 'armisticers'. He told Churchill that he was certain that de Gaulle was staunch, but that General Weygand looked upon anyone who wished to fight as an enemy. Beaverbrook urged Churchill to repeat what he had already said \u2013 namely that U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] be telegraphed and American help sought. When the proceedings were resumed, it was agreed that both countries would send identical telegrams. It was on this note that the conference ended.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 214\u2013218.</ref>\n\n[[File:dragon rapide g-aeml flying arp.jpg|thumb|right|Spears and de Gaulle flew from Bordeaux to England via Jersey in a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|Dragon Rapide]]. There was some dispute after the war as to whether the aircraft had been at the command of Spears or of de Gaulle; the matter has never been satisfactorily resolved.<ref>Egremont, pp. 310\u2013302.</ref>]]\n\n====Linguistic misunderstanding====\nAfter the meeting, de Gaulle told Spears that Paul Baudoin had been telling journalists that Churchill had said that \"he would understand if France concluded a separate armistice\" ... ''\"que l'Angleterre comprendrait si la France faisait un armistice et une paix s\u00e9par\u00e9e''\". Spears realised there had been a linguistic misunderstanding. When Reynaud spoke (in French) about a separate armistice, Churchill had said, ''\"Je comprends\"'' (I understand) in the sense of 'I understand what you say', not in the sense of 'I agree'. Just as Churchill was about to take off for Britain, Spears obtained his assurance that he had never given consent to a separate armistice. But the damage had been done and, on 23 June, the words would be quoted by [[Admiral Darlan]], who signalled all French warships saying that the British Prime Minister had declared that 'he understood' the necessity for France to bring the struggle to an end'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 218\u2013220.</ref>\n\n====Churchill fails to address French cabinet====\nThe day ended in confusion \u2013 Churchill flew back to London without speaking to the French cabinet, as had been promised by Reynaud. The ministers were dismayed and angry; Spears was depressed, realising that 'an opportunity that might not recur had been missed'. He was at a loss to understand why a meeting had not taken place \u2013 had Reynaud simply forgotten? Did Reynaud wish to explain the situation to the ministers himself? In any event, his ministers were disillusioned and felt abandoned. Spears believed that this event played its part in swaying the majority of the cabinet towards surrender. He was sure that 'by the night of 13 June, the possibility of France remaining in the war had almost disappeared'. The only hope rested on the decision of President Roosevelt \u2013 would America now join the war?<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 221\u2013234.</ref>\n\n====End game at Bordeaux \u2013 London offers a Franco-British Union====\nOn 14 June, Spears left Tours to look for Reynaud and his government, which had moved to [[Bordeaux]]. On the way, he was conscious that the attitude of people to the sight of a British uniform had changed \u2013 they were morose if not hostile. When he reached Bordeaux, he learnt that Paris had fallen that morning. Spears found Reynaud \u2013 he had not received a satisfactory reply from Washington but was still clinging to the hope. Spears found him worn out, forlorn and undecided. The British consulate was besieged with crowds of would-be refugees seeking passage out of France.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 235\u2013253.</ref>\n\n====Spears rails against defeatism====\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Camille Chautemps.jpg|thumb|right|Camille Chautemps, Vice-President of the Council in Reynaud's government. Spears railed against his defeatism, commenting sarcastically that 'his sob-impregnated voice would make a stone weep'.]] -->The next day he clashed with [[Camille Chautemps]], Vice-President of the cabinet, upbraiding him for his defeatism and praising the spirit of the French soldiers that he had known during the First World War. He later spoke to [[Roland de Margerie]], Reynaud's ''Chef de cabinet'' and raised the matter of several hundred German pilots who were prisoners of the French, asking that they be handed over to the British. However, there was much confusion and telephone communications were difficult even within the city of Bordeaux itself. Spears now had misgivings about Reynaud's determination to stay in the war, if necessary from French North Africa. He was outraged that despite the critical situation, the French Commander in Chief in North Africa was opposed to receiving troops from France. There was insufficient accommodation, no spare weapons, there was a shortage of doctors; moreover the climate was rather warm for young Frenchmen at this season! In Spears' view this was monstrous; why did Reynaud not dismiss the obstructionist general? He asked why the idea of forming a redoubt in Brittany had been dropped and why Reynaud did not dismiss General Weygand for his defeatism. Margerie replied that the people had faith in Weygand and that he also had the support of P\u00e9tain. Continuing in the same vein, Spears poured cold water on the notion that America might join the war. Spears and the ambassador sent a telegram to London explaining that everything now hung on an assurance from the US, adding that they would to their utmost to obtain the scuttling of the French fleet. Their final words were, \"We have little confidence in anything now.\" They heard that Marshal P\u00e9tain would resign if American help was not forthcoming; Spears concluded that Reynaud would not continue in the face of combined opposition from the Marshal and Weygand. He longed for the presence of Churchill, which would have been 'worth more than millions in gold could buy'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 246\u2013263.</ref>\n\nSpears and the Ambassador were called following a meeting of the cabinet. The linguistic confusion from Tours returned to haunt them as Reynaud began, \"As Mr Churchill stated at Tours he would agree that France should sue for an armistice....\" Spears stopped writing and objected, \"I cannot take that down for it is untrue.\" The minutes of the Tours meeting were produced and Spears was vindicated. Reynaud wrote a message to Churchill, stating that France sought leave of Britain to inquire about armistice terms; if Britain declined, he would resign. At this point an aide handed him Roosevelt's refusal to declare war \u2013 Reynaud was in despair. He did, however, guarantee that any successor would not surrender the fleet in an armistice. Spears felt sympathy for the French army, but contempt for Weygand, 'a hysterical, egocentric old man'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 263\u2013275.</ref>\n\n====British refusal to allow France to seek a separate peace====\nBy 16 June, Spears and Sir Ronald Campbell were sure that once the French had asked for an armistice they would never fight again. With regard to the French Empire and the fleet, there was a possibility that if German armistice terms were too harsh, the Empire might rebel against them, even if metropolitan France succumbed. It did not occur to them that Hitler would split France into two zones thus dividing it against itself. Early the same morning, Reynaud, nervously exhausted and depressed, asked again for France to be relieved of its undertaking not to make a separate peace. The British took a hard line, pointing out that the solemn undertaking had been drawn up to meet the existing contingency; in any case, France [with its overseas possessions and fleet] was still in a position to carry on. While these top-level discussions were being held, [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Portes]], Reynaud's mistress repeatedly entered the room, much to the irritation of Spears and the Ambassador. Spears felt that her pernicious influence had done Reynaud great harm.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 276\u2013280.</ref><ref>In his diary for 4 March 1941, [[Harold Nicolson]] recalls having dinner with Spears at the Ritz in London. Spears had said that de Portes was passionately anti-British; she believed that Reynaud would become dictator of France and that she would be the power behind the throne. She felt that our democratic ideas would prevent this pattern of state government. She surrounded Reynaud with fifth-columnists and spies. Spears further thought that Reynaud had an inferiority complex due to his small stature; La Comtesse de Portes made him feel tall, grand and powerful. Anyone who urged resistance would be shouted at: 'C'est moi qui suis la ma\u00eetresse ici!' Towards the end of June, after Reynaud had resigned, they were in their car when Reynaud ran into a tree. A suitcase hit her on the back of the neck and she was killed instantly.</ref>\n\n====British acceptance of armistice dependent on fate of French fleet====\nShortly before lunch a telegram arrived from London agreeing that France could seek armistice terms provided that the French fleet was sailed forthwith for British harbours pending negotiations. Spears and the Ambassador felt this would be taken as an insult by the French Navy and an indication of distrust. Reynaud received the news with derision \u2013 if Britain wanted France to continue the war from North Africa, how could they ask her fleet to go to British harbours? He had spoken by telephone with Churchill and asked Spears to arrange a meeting with the British Prime Minister, at sea somewhere off Brittany. The meeting, however, never took place as he preferred to go in a French warship and this never materialised. As the day wore on, Spears became more aware of defeatism \u2013 but the hard-liners tended to be socialists. His British uniform struck a false note and people avoided him.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 282\u2013288.</ref>\n\n====French reject Franco-British Union====\nOn the afternoon of 16 June, Spears and the Ambassador met Reynaud to convey a message from London \u2013 it would be in the interest of both countries for the French fleet to be moved to British ports; it was assumed that every effort would be made to transfer the air force to North Africa or to Britain; Polish, Belgian and Czech troops in France should be sent to North Africa. While they were arguing with increasing acrimony about the fleet, a call came through from de Gaulle, who was in London. The British proposition was nothing less than a Declaration of Union \u2013 'France and Great Britain shall no longer be two nations, but one Franco-British Union. Every citizen of France will enjoy immediate citizenship of Great Britain; every British subject will become a citizen of France.' Spears became 'transfixed with amazement'; Reynaud was exulted. When the news got out, hard-liners such as [[Georges Mandel]] were pleased and relieved. The proposal would be put before the French cabinet. Spears was optimistic that it would be accepted for how could it be that of the countries fighting Germany, France should be the only one to give up the struggle, when she possessed an Empire second only to our own and a fleet whole and entire, the strongest after ours in Europe'. Yet he joked that the only common denominator of an Anglo-French Parliament would be 'an abysmal ignorance of each other's language'!<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 290\u2013294.</ref>\n\nWhile the cabinet meeting was taking place, Spears and the Ambassador heard that Churchill, [[Clement Attlee]], [[Sir Archibald Sinclair]], the three [[Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chiefs of Staff]] and others would arrive off Brittany in a warship the next day at noon for talks with the French. However, the French cabinet rejected the offer of union; Reynaud would be resigning. One minister had commented that the proposal would make France into a British [[Dominion]]. Spears, on the other hand, felt the rejection 'was like stabbing a friend bent over you in grief and affection'. Churchill and his delegation were already in the train at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]], when news of the rejection came through. He returned to [[Downing Street]] 'with a heavy heart'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 296\u2013300.</ref>\n\n====De Gaulle fears arrest====\nIn Bordeaux, Spears and Sir Ronald Campbell went to see Reynaud at his dimly-lit offices. According to Spears, he was approached in the darkness by de Gaulle, who said that Weygand intended to arrest him. Reynaud told the British that P\u00e9tain would be forming a government. Spears noted that it would consist entirely of defeatists and that the French Prime Minister had 'the air of a man relieved of a great burden'. Incredibly Reynaud asked when Churchill would be arriving off Brittany in the morning. Spears was short with him: \"Tomorrow there will be a new government and you will no longer speak for anyone.\"  However, he later came to realise that Reynaud had never double-crossed his ally, but had done his best to hold the alliance while fighting against men stronger than he was. His fault lay in his inability to pick good men. After the meeting, Spears found de Gaulle and decided to help him escape to Britain. He telephoned Churchill and got his somewhat reluctant agreement to bring over both de Gaulle and [[Georges Mandel]]. The latter, however, declined to come, opting instead to go to North Africa. It was arranged that de Gaulle would come to Spears' hotel at 7 o'clock in the morning of the following day.<ref>Egremont (p. 191) notes that Mandel went to North Africa but was sent back to France, where he was murdered in 1944.</ref><ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 235\u2013318.</ref>\n\n====Spears leaves for Britain with de Gaulle====\nOn 17 June, de Gaulle and his ADC, Lieutenant [[Geoffroy de Courcel]],<ref>See French Wikipedia at [[:fr:Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel]].</ref> went with Spears to the airfield on the pretext of seeing him off. After a delay while de Gaulle's baggage was secured, the [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide|Dragon Rapide]] took off for Britain. Winston Churchill wrote that Spears personally rescued de Gaulle from France just before the German conquest, literally pulling the Frenchman into his plane as it was taking off from Bordeaux for Britain.<ref>{{cite book |author=Winston S. Churchill|title=[[The Second World War (book series)|Their Finest Hour]] |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |year=1949 |id=}}</ref><ref>However, Egremont (p.190) notes that Spears' account of the dramatic rescue was contested after the war \u2013 by Gaullists in particular. His part was played down in France, with some accounts suggesting that he had fled fearing for his life because he was Jewish. In ''Charles de Gaulle'' by Eric Roussel (Gaillimard, 2002, p.121), Geoffroy de Courcel is scornful of Spears' description of how he had jumped aboard the taxiing aircraft: 'Courcel, more nimble, was in a trice'. De Courcel comments that this action attributes to him an acrobatic prowess which would, even at that time, have been well beyond his capability. 'C'est m'attribuer des dons acrobatiques dont, m\u00eame \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 bien incapable.'</ref> When they had reached Britain, de Gaulle gave Spears a signed photograph with the inscription, \"To General Spears, witness, ally, friend.\" <ref>Berthon, p. 80.</ref>\n\n===Spears heads British government's mission to de Gaulle===\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|left|It was Spears who brought Charles de Gaulle to London in 1940, where he would form and lead the Free French.

The attack caused great hostility towards Britain and made it even more difficult for de Gaulle to recruit men to his cause. De Gaulle, while regarding the naval action as 'inevitable', was initially uncertain whether he could still collaborate with Britain. Spears tried to encourage him and at the end of July in an unsuccessful attempt to rally support, flew to the internment camp at Aintree racecourse near Liverpool, where French seamen who had been in British ports were taken as part of Operation Catapult.<ref>Egremont, pp. 197\u2013200.</ref> In the event, de Gaulle had only some 1,300 men at his disposal in Britain, the majority being those who had recently been evacuated from Narvik following the [[Norwegian Campaign]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Les Fran\u00e7ais libres \n |publisher=Fondation de la France Libre \n |year=2003 \n |url=http://www.concours-resistance.org/pdf/cnrd_2004_complet.pdf \n |accessdate=30 March 2008 \n |format=PDF \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724073730/http://www.concours-resistance.org/pdf/cnrd_2004_complet.pdf \n |archivedate=24 July 2008  \n}}</ref>\n\n==== Dakar \u2013 Operation Menace ====\nWinston Churchill pressed for action by the Free French to turn French colonies from Vichy. [[File:General Spears and General de Gaulle.jpg|thumb|left|Spears and de Gaulle en route for Dakar in September 1940 aboard the Dutch liner, ''Westernland''.]] The target was [[Dakar]] in West Africa; the main reason being that it could become a base threatening shipping in the Atlantic. A show of force by the Royal Navy was planned coupled with a landing by de Gaulle's troops which, it was hoped, would convince the Vichy defenders to defect. Spears accompanied de Gaulle on the mission, [[Operation Menace]], with orders to report directly to the Prime Minister. However, security had been lax and the destination was said to be common talk among French troops in London.<ref>Egremont, pp. 201\u2013204.</ref>\n\nWhile the task force was en route, it came in sight of a French fleet \u2013 including three cruisers \u2013 on its way from [[Toulon]] to [[Douala]] to recapture French Equatorial Africa which had declared for de Gaulle. Surprised, the French fleet sailed for Dakar instead, thus making the outcome of the expedition much more uncertain.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''De Gaulle'', Seuil, 2010 (1984) vol 1, pp. 437\u2013438.</ref> Churchill was now of the opinion that the project should be abandoned, but de Gaulle insisted and a telegram from Spears to the Prime Minister stated, \"I wish to insist to you personally and formally that the plan for the constitution of French Africa through Dakar should be upheld and carried out.\"<ref>Egremont, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref>\n\nOn 23 September 1940, a landing by de Gaulle's troops was repulsed and, in the ensuing naval engagement, four British [[capital ships]] were damaged while the Vichy French lost two destroyers and a submarine. Finally Churchill ordered the operation to be called off. The Free French had been snubbed by their countrymen; de Gaulle and Spears were deeply depressed, the latter fearing for his own reputation \u2013 and rightly so. The ''Daily Mirror'' wrote: \u201cDakar has claims to rank with the lowest depths of imbecility to which we have yet sunk.\u201d De Gaulle was further discredited with the Americans and began to criticise Spears openly, telling Churchill that he was 'intelligent but egotistical and hampering because of his unpopularity at the War Office etc.'.<ref>Egremont, pp. 214, 216.</ref> John Colville, Churchill's private secretary, wrote on 27 October 1940, \u201cIt is true that Spears' emphatic telegrams persuaded the Cabinet to revert to the Dakar scheme after it had, on the advice of the Chiefs of Staff, been abandoned.\u201d <ref name=\"colville\">{{cite book |last= Colville |first= John |title= The Fringes of Power \u2013 10 Downing Street Diaries 1939\u20131955 |year= 1985 |publisher= Hodder and Stoughton |location= London |isbn= 0-393-02223-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/fringesofpower1000colv/page/277 277] |url= https://archive.org/details/fringesofpower1000colv/page/277 }}</ref>\n\n=== De Gaulle and Spears in the Levant ===\n[[File:Flag of Free France (1940-1944).svg|thumb|right|The French flag with the [[Cross of Lorraine]], emblem of the Free French.]]Still acting as Churchill's personal representative to the Free French, Spears left England with de Gaulle for the [[Levant]] via Cairo in March 1941. They were received by British officers, including General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the British Commander in Chief Middle East, and also General [[Georges Catroux]], the former Governor General of French [[Indo-China]], who had been relieved of his post by the [[Vichy France]] regime of Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]].<ref name=\"fulfilment\">{{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward|title= Fulfilment of a Mission |year= 1977 |publisher= Leo Cooper|location= London|isbn= 0-85052-234-X |page= 6 }}</ref>\n\nWavell, the British [[Commander-in-Chief]], wanted to negotiate with the Governor of [[French Somaliland]], which was still loyal to Vichy France, and lift the blockade of that territory in exchange for the right to send supplies to British forces in [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] via the railway from the coast to [[Addis Ababa]]. However, de Gaulle and Spears argued in favour of firmness, the former arguing that a detachment of his [[Free French]] should be sent to confront the Vichy troops in the hope that the latter would be persuaded to change sides. Wavell agreed, but was later overruled by [[Anthony Eden]], who feared an open clash between the two French factions. British vacillations persisted against the advice of Spears and to the extreme irritation of de Gaulle.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 11\u201313.</ref>\n\n==== Syria and Lebanon ====\nMore serious differences between Britain and de Gaulle soon emerged over [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. De Gaulle and Spears held that it was essential to deny the Germans access to Vichy air bases in Syria from where they would threaten the [[Suez Canal]]. However, Wavell was reluctant to stretch his limited forces and did not want to risk a clash with the French in Syria.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 61\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe French in Syria had initially been in favour of continuing the struggle against Germany but had been snubbed by Wavell, who declined the offer of cooperation from three French divisions. By the time de Gaulle reached the Levant, Vichy had replaced any Frenchmen who were sympathetic towards Britain.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 15, 25.</ref>\n\nHaving left the Middle East with de Gaulle on a visit to [[French Equatorial Africa]], Spears had his first major row with the general who, in a fit of pique caused by 'some quite minor action by the British government', suddenly declared that the landing ground at [[Fort Lamy]] would no longer be available to British aircraft transiting Africa. Spears countered furiously by threatening to summon up British troops to take over the aerodrome and the matter blew over.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle told Spears that the Vichy authorities in the Middle East were acting against the Free French and the British. French ships blockaded by the British at [[Alexandria]] were permitted to transmit coded messages which were anything but helpful to the British cause. Their crews were allowed to take leave in the [[Levant]] States where they stoked up anti-British feeling. They also brought back information about British naval and troop movements which would find its way back to Vichy. In ''Fulfilment of a Mission'' Spears writes bitterly about how Britain was providing pay for Vichy sailors who were allowed to remit money back to France. Their pay would, of course, be forfeited if they joined de Gaulle. However, his biggest bone of contention \u2013 one over which he frequently clashed with the [[Foreign Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] \u2013 was that a French ship, ''SS Providence'', was allowed to sail unchallenged between [[Beirut]] and [[Marseille]]. It carried contraband 'and a living cargo of French soldiers and officials [prisoners] who were well disposed to us or who wished to continue the fight at our side'.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 21\u201322.</ref> [[File:Flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|right|Presidential standard of the collaborationist Vichy Regime]]\n\nDe Gaulle and Spears held the view that the British at [[Headquarters|GHQ]] in Cairo were unwilling to accept that they had been duped over the level of collaboration between Germany and the Vichy-controlled states in the Levant. The British military authorities feared that a blockade of the Levant would cause hardship and thus antagonise the civilian population. However, Spears pointed out that the Vichy French were already unpopular with the local population \u2013 ordinary people resented being lorded over by defeated foreigners. He urged aggressive propaganda aimed at the Vichy French in support of the Free French and British policy. He felt that the Free French would be considered as something different as they were allies of Britain and enjoyed the dignity of fighting their enemy instead of submitting to him.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 26, 33.</ref>\n\nOn 13 May 1941, the fears of de Gaulle and Spears were realised when German aircraft landed in Syria in support of the Iraqi rebel [[Rashid Ali]], who was opposed to the pro-British government. On 8 June, 30,000 troops (Indian Army, British, Australian, Free French and the Trans-Jordanian Frontier Force) invaded Lebanon and Syria in what was known as [[Operation Exporter]]. There was stiff resistance from the Vichy French and Spears commented bitterly on 'that strange class of Frenchmen who had developed a vigour in defeat which had not been apparent when they were defending their country'.<ref>Egremont, pp. 225\u2013226.</ref>\n\nSpears soon became aware of the poor liaison which existed between the British Embassy in Cairo, the armed forces, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Sudan]]. The arrival in Cairo in July 1941 of [[Oliver Lyttelton]], who was a Minister of State and a member of the War Cabinet, improved matters considerably. The Middle East Defence Council was also formed \u2013 a body that Spears would later join.<ref>Egremont, pp. 21, 111.</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, having received the title of [[KBE]], Spears was appointed the first British minister to Syria and Lebanon. Beirut still holds his name on one of its major streets, [[Rue Spears]].<ref name=XDNB/>\n\n== Later life ==\nSpears lost his parliamentary seat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 General Election]], which saw the Conservative Party defeated in a landslide. The same year he accepted the position of chairman of the commercial firm Ashanti Goldfields. From 1948 to 1966 he was chairman of the Institute of Directors, frequently visiting West Africa. Spears published several books during the post-war period: ''Assignment to Catastrophe'' (1954);. ''Two Men who Saved France'' (1966), and his own autobiography, ''The Picnic Basket'' (1967).\n\nSpears was created a [[baronet]], of [[Warfield]], Berkshire, on 30 June 1953. He died on 27 January 1974 at the age of 87 at the [[Heatherwood Hospital]] at [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]].<ref name=XDNB>\n{{cite web\n  | title =Spears, Sir Edward Louis, baronet (1886\u20131974)\n  | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | year = 2004 |edition = online January 2008\n  | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31706\n  | accessdate =  16 August 2009}}</ref>\nA memorial service at [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]] followed on 7 March. The trumpeters of the 11th Hussars sounded a fanfare; the French and Lebanese ambassadors were in attendance. General Sir Edward Louis Spears lies buried at Warfield alongside the graves of his first wife, May, and his son, Michael.<ref>Egremont, p. 316.</ref>\n\n== Tragedy of his life ==\nIn the foreword to ''Fulfilment of a Mission'', the account by Spears of his service in the Levant, [[John Terraine]], writes of 'the tragedy of his life'. By this he meant that someone who should have been a warm friend of de Gaulle had become an intractable and spiteful enemy. His boyhood had been spent in France. He was happy in France, he liked the spirit of the people. He liked the sailors of Brittany and the peasants of Burgundy. He understood their wit. It amused him to talk to them and to be with them. It had been a very bitter experience to find himself opposed and having to oppose French policy so often. That, he said, had been the tragedy of his life. Terraine comments further, \"If Mr [[Graham Greene]] had not already made good use of it, the title of ''Fulfilment of a Mission'' might just as well have been, ''The End of an Affair.\"<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, p. ix.</ref>\n\n== Linguistic competence ==\nIn October 1939, he led a delegation of British MPs to France and spoke on French Radio. After the broadcast, listeners protested that his speech had been read for him because 'an Englishman without an accent did not exist'!<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, p. 46.</ref> In February 1940, he gave a lecture on the British war effort to a large and distinguished audience in Paris. Fluent though he was, he nevertheless felt it would be helpful to attend lessons with an elocution teacher who coached leading French actors.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, p. 72.</ref> It must be supposed that he also spoke some German thanks to the two years which he had spent at a boarding school in Germany.<ref>Egremont, p. 6.</ref>\n\nDespite his linguistic competence, Spears hated interpreting. He realised that it required qualifications beyond a mere knowledge of two languages. At the conference at Tours on 13 June 1940, he had the awesome responsibility of translating Paul Reynaud's French into English and Winston Churchill's English into French. The final phase of the Battle of France and the destiny of two nations were at stake; it promised to be the gravest of the meetings so far held between the two governments. Furthermore, he was aware that others in the room were completely conversant with both languages and that most of them would have thought of the word that he was searching for before he had found it.<ref>''The Fall of France'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 201\u2013202.</ref>\n\n== Media ==\nSir Edward Spears appears as an interviewee in numerous episodes of the 1964 documentary series ''[[The Great War (documentary)|The Great War]]'', especially in reference to the major roles he played as liaison to the French [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth Army]] in the episodes ''Our hats we doff to General Joffre'', detailing the [[Great Retreat]] to the Marne and ''This business may last a long time'', detailing the First Battle of the Marne and the subsequent [[Race to the Sea]]. He appeared in the 1969 French documentary ''[[The Sorrow and the Pity]]''. He also appeared near the end of his life, in the episode \"[[France Falls]]\" of the landmark 1974 documentary series, ''[[The World at War]]''.\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last= Berthon|first=Simon|title=Allies at War|year=2001|publisher= HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-00-711622-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last= Borden|first=Mary|title=Journey down a Blind Alley|year=1946|publisher= Hutchinson & Co|location= London }}\n* {{cite book |last= Churchill |first= Winston S. |authorlink=  |title= Their Finest Hour |url= https://archive.org/details/theirfinesthour00chur |url-access= registration |year=1949|publisher= Houghton Mifflin }}\n* {{cite book |last= Colville |first= John |authorlink=  |title= The Fringes of Power \u2013 10 Downing Street Diaries 1939\u20131955 |year= 1985 |publisher= Hodder and Stoughton |location= London |isbn= 0-393-02223-4 |url= https://archive.org/details/fringesofpower1000colv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Egremont |first= Max |authorlink=  |title= Under two Flags |year=1997 |publisher= Phoenix, Orion Books |location= London |isbn=0-7538-0147-7}}\n* {{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= Martin |authorlink=  |title= The Day the War Ended |year= 1995 |publisher= HarperCollins |location= London |isbn= 0-00-255597-2 |url= https://archive.org/details/daywarendedveday0000gilb }}\n* {{cite book |last= Nicolson |first= Harold |title= Diaries and Letters, 1939\u20131945 |url= https://archive.org/details/diariesletters0000nico |url-access= registration |year=1967 |publisher= Collins |location= London}}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Liaison 1914 |origyear=1930|year=1999|publisher= Eyre & Spottiswood |location= London|isbn=0-304-35228-4}}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Prelude to Victory|year=1939|publisher= Jonathan Cape |location= London |edition=online |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.503332 |accessdate=13 May 2017 |oclc=459267081}}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Prelude to Dunkirk (Part 1 of [[Assignment to Catastrophe]])|year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London }}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= The Fall of France (Part 2 of Assignment to Catastrophe)|year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London }}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Fulfilment of a Mission |year=1977|publisher= Leo Cooper |location= London |isbn= 0-85052-234-X }}\n\n==Notes and sources==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

Spears was a retired Brigadier General of the British Army, and served as a Member of the British House of Commons. From 1917 to 1920 he was head of the British Military Mission in Paris.\n\n==Family and early life==\nSpears was born of British parents at 7 chauss\u00e9e de la Muette in the fashionable district of [[Passy]] in Paris on 7 August 1886; France would remain the land of his childhood. His parents, Charles McCarthy Spiers and Melicent Marguerite Lucy Hack, were British residents of France. His paternal grandfather was the noted [[lexicographer]], [[Alexander Spiers]], who had published an English-French and French-English dictionary in 1846.<ref name=Egremont>{{cite book |last= Egremont |first= Max |title= Under Two Flags |year=1997|publisher= Phoenix \u2013 Orion Books |location= London |isbn=0-7538-0147-7| pages = 1\u20132 }}</ref> The work was extremely successful and adopted by the University of France for French Colleges.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n  | title = General English and French Dictionary (Google Book Search)\n  | publisher = Google\n  | year = 2006\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NroPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22alexander+spiers%22&output=html&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=0_2\n  | accessdate =  11 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nEdward Louis Spears changed his name from Spiers to Spears in 1918. He claimed that the reason was his irritation at the mispronunciation of Spiers, yet it is possible that he wanted an English looking name \u2013 something more in keeping with his rank as a brigadier-general and head of the British Military Mission to the French War Office. He denied that he was of Jewish stock, but his great-grandfather had been an Isaac Spiers of Gosport who married Hannah Moses, a shopkeeper of the same town.<ref>Egremont, pp. 2, 82.</ref> His ancestry was no secret. In 1918 the French ambassador in London described him as \"a very able and intriguing Jew who insinuates himself everywhere.\"<ref>Julian Jackson, The Fall of France, Oxford 2003, 91.</ref>\n\nHis parents separated while he was a child, and his maternal grandmother played an important role during his formative years. The young Louis (the name used by his friends) was often on the move, usually with his grandmother \u2013 Menton, Aix-les-Bains, Switzerland, Brittany and Ireland. He had contracted [[diphtheria]] and [[typhoid]] as an infant and was considered delicate. However, after two years at a tough boarding school in Germany, his physical condition improved and he became a strong swimmer and an athlete.<ref>Egremont, pp. 4, 6.</ref>\n\n== Army service before First World War ==\n[[File:Old war office.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Old War Office Building in London. It was here that Spears, the bilingual young subaltern, worked with French counterparts developing a joint Anglo-French codebook.]]\nIn 1903, he joined the Kildare [[Militia]], the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. In the mess, he acquired the nickname of Monsieur Beaucaire after a play about an urbane Frenchman. The nickname stuck and he was called this by both of his wives, the first of whom would often shorten it to B. In 1906 he was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] in the regular army with the 8th Royal Irish Hussars. Spears did not conform to the conventional image of a young army officer. In the same year that he was commissioned, he published a translation of a French general's book, ''Lessons of the [[Russo-Japanese War]]''. His upbringing with a succession of tutors meant that he had not learned to mix, and so he did not easily adapt to life in an officers' [[mess]]. He could be tactless and argumentative and became an outsider \u2013 something he would remain all his life. In 1911, he worked at the [[War Office]] developing a joint Anglo-French codebook. In 1914, he published ''Cavalry Tactical Schemes'', another translation of a French military text. In May of the same year, he was sent to Paris to work alongside the French at their Ministry of War with orders to make contact with British agents in Belgium. With the outbreak of war in August 1914, on the orders of his colonel at the War Office, Spears left Paris for the front.

General [[Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet|Henry Wilson]], a [[staff officer]] acting as a liaison officer to the French Army, had been said to declare that he saw 'no reason for an officer knowing any language except his own'. According to one story, when Field Marshal [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Sir John French]], the commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] at the start of the [[First World War]], had spoken (then as a general) from a prepared French text at manoeuvres in France in 1910, his accent was so bad that his listeners thought he was speaking in English!<ref>Egremont, p. 23.</ref>\n\nDuring the First World War, British soldiers unable to pronounce French words came up with their own (often humorous) versions of place names \u2013 the town of [[Ypres]] (''Ieper'' in Flemish) was known as 'Wipers'.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Battlefield Colloquialisms of the Great War (WW1) by Paul Hinckley\n |url         = http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~davidt/z_ww1_slang/index_bak.htm\n |accessdate  = 6 April 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414234838/http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~davidt/z_ww1_slang/index_bak.htm\n |archivedate = 14 April 2008\n|df          = dmy\n}}</ref> Yet French place names were also a problem for senior officers. In the spring of 1915, Spears was ordered to pronounce French place names in an English way otherwise General Robertson, the new Chief of Staff, would not be able to understand them.<ref>Egremont, p. 41.</ref>\n\nOn the French side, few of the commanders spoke good English with the exception of Generals Nivelle and [[Ferdinand Foch]]. It was in this linguistic fog that the bilingual young [[subaltern]], made his mark. Although only a junior officer (a lieutenant of Hussars), he would get to know senior British and French military and political figures (Churchill, French, Haig, Joffre, P\u00e9tain, Reynaud, Robertson etc.)  \u2013 a fact that would stand him in good stead during later life.<ref>Egremont, pp. 6, 22, 41, 43.</ref>\n\n=== First liaison duties \u2013 French Fifth Army ===\n[[File:Charles Lanrezac.gif|thumb|right|General Charles Lanrezac, Commander of Fifth French Army \u2013 Spears' first liaison job was an attachment to this officer early in the war]] Sent first to the [[Ardennes]] on 14 August 1914, his job was to liaise between Field Marshal Sir [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and General [[Charles Lanrezac]], commander of the [[French Fifth Army]]. The task was made more difficult by Lanrezac's obsession with secrecy and an arrogant attitude towards the British. The Germans were moving fast and the allied commanders had to make decisions quickly, without consulting each other; their headquarters were also on the move and could not keep their counterparts up to date with their locations. In today's age of radio communication, it is hard to believe that such vital information was often relayed personally by Spears, who travelled by car between the headquarters along roads clogged with refugees and retreating troops.<ref>Egremont, pp. 23, 25, 30.</ref>\n\nCommanders were aware that wireless communications were insecure and so often preferred the traditional, personal touch for liaison work. And as far as the telephone was concerned, Spears refers to 'exasperating delays'; sometimes, he was even put through to the advancing Germans by mistake. On these occasions he pretended to be German to extract information, but failed as his German was not sufficiently convincing.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Telephones, Telegraphs and Automobiles: The Response of British Commanders to New Communications Technologies in 1914 by Nikolas Gardner.\n |url         = http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/Gardner.pdf\n |accessdate  = 9 April 2008\n |format      = PDF\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20040107193311/http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/Gardner.pdf\n |archivedate = 7 January 2004\n|df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n====An army is saved====\nOn 23 August, General Lanrezac made a sudden decision to retreat \u2013 a manoeuvre that would have dangerously exposed the British forces on his flank. Spears was able to inform Sir John French in the nick of time \u2013 the action of a young liaison officer had saved an army. The following day, Spears amazed himself by his audacious language when urging General Lanrezac to launch a counter-attack, \"Mon G\u00e9neral, if by your action the British Army is annihilated, England will never pardon France, and France will not be able to afford to pardon you.\"  In September, Spears again showed that he was not afraid to speak his mind. When General [[Franchet d'Esperey]], Lanrezac's successor, had heard (incorrectly) that the British were in retreat, the French officer said 'some unacceptable things concerning the British commander-in-chief in particular and the British in general'. Spears confronted Franchet d'Esperey's chief-of-staff for an apology, which was duly given. At the suggestion of his young liaison officer, Sir John French visited Franchet d'Esperey a few days later to clear up the misunderstanding. Spears remained with the French Fifth Army during the [[First Battle of the Marne]], riding on horseback behind Franchet d'Esperey when [[Reims]] was liberated on 13 September.<ref>Egremont, pp. 28\u201329, 34.</ref>\n\n=== Liaison duties \u2013 French Tenth Army ===\n[[File:Fisher&Churchill.jpg|thumb|right|When Winston Churchill (seen here with Admiral 'Jackie' Fisher) lost his post as First Lord of the Admiralty after the failure of the Gallipoli campaign, he served on the western front.

The two men got on well \u2013 Maud'huy referring to him as 'my friend Spears', and insisting that they ate together. It was at the recommendation of the new commander that Spears was made a 'Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]]'. In January 1915, he was wounded for the first time and repatriated to convalesce in London. He was [[mentioned in dispatches]] and again commended by Maud'huy \u2013 as a result he was awarded the [[Military Cross]].<ref>Egremont, pp. 38\u201340.</ref>\n\n====Meets Winston Churchill \u2013 a friendship is forged====\nAgain at the front in April 1915, he accompanied [[Winston Churchill]], then [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], on a tour of inspection.<ref name=\"Egremont, p.81\">Egremont, p. 81.</ref> Frequently the only Englishman in a French officers' mess, Spears could feel lonely and isolated and had to endure criticism of his country. The general feeling in France was that Britain should be doing more.<ref>Egremont, pp. 42, 50.</ref>\n\nWhen he returned to France after treatment for a second wound which he had incurred in August 1915 (there would be a total of four during the war), he found General Sir Douglas Haig, who was in command of the British First Army, and General d'Urbal, the new commander of the French Tenth Army, at loggerheads; it was his task to improve the relationship. Then on 5 December, the [[Dardanelles Campaign]] having failed, Winston Churchill arrived in France seeking a command on the western front. He had lost his post of [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] and wanted to temporarily leave the political arena. The two men became friends and Churchill suggested that if he were to be given command of a brigade, Spears might join him as his brigade major. However, Churchill was instead given command of a battalion. In any case, Spears' work in liaison was too highly valued and there was no question that he would be allowed to join Churchill.<ref>Egremont, pp. 43, 48, 49.</ref>\n\n====Fear of mental breakdown====\nHe got to know General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who had distinguished himself at the [[Battle of Verdun]] in 1916 and said of him, \"I like P\u00e9tain, whom I know well.\"  Prior to the [[Battle of the Somme]], he hoped that he would no longer have to face criticism of the British. However, when the British failed and took heavy losses, there were hints that they could not stand shell fire. He began to doubt his fellow countrymen \u2013 had they lost the vigour and courage of their forebears?  In August 1916, subjected to emotional buffeting from both sides, he feared he might suffer a breakdown.<ref>Egremont, p. 48.</ref>\n\n=== General Staff \u2013 liaison between French Ministry of War and War Office in London ===\nIn May 1917, Spears became a major and was promoted to General Staff Officer 1st Grade prior to taking up a high-level appointment in Paris, where he was to liaise between the French Ministry of War and the [[War Office]] in London. In less than three years, this young officer had got to know many influential figures on both sides of the Channel. He found Paris full of intrigues, with groups of officers and officials conspiring against each other. Spears exploited the confusion to his advantage and created an independent position for himself.<ref>Egremont, pp. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\nWithin days, Spears was dining at the French War Ministry with a group of VIPs \u2013 the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], the Chief of the Imperial General Staff General Sir [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|William Robertson]], [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe]], War Minister [[Paul Painlev\u00e9]] and Major-General [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Maurice]], who was the British Director of Military Operations. His brief was to report directly to the War Office in London, bypassing the military attach\u00e9. On 17 May, General P\u00e9tain, the new French Commander in Chief, told Spears that he wished Lt-General Henry Wilson, who had been closely associated with Petain's disgraced predecessor [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]], to be replaced as the chief British liaison officer. Realising this would make Wilson his enemy, Spears protested but was overruled.<ref>Egremont, p. 55.</ref>\n\n====Reports on French mutinies and resentment====\nBy 22 May 1917 he had learned of the mutinies in the French Army and travelled to the front to make an assessment. The mutinies had first rumbled during the slaughter at [[Verdun]] the previous year (especially during the costly counterattacks by Nivelle and Mangin) and had erupted in earnest after the failure of the Nivelle Offensive in the spring of 1917. Spears was called to London to report on French morale to the War Policy Cabinet Council \u2013 a heavy responsibility. Spears recorded in a 1964 BBC interview that Lloyd George asked repeatedly for assurances that the French would recover. At one point Spears said\n\u201cYou can shoot me if I am wrong \u2013 I know how important it is and will stake my life on it.\" Lloyd George was still not satisfied: \u201cWill you give me your word of honour as an officer and a gentleman that the French Army will recover?\u201d. Spears was so stung by this that he replied \"The fact that you ask me that shows you know the meaning of neither\".<ref>Egremont, pp. 56\u201358.</ref>\n\nSpears heard of French dissatisfaction which was expressed on 7 July at a secret parliamentary session. Left wing deputies declared that the British had suffered 300,000 casualties as opposed to 1,300,000 by the French. Furthermore, they were holding a front of {{convert|138|km|mi}}, whereas the French held {{convert|474|km|mi}}.<ref>Egremont, p. 59.</ref>\n\n[[File:Henry Hughes Wilson, British general, photo portrait standing in uniform.jpg|thumb|General Henry Wilson \u2013 within days of taking up his post in Paris, Major Spears was told by General P\u00e9tain that he wished Wilson to be replaced. Spears protested but was overruled; thereafter Wilson would bear a grudge against him.]] In the wake of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], efforts were made to revive the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and detach Bulgaria from the [[Central Powers]]. In Paris, Spears worked to promote these ends and received the added task of liaising with the Polish army.<ref>Egremont, p. 66.</ref>\n\n====Introduces Churchill to Clemenceau====\nIn November 1917, [[Georges Clemenceau]] became Prime Minister of France and restored a will to fight. Spears reported that Clemenceau, who spoke English fluently, was 'markedly pro English'; he was sure that France would last out to the bitter end. Clemenceau had told Spears that he could come to see him at any time \u2013 and this he duly did, taking his friend Winston Churchill \u2013 now Minister of Munitions \u2013 to meet the so-called 'Tiger of France'.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Portrait \u2013 Georges Cl\u00e9menceau (1841\u20131929)\n |url         = http://multisites.phpnet.org/alaurent/biographie/france/clemenceau.htm\n |accessdate  = 7 April 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20040611072002/http://multisites.phpnet.org/alaurent/biographie/france/clemenceau.htm\n |archivedate = 11 June 2004\n|df          = dmy\n}}</ref>\nSpears became aware of Clemenceau's ruthlessness \u2013 'probably the most difficult and dangerous man I have ever met' \u2013 and told London that he was 'out to wreck' the [[Supreme War Council]] at Versailles, France, being bent on its domination.<ref>Egremont, pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n[[File:Georges Clemenceau.jpg|thumb|left|Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister of France from 16 November 1917 to 20 January 1920. He supported Spears when Foch tried to have him removed. Known as 'The Tiger of France', he was a formidable character \u2013 Spears would later refer to what he had said of himself, \"I had a wife, she abandoned me; I had children, they turned against me; I had friends, they betrayed me. I have only my claws left, and I use them.\"]]\n\n====Intrigues in Paris====\nGeneral [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]] reported Spears as 'one to make mischief'. At the first meeting of the Supreme War Council in December 1917, Spears took the role as a master of ceremonies, interpreting and acting as a go-between. In January 1918, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and was told he would be made a brigadier-general \u2013 the rank that he retained after the war. However, one month later he feared for his career when his enemy, Henry Wilson, replaced General Sir William Robertson as [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]].<ref>Egremont, pp. 68\u201369, 73.</ref>\n\nFebruary 1918 saw more intrigues in Paris. General [[Ferdinand Foch]], an ally and friend of General Henry Wilson, would be nominated Allied Supreme Commander in the northern French town of Doullens on 26 March 1918.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Culture.fr \u2013 le portail de la culture \n |url=http://www.culture.fr/sections/regions/picardie/organisme/JEP-ORGS21768?typeSearch=bibliotheques&SearchableText=&SearchWhere=\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610114552/http://www.culture.fr/sections/regions/picardie/organisme/JEP-ORGS21768?typeSearch=bibliotheques&SearchableText=&SearchWhere=\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=10 June 2011\n |accessdate=7 April 2008 \n}}</ref>\nFoch was concerned at the friendship between his General Alphonse Georges and Louis Spears. Fearing that the latter would know too much, Foch said he would deny the Englishman access to diplomatic dispatches. However, this never came about because Spears played his ace card \u2013 the close relationship which he enjoyed with Georges Clemenceau. His adversary General Henry Wilson, the new Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was advised by Foch to 'get rid of Spears'. The complications continued with Spears fighting to maintain his position \u2013 telling Wilson that the antagonism of Foch stemmed from personal resentment, and calling upon support from his friend, Winston Churchill. Spears argued that he was attached to Clemenceau and not to Foch \u2013 thus his position in Paris was assured, a fact confirmed in due course in a letter from Henry Wilson.<ref>Egremont, pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe German offensive of March 1918 forced the allies back and Paris came under artillery bombardment. Mutual recrimination followed, with Field Marshal [[Douglas Haig]] raging 'because the French don't help more'; and the French failing to understand 'why the British can't hold'. Paris was a nest of vipers. Both sides were wary of Spears \u2013 the French ambassador in London believing him to be a Jew and an intriguer who had wormed his way into the trust of [[Paul Painlev\u00e9]] (War Minister in the summer of 1917 when Spears had replaced Wilson in French confidence, later Prime Minister from 12 September to 16 November 1917), and that he had passed secrets to the British. By the same token, Spears pointed a finger at Professor Alfred Mantoux, claiming that he was giving information to the French socialist, [[Albert Thomas (minister)|Albert Thomas]]. However, Henry Wilson noted that 'Spears is jealous of Mantoux, who is his successful rival as an interpreter.'  By the end of May, the Germans were at the [[River Marne]] and even Clemenceau turned against Spears. The reason according to Lord Derby, the new ambassador to Paris, was that he 'finds out and tells our government things that Clemenceau does not wish them to know'.<ref>Egremont, pp. 77\u201380.</ref>\n\nIn September 1918, the Germans were in retreat and although praise for Britain came from Foch, the French press was off-hand. Bad feeling towards the British persisted after the armistice on 11 November 1918. In his victory speech to the [[Chamber of Deputies]], Clemenceau did not even mention the British \u2013 'calculated rudeness' according to Spears.<ref name=\"Egremont, p.81\"/>\n\n== Romance and marriage ==\n\n=== Jessie Gordon ===\nIn 1908, as a young cavalry officer, Spears suffered concussion after being knocked unconscious during a game of polo. He was treated in London and fell in love with Jessie Gordon, one of the two women running the nursing home where he was a patient. This affair would last for several years \u2013 often causing him distress.<ref>Egremont, pp. 9\u201310, 39\u201340, 46.</ref>\n\n=== Mary 'May' Borden-Turner ===\n[[File:Strathearn Place 12-London-W2.JPG|thumb|12 Strathearn Place \u2013 the London home of Louis and May before, during and after the Second World War.

When Spears first met Mary \u2013 'May' as she was known \u2013 she had used her money to set up a field hospital for the French army. The attraction was mutual and by the spring of 1917 she and Louis had become lovers.

The unit was staffed with British nurses and French doctors. May and her unit served in France until the German [[Blitzkrieg]] in June 1940 forced them to evacuate to Britain via [[Arcachon]]. From May 1941, with funds provided by the [[British War Relief Society]] in New York, the medical unit served with [[Free French]] forces in the Middle East, North Africa, Italy and France.<ref>Borden, pp. 13, 116\u2013117, inside front cover.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lady Spears (May Borden) and Sir Edward Spears in the Lebanon, 1942.jpg|thumb|Lady Spears (centre) with Sir Edward Spears (left) in December 1942 in Lebanon on the steps of their residence \u2013 that of the First British Minister to the Levant.

However, vehicles from May's Anglo-French ambulance unit took part \u2013 Union Jacks and Tricolours side by side as usual. De Gaulle heard wounded French soldiers cheering, \"Voil\u00e0 Spears!  Vive Spears!\" and ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British members repatriated. May commented, \"A pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.\".<ref name=\"GILBERT\">{{Cite book |last = Gilbert| first = Martin| title = The Day the War Ended|year = 1995|publisher = HarperCollins|place= London|isbn =0-00-711622-5|page= 397 }}</ref> May wrote to General de Gaulle protesting at his order, and speaking in the name of the French officers who had been attached to her unit. The general replied, denying that her unit had been dissolved because of the flying of the British flag; he maintained that a decision had already been taken to dissolve six of the nine mobile surgical units attached to his forces. May's reply of 5 July was bitter: 'From you I have had no recognition since February 1941 [...] but our four years with the 1st Free French Division have bound to us the officers and men of that Division with bonds that can never be broken.'<ref>Borden, pp. 295\u2013296.</ref> Mary Borden died on 2 December 1968; her obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' pays tribute to her humanitarian work during both world wars and describes her as 'a writer of very real and obvious gifts'.\n\n=== Nancy Maurice ===\nSpears resigned his commission in June 1919, thus bringing to an end his post as Head of the Military Mission in Paris. In October of the same year, the former Director of Military Operations in Paris, Sir Frederick Maurice, passed through the city accompanied by his daughter, Nancy. Unlike most girls of her background and station, Nancy had had a good education and was a trained secretary. She agreed to act as Spears' secretary on a temporary basis. However, she would become indispensable and remain in the post for 42 years. Their work brought them close and an affair developed.\n\nWhen he returned to the Levant in the spring of 1942 after sick leave in Britain, she accompanied him as his secretary. With her good head for commerce, she proved invaluable when he became chairman of the [[Ashanti Goldfields Corporation]] in West Africa after the war. When May died in December 1968, Nancy expected a speedy marriage but Louis prevaricated. They married on 4 December 1969 at [[St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge|St Paul's Church]], Knightsbridge, and Nancy thus became the second Lady Spears. Nancy died in 1975.<ref>Egremont, pp. 91\u201393, 113, 237, 305, 316.</ref>\n\n== Inter-war years ==\n\n===Business and political links with Czechoslovakia===\nIn 1921, Spears went into business with a Finnish partner \u2013 their aim was to establish trading links in the newly founded republic of [[Czechoslovakia]]. On a visit to Prague, he met [[Eduard Benes]], the Prime Minister, and [[Jan Masaryk]], son of the President; at the same time he came into contact with officials at the Czech Finance Ministry.<ref>Egremont, p. 98.</ref> His business relations in Prague developed further when, in 1934, Spears became chairman of the British [[Bata Shoes|Bata]] shoe company, which, in turn, was part of the international concern of the same name. He later became a director of the merchants, J. Fisher, which had trade links with Czechoslovakia, and a director of a Czech steel works. Yet his business successes found no favour with certain members of the Conservative Party \u2013 especially those with anti-Semitic views. [[Duff Cooper]] said of him: \"He's the most unpopular man in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House]]. Don't trust him: he'll let you down in the end.\" <ref>Egremont, pp. 136\u20137.</ref>\n\nHis visits to Czechoslovakia and friendship with its political figures strengthened his resolve to bolster support for the young republic in both London and Paris. He was violently opposed to the [[Munich agreement]] of 1938, which saw the [[Sudetenland]] handed over to Germany. When he heard the news of the occupation, he wept openly and declared that he had never felt so ashamed and heartbroken. His views brought him into opposition with Conservatives who were broadly in favour of the Munich agreement. Yet it cannot be denied that there was an element of self-interest in his espousal of the Czech cause \u2013 he stood to lose his business interests and an annual income of some \u00a32,000 if the country broke up.<ref>Egremont, pp. 139\u2013141.</ref>\n\n===Member of Parliament===\nSpears was twice a member of parliament (MP) \u2013 from 1922 to 1924 at [[Loughborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Loughborough]] and from 1931 to 1945 at [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]]. His pro-French views in the Commons earned him the nickname of 'the Member for Paris'.<ref name=\"berthonbook\">{{cite book |last= Berthon |first= Simon|title= Allies at War |year= 2001 |publisher= HarperCollins|location= London|isbn= 0-00-711622-5 |page= 80 }}</ref>\n\n====Loughborough====\nIn December 1921, Spears was adopted at Loughborough as the parliamentary candidate for the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal Party]]. He was elected unopposed in 1922 because the Labour candidate had failed to hand in his nomination papers in time, and the Conservatives had agreed not to put up a candidate to oppose him. With Winston Churchill in hospital and unable to campaign at [[Dundee]], Spears and his wife took on the job, but Churchill was defeated. As a gesture of friendship, Spears offered to give up his seat at Loughborough \u2013 an offer which Churchill declined. His maiden speech, in February 1923, was critical of both the Foreign Office and the Embassy in Paris. He spoke out against the French occupation of the [[Ruhr]] in the House of Commons later the same month. In December, there was another election, with Spears retaining his seat as a National Liberal.<ref>Egremont, pp. 100\u2013106, 111.</ref> However, at the election in October 1924, he was beaten into third place by the Conservative and Labour candidates.<ref>Egremont, p. 113.</ref> There followed two further attempts \u2013 both unsuccessful. The first was at a by-election at [[Bosworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bosworth]] in 1927, then at [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in June 1929.<ref>Egremont, p. 114.</ref>\n\n====Carlisle====\nAt the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|General Election]] in October 1931, Spears stood as a National Conservative candidate and was elected Member of Parliament for [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]].<ref>Egremont, p. 124.</ref> In June 1935, [[Ramsay MacDonald]] resigned as Prime Minister of the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] to be succeeded by the Conservative, [[Stanley Baldwin]].

Its members included [[Robert Boothby]], Joshiah Wedgwood and [[Clement Attlee]]. Spears became its chairman in 1936; it would become a focus for those [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] who were suspicious of the European policies of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government.<ref>Egremont, p. 127.</ref>\n\n=== First World War books ===\n''Liaison 1914'', was published in September 1930 with a foreword by [[Winston Churchill]]. This personal account of his experiences as a liaison officer from July to September 1914 was well received. The preface states: 'The object of this book is to contribute something to the true story of the war, and to vindicate the role of the British Expeditionary Force in 1914.'<ref>''Liaison 1914'', Author's Preface to the First Edition, Cassell 1999, xxxi.</ref> As far as the French were concerned, [[Charles Lanrezac]] came in for heavy criticism but there was praise for Marshals [[Franchet d'Esperey]] and [[Joseph Joffre]]. On the British side, Spears wrote favourably of [[George Macdonogh|General Macdonough]], who, as a colonel, had recruited him for military intelligence in 1909, and of Field Marshal Sir John French. ''Liaison 1914'' describes vividly the horrors of war \u2013 the shoeless refugees, the loss of comrades and the devastated landscape. Two years later, a French translation was also successful, the only dissent coming from the son of General Lanrezac, who denied Spears' account of his father's rudeness to Sir John French. The French politician [[Paul Reynaud]], who would later serve briefly as Prime Minister of France from 21 March to 16 June 1940, took the book as an illustration of how France must not allow herself to become separated from Britain. ''Liaison 1914'' was published again in the USA in May 1931 and received high praise.<ref>Egremont, pp. 24, 119\u2013120, 123, 125.</ref>\n\nIn 1939 Spears published ''Prelude to Victory'', an account of the early months of 1917, containing a famous account of the Calais Conference in which Lloyd George had attempted to place the British forces under the command of General [[Robert Nivelle|Nivelle]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]]. With war looming once again, Spears wrote that given time constraints he had chosen to concentrate on the period with the greatest lessons for Anglo-French relations. The book also contains a foreword by [[Winston Churchill]], stating that Spears had not, in his view, been entirely fair to Lloyd George's wish to see Britain abstain from major offensives until the Americans were present in force.<ref>Spears 1939, pp. 11, 15.</ref>\n\n=== Opposes appeasement ===\nSpears became a member of the so-called 'Eden Group' of anti-[[appeasement]] [[backbench]] MPs. This group, known disparagingly by the Conservative [[whip (politics)|whips]] as 'The Glamour Boys', formed around [[Anthony Eden]] when he had resigned as Foreign Secretary in February 1938 in protest at the opening of negotiations with Italy by the Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Given his long-standing friendship with [[Winston Churchill]], it was not surprising that Spears also joined the latter's group of anti-appeasers, known as 'The Old Guard'. Both groups called for rearmament in the face of [[Nazism|Nazi]] threats.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | title = Oxford DNB\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | year = 2006\n  | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/public/themes/95/95077.html\n  | accessdate =  25 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Eve of war ===\nIn August 1939, with war looming, Spears accompanied Winston Churchill to eastern France on a visit to the [[Maginot Line]]. In [[Strasbourg]], he had the idea of floating mines linked together by cables down the [[Rhine]] \u2013 an action to be carried out on the declaration of war to damage bridges. Initially sceptical about the plan, Churchill would later approve it under the code name of [[Operation Royal Marine]], but claim that it had been his own idea.<ref name=Spears>{{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |title= Prelude to Dunkirk |year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London| page =10 }}</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n\n=== Phoney War ===\nDuring the [[Phoney War]], Spears favoured a [[hawkish]] policy; lamenting that Britain and France were not doing 'anything more warlike than dropping leaflets'. He urged active support for the Poles and wanted Germany to be bombed; he was set to speak in the House in this vein but was dissuaded \u2013 much to his later regret.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nAs Chairman of the Anglo-French Committee of the House of Commons, he fostered links with his friends across the Channel, and in October 1939 led a delegation of MPs on a visit to the [[Chamber of Deputies of France]] when they were taken to the [[Maginot Line]].<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, p. 38.</ref>\n\nFour months later, Spears was sent to France to check on [[Operation Royal Marine]] for Winston Churchill, returning with him in April. Thousands of mines were to be released into the Rhine by the Royal Navy to destroy bridges and disrupt river traffic. The operation was vetoed by the French for fear of reprisals, but a postponement was finally agreed.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 96\u201399, 73, 101.</ref>\n\nOn 10 May 1940, [[Operation Royal Marine]] was launched, producing the results that Spears had prophesied. However, by then the German blitzkrieg was underway and the success, as Churchill noted, was lost in the 'deluge of disaster' that was the fall of France.<ref>\n{{cite news\n  | title = Rear-Admiral Roger Wellby (obituary)\n  | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph\n  | date = 3 December 2003\n  | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/12/04/db0401.xml\n  | accessdate =  11 April 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Churchill's Personal Representative to the French Prime Minister ===\n\n====Spears leaves for Paris====\nOn 22 May 1940, Spears was summoned to [[10 Downing Street]]. With British and French forces retreating before the German [[Blitzkrieg]], and confused and contradictory reports arriving from across the Channel, Winston Churchill had decided to send Spears as his personal representative to [[Paul Reynaud]], the Prime Minister of France, who was also acting as Minister of Defence. Three days later, having managed to find the various pieces of his uniform which he had not worn since leaving the army in 1919, he left by plane for Paris holding the rank of major general.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 153\u2013154, 176.</ref>\n\n====Doubts about P\u00e9tain====\nDuring the chaos and confusion of the allied retreat, Spears continued to meet senior French political and military figures. He put forward the view that tanks could be halted by blowing up buildings; he also urged that [[prefects]] should not leave their [[departments of France|departments]] without first ensuring that all petrol had been destroyed. On 26 May, he met Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]; the old man reminisced about their time together during the First World War and 'treated him like a son'. Yet it seemed that the Marshal 'in his great age, epitomised the paralysis of the French people'. He became aware of the difficulties of re-creating a liaison organisation; in 1917 his mission had been established over several years. Starting again from scratch, the task seemed 'as impossible as to recall the dead'.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 219, 224, 234.</ref>\n\n====Weygand's pessimism and Belgian capitulation====\nDuring a visit to London on Sunday 26 May, the French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] had reported to Churchill the view of the new Commander-in-Chief General [[Maxime Weygand]] that the struggle had become hopeless. On 27 May, Churchill demanded an immediate report from Spears, who was told to resist such defeatism. Reynaud referred to 'mortal danger' with reference to a possible attack by the Italians, who had not yet entered the war; Spears' view was that the French army in the Alps was strong and that the only danger from the Italians would be if they interfered with the transport of troops from North Africa. Yet perversely, Italian intervention might be good for allied morale: 'our combined fleets would whip them around the Mediterranean'. Reynaud and Spears argued, the former calling for more British air support, the latter, exasperated, asking, \"Why don't you import Finns and Spaniards to show the people how to resist an invader?\" <ref>A reference to the spirited resistance of Finland to the Russian invasion of November 1939 in the [[Winter War]], and that of the [[Guerrilla warfare in the Peninsular War|Spanish guerrillas]] to [[Napoleon]].</ref> He went on to compare unfavourably the spirit of Paris in 1940 with that which he had known in 1914. That evening, Spears and the British Ambassador were summoned to the Ministry of War \u2013 news of the sudden Belgian surrender had infuriated Reynaud, P\u00e9tain and Weygand; Spears was briefly encouraged, but then irritated by Weygand's criticism of [[Lord Gort]], the commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. At the end of the day, Spears noted that he 'sensed a break in the relationship between the two nations; they were 'no longer one'.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 237\u2013239, 244\u2013251.</ref>\n\n====Invasion of Britain could be repulsed====\nOn 28 May, Reynaud asked the British Ambassador, Sir [[Ronald Hugh Campbell]] and Spears for their view regarding a direct appeal for help to the USA. Sir Ronald declined to comment, but Spears said it had no chance of success; America would not declare war overnight and, in any case, it was not within the President's power. The prospect of an attempted German invasion across the Channel was of some comfort to Reynaud for it would give the French breathing space. Far from feeling intimidated, Spears welcomed the prospect: 'it did not even occur to me that we could not deal successfully with an attempted invasion. It would be wonderful indeed if the Nazi forces ventured on our own element, the sea'. During a discussion with [[Georges Mandel]] (Interior Minister, and one of the few hawks in the French Cabinet), he was told that [[Lebrun]], the President of the Republic was weeping with despair. Mandel reported the criticism of Weygand and General [[Joseph Vuillemin]] (Commander of the French air force) over insufficient British air support; Vuillemin doubted that his air force could withstand the losses it was sustaining.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 253, 261\u2013263.</ref>\n\n====Discussions about Dunkirk, Narvik and Italy at Supreme War Council in Paris====\nOn 31 May 1940, Churchill flew to Paris with Clement Attlee and Generals [[John Dill]] ([[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]]) and [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|\"Pug\" Ismay]] for a meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]]<ref name=Jackson>{{cite book |last= Jackson |first= Julian |title= The Fall of France: The Nazi Invasion of 1940|year=2004|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 9780192805508| page =82 }}</ref> to discuss the deteriorating military situation with a French delegation consisting of Reynaud, P\u00e9tain and Weygand. Three main points were considered: [[Narvik]], the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the prospect of an [[Italian invasion of France]]. Spears did not take part in the discussions but was present 'taking voluminous notes'. It was agreed that British and French forces at Narvik be evacuated without delay \u2013 France urgently needed the manpower. Spears was impressed with the way that Churchill dominated the meeting. Dunkirk was the main topic, the French pointing out that 'out of 200,000 British 150,000 had been evacuated, whereas out of 200,000 Frenchmen only 15,000 had been taken off'. Churchill promised that now British and French soldiers would leave together 'bras dessus, bras dessous' \u2013 arm in arm. Italian entry into the war seemed imminent, with Churchill urging the bombing of the industrial north by British aircraft based in southern France while at the same time trying to gauge whether the French feared retaliation. Spears guessed that he was trying to assess the French will to fight. With the agenda completed, Churchill spoke passionately about the need for the two countries to fight on, or 'they would be reduced to the status of slaves for ever'. Spears was moved 'by the emotion that surged from Winston Churchill in great torrents'.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 253, 292\u2013314.</ref>\n\nDuring discussions after the meeting, a group formed around Churchill, P\u00e9tain and Spears. One of the French officials mentioned the possibility of France seeking a separate peace. Speaking to P\u00e9tain, Spears pointed out that such an event would provoke a blockade of France by Britain and the bombardment of all French ports in German hands. Churchill declared that Britain would fight on whatever happened.<ref>Egremont, p. 170.</ref>\n\n====Returns to London with message for Churchill====\n[[File:De havilland DH95 Flamingo.jpg|thumb|right|The [[de Havilland Flamingo]] transport aircraft. Churchill's personal Flamingo, in which he flew to and from France during the crisis of May and June 1940, was operated by [[No. XXIV Squadron RAF]].]]On 7 June, with the Germans advancing on Paris, Spears flew to London in Churchill's personal aircraft bearing a personal message from Reynaud to the British Prime Minister. The French were requesting British divisions, and fighter squadrons to be based in France. In reply, Spears had inquired how many French troops were being transferred from North Africa. In London, he was asked whether the French would, as Cl\u00e9menceau had said, \"Fight outside Paris, inside Paris, behind Paris.\"  His view was that they would not permit the destruction of that beautiful city, but this was contradicted on 11 June by a French government spokesman who told the ''Daily Telegraph'' that Paris would never be declared an open city. (The following day General Weygand issued orders declaring that the capital was not to be defended.)<ref name=\"The Fall of France\">{{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |title= The Fall of France |year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London| pages =110\u2013123, 148}}</ref>\n\n====Accompanies Churchill to conference at Briare====\n[[File:Chateau muguet breteau 45 retouche.jpg|thumb|left|Chateau du Muguet at Briare, HQ of General Weygand and venue of the conference on 11 June 1940]] On 11 June, Spears returned to France with Churchill, Eden, Generals Dill and Ismay and other staff officers. A meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]] had been arranged with Reynaud, who had been forced to leave Paris, at [[Briare]] near Orleans, which was now the HQ of General Weygand. Also present was General [[Charles de Gaulle]]; Spears had not met him before and was impressed with his bearing. As wrangling continued over the level of support from Britain, Spears suddenly became aware that 'the battle of France was over and that no one believed in miracles'. The next day Weygand's catastrophic account of the military situation reinforced his pessimism. Despite assurances from Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the British were worried that the powerful French fleet might fall into German hands. With the conference drawing to a close, it dawned on Spears that the two countries were 'within sight of a cross-roads at which the destinies of the two nations might divide'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 137\u2013171.</ref>\n\n====Spears argues with P\u00e9tain \u2013 departure for Tours====\nHe remained at Briare after Churchill had left for London on 12 June; later that day he argued with Marshal P\u00e9tain, who maintained that an armistice with Germany was now inevitable, complaining that the British had left France to fight alone. Spears referred to Churchill's words of defiance at the meeting, feeling that some of the French might remain in the struggle if they could be made to believe that Britain would fight on. The Marshal replied, \"You cannot beat Hitler with words.\" He began to feel estrangement from P\u00e9tain, whose attitude, for the first time in their relationship, savoured of hostility. His concern was now to link up with the Ambassador, [[Sir Ronald Hugh Campbell]], and he set out by car for [[Tours]]. On the way they drove through crowds of refugees, many of whom had become stranded when their cars ran out of fuel. At the Chateau de Chissey high above the River Cher, he found Reynaud and his ministers struggling to govern France, but with insufficient telephone lines and in makeshift accommodation. Again he met de Gaulle, 'whose courage was keen and clear, born of love of, and inspired by, his country'. Later in the day, he heard to his astonishment that Reynaud had left for Tours because Churchill was flying over for another meeting. In the confusion, neither Spears nor Sir Ronald had been informed. Fearful that he might not arrive in time, he set off at once along roads choked with refugees.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 172\u2013197.</ref>\n\n====Last-ditch talks at Tours====\n[[File:Prefecture Tours.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Pr\u00e9fecture at Tours \u2013 scene of crisis talks.]] What would prove to be the final meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]] took place at the [[Pr\u00e9fecture]] in Tours on 13 June. When Spears arrived, the British delegation \u2013 Churchill, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], Sir [[Alexander Cadogan]] and General 'Pug' Ismay \u2013 were already there. The French Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, was accompanied by [[Paul Baudoin]], a member of the War Committee. Spears found the atmosphere quite different from that at Briare, where Churchill had expressed good will, sympathy and sorrow; now it was like a business meeting, with the British keenly appraising the situation from its own point of view. Reynaud declared that unless immediate help was assured by the USA, the French government would have to give up the struggle. He acknowledged that the two countries had agreed never to conclude a separate peace<ref>At a meeting of the [[Anglo French Supreme War Council]] held in London on 28 March 1940.</ref> \u2013 but France was physically incapable of carrying on. The news was received by the British with shock and horror; Spears' feelings were expressed by the exclamation marks which he scrawled in his notes. Spears noted Churchill's determination as he said, \"We must fight, we will fight, and that is why we must ask our friends to fight on.\" Prime Minister Reynaud acknowledged that Britain would continue the war, affirming that France would also continue the struggle from North Africa, if necessary \u2013 but only if there were a chance of success. That success could come only if America were prepared to join the fray. The French leader called for British understanding, asking again for France to be released from her obligation not to conclude a separate peace now that she could do no more. Spears passed a note to Churchill proposing an adjournment \u2013 a suggestion that was taken up.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 199\u2013213.</ref>\n\nThe British walked around the sodden garden of the prefecture, Spears reporting that Reynaud's mood had changed since that morning, when he had spoken of his resistance to the 'armisticers'. He told Churchill that he was certain that de Gaulle was staunch, but that General Weygand looked upon anyone who wished to fight as an enemy. Beaverbrook urged Churchill to repeat what he had already said \u2013 namely that U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] be telegraphed and American help sought. When the proceedings were resumed, it was agreed that both countries would send identical telegrams. It was on this note that the conference ended.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 214\u2013218.</ref>\n\n[[File:dragon rapide g-aeml flying arp.jpg|thumb|right|Spears and de Gaulle flew from Bordeaux to England via Jersey in a [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide|Dragon Rapide]]. There was some dispute after the war as to whether the aircraft had been at the command of Spears or of de Gaulle; the matter has never been satisfactorily resolved.<ref>Egremont, pp. 310\u2013302.</ref>]]\n\n====Linguistic misunderstanding====\nAfter the meeting, de Gaulle told Spears that Paul Baudoin had been telling journalists that Churchill had said that \"he would understand if France concluded a separate armistice\" ... ''\"que l'Angleterre comprendrait si la France faisait un armistice et une paix s\u00e9par\u00e9e''\". Spears realised there had been a linguistic misunderstanding. When Reynaud spoke (in French) about a separate armistice, Churchill had said, ''\"Je comprends\"'' (I understand) in the sense of 'I understand what you say', not in the sense of 'I agree'. Just as Churchill was about to take off for Britain, Spears obtained his assurance that he had never given consent to a separate armistice. But the damage had been done and, on 23 June, the words would be quoted by [[Admiral Darlan]], who signalled all French warships saying that the British Prime Minister had declared that 'he understood' the necessity for France to bring the struggle to an end'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 218\u2013220.</ref>\n\n====Churchill fails to address French cabinet====\nThe day ended in confusion \u2013 Churchill flew back to London without speaking to the French cabinet, as had been promised by Reynaud. The ministers were dismayed and angry; Spears was depressed, realising that 'an opportunity that might not recur had been missed'. He was at a loss to understand why a meeting had not taken place \u2013 had Reynaud simply forgotten? Did Reynaud wish to explain the situation to the ministers himself? In any event, his ministers were disillusioned and felt abandoned. Spears believed that this event played its part in swaying the majority of the cabinet towards surrender. He was sure that 'by the night of 13 June, the possibility of France remaining in the war had almost disappeared'. The only hope rested on the decision of President Roosevelt \u2013 would America now join the war?<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 221\u2013234.</ref>\n\n====End game at Bordeaux \u2013 London offers a Franco-British Union====\nOn 14 June, Spears left Tours to look for Reynaud and his government, which had moved to [[Bordeaux]]. On the way, he was conscious that the attitude of people to the sight of a British uniform had changed \u2013 they were morose if not hostile. When he reached Bordeaux, he learnt that Paris had fallen that morning. Spears found Reynaud \u2013 he had not received a satisfactory reply from Washington but was still clinging to the hope. Spears found him worn out, forlorn and undecided. The British consulate was besieged with crowds of would-be refugees seeking passage out of France.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 235\u2013253.</ref>\n\n====Spears rails against defeatism====\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Camille Chautemps.jpg|thumb|right|Camille Chautemps, Vice-President of the Council in Reynaud's government. Spears railed against his defeatism, commenting sarcastically that 'his sob-impregnated voice would make a stone weep'.]] -->The next day he clashed with [[Camille Chautemps]], Vice-President of the cabinet, upbraiding him for his defeatism and praising the spirit of the French soldiers that he had known during the First World War. He later spoke to [[Roland de Margerie]], Reynaud's ''Chef de cabinet'' and raised the matter of several hundred German pilots who were prisoners of the French, asking that they be handed over to the British. However, there was much confusion and telephone communications were difficult even within the city of Bordeaux itself. Spears now had misgivings about Reynaud's determination to stay in the war, if necessary from French North Africa. He was outraged that despite the critical situation, the French Commander in Chief in North Africa was opposed to receiving troops from France. There was insufficient accommodation, no spare weapons, there was a shortage of doctors; moreover the climate was rather warm for young Frenchmen at this season! In Spears' view this was monstrous; why did Reynaud not dismiss the obstructionist general? He asked why the idea of forming a redoubt in Brittany had been dropped and why Reynaud did not dismiss General Weygand for his defeatism. Margerie replied that the people had faith in Weygand and that he also had the support of P\u00e9tain. Continuing in the same vein, Spears poured cold water on the notion that America might join the war. Spears and the ambassador sent a telegram to London explaining that everything now hung on an assurance from the USA, adding that they would to their utmost to obtain the scuttling of the French fleet. Their final words were, \"We have little confidence in anything now.\" They heard that Marshal P\u00e9tain would resign if American help was not forthcoming; Spears concluded that Reynaud would not continue in the face of combined opposition from the Marshal and Weygand. He longed for the presence of Churchill, which would have been 'worth more than millions in gold could buy'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 246\u2013263.</ref>\n\nSpears and the Ambassador were called following a meeting of the cabinet. The linguistic confusion from Tours returned to haunt them as Reynaud began, \"As Mr Churchill stated at Tours he would agree that France should sue for an armistice....\" Spears stopped writing and objected, \"I cannot take that down for it is untrue.\" The minutes of the Tours meeting were produced and Spears was vindicated. Reynaud wrote a message to Churchill, stating that France sought leave of Britain to inquire about armistice terms; if Britain declined, he would resign. At this point an aide handed him Roosevelt's refusal to declare war \u2013 Reynaud was in despair. He did, however, guarantee that any successor would not surrender the fleet in an armistice. Spears felt sympathy for the French army, but contempt for Weygand, 'a hysterical, egocentric old man'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 263\u2013275.</ref>\n\n====British refusal to allow France to seek a separate peace====\nBy 16 June, Spears and Sir Ronald Campbell were sure that once the French had asked for an armistice they would never fight again. With regard to the French Empire and the fleet, there was a possibility that if German armistice terms were too harsh, the Empire might rebel against them, even if metropolitan France succumbed. It did not occur to them that Hitler would split France into two zones thus dividing it against itself. Early the same morning, Reynaud, nervously exhausted and depressed, asked again for France to be relieved of its undertaking not to make a separate peace. The British took a hard line, pointing out that the solemn undertaking had been drawn up to meet the existing contingency; in any case, France [with its overseas possessions and fleet] was still in a position to carry on. While these top-level discussions were being held, [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Portes]], Reynaud's mistress repeatedly entered the room, much to the irritation of Spears and the Ambassador. Spears felt that her pernicious influence had done Reynaud great harm.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 276\u2013280.</ref><ref>In his diary for 4 March 1941, [[Harold Nicolson]] recalls having dinner with Spears at the Ritz in London. Spears had said that de Portes was passionately anti-British; she believed that Reynaud would become dictator of France and that she would be the power behind the throne. She felt that our democratic ideas would prevent this pattern of state government. She surrounded Reynaud with fifth-columnists and spies. Spears further thought that Reynaud had an inferiority complex due to his small stature; La Comtesse de Portes made him feel tall, grand and powerful. Anyone who urged resistance would be shouted at: 'C'est moi qui suis la ma\u00eetresse ici!' Towards the end of June, after Reynaud had resigned, they were in their car when Reynaud ran into a tree. A suitcase hit her on the back of the neck and she was killed instantly.</ref>\n\n====British acceptance of armistice dependent on fate of French fleet====\nShortly before lunch a telegram arrived from London agreeing that France could seek armistice terms provided that the French fleet was sailed forthwith for British harbours pending negotiations. Spears and the Ambassador felt this would be taken as an insult by the French Navy and an indication of distrust. Reynaud received the news with derision \u2013 if Britain wanted France to continue the war from North Africa, how could they ask her fleet to go to British harbours? He had spoken by telephone with Churchill and asked Spears to arrange a meeting with the British Prime Minister, at sea somewhere off Brittany. The meeting, however, never took place as he preferred to go in a French warship and this never materialised. As the day wore on, Spears became more aware of defeatism \u2013 but the hard-liners tended to be socialists. His British uniform struck a false note and people avoided him.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 282\u2013288.</ref>\n\n====French reject Franco-British Union====\nOn the afternoon of 16 June, Spears and the Ambassador met Reynaud to convey a message from London \u2013 it would be in the interest of both countries for the French fleet to be moved to British ports; it was assumed that every effort would be made to transfer the air force to North Africa or to Britain; Polish, Belgian and Czech troops in France should be sent to North Africa. While they were arguing with increasing acrimony about the fleet, a call came through from de Gaulle, who was in London. The British proposition was nothing less than a Declaration of Union \u2013 'France and Great Britain shall no longer be two nations, but one Franco-British Union. Every citizen of France will enjoy immediate citizenship of Great Britain; every British subject will become a citizen of France.' Spears became 'transfixed with amazement'; Reynaud was exulted. When the news got out, hard-liners such as [[Georges Mandel]] were pleased and relieved. The proposal would be put before the French cabinet. Spears was optimistic that it would be accepted for how could it be that of the countries fighting Germany, France should be the only one to give up the struggle, when she possessed an Empire second only to our own and a fleet whole and entire, the strongest after ours in Europe'. Yet he joked that the only common denominator of an Anglo-French Parliament would be 'an abysmal ignorance of each other's language'!<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 290\u2013294.</ref>\n\nWhile the cabinet meeting was taking place, Spears and the Ambassador heard that Churchill, [[Clement Attlee]], [[Sir Archibald Sinclair]], the three [[Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chiefs of Staff]] and others would arrive off Brittany in a warship the next day at noon for talks with the French. However, the French cabinet rejected the offer of union; Reynaud would be resigning. One minister had commented that the proposal would make France into a British [[Dominion]]. Spears, on the other hand, felt the rejection 'was like stabbing a friend bent over you in grief and affection'. Churchill and his delegation were already in the train at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]], when news of the rejection came through. He returned to [[Downing Street]] 'with a heavy heart'.<ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 296\u2013300.</ref>\n\n====De Gaulle fears arrest====\nIn Bordeaux, Spears and Sir Ronald Campbell went to see Reynaud at his dimly-lit offices. According to Spears, he was approached in the darkness by de Gaulle, who said that Weygand intended to arrest him. Reynaud told the British that P\u00e9tain would be forming a government. Spears noted that it would consist entirely of defeatists and that the French Prime Minister had 'the air of a man relieved of a great burden'. Incredibly Reynaud asked when Churchill would be arriving off Brittany in the morning. Spears was short with him: \"Tomorrow there will be a new government and you will no longer speak for anyone.\"  However, he later came to realise that Reynaud had never double-crossed his ally, but had done his best to hold the alliance while fighting against men stronger than he was. His fault lay in his inability to pick good men. After the meeting, Spears found de Gaulle and decided to help him escape to Britain. He telephoned Churchill and got his somewhat reluctant agreement to bring over both de Gaulle and [[Georges Mandel]]. The latter, however, declined to come, opting instead to go to North Africa. It was arranged that de Gaulle would come to Spears' hotel at 7 o'clock in the morning of the following day.<ref>Egremont (p. 191) notes that Mandel went to North Africa but was sent back to France, where he was murdered in 1944.</ref><ref>''The Fall of France'', pp. 235\u2013318.</ref>\n\n====Spears leaves for Britain with de Gaulle====\nOn 17 June, de Gaulle and his ADC, Lieutenant [[Geoffroy de Courcel]],<ref>See French Wikipedia at [[:fr:Geoffroy Chodron de Courcel]].</ref> went with Spears to the airfield on the pretext of seeing him off. After a delay while de Gaulle's baggage was secured, the [[De Havilland Dragon Rapide|Dragon Rapide]] took off for Britain. Winston Churchill wrote that Spears personally rescued de Gaulle from France just before the German conquest, literally pulling the Frenchman into his plane as it was taking off from Bordeaux for Britain.<ref>{{cite book |author=Winston S.

His part was played down in France, with some accounts suggesting that he had fled fearing for his life because he was Jewish. In ''Charles de Gaulle'' by Eric Roussel (Gaillimard, 2002, p.121), Geoffroy de Courcel is scornful of Spears' description of how he had jumped aboard the taxiing aircraft: 'Courcel, more nimble, was in a trice'. De Courcel comments that this action attributes to him an acrobatic prowess which would, even at that time, have been well beyond his capability. 'C'est m'attribuer des dons acrobatiques dont, m\u00eame \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, j'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 bien incapable.'</ref> When they had reached Britain, de Gaulle gave Spears a signed photograph with the inscription, \"To General Spears, witness, ally, friend.\" <ref>Berthon, p. 80.</ref>\n\n===Spears heads British government's mission to de Gaulle===\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|left|It was Spears who brought Charles de Gaulle to London in 1940, where he would form and lead the Free French.

The attack caused great hostility towards Britain and made it even more difficult for de Gaulle to recruit men to his cause. De Gaulle, while regarding the naval action as 'inevitable', was initially uncertain whether he could still collaborate with Britain. Spears tried to encourage him and at the end of July in an unsuccessful attempt to rally support, flew to the internment camp at Aintree racecourse near Liverpool, where French seamen who had been in British ports were taken as part of Operation Catapult.<ref>Egremont, pp. 197\u2013200.</ref> In the event, de Gaulle had only some 1,300 men at his disposal in Britain, the majority being those who had recently been evacuated from Narvik following the [[Norwegian Campaign]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Les Fran\u00e7ais libres \n |publisher=Fondation de la France Libre \n |year=2003 \n |url=http://www.concours-resistance.org/pdf/cnrd_2004_complet.pdf \n |accessdate=30 March 2008 \n |format=PDF \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724073730/http://www.concours-resistance.org/pdf/cnrd_2004_complet.pdf \n |archivedate=24 July 2008  \n}}</ref>\n\n==== Dakar \u2013 Operation Menace ====\nWinston Churchill pressed for action by the Free French to turn French colonies from Vichy. [[File:General Spears and General de Gaulle.jpg|thumb|left|Spears and de Gaulle en route for Dakar in September 1940 aboard the Dutch liner, ''Westernland''.]] The target was [[Dakar]] in West Africa; the main reason being that it could become a base threatening shipping in the Atlantic. A show of force by the Royal Navy was planned coupled with a landing by de Gaulle's troops which, it was hoped, would convince the Vichy defenders to defect. Spears accompanied de Gaulle on the mission, [[Operation Menace]], with orders to report directly to the Prime Minister. However, security had been lax and the destination was said to be common talk among French troops in London.<ref>Egremont, pp. 201\u2013204.</ref>\n\nWhile the task force was en route, it came in sight of a French fleet \u2013 including three cruisers \u2013 on its way from [[Toulon]] to [[Douala]] to recapture French Equatorial Africa which had declared for de Gaulle. Surprised, the French fleet sailed for Dakar instead, thus making the outcome of the expedition much more uncertain.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''De Gaulle'', Seuil, 2010 (1984) vol 1, pp. 437\u2013438.</ref> Churchill was now of the opinion that the project should be abandoned, but de Gaulle insisted and a telegram from Spears to the Prime Minister stated, \"I wish to insist to you personally and formally that the plan for the constitution of French Africa through Dakar should be upheld and carried out.\"<ref>Egremont, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref>\n\nOn 23 September 1940, a landing by de Gaulle's troops was repulsed and, in the ensuing naval engagement, four British [[capital ships]] were damaged while the Vichy French lost two destroyers and a submarine. Finally Churchill ordered the operation to be called off. The Free French had been snubbed by their countrymen; de Gaulle and Spears were deeply depressed, the latter fearing for his own reputation \u2013 and rightly so. The ''Daily Mirror'' wrote: \u201cDakar has claims to rank with the lowest depths of imbecility to which we have yet sunk.\u201d De Gaulle was further discredited with the Americans and began to criticise Spears openly, telling Churchill that he was 'intelligent but egotistical and hampering because of his unpopularity at the War Office etc'.<ref>Egremont, pp. 214, 216.</ref> John Colville, Churchill's private secretary, wrote on 27 October 1940, \u201cIt is true that Spears' emphatic telegrams persuaded the Cabinet to revert to the Dakar scheme after it had, on the advice of the Chiefs of Staff, been abandoned.\u201d <ref name=\"colville\">{{cite book |last= Colville |first= John |title= The Fringes of Power \u2013 10 Downing Street Diaries 1939\u20131955 |year= 1985 |publisher= Hodder and Stoughton |location= London |isbn= 0-393-02223-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/fringesofpower1000colv/page/277 277] |url= https://archive.org/details/fringesofpower1000colv/page/277 }}</ref>\n\n=== De Gaulle and Spears in the Levant ===\n[[File:Flag of Free France (1940-1944).svg|thumb|right|The French flag with the [[Cross of Lorraine]], emblem of the Free French.]]Still acting as Churchill's personal representative to the Free French, Spears left England with de Gaulle for the [[Levant]] via Cairo in March 1941. They were received by British officers, including General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the British Commander in Chief Middle East, and also General [[Georges Catroux]], the former Governor General of French [[Indo-China]], who had been relieved of his post by the [[Vichy France]] regime of Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]].<ref name=\"fulfilment\">{{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward|title= Fulfilment of a Mission |year= 1977 |publisher= Leo Cooper|location= London|isbn= 0-85052-234-X |page= 6 }}</ref>\n\nWavell, the British [[Commander-in-Chief]], wanted to negotiate with the Governor of [[French Somaliland]], which was still loyal to Vichy France, and lift the blockade of that territory in exchange for the right to send supplies to British forces in [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]] via the railway from the coast to [[Addis Ababa]]. However, de Gaulle and Spears argued in favour of firmness, the former arguing that a detachment of his [[Free French]] should be sent to confront the Vichy troops in the hope that the latter would be persuaded to change sides. Wavell agreed, but was later overruled by [[Anthony Eden]], who feared an open clash between the two French factions. British vacillations persisted against the advice of Spears and to the extreme irritation of de Gaulle.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 11\u201313.</ref>\n\n==== Syria and Lebanon ====\nMore serious differences between Britain and de Gaulle soon emerged over [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. De Gaulle and Spears held that it was essential to deny the Germans access to Vichy air bases in Syria from where they would threaten the [[Suez Canal]]. However, Wavell was reluctant to stretch his limited forces and did not want to risk a clash with the French in Syria.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 61\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe French in Syria had initially been in favour of continuing the struggle against Germany but had been snubbed by Wavell, who declined the offer of cooperation from three French divisions. By the time de Gaulle reached the Levant, Vichy had replaced any Frenchmen who were sympathetic towards Britain.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 15, 25.</ref>\n\nHaving left the Middle East with de Gaulle on a visit to [[French Equatorial Africa]], Spears had his first major row with the general who, in a fit of pique caused by 'some quite minor action by the British government', suddenly declared that the landing ground at [[Fort Lamy]] would no longer be available to British aircraft transiting Africa. Spears countered furiously by threatening to summon up British troops to take over the aerodrome and the matter blew over.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\nDe Gaulle told Spears that the Vichy authorities in the Middle East were acting against the Free French and the British. French ships blockaded by the British at [[Alexandria]] were permitted to transmit coded messages which were anything but helpful to the British cause. Their crews were allowed to take leave in the [[Levant]] States where they stoked up anti-British feeling. They also brought back information about British naval and troop movements which would find its way back to Vichy. In ''Fulfilment of a Mission'' Spears writes bitterly about how Britain was providing pay for Vichy sailors who were allowed to remit money back to France. Their pay would, of course, be forfeited if they joined de Gaulle. However, his biggest bone of contention \u2013 one over which he frequently clashed with the [[Foreign Office]] and the [[Admiralty]] \u2013 was that a French ship, ''SS Providence'', was allowed to sail unchallenged between [[Beirut]] and [[Marseille]]. It carried contraband 'and a living cargo of French soldiers and officials [prisoners] who were well disposed to us or who wished to continue the fight at our side'.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 21\u201322.</ref> [[File:Flag of Philippe P\u00e9tain, Chief of State of Vichy France.svg|thumb|right|Presidential standard of the collaborationist Vichy Regime]]\n\nDe Gaulle and Spears held the view that the British at [[Headquarters|GHQ]] in Cairo were unwilling to accept that they had been duped over the level of collaboration between Germany and the Vichy-controlled states in the Levant. The British military authorities feared that a blockade of the Levant would cause hardship and thus antagonise the civilian population. However, Spears pointed out that the Vichy French were already unpopular with the local population \u2013 ordinary people resented being lorded over by defeated foreigners. He urged aggressive propaganda aimed at the Vichy French in support of the Free French and British policy. He felt that the Free French would be considered as something different as they were allies of Britain and enjoyed the dignity of fighting their enemy instead of submitting to him.<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 26, 33.</ref>\n\nOn 13 May 1941, the fears of de Gaulle and Spears were realised when German aircraft landed in Syria in support of the Iraqi rebel [[Rashid Ali]], who was opposed to the pro-British government. On 8 June, 30,000 troops (Indian Army, British, Australian, Free French and the Trans-Jordanian Frontier Force) invaded Lebanon and Syria in what was known as [[Operation Exporter]]. There was stiff resistance from the Vichy French and Spears commented bitterly on 'that strange class of Frenchmen who had developed a vigour in defeat which had not been apparent when they were defending their country'.<ref>Egremont, pp. 225\u2013226.</ref>\n\nSpears soon became aware of the poor liaison which existed between the British Embassy in Cairo, the armed forces, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Sudan]]. The arrival in Cairo in July 1941 of [[Oliver Lyttelton]], who was a Minister of State and a member of the War Cabinet, improved matters considerably. The Middle East Defence Council was also formed \u2013 a body that Spears would later join.<ref>Egremont, pp. 21, 111.</ref>\n\nIn January 1942, having received the title of [[KBE]], Spears was appointed the first British minister to Syria and Lebanon. Beirut still holds his name on one of its major streets, [[Rue Spears]].<ref name=XDNB/>\n\n== Later life ==\nSpears lost his parliamentary seat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 General Election]], which saw the Conservative Party defeated in a landslide. The same year he accepted the position of chairman of the commercial firm Ashanti Goldfields. From 1948 to 1966 he was chairman of the Institute of Directors, frequently visiting West Africa. Spears published several books during the post-war period: ''Assignment to Catastrophe'' (1954);. ''Two Men who Saved France'' (1966), and his own autobiography, ''The Picnic Basket'' (1967).\n\nSpears was created a [[baronet]], of [[Warfield]], Berkshire, on 30 June 1953. He died on 27 January 1974 at the age of 87 at the [[Heatherwood Hospital]] at [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]].<ref name=XDNB>\n{{cite web\n  | title =Spears, Sir Edward Louis, baronet (1886\u20131974)\n  | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | year = 2004 |edition = online January 2008\n  | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31706\n  | accessdate =  16 August 2009}}</ref>\nA memorial service at [[St. Margaret's, Westminster]] followed on 7 March. The trumpeters of the 11th Hussars sounded a fanfare; the French and Lebanese ambassadors were in attendance. General Sir Edward Louis Spears lies buried at Warfield alongside the graves of his first wife, May, and his son, Michael.<ref>Egremont, p. 316.</ref>\n\n== Tragedy of his life ==\nIn the foreword to ''Fulfilment of a Mission'', the account by Spears of his service in the Levant, [[John Terraine]], writes of 'the tragedy of his life'. By this he meant that someone who should have been a warm friend of de Gaulle had become an intractable and spiteful enemy. His boyhood had been spent in France. He was happy in France, he liked the spirit of the people. He liked the sailors of Brittany and the peasants of Burgundy. He understood their wit. It amused him to talk to them and to be with them. It had been a very bitter experience to find himself opposed and having to oppose French policy so often. That, he said, had been the tragedy of his life. Terraine comments further, \"If Mr [[Graham Greene]] had not already made good use of it, the title of ''Fulfilment of a Mission'' might just as well have been, ''The End of an Affair.\"<ref>''Fulfilment of a Mission'' \u2013 Spears, p. ix.</ref>\n\n== Linguistic competence ==\nIn October 1939, he led a delegation of British MPs to France and spoke on French Radio. After the broadcast, listeners protested that his speech had been read for him because 'an Englishman without an accent did not exist'!<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, p. 46.</ref> In February 1940, he gave a lecture on the British war effort to a large and distinguished audience in Paris. Fluent though he was, he nevertheless felt it would be helpful to attend lessons with an elocution teacher who coached leading French actors.<ref>''Prelude to Dunkirk'' \u2013 Spears, p. 72.</ref> It must be supposed that he also spoke some German thanks to the two years which he had spent at a boarding school in Germany.<ref>Egremont, p. 6.</ref>\n\nDespite his linguistic competence, Spears hated interpreting. He realised that it required qualifications beyond a mere knowledge of two languages. At the conference at Tours on 13 June 1940, he had the awesome responsibility of translating Paul Reynaud's French into English and Winston Churchill's English into French. The final phase of the Battle of France and the destiny of two nations were at stake; it promised to be the gravest of the meetings so far held between the two governments. Furthermore, he was aware that others in the room were completely conversant with both languages and that most of them would have thought of the word that he was searching for before he had found it.<ref>''The Fall of France'' \u2013 Spears, pp. 201\u2013202.</ref>\n\n== Media ==\nSir Edward Spears appears as an interviewee in numerous episodes of the 1964 documentary series ''[[The Great War (documentary)|The Great War]]'', especially in reference to the major roles he played as liaison to the French [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth Army]] in the episodes ''Our hats we doff to General Joffre'', detailing the [[Great Retreat]] to the Marne and ''This business may last a long time'', detailing the First Battle of the Marne and the subsequent [[Race to the Sea]]. He appeared in the 1969 French documentary ''[[The Sorrow and the Pity]]''. He also appeared near the end of his life, in the episode \"[[France Falls]]\" of the landmark 1974 documentary series, ''[[The World at War]]''.\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last= Berthon|first=Simon|title=Allies at War|year=2001|publisher= HarperCollins|location=London|isbn=0-00-711622-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last= Borden|first=Mary|title=Journey down a Blind Alley|year=1946|publisher= Hutchinson & Co|location= London }}\n* {{cite book |last= Churchill |first= Winston S. |authorlink=  |title= Their Finest Hour |url= https://archive.org/details/theirfinesthour00chur |url-access= registration |year=1949|publisher= Houghton Mifflin }}\n* {{cite book |last= Colville |first= John |authorlink=  |title= The Fringes of Power \u2013 10 Downing Street Diaries 1939\u20131955 |year= 1985 |publisher= Hodder and Stoughton |location= London |isbn= 0-393-02223-4 |url= https://archive.org/details/fringesofpower1000colv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Egremont |first= Max |authorlink=  |title= Under two Flags |year=1997 |publisher= Phoenix, Orion Books |location= London |isbn=0-7538-0147-7}}\n* {{cite book |last= Gilbert |first= Martin |authorlink=  |title= The Day the War Ended |year= 1995 |publisher= HarperCollins |location= London |isbn= 0-00-255597-2 |url= https://archive.org/details/daywarendedveday0000gilb }}\n* {{cite book |last= Nicolson |first= Harold |title= Diaries and Letters, 1939\u20131945 |url= https://archive.org/details/diariesletters0000nico |url-access= registration |year=1967 |publisher= Collins |location= London}}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Liaison 1914 |origyear=1930|year=1999|publisher= Eyre & Spottiswood |location= London|isbn=0-304-35228-4}}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Prelude to Victory|year=1939|publisher= Jonathan Cape |location= London |edition=online |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.503332 |accessdate=13 May 2017 |oclc=459267081}}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Prelude to Dunkirk (Part 1 of [[Assignment to Catastrophe]])|year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London }}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= The Fall of France (Part 2 of Assignment to Catastrophe)|year=1954|publisher= Heinemann |location= London }}\n* {{cite book |last= Spears |first= Sir Edward |authorlink=  |title= Fulfilment of a Mission |year=1977|publisher= Leo Cooper |location= London |isbn= 0-85052-234-X }}\n\n==Notes and sources==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.
