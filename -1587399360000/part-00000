Pelger'', with a [[funding]] capital of 40 [[Dutch guilder]]s The company started at the Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current [[electric motor]] repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, as a result of the [[direct current]] power supply instead of [[alternating current]] supply in these early days of [[Electrical grid|electric grid]]. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a [[centrifugal fan]]''',''' [[Electromagnetic brake|brake]] motors and [[Induction motor|small induction]] motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam.  Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical engineer]] of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. [[patent]]<nowiki/>s were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the [[centrifugal switch]], the [[centrifugal fan]] housing and the principle of a [[squirrel-cage rotor]]. The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a [[factory]] designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.\n\n=== Heinke & Schuitema Musselkanaal ===\n[[File:Locatie plaats Stadskanaal.png|thumb|Musselkanaal region]]\nThe company Heinke en Schuitema Musselkanaal (HSM) was founded on 1 March 1933 by Mr. ''Konrad W. Heinke'' and Mr. ''Etsko Schuitema'' as a company to manufacture and repair of electric machines. In 1935 per coincidence contact was made with Mr. G. Ph. van Gelder,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ir. J.W.

The company was not performing very well and financially in trouble deep. Contact was made with this factory and as a result the company was bought, as well as the inventory and 5 employees moved to Rotterdam. Mr. Schuitema continues the company under E. Schuitema repair company of electric machines, which ends in 1947 as a result of his death. Mr. Heinke keeps all rights on the [[casting]] patterns, which are based at: {{ill|N.V. Asselbergs' IJzerindustrie en Handelsmaatschappij IJzergieterijen|nl|Gieterij Asselbergs|vertical-align=sup}}, {{ill|N.V. Nederlandsche IJzergieterij Vulcanus|nl|Vulcanus (fabriek)|vertical-align=sup}} en de {{ill|N.V. Twentsche Metaal- en IJzergieterij|nl|Twentsche IJzergieterij|vertical-align=sup}}.In 1936 the manufacturing and series production at the Pelger factory started. Mr. Heinke initiated further development and introduction of new models. Mr. van Gelder kept the sole distribution rights for the products. The sales and distribution of the products therefore stayed until World War II with Mr. van Gelder's company, Firma G. Ph. van Gelder in [[Overschie]]. After [[World War II]] a new sales organization was set up: Van Gelder & Pelger. On 9 June 1950 the company Pelger N.V. was founded with a funding capital of 500.000,-- Dutch guilders. In 1951 it was decided the sales and distribution of the produced goods would be done by the company Pelger itself, by means a separate sales office located at the Groenendaal 25 in Rotterdam.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAt the beginning of [[World War II]], the company had a narrow escape during the [[Rotterdam Blitz]], or bombing of Rotterdam. The limit of the burned down zone ([[Dutch language|Dutch substantive]]: brandgrens<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brandgrens.nl/en/home|title=Fire Wall Rotterdam Blitz|date=14 May 1940|website=www.brandgrens.nl}}</ref>) came very close to the factory, located at the Van Speykstraat 102. During World War II under the occupation of the German Regime the factory continued to work almost up to the end of the war. Mr. van Gelder had to end the cooperation on behalf of German orders received and went into hiding and stayed under cover. Also the name of the trade company Firma G.Ph. van Gelder could no longer be used and was replaced by Handelsonderneming H.S.M.-HOLLAND.In 1941 the factory was declared as enemy of the Germany Regime and in 1943 the factory was forced to work for the German industry. The company {{ill|Elin Schorch Reydt|de|ELIN|vertical-align=sup}} (the so-called {{ill|Patenschaft|de|vertical-align=sup}}) raised an order to manufacture refrigerator motors for the company {{ill|Alfred Teves|de|vertical-align=sup}}. The production of the motors was sabotaged by the employees and management, endangering personal lives. On 1st 1944 in small committee the 25 anniversary of the company was celebrated. A few days later during the Rotterdam Razzia<ref>[[:nl:Razzia van Rotterdam|De razzia van Rotterdam, 1951]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2020}}</ref> (or [[Roundup (history)|Roundup]]) on 6 November 1944 all the raw materials were collected from the factory and on 10 November all the machinery were collected and transported to Germany. Mr. Heinke who had German roots and [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] sympathies, had gained the title of R\u00fcstung-Inspektor der R\u00fcstung und Kriegsprodukten in the Netherlands, assisted the transport. Mr. Heinke wanted to continue the development of the [[Repulsion motor|repulsion]] motor, on which a patent was [[Patent pending|pending]] for his own account. Mr. J. Vos an employee of the company and Head of the test laboratory was put to work as a forced laborer in [[Zwickau]]. After the war Mr. Vos managed to find the machinery taken from the Pelger factory, as he stayed in contact with Mr. Heinke. He found the maschinery were stored at the Tischlerei Max Siegert in Frankhausen, also Mr. Heinke's former home. The machinery which were in the possession of Mr. Heinke's widow, as Mr. K.W. Heinke passed away shortly after the war. The machinery were officially confiscated by the American Occupation Authorities in [[Crimmitschau]] and were brought back to the Netherlands.\n\n=== Emmen ===\n[[File:LocatieEmmen.png|alt=|thumb|Emmen region]]\nAfter moving premises within Rotterdam a couple of times to larger facilities, in 1957 the factory moved from the city of Rotterdam to the town of [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]]. The factory location at the Van Speykstraat 102 in Rotterdam became to small and it was located too near to the city center. The available [[subsidy]] in the Emmen region to attract new businesses and industries, the available areas on a new developed industrial estate and the high [[unemployment]] in this region, initiated the move to the other part of the country and to relocate the factory. The available workers, although often poorly technically educated, could with help of the local technical schools and the company's own internal technical education be transformed to well skilled employees. In the years to follow, the management is being transferred to the sons of Mr. J.W. Pelger. Mr. K.D. Pelger becomes technical director of the factory in Emmen. Mr. W.C. Pelger becomes sales director of the Rotterdam sales office, which stayed in Rotterdam until 1971. The company grew to 130 [[Full-time equivalent|Fte's]] in Emmen en 10 Fte's in Rotterdam. In 1969 the company Pelger was taken over by Mr. L Bood. Both Mr. K.D. Pelger and Mr. W.C. Pelger stayed on in the [[board of directors]] as purchase director and sales director respectively.\n\n=== Strike ===\nIn 1972 a dispute arose between the Mr. L. Bood the [[managing director]] and an employee Mr. A. Platje,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jassies|first=Ary|date=22 April 1972|title=Employees battle on|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1972-04-22/edition/0/page/7?query=Pelger&sort=relevance|journal=Leidsch Dagblad|volume=|pages=|via=Leiden Courant}}</ref> member of the Dutch [[communist party]], about rights and obligations under the [[labour law]]. The [[Trade union|unions]] got involved and strikes were initiated. The dispute ended up in the longest [[Strike action|strike]] in the electrotechnical industry in the Netherlands, which lastet for almost half a year and several court cases<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Editor|date=15 February 1973|title=Pelger facing court tomorrow|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1973-02-15/edition/0/page/21|journal=Leidsch Dagblad|volume=|pages=|via=Leiden Courant}}</ref> were held.

This made an ending to the Pelger era and 102 [[Full-time equivalent|Fte]]'s lost their jobs. The company received national notoriety, due to all the publicity. To continue the employment of the workers a foundation was raised, named Stichting voor behoud van Werkgelegenheid: Combinatie Machines Apparaten en Constructies, or in short COMBIMAC. In the committee of the foundation the following people were appointed: Mr. [[Piet de Jong|P.J.S. de Jong]], former [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] of the Netherlands and [[Minister of Defense]]. Mr. A. Jellesma, director of company W. Hubert & Co. in [[Sneek]] and Mr. W. de Vries director of company Hydro-Holland in [[Meppel]]. The company continued with 35 Fte's. In 1976 Mr. P.W. Glasmacher, working as a vice director at that time in the company, takes over the foundation and transfers it back into a company: Machine- en Apparatenfabriek Combimac B.V. In 1993 Mr. H.J. Robben en Mr. M.J.T. de Zwart, by means of a [[management buyout]], took over the company.\n\n== Products ==\n[[File:Peter Willemoes (F362) NOCO2014 04 SMART-L.JPG|alt=SMART-L radar system|thumb|SMART-L radar driven by electric motors|187x187px]]\n\n=== Electric motors ===\n\n==== Naval ships ====\nThe company started in 1919 as a repair shop for direct current machines and transformed during the history into a designer and manufacturer of special electric motors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/46775310/349169-1.pdf|title=Thesis: Research of the characteristics on a so called Jarret machine.|last=Thoone|first=M.L.G.|date=27 April 1977|website=Technical University Eindhoven}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spijkers|first=Ad|date=27 February 2015|title=Elektromotoren uit eigen land (Indegious build electric motors|url=https://www.at-aandrijftechniek.nl/algemeen/elektromotoren-uit-eigen-land/34433/|journal=AT Aandrijftechniek|volume=2|pages=|via=Aandrijftechniek}}</ref> These electric motors are designed to drive and rotate all kinds of equipment, including [[pump]]s, [[Gas compressor|compressors]], [[winch]]es, [[Manoeuvring thruster|thrusters]] and [[radar]] systems, such as the [[SMART-L]].

As a result of the Dutch Army procurement of this tank and the industrial compensation obligations, Combimac became co-manufacturer of the company AEG and supplied several electric motors for specific drives during the 1980s. In the same period NBC electric fan units had been developed for the French company \u00c9stablissements Neu (currently: Howden) in [[Lille]] for use on board the French [[AMX-30|AMX30]] battle tanks. At the beginning of this century direct contact was made with the French company GIAT (currently: [[Nexter Systems]]) designer of the [[AMX Leclerc|Leclerc]] battle.

Pelger'', with a [[funding]] capital of 40 [[Dutch guilder]]s The company started at the Zwanesteeg 4 in Rotterdam as a direct current [[electric motor]] repair shop. In 1920 the first employee was offered a job. Direct current motors were in use in Rotterdam, as a result of the [[direct current]] power supply instead of [[alternating current]] supply in these early days of [[Electrical grid|electric grid]]. In March 1926 the company moved to the Paardenstraat 5 and in May 1929 they moved on to the Van Speykstraat 86-102 in Rotterdam. In 1936 a [[centrifugal fan]]''',''' [[Electromagnetic brake|brake]] motors and [[Induction motor|small induction]] motors program from another manufacturer named HSM (short for: Heinke-Schuitema-Musselkanaal) in Musselkanaal was bought and brought to Rotterdam.  Mr. K.W. Heinke, one of the former owners and [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical engineer]] of HSM also moved to work at the factory in Rotterdam. In the same year 40 off. [[patent]]<nowiki/>s were applied for, with reference to three inventions: the [[centrifugal switch]], the [[centrifugal fan]] housing and the principle of a [[squirrel-cage rotor]]. The Pelger repair shop gradually evolved into a [[factory]] designing and manufacturing special electric motors and centrifugal fans. After some time the two original company names Pelger and HSM were changed into a variant of the existing names: Holland Special Machines Pelger or HSM-Pelger.\n\n=== Heinke & Schuitema Musselkanaal ===\n[[File:Locatie plaats Stadskanaal.png|thumb|Musselkanaal region]]\nThe company Heinke en Schuitema Musselkanaal (HSM) was founded on 1 March 1933 by Mr. ''Konrad W. Heinke'' and Mr. ''Etsko Schuitema'' as a company to manufacture and repair of electric machines. In 1935 per coincidence contact was made with Mr. G. Ph. van Gelder,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ir. J.W.

The company was not performing very well and financially in trouble deep. Contact was made with this factory and as a result the company was bought, as well as the inventory and 5 employees moved to Rotterdam. Mr. Schuitema continues the company under E. Schuitema repair company of electric machines, which ends in 1947 as a result of his death. Mr. Heinke keeps all rights on the [[casting]] patterns, which are based at: {{ill|N.V. Asselbergs' IJzerindustrie en Handelsmaatschappij IJzergieterijen|nl|Gieterij Asselbergs|vertical-align=sup}}, {{ill|N.V. Nederlandsche IJzergieterij Vulcanus|nl|Vulcanus (fabriek)|vertical-align=sup}} en de {{ill|N.V. Twentsche Metaal- en IJzergieterij|nl|Twentsche IJzergieterij|vertical-align=sup}}.In 1936 the manufacturing and series production at the Pelger factory started. Mr. Heinke initiated further development and introduction of new models. Mr. van Gelder kept the sole distribution rights for the products. The sales and distribution of the products therefore stayed until World War II with Mr. van Gelder's company, Firma G. Ph. van Gelder in [[Overschie]]. After [[World War II]] a new sales organization was set up: Van Gelder & Pelger. On 9 June 1950 the company Pelger N.V. was founded with a funding capital of 500.000,-- Dutch guilders. In 1951 it was decided the sales and distribution of the produced goods would be done by the company Pelger itself, by means a separate sales office located at the Groenendaal 25 in Rotterdam.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nAt the beginning of [[World War II]], the company had a narrow escape during the [[Rotterdam Blitz]], or bombing of Rotterdam. The limit of the burned down zone ([[Dutch language|Dutch substantive]]: brandgrens<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brandgrens.nl/en/home|title=Fire Wall Rotterdam Blitz|date=14 May 1940|website=www.brandgrens.nl}}</ref>) came very close to the factory, located at the Van Speykstraat 102. During World War II under the occupation of the German Regime the factory continued to work almost up to the end of the war. Mr. van Gelder had to end the cooperation on behalf of German orders received and went into hiding and stayed under cover. Also the name of the trade company Firma G.Ph. van Gelder could no longer be used and was replaced by Handelsonderneming H.S.M.-HOLLAND.In 1941 the factory was declared as enemy of the Germany Regime and in 1943 the factory was forced to work for the German industry. The company {{ill|Elin Schorch Reydt|de|ELIN|vertical-align=sup}} (the so-called {{ill|Patenschaft|de|vertical-align=sup}}) raised an order to manufacture refrigerator motors for the company {{ill|Alfred Teves|de|vertical-align=sup}}. The production of the motors was sabotaged by the employees and management, endangering personal lives. On 1st 1944 in small committee the 25 anniversary of the company was celebrated. A few days later during the Rotterdam Razzia<ref>[[:nl:Razzia van Rotterdam|De razzia van Rotterdam, 1951]]{{Circular reference|date=March 2020}}</ref> (or [[Roundup (history)|Roundup]]) on 6 November 1944 all the raw materials were collected from the factory and on 10 November all the machinery were collected and transported to Germany. Mr. Heinke who had German roots and [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] sympathies, had gained the titel of R\u00fcstung-Inspektor der R\u00fcstung und Kriegsprodukten in the Netherlands, assisted the transport. Mr. Heinke wanted to continue the development of the [[Repulsion motor|repulsion]] motor, on which a patent was [[Patent pending|pending]] for his own account. Mr. J. Vos an employee of the company and Head of the test laboratory was put to work as a forced laborer in [[Zwickau]]. After the war Mr. Vos managed to find the machinery taken from the Pelger factory, as he stayed in contact with Mr. Heinke. He found the maschinery were stored at the Tischlerei Max Siegert in Frankhausen, also Mr. Heinke's former home. The machinery which were in the possession of Mr. Heinke's widow, as Mr. K.W. Heinke passed away shortly after the war. The machinery were officially confiscated by the American Occupation Authorities in [[Crimmitschau]] and were brought back to the Netherlands.\n\n=== Emmen ===\n[[File:LocatieEmmen.png|alt=|thumb|Emmen region]]\nAfter moving premises within Rotterdam a couple of times to larger facilities, in 1957 the factory moved from the city of Rotterdam to the town of [[Emmen, Netherlands|Emmen]]. The factory location at the Van Speykstraat 102 in Rotterdam became to small and it was located too near to the city center. The available [[subsidy]] in the Emmen region to attract new businesses and industries, the available areas on a new developed industrial estate and the high [[unemployment]] in this region, initiated the move to the other part of the country and to relocate the factory. The available workers, although often poorly technically educated, could with help of the local technical schools and the company's own internal technical education be transformed to well skilled employees. In the years to follow, the management is being transferred to the sons of Mr. J.W. Pelger. Mr. K.D. Pelger becomes technical director of the factory in Emmen. Mr. W.C. Pelger becomes sales director of the Rotterdam sales office, which stayed in Rotterdam until 1971. The company grew to 130 [[Full-time equivalent|Fte's]] in Emmen en 10 Fte's in Rotterdam. In 1969 the company Pelger was taken over by Mr. L Bood. Both Mr. K.D. Pelger and Mr. W.C. Pelger stayed on in the [[board of directors]] as purchase director and sales director respectively.\n\n=== Strike ===\nIn 1972 a dispute arose between the Mr. L. Bood the [[managing director]] and an employee Mr. A. Platje,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jassies|first=Ary|date=22 April 1972|title=Employees battle on|url=http://leiden.courant.nu/issue/LD/1972-04-22/edition/0/page/7?query=Pelger&sort=relevance|journal=Leidsch Dagblad|volume=|pages=|via=Leiden Courant}}</ref> member of the Dutch [[communist party]], about rights and obligations under the [[labour law]].

This made an ending to the Pelger era and 102 [[Full-time equivalent|Fte]]'s lost their jobs. The company received national notoriety, due to all the publicity. To continue the employment of the workers a foundation was raised, named Stichting voor behoud van Werkgelegenheid: Combinatie Machines Apparaten en Constructies, or in short COMBIMAC. In the committee of the foundation the following people were appointed: Mr. [[Piet de Jong|P.J.S. de Jong]], former [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]] of the Netherlands and [[Minister of Defense]]. Mr. A. Jellesma, director of company W. Hubert & Co. in [[Sneek]] and Mr. W. de Vries director of company Hydro-Holland in [[Meppel]]. The company continued with 35 Fte's. In 1976 Mr. P.W. Glasmacher, working as a vice director at that time in the company, takes over the foundation and transfers it back into a company: Machine- en Apparatenfabriek Combimac B.V. In 1993 Mr. H.J. Robben en Mr. M.J.T. de Zwart, by means of a [[management buyout]], took over the company.\n\n== Products ==\n[[File:Peter Willemoes (F362) NOCO2014 04 SMART-L.JPG|alt=SMART-L radar system|thumb|SMART-L radar driven by electric motors|187x187px]]\n\n=== Electric motors ===\n\n==== Naval ships ====\nThe company started in 1919 as a repair shop for direct current machines and transformed during the history into a designer and manufacturer of special electric motors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/46775310/349169-1.pdf|title=Thesis: Research of the characteristics on a so called Jarret machine.|last=Thoone|first=M.L.G.|date=27 April 1977|website=Technical University Eindhoven}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spijkers|first=Ad|date=27 February 2015|title=Elektromotoren uit eigen land (Indegious build electric motors|url=https://www.at-aandrijftechniek.nl/algemeen/elektromotoren-uit-eigen-land/34433/|journal=AT Aandrijftechniek|volume=2|pages=|via=Aandrijftechniek}}</ref> These electric motors are designed to drive and rotate all kinds of equipment, including [[pump]]s, [[Gas compressor|compressors]], [[winch]]es, [[Manoeuvring thruster|thrusters]] and [[radar]] systems, such as the [[SMART-L]].

This company was a major sub supplier to the German company [[Krauss-Maffei]] AG (nowadays: [[Krauss-Maffei Wegmann]]) designer of the [[Leopard 2]] battle tanks. As a result of the Dutch Army procurement of this tank and the industrial compensation obligations, Combimac became co-manufacturer of the company AEG and supplied several electric motors for specific drives during the 1980s. In the same period NBC electric fan units had been developed for the French company \u00c9stablissements Neu (currently: Howden) in [[Lille]] for use on board the French [[AMX-30|AMX30]] battle tanks. At the beginning of this century direct contact was made with the French company GIAT (currently: [[Nexter Systems]]) designer of the [[AMX Leclerc|Leclerc]] battle.

Its stator is incorporated in the tunnel and its rotor carries propeller blades. Waterflow through the unit is unobstructed since there is no gearbox in the tunnel, nor are struts needed to support a hub. Together these factors give a high total efficiency and reduced noise and vibration, due to no [[cavitation]] as result of a low tip speed of the propeller blades.

{"title_page": "Sno-Freighter", "text_new": "[[Image:Sno-Freighter.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Sno-Freighter, summer 2009.]]\nThe '''Sno-Freighter''' is a one-of-a-kind land vehicle designed by LeTourneau Technologies (now part of [[Cameron International]]) for Alaska Freight Lines in the 1950s. During that decade, Alaska Freight Lines won the contract to transport construction material to build the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW) in far northern [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]]. At the time, no roads crossed the [[Arctic Circle]] in North America, there were almost no runways for air transportation, and the polar ice cap prevented seaborne transport.\n\nLeTourneau had built a series of prototype \"land trains\" for use in roadless environments, and Alaska Freight Lines contracted the company to build a special model for cold-climate transportation on January 5, 1955. The contract called for an off-road vehicle capable of transporting {{convert|150|ST|kg}} of cargo in {{convert|-68|F|C}} temperatures, through {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=on}} deep streams, and deep snowdrifts.<ref name=#1>Orlemann, p. 66</ref>\n\nUsing parts from its previous land trains, LeTourneau manufactured the Model VC-22 Sno-Freighter, completing it on February 17. It left the factory in [[Longview, Texas]] on March 16. The \"locomotive\" (serial # 5198) <ref name=#2>Orlemann, p. 31</ref> of the Sno-Freighter contained two [[Cummins]] NHV-12BI V-12 diesel engines operating at 400 horsepower each.

One of the famous armorials is the [[Gelre Armorial]] or ''Wapenboek'', written between 1370 and 1414.\nCoats of arms in the [[Netherlands]] were not controlled by an official heraldic system like the two in the United Kingdom, nor were they used solely by [[Nobility|noble families]]. Any person could develop and use a coat of arms if they wished to do so, provided they did not usurp someone else's arms, and historically, this right was enshrined in [[Roman Dutch law]].<ref>J.

Much of the terminology and classifications are taken from it. However, with the fall of the French monarchy (and later Empire) there is not currently a ''Fons Honorum'' (power to dispense and control honors) to strictly enforce heraldic law. [[French Republican calendar|The French Republics]] that followed have either merely affirmed pre-existing titles and honors or vigorously opposed noble privilege. Coats of arms are considered an intellectual property of a family or municipal body. Assumed arms (arms invented and used by the holder rather than granted by an authority) are considered valid unless they can be proved in court to copy that of an earlier holder.\n\n==British heraldry==\n{{main|English heraldry|Scottish heraldry|Welsh heraldry}}\n[[File:Arms of Duke of Richmond 02817.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|left|Arms of the [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|Duke of Richmond]] c.1780]]\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, KG.png|left|thumb|upright=0.55|Coat of arms of Sir Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, KG]]\nIn the heraldic traditions of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], an individual, rather than a family, had a coat of arms. In those traditions coats of arms are legal property transmitted from father to son; [[Women in heraldry|wives and daughters]] could also bear arms modified to indicate their relation to the current holder of the arms. [[Undifferenced arms]] are used only by one person at any given time. Other descendants of the original bearer could bear the ancestral arms only with some [[cadency|difference]]: usually a colour change or the addition of a distinguishing [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]. One such charge is the [[label (heraldry)|label]], which in British usage (outside the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]) is now always the mark of an [[heir apparent]] or (in Scotland) an [[heir presumptive]]. Because of their importance in identification, particularly in seals on legal documents, the use of arms was strictly regulated; few countries continue in this today. This has been carried out by [[herald]]s and the study of coats of arms is therefore called \"heraldry\". In time, the use of arms spread from military entities to educational institutes, and other establishments.<ref name=emerald>{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Articles/1680100103.html|title=Educational Institute Coat of arms|date=October 2005|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Scotland, the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] has [[criminal jurisdiction]] to control the use of arms. In England, [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Wales]] the use of arms is a matter of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and regulated by the [[College of Arms]] and the [[High Court of Chivalry]].\n\nIn reference to a dispute over the exercise of authority over the Officers of Arms in England, [[Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey]], [[Lord Privy Seal]], declared on 16 June 1673 that the powers of the [[Earl Marshal]] were \"to order, judge, and determine all matters touching arms, ensigns of nobility, honour, and chivalry; to make laws, ordinances, and statutes for the good government of the Officers of Arms; to nominate Officers to fill vacancies in the College of Arms; to punish and correct Officers of Arms for misbehaviour in the execution of their places\".  It was further declared that no patents of arms or any ensigns of nobility should be granted and no augmentation, alteration, or addition should be made to arms without the consent of the Earl Marshal.\n\n==Latin heraldry==\n{{Main|Ecclesiastical heraldry|Portuguese heraldry|Spanish heraldry|Brazilian heraldry}}\nThe heraldry of [[southern France]], [[Andorra]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]] is characterized by a lack of crests, and uniquely shaped shields. Portuguese heraldry, however, does use crests.<ref name=\"Warnstedt, Christopher 1970\"/> Portuguese and Spanish heraldry, which together form a larger Iberian tradition of heraldry, occasionally introduce words to the shield of arms, a practice usually avoided in British heraldry. Latin heraldry is known for extensive use of quartering, because of armorial inheritance via the male and the female lines. Moreover, Italian heraldry is dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, featuring many shields and achievements, most bearing some reference to the Church.<ref>{{harvp|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|pp=24\u201330}}</ref>\n\nTrees are frequent charges in Latin arms. Charged bordures, including bordures inscribed with words, are seen often in Spain.\n\n==Central and Eastern European heraldry==\n[[File:Turiec.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Coat of Arms of the [[Turiec]] county in [[Slovakia]].]]\n{{Main|Belarusian heraldry|Croatian heraldry|Hungarian heraldry|Polish heraldry|Romanian heraldry|Russian heraldry|Serbian heraldry}}\nEastern European heraldry is in the traditions developed in [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Russia]]. Eastern coats of arms are characterized by a pronounced, territorial, [[clan]] system \u2013 often, entire villages or military groups were granted the same coat of arms irrespective of family relationships. In Poland, nearly six hundred unrelated families are known to bear the same [[Jastrz\u0119biec coat of arms]]. Marks of cadency are almost unknown, and shields are generally very simple, with only one charge. Many heraldic shields derive from ancient [[house mark]]s. At the least, fifteen per cent of all Hungarian personal arms bear a severed [[Turk head (heraldry)|Turk's head]], referring to their wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{harvp|von Warnstedt|1970|pp=129\u201330}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|pp=28\u201332}}</ref>\n\n== Irish heraldry ==\n{{Main|Irish heraldry}}\nIn [[Ireland]] the usage and granting of coats of arms was strictly regulated by the [[Ulster King of Arms]] from the office's creation in 1552. After Irish independence in 1922 the office was still functioning and working out of [[Dublin Castle]]. The last Ulster King of Arms was [[Nevile Wilkinson|Sir Nevile Rodwell Wilkinson]] [Ulster King of Arms 1908\u20131940], who held it until his death in 1940. At the Irish government's request, no new King of Arms was appointed. [[Thomas Sadleir|Thomas Ulick Sadleir]], the Deputy Ulster King of Arms, then became the Acting Ulster King of Arms. He served until the office was merged with that of [[Norroy King of Arms]] in 1943 and stayed on until 1944 to clear up the backlog.\n\nAn earlier [[Ireland King of Arms]] was created by [[King Richard II]] in 1392 and discontinued by [[King Henry VII]] in 1487. It didn't grant many coats of arms \u2013 the few it did grant were annulled by the other Kings of Arms because they encroached upon their jurisdictions. Its purpose was supposedly to marshal an expedition to fully conquer Ireland that never materialized. Since 1 April 1943 the authority has been split between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Heraldry in the Republic of Ireland is regulated by the [[Government of Ireland]], by the [[Genealogical Office]] through the Office of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Heraldry in Northern Ireland is regulated by the [[British Government]] by the [[College of Arms]] through the [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms]].\n\n== North American ==\n{{Main|Canadian heraldry|United States heraldry}}\n[[File:US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Great Seal of the United States]], which displays as its central design the heraldic device of the nation.]]\n\nThe [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]] has delegated her prerogative to grant armorial bearings to the [[Governor General of Canada]].

The crest is thirteen stars breaking through a glory and clouds, displayed with no helm, torse, or mantling (unlike most European precedents). Only a few of the [[U.S. state|American states]] have adopted a coat of arms, which is usually designed as part of the [[Seals of the U.S. states|respective state's seal]]. [[Vermont]] has both a [[Great Seal of Vermont|state seal]] and a [[Coat of arms of Vermont|state coat of arms]] that are independent of one another (though both contain a pine tree, a cow and sheaves of grain); the seal is used to authenticate documents, whilst the heraldic device represents the state itself.\n\n== Other national traditions ==\n[[File:Liptov coatofarms.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Coat of arms of [[Liptov]] County in [[Slovakia]].]]\n{{Main|Spanish heraldry|Russian heraldry|Portuguese heraldry|Hungarian heraldry|Polish heraldry|Dutch heraldry}}\n\nAt a national level, \"coats of arms\" were generally retained by European states with constitutional continuity of more than a few centuries, including constitutional monarchies like [[Coat of arms of Denmark|Denmark]] as well as old republics like [[Coat of arms of San Marino|San Marino]] and [[Coat of arms of Switzerland|Switzerland]].\n\nIn [[Italy]] the use of coats of arms was only loosely regulated by the states existing before the [[Italian unification|unification]] of 1861. Since the [[Consulta Araldica]], the [[college of arms]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], was abolished in 1948, personal coats of arms and titles of nobility, though not outlawed, are not recognised.\n\nCoats of arms in [[Spain]] were generally left up to the owner themselves, but the design was based on military service and the heritage of their grandparents. In [[France]], the coat of arms is based on the [[Fleur-de-lys]] and the ''Rule of Tinctures'' used in English heraldry as well.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Heraldry}}\n\n[[Category:Heraldry]]\n", "text_old": "The emergence of heraldry occurred across [[western Europe]] almost simultaneously in the various countries.

Much of the terminology and classifications are taken from it. However, with the fall of the French monarchy (and later Empire) there is not currently a ''Fons Honorum'' (power to dispense and control honors) to strictly enforce heraldic law. [[French Republican calendar|The French Republics]] that followed have either merely affirmed pre-existing titles and honors or vigorously opposed noble privilege. Coats of arms are considered an intellectual property of a family or municipal body. Assumed arms (arms invented and used by the holder rather than granted by an authority) are considered valid unless they can be proved in court to copy that of an earlier holder.\n\n==British heraldry==\n{{main|English heraldry|Scottish heraldry|Welsh heraldry}}\n[[File:Arms of Duke of Richmond 02817.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|left|Arms of the [[Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Richmond and Somerset|Duke of Richmond]] c.1780]]\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, KG.png|left|thumb|upright=0.55|Coat of arms of Sir Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, KG]]\nIn the heraldic traditions of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], an individual, rather than a family, had a coat of arms. In those traditions coats of arms are legal property transmitted from father to son; [[Women in heraldry|wives and daughters]] could also bear arms modified to indicate their relation to the current holder of the arms. [[Undifferenced arms]] are used only by one person at any given time. Other descendants of the original bearer could bear the ancestral arms only with some [[cadency|difference]]: usually a colour change or the addition of a distinguishing [[charge (heraldry)|charge]]. One such charge is the [[label (heraldry)|label]], which in British usage (outside the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]]) is now always the mark of an [[heir apparent]] or (in Scotland) an [[heir presumptive]]. Because of their importance in identification, particularly in seals on legal documents, the use of arms was strictly regulated; few countries continue in this today. This has been carried out by [[herald]]s and the study of coats of arms is therefore called \"heraldry\". In time, the use of arms spread from military entities to educational institutes, and other establishments.<ref name=emerald>{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Articles/1680100103.html|title=Educational Institute Coat of arms|date=October 2005|accessdate=26 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Scotland, the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] has [[criminal jurisdiction]] to control the use of arms. In England, [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Wales]] the use of arms is a matter of [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and regulated by the [[College of Arms]] and the [[High Court of Chivalry]].\n\nIn reference to a dispute over the exercise of authority over the Officers of Arms in England, [[Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey]], [[Lord Privy Seal]], declared on 16 June 1673 that the powers of the [[Earl Marshal]] were \"to order, judge, and determine all matters touching arms, ensigns of nobility, honour, and chivalry; to make laws, ordinances, and statutes for the good government of the Officers of Arms; to nominate Officers to fill vacancies in the College of Arms; to punish and correct Officers of Arms for misbehaviour in the execution of their places\".  It was further declared that no patents of arms or any ensigns of nobility should be granted and no augmentation, alteration, or addition should be made to arms without the consent of the Earl Marshal.\n\n==Latin heraldry==\n{{Main|Ecclesiastical heraldry|Portuguese heraldry|Spanish heraldry|Brazilian heraldry}}\nThe heraldry of [[southern France]], [[Andorra]], [[Spain]], and [[Italy]] is characterized by a lack of crests, and uniquely shaped shields. Portuguese heraldry, however, does use crests.<ref name=\"Warnstedt, Christopher 1970\"/> Portuguese and Spanish heraldry, which together form a larger Iberian tradition of heraldry, occasionally introduce words to the shield of arms, a practice usually avoided in British heraldry. Latin heraldry is known for extensive use of quartering, because of armorial inheritance via the male and the female lines. Moreover, Italian heraldry is dominated by the Roman Catholic Church, featuring many shields and achievements, most bearing some reference to the Church.<ref>{{harvp|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|pp=24-30}}</ref>\n\nTrees are frequent charges in Latin arms. Charged bordures, including bordures inscribed with words, are seen often in Spain.\n\n==Central and Eastern European heraldry==\n[[File:Turiec.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Coat of Arms of the [[Turiec]] county in [[Slovakia]].]]\n{{Main|Belarusian heraldry|Croatian heraldry|Hungarian heraldry|Polish heraldry|Romanian heraldry|Russian heraldry|Serbian heraldry}}\nEastern European heraldry is in the traditions developed in [[Belarus]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Russia]]. Eastern coats of arms are characterized by a pronounced, territorial, [[clan]] system &ndash; often, entire villages or military groups were granted the same coat of arms irrespective of family relationships. In Poland, nearly six hundred unrelated families are known to bear the same [[Jastrz\u0119biec coat of arms]]. Marks of cadency are almost unknown, and shields are generally very simple, with only one charge. Many heraldic shields derive from ancient [[house mark]]s. At the least, fifteen per cent of all Hungarian personal arms bear a severed [[Turk head (heraldry)|Turk's head]], referring to their wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>{{harvp|von Warnstedt|1970|pp=129-30}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Woodcock|Robinson|1988|pp=28-32}}</ref>\n\n== Irish heraldry ==\n{{Main|Irish heraldry}}\nIn [[Ireland]] the usage and granting of coats of arms was strictly regulated by the [[Ulster King of Arms]] from the office's creation in 1552. After Irish independence in 1922 the office was still functioning and working out of [[Dublin Castle]]. The last Ulster King of Arms was [[Nevile Wilkinson|Sir Nevile Rodwell Wilkinson]] [Ulster King of Arms 1908\u20131940], who held it until his death in 1940. At the Irish government's request, no new King of Arms was appointed. [[Thomas Sadleir|Thomas Ulick Sadleir]], the Deputy Ulster King of Arms, then became the Acting Ulster King of Arms. He served until the office was merged with that of [[Norroy King of Arms]] in 1943 and stayed on until 1944 to clear up the backlog.\n\nAn earlier [[Ireland King of Arms]] was created by [[King Richard II]] in 1392 and discontinued by [[King Henry VII]] in 1487. It didn't grant many coats of arms \u2013 the few it did grant were annulled by the other Kings of Arms because they encroached upon their jurisdictions. Its purpose was supposedly to marshal an expedition to fully conquer Ireland that never materialized. Since 1 April 1943 the authority has been split between the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Heraldry in the Republic of Ireland is regulated by the [[Government of Ireland]], by the [[Genealogical Office]] through the Office of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. Heraldry in Northern Ireland is regulated by the [[British Government]] by the [[College of Arms]] through the [[Norroy and Ulster King of Arms]].\n\n== North American ==\n{{Main|Canadian heraldry|United States heraldry}}\n[[File:US-GreatSeal-Obverse.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Great Seal of the United States]], which displays as its central design the heraldic device of the nation.]]\n\nThe [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]] has delegated her prerogative to grant armorial bearings to the [[Governor General of Canada]].

The crest is thirteen stars breaking through a glory and clouds, displayed with no helm, torse, or mantling (unlike most European precedents). Only a few of the [[U.S. state|American states]] have adopted a coat of arms, which is usually designed as part of the [[Seals of the U.S. states|respective state's seal]]. [[Vermont]] has both a [[Great Seal of Vermont|state seal]] and a [[Coat of arms of Vermont|state coat of arms]] that are independent of one another (though both contain a pine tree, a cow and sheaves of grain); the seal is used to authenticate documents, whilst the heraldic device represents the state itself.\n\n== Other national traditions ==\n[[File:Liptov coatofarms.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|Coat of arms of [[Liptov]] County in [[Slovakia]].]]\n{{Main|Spanish heraldry|Russian heraldry|Portuguese heraldry|Hungarian heraldry|Polish heraldry|Dutch heraldry}}\n\nAt a national level, \"coats of arms\" were generally retained by European states with constitutional continuity of more than a few centuries, including constitutional monarchies like [[Coat of arms of Denmark|Denmark]] as well as old republics like [[Coat of arms of San Marino|San Marino]] and [[Coat of arms of Switzerland|Switzerland]].\n\nIn [[Italy]] the use of coats of arms was only loosely regulated by the states existing before the [[Italian unification|unification]] of 1861. Since the [[Consulta Araldica]], the [[college of arms]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy]], was abolished in 1948, personal coats of arms and titles of nobility, though not outlawed, are not recognised.\n\nCoats of arms in [[Spain]] were generally left up to the owner themselves, but the design was based on military service and the heritage of their grandparents. In [[France]], the coat of arms is based on the [[Fleur-de-lys]] and the ''Rule of Tinctures'' used in English heraldry as well.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Heraldry}}\n\n[[Category:Heraldry]]\n", "name_user": "Diannaa", "label": "safe", "comment": "Attribution: text was copied fromCoat of armson April 19, 2020.

It is part of the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system. The college was founded in 1871 as the '''Wadsworth Normal and Training School''' before it became a state [[liberal arts college]] in 1948.\n\n[[File:Geneseo Normal School.jpg|thumb|236px|Wadsworth School, [[Circa|c.]]&nbsp;1904.]]\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:Milnelibrary.jpg|right|thumb|Milne Library.]]\n\nGeneseo is a four-year public liberal arts college. Noted to be among the top SUNY schools, it has 48 undergraduate [[Major (academic)|major]]s, five graduate programs (Master's only) and 25 interdisciplinary [[Minor (academic)|minor]]s.

Nearly 90% of Geneseo's full-time faculty holds a Ph.D. or other terminal degree. Geneseo ranks number one in the nation for four-year graduation rates among comprehensive colleges and is tied for highest freshman retention rate out of any public college or university in New York.\n\nGeneseo is part of the New York Space Grant Consortium,<ref name=\"NY Space Grant\">{{cite web |title=New York Space Grant Community College Partnership Program |url=http://astrosun2.astro.cornell.edu/specialprograms/spacegrant// |accessdate=2015-07-21 |publisher=Cornell University |year=2014}}</ref> and is provided grants by [[NASA]] to support outer-space related research on-campus. Due to this participation, Geneseo is designated as a \"space-grant\" institution.\n\n===Humanities and core curriculum===\nSUNY Geneseo currently requires each student to take one of two survey courses in western humanities, in addition to a wide distribution of core courses in the arts and sciences. Faculty members from various departments teach \"Western Humanities 1\" and \"Western Humanities 2\". Individual course syllabi share many historical, philosophical, and literary texts with other courses creating a common knowledge base within the undergraduate student body. Core courses in the humanities, languages, and sciences ensures Geneseo students are well versed in the liberal arts tradition of education.\n\nAll Geneseo students must complete the general education curriculum outlined below:\n\n*2 courses in Natural Sciences\n*2 courses in Social Sciences\n*2 courses in Fine Arts\n*1 course in Western Humanities\n*1 course in Numeric/Symbolic Reasoning\n*1 course in U.S. History\n*1 course in Other World Civilizations\n*1 course in Critical Reading/Writing\n*Competency within a Foreign Language\n\n===Study abroad===\nNearly 40% of Geneseo's students participate in study abroad programs through the College or the SUNY system.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Fast Facts |url=http://www.geneseo.edu/about/fast-facts |accessdate=2013-06-03 |publisher=SUNY Geneseo}}</ref> One of Geneseo's most popular study abroad programs is its offering of the Humanities I course in [[Rome]], [[Athens]] or [[New York City]], and the Humanities II course in [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[El Sauce]], or at [[Oxford University]].

Of Geneseo's approximately 5,000 full-time residents, some 70% work at or are in some way affiliated with the College, making Geneseo a \"college town.\"\n\nThe campus is divided between the Academic Quad, \"North Side\" and \"South Side,\" with all academic buildings contained within the Academic Quad. The South Side has five residence halls and a dining hall. The South Side complex was designed by architect [[Edgar Tafel]], one-time apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Tafel also designed Brodie Hall, home of Geneseo's four Arts departments on the Academic Quad. Additionally, 44 on campus townhouses, known as Saratoga Terrace, provide a connective corridor between the South Side and the Academic Quad. The North Side has eleven residence halls, two dining halls and the Lauderdale Health Center. The Academic Quad comprising the Upper and Lower Campuses has the academic buildings, the College Union, Merritt Athletic Center, Wadsworth Auditorium and the Milne Library that offers amazing views of the Genesee valley.\n\nThe campus is laid out in generally the same shape as the state of New York; almost all residence halls are named after counties in the state, though not all are placed in line with their same geography within the state. (Example: Nassau and Suffolk Halls on South Side, which is the \"Long Island\" aspect to the state, but Wayne, Niagara, and Onondaga Halls which are named for counties upstate are also on the South Side.) Jones Hall is the only residence hall not named after a county.\n\nIn 2003, the college began the largest capital improvement project in the history of the [[State University of New York|SUNY]] system. The Integrated Science Facility (pictured right) is a {{convert|105000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, $32 million building equipped with a nuclear accelerator. Leslie E. Robertson Associates are the structural engineers in this project.  The Center opened in the Spring of 2007. On the new building's opening, Greene Hall (a science building constructed in 1970) was shut down and completely renovated at a cost of $20 million.\n\nOne of the main attractions of SUNY Geneseo's campus is the architecture of many of the older buildings. The James B. Welles building was built in 1932 and is the oldest building on campus with arches, gables, and broad-leaf collegiate ivy draping its stone and brick facade. Formerly known as the Winfield Holcomb School, it served as the laboratory school for children in kindergarten through sixth grade. It now houses the departments of Philosophy, Political Science, Foreign Language, and English.\n\nThe James V. Sturges building (pictured here [[:File:Sturges Hall at SUNY Geneseo.jpg]]), the central clock tower of the main Sturges Quad is Geneseo's signature building and contains the Alumni Carillon which chimes on the hour and plays songs at various times during the day. Constructed in 1938, it once served as the administration building and now houses the History department. Sturges also holds classrooms and laboratories as well as the Geneseo Speech and Hearing Clinic. Wadsworth Auditorium, (pictured here [[:Image:Wadsworth.JPG]]) is also one of the oldest buildings on campus.\n\nAt the far end of the South Village Residences, the college maintains the {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} Spencer J. Roemer [[Arboretum]] wherein are preserved \"more than 70 species of trees, shrubs and wildflowers, including a magnificent group of [[oak]] trees which are more than 200 years old, and several [[black walnut]] trees estimated to be over 100 years old.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arboretum.geneseo.edu/|title=Roemer Arboretum|website=arboretum.geneseo.edu|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> The arboretum is used for teaching and recreation. It also has a gazebo and the college's memorial to four alumni who died in the September 11, 2001 attack on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], a gift left by the Class of 2002 through the Senior Challenge program.\n\nEast of the Academic Quad and up a slight hill is Geneseo's Main Street that complements the quaint campus with a variety of shops, restaurants, and bars. Beyond Main Street is the historic village of Geneseo, marked by Victorian architecture, well-kept mansions, fraternity and sorority houses as well as several nineteenth-century churches.\n\n===Planned expansion===\n[[File:Doty Building at SUNY Geneseo.jpg|right|thumb|Doty Hall.

Both projects are in progress, with the athletic stadium near completion.\n\n''The Lamron'' reported that SUNY Geneseo would acquire Doty Hall and update its electrical and plumbing systems, as well as modernizing the new workspace. SUNY Geneseo collaborated with the building's tenants, the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, who maintain their center on the building's first floor. SUNY Geneseo moved its Office of Admissions into the building as part of a new, more visible college welcome center. Then the Center for International Students, the Hearing and Speech Clinic, and the Department of Communicative Disorders and Science were all scheduled to move into Doty, but with the program curtailments and the closing of the Communicative Disorder Department, new plans are being developed for the space. These moves will free up space in Sturges Hall and Erwin Hall and reconnect a highly visible plot of land with the campus.\n\nIn addition to providing a turf field for Geneseo's soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse programs, Commencement will be held at the new stadium, eliminating the cost and hassle of annually erecting a temporary stadium in the B lot parking area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelamron.com/2006/11/13/college-plans-to-raze-holcomb-for-new-stadium-reacquire-doty/|date=2006-09-28|last=Peek|first=Michael|title=College plans to raze Holcomb for new stadium, reacquire Doty.|publisher=thelamron|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112002000/http://thelamron.com/2006/11/13/college-plans-to-raze-holcomb-for-new-stadium-reacquire-doty/|archive-date=2015-11-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Traditions and campus culture==\n\nGeneseo's students celebrate many longstanding traditions and campus legends.\n\n===The Bronze Bear===\n[[File:Bear Fountain in Geneseo.jpg|thumb|The Bronze Bear Fountain is on Main Street.]]\nJust off campus, in the center of Main Street in Geneseo sits the famous Bronze Bear statue. \"The Bear\" also plays host to any number of spontaneous decorations and pranks throughout the academic year. A story also circulates that one of the wealthy Wadsworth daughters saw the bear fountain in a small town in Germany, fell in love with it, bought it, and sent it back to Geneseo in the early 19th century. This story is unverified, but an excerpt from a history of the family that settled the valley implies that this is not true, and that the fountain was designed and built for its current location: \"[Main Street] is still dominated by a drinking fountain for horses dedicated to Mrs. Emmeline Austin Wadsworth. For some obscure reason its designer placed a short pole in its center on top of which sits a cunning little iron bear, who is generally known as 'Aunt Emmeline'\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Alden R. |last=Hatch| author-link=Alden Hatch |title=The Wadsworths of the Genesee |url=https://archive.org/details/wadsworthsofgene00hatc_0|publisher=Coward-McCann |year=1959 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wadsworthsofgene00hatc_0/page/205 205]}}</ref> Campus legend also says that if a virgin graduates from the College, the bear will spring to life and run away, a legend that attaches itself to campus statues all over the US. In May 2016, Emmeline was toppled by a tractor trailer and was awaiting repair. The bear has since been returned to its proper place as of 2017.\n\n===The Painted Tree===\nIn the Sturges quad, students from different Greek organizations sneak about late at night to paint a \"Greek tree.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20140907065301/http://www.geneseo.edu/~ago/photos/alumni/1980s/1980_ago_tree.jpg]. There are so many layers of paint on the tree that the original contours of the bark and trunk are obscured. Despite the years of paint, the tree continues to grow and produce leaves. The exact date when this practice began is unknown, but alumni report that it began sporadically during the 1950s and became regular practice in the mid to late 1960s.\n\n===The Seuss Spruce===\n[[File:SUNY Geneseo Seuss Spruce.jpg|thumb|right|The Seuss Spruce.]]\nAlso in the Sturges quad is the famous \"Seuss Spruce,\" so called because it looks like a [[Dr. Seuss]] illustration.  The tree's shape most likely developed due to damage during the March 1991 ice storm that struck western New York.  Now the tree simply grows in a crooked and slightly spiral shape. It's more likely that the tree is the cultivated variety [[Weeping tree|Picea Glauca 'Pendula']] or a similar spruce.  Adding to the Seussian quality of the tree is the fact that the bottom branches \"fan out\" along the ground.\n\n===Sunsets===\nGeneseo is known for visually striking sunsets, with students and alumni saying the sunset at Geneseo was once ranked by ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' as one of the top ten in the world. This claim has since been proved to be false\u2014''Nationa a couple who kisses in the Gazebo at sunset is destined to be engaged and wed.\n\n===Ice hockey games===\n[[File:geneseohockey.jpg|right|thumb|A Geneseo Ice Knights hockey game at the [[Ira S. Wilson Ice Arena]].]]\nIn recent years, men's ice hockey games in the [[Ira S. Wilson Ice Arena]] have become major campus events that draw sell-out crowds of students and community members. A pep band has been formed and student groups often offer promotions such as handing out noise makers to the capacity crowds.\n\n===Alma mater===\nThe lyrics to the school song, sung at convocation, commencement, and other formal events are as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=Geneseo Alma Mater |url=http://www.geneseo.edu/CMS/display.php?page=5150&dpt=studenthandbook |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=Geneseo Student Handbook |publisher=SUNY Geneseo}}</ref>\n\n<poem>\nShine the sun down on her halls of wisdom, where memories linger and our thoughts remain\nSing her praises out across the valley, that echoes our refrain:\nGeneseo! Geneseo! send us on our way\nGeneseo! Geneseo! with our life's work we'll repay.\n</poem>\n\nAn older and longer version of the [[Alma Mater]] from a 1929 student handbook has three verses and a chorus:\n\n<blockquote>\n{{ordered list\n|1= ''Proudly it stands on the hillside so firm, with its banners floating on high.''<br>\n''The finest Normal in the land, for you we'll do or die.''\n}}\nChorus:<br>\n''Then cheer for Alma Mater, our foster mother dear.''<br>\n''May her sons and daughters ever, love her from year to year.''<br>\n''May they her memory cherish--in duty never fail,''<br>\n''Nor let her honor perish. To Geneseo all hail!''\n{{ordered list|start=2\n|2= ''Let us strive to all our standards raise in sport and studies too.''<br>\n''Show all the world we're fighting clean, in all that we may do.''\n\n|3= ''Others may cheer for their orange and black, or to other colors be true.''<br>\n''But we shall ever hold out love, for you our white and blue.''<ref>''Student Cooperative Government'', Geneseo State Normal School, 1929</ref>\n\n}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==College seal and logotype==\n\nThe Geneseo college seal, featured in the infobox above, was unveiled in July 1968. According to the college's office of publications, the seal is a representation of the college's location and mission: \"The circular design features a flame from the torch of knowledge surrounded by leaves symbolic of the bucolic setting of SUNY Geneseo and its growth. Both are atop waves symbolizing the historic Genesee River.\"<ref name=\"graphic_standards\">{{cite web |title=Graphic Standards |url=http://www.geneseo.edu/CMS/display.php?page=2417&dpt=commpubs |accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher=SUNY Geneseo Office of Communications and Publications}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the college designed a logo to \"provide the College with an identity mark that was more readily identifiable than the College Seal and was not meant to replace the College Seal.\" Again drawing on the college's unique surroundings, \"the graphic underneath the word 'Geneseo' symbolizes the rolling and rural character of the surrounding Genesee Valley.\"  The [[typeface]] used in this logo, and in many other college publications, is ''Galliard''.<ref name=\"graphic_standards\"/>\n\nIn October 2012, Geneseo unveiled a new logotype, featured in the infobox above. Bill Caren, Geneseo's Associate Vice President of Enrollment, stated the new word mark reflected \"[Geneseo's] competitors' logos,\" which are less stylized.  \"If [Geneseo] wants to be perceived in the same category as its competitors,\" Caren added, \"it would be good to have a logo that corresponds on the same level.\" The logotype was met with mixed responses by the student body, although its implementation throughout campus continued unhindered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelamron.com/news/new-wordmark-incites-divisive-debate-1.2931002#.UayqQGQ0rv4|archive-date=2013-06-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630102445/http://www.thelamron.com/news/new-wordmark-incites-divisive-debate-1.2931002%23.UayqQGQ0rv4|url-status=dead|date=2012-10-18|last=Rose-Gross|first=Joanna|title=New wordmark incites divisive debate|publisher=Lamron|accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Infobox college athletics\n| name = Geneseo Knights\n| logo =\n| logo_width = 220\n| university = State University of New York at Geneseo\n| association = NCAA\n| conference = [[State University of New York Athletic Conference]]\n| division = [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]\n| director = [[Mike Mooney (athletic director)|Mike Mooney]]\n| location = [[Geneseo, New York]]\n| teams = 20\n| stadium =\n| basketballarena= [[Schrader Gymnasium]]\n| arena2 = [[Ira S.

In the 2011 Princeton Review report, for example, Geneseo, Binghamton, and Buffalo were ranked within the top 75 for best public college value.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.princetonreview.com/best-value-colleges.aspx| year=2012 |title=Rankings for 75 Best Values in Public Colleges |publisher=Princeton Review |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> Binghamton, Buffalo, and Stony Brook are doctoral-granting universities and Geneseo is a master's-granting college.\n\n===Admissions===\nGeneseo's acceptance rate is 72% as of 2017.<ref name=\"colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com\"/>\n\n===Phi Beta Kappa===\nGeneseo has a chapter of the oldest academic honor society in the United States, [[Phi Beta Kappa]].<ref name=\"pbk_chapter\">{{cite web |title=Chapter Chronology |url=http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Chapter_Chronology&Template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=1624 |accessdate=2007-08-12 |publisher=The [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001756/http://staging.pbk.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Chapter_Chronology&Template=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=1624 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> SUNY's four university ''centers'' already had chapters; Geneseo's establishment of a chapter is significant because it was the first (and is currently the only) of New York's thirteen state comprehensive ''colleges'' to receive the honor.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Geneseo Faculty Granted Charter for Phi Beta Kappa Chapter at the College |publisher=SUNY Geneseo |date=2003-08-26}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural \u03a6\u0392\u039a class was inducted to Geneseo's Alpha-Gamma of New York chapter in April 2004.<ref name=\"pbk_chapter\"/>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:SUNY Geneseo Integrated Science Center.jpg|thumb|The Integrated Science Center opened in Fall 2006. In the foreground is the college green.]]\n[[File:Geneseo Pelletron ribbon-cutting.jpg|thumb|President Christopher Dahl cuts the ribbon on Geneseo's 1.7&nbsp;[[MeV]] tandem Pelletron [[particle accelerator]].]]\n\nSUNY Geneseo is on the Genesee Valley's eastern side. Of Geneseo's approximately 5,000 full-time residents, some 70% work at or are in some way affiliated with the College, making Geneseo a \"college town.\"\n\nThe campus is divided between the Academic Quad, \"North Side\" and \"South Side,\" with all academic buildings contained within the Academic Quad. The South Side has five residence halls and a dining hall. The South Side complex was designed by architect [[Edgar Tafel]], one-time apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Tafel also designed Brodie Hall, home of Geneseo's four Arts departments on the Academic Quad. Additionally, 44 on campus townhouses, known as Saratoga Terrace, provide a connective corridor between the South Side and the Academic Quad. The North Side has eleven residence halls, two dining halls and the Lauderdale Health Center. The Academic Quad comprising the Upper and Lower Campuses has the academic buildings, the College Union, Merritt Athletic Center, Wadsworth Auditorium and the Milne Library that offers amazing views of the Genesee valley.\n\nThe campus is laid out in generally the same shape as the state of New York; almost all residence halls are named after counties in the state, though not all are placed in line with their same geography within the state. (Example: Nassau and Suffolk Halls on South Side, which is the \"Long Island\" aspect to the state, but Wayne, Niagara, and Onondaga Halls which are named for counties upstate are also on the South Side.) Jones Hall is the only residence hall not named after a county.\n\nIn 2003, the college began the largest capital improvement project in the history of the [[State University of New York|SUNY]] system. The Integrated Science Facility (pictured right) is a {{convert|105000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, $32 million building equipped with a nuclear accelerator. Leslie E. Robertson Associates are the structural engineers in this project.  The Center opened in the Spring of 2007. On the new building's opening, Greene Hall (a science building constructed in 1970) was shut down and completely renovated at a cost of $20 million.\n\nOne of the main attractions of SUNY Geneseo's campus is the architecture of many of the older buildings. The James B. Welles building was built in 1932 and is the oldest building on campus with arches, gables, and broad-leaf collegiate ivy draping its stone and brick facade. Formerly known as the Winfield Holcomb School, it served as the laboratory school for children in kindergarten through sixth grade. It now houses the departments of Philosophy, Political Science, Foreign Language, and English.\n\nThe James V. Sturges building (pictured here [[:File:Sturges Hall at SUNY Geneseo.jpg]]), the central clock tower of the main Sturges Quad is Geneseo's signature building and contains the Alumni Carillon which chimes on the hour and plays songs at various times during the day. Constructed in 1938, it once served as the administration building and now houses the History department. Sturges also holds classrooms and laboratories as well as the Geneseo Speech and Hearing Clinic. Wadsworth Auditorium, (pictured here [[:Image:Wadsworth.JPG]]) is also one of the oldest buildings on campus.\n\nAt the far end of the South Village Residences, the college maintains the {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} Spencer J. Roemer [[Arboretum]] wherein are preserved \"more than 70 species of trees, shrubs and wildflowers, including a magnificent group of [[oak]] trees which are more than 200 years old, and several [[black walnut]] trees estimated to be over 100 years old.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arboretum.geneseo.edu/|title=Roemer Arboretum|website=arboretum.geneseo.edu|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> The arboretum is used for teaching and recreation. It also has a gazebo and the college's memorial to four alumni who died in the September 11, 2001 attack on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], a gift left by the Class of 2002 through the Senior Challenge program.\n\nEast of the Academic Quad and up a slight hill is Geneseo's Main Street that complements the quaint campus with a variety of shops, restaurants, and bars. Beyond Main Street is the historic village of Geneseo, marked by Victorian architecture, well-kept mansions, fraternity and sorority houses as well as several nineteenth-century churches.\n\n===Planned expansion===\n[[File:Doty Building at SUNY Geneseo.jpg|right|thumb|Doty Hall. The Doty Building was Geneseo, New York's high school from 1933 to 1973.<ref>The Jen-o-see [Gen-\u0259-see], 1933 & 1975.

Both projects are in progress, with the athletic stadium near completion.\n\n''The Lamron'' reported that SUNY Geneseo would acquire Doty Hall and update its electrical and plumbing systems, as well as modernizing the new workspace. SUNY Geneseo collaborated with the building's tenants, the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities, who maintain their center on the building's first floor. SUNY Geneseo moved its Office of Admissions into the building as part of a new, more visible college welcome center. Then the Center for International Students, the Hearing and Speech Clinic, and the Department of Communicative Disorders and Science were all scheduled to move into Doty, but with the program curtailments and the closing of the Communicative Disorder Department, new plans are being developed for the space. These moves will free up space in Sturges Hall and Erwin Hall and reconnect a highly visible plot of land with the campus.\n\nIn addition to providing a turf field for Geneseo's soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse programs, Commencement will be held at the new stadium, eliminating the cost and hassle of annually erecting a temporary stadium in the B lot parking area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelamron.com/2006/11/13/college-plans-to-raze-holcomb-for-new-stadium-reacquire-doty/|date=2006-09-28|last=Peek|first=Michael|title=College plans to raze Holcomb for new stadium, reacquire Doty.|publisher=thelamron|accessdate=2006-11-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112002000/http://thelamron.com/2006/11/13/college-plans-to-raze-holcomb-for-new-stadium-reacquire-doty/|archive-date=2015-11-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Traditions and campus culture==\n\nGeneseo's students celebrate many longstanding traditions and campus legends.\n\n===The Bronze Bear===\n[[File:Bear Fountain in Geneseo.jpg|thumb|The Bronze Bear Fountain is on Main Street.]]\nJust off campus, in the center of Main Street in Geneseo sits the famous Bronze Bear statue. \"The Bear\" also plays host to any number of spontaneous decorations and pranks throughout the academic year. A story also circulates that one of the wealthy Wadsworth daughters saw the bear fountain in a small town in Germany, fell in love with it, bought it, and sent it back to Geneseo in the early 19th century. This story is unverified, but an excerpt from a history of the family that settled the valley implies that this is not true, and that the fountain was designed and built for its current location: \"[Main Street] is still dominated by a drinking fountain for horses dedicated to Mrs. Emmeline Austin Wadsworth. For some obscure reason its designer placed a short pole in its center on top of which sits a cunning little iron bear, who is generally known as 'Aunt Emmeline'\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Alden R. |last=Hatch| author-link=Alden Hatch |title=The Wadsworths of the Genesee |url=https://archive.org/details/wadsworthsofgene00hatc_0|publisher=Coward-McCann |year=1959 |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/wadsworthsofgene00hatc_0/page/205 205]}}</ref> Campus legend also says that if a virgin graduates from the College, the bear will spring to life and run away, a legend that attaches itself to campus statues all over the US. In May 2016, Emmeline was toppled by a tractor trailer and was awaiting repair. The bear has since been returned to its proper place as of 2017.\n\n===The Painted Tree===\nIn the Sturges quad, students from different Greek organizations sneak about late at night to paint a \"Greek tree.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20140907065301/http://www.geneseo.edu/~ago/photos/alumni/1980s/1980_ago_tree.jpg]. There are so many layers of paint on the tree that the original contours of the bark and trunk are obscured. Despite the years of paint, the tree continues to grow and produce leaves. The exact date when this practice began is unknown, but alumni report that it began sporadically during the 1950s and became regular practice in the mid to late 1960s.\n\n===The Seuss Spruce===\n[[File:SUNY Geneseo Seuss Spruce.jpg|thumb|right|The Seuss Spruce.]]\nAlso in the Sturges quad is the famous \"Seuss Spruce,\" so called because it looks like a [[Dr. Seuss]] illustration.  The tree's shape most likely developed due to damage during the March 1991 ice storm that struck western New York.  Now the tree simply grows in a crooked and slightly spiral shape. It's more likely that the tree is the cultivated variety [[Weeping tree|Picea Glauca 'Pendula']] or a similar spruce.  Adding to the Seussian quality of the tree is the fact that the bottom branches \"fan out\" along the ground.\n\n===Sunsets===\nGeneseo is known for visually striking sunsets, with students and alumni saying the sunset at Geneseo was once ranked by ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' as one of the top ten in the world. This claim has since been proved to be false\u2014''Nationa a couple who kisses in the Gazebo at sunset is destined to be engaged and wed.\n\n===Ice hockey games===\n[[File:geneseohockey.jpg|right|thumb|A Geneseo Ice Knights hockey game at the [[Ira S. Wilson Ice Arena]].]]\nIn recent years, men's ice hockey games in the [[Ira S. Wilson Ice Arena]] have become major campus events that draw sell-out crowds of students and community members. A pep band has been formed and student groups often offer promotions such as handing out noise makers to the capacity crowds.\n\n===Alma mater===\nThe lyrics to the school song, sung at convocation, commencement, and other formal events are as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=Geneseo Alma Mater |url=http://www.geneseo.edu/CMS/display.php?page=5150&dpt=studenthandbook |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=Geneseo Student Handbook |publisher=SUNY Geneseo}}</ref>\n\n<poem>\nShine the sun down on her halls of wisdom, where memories linger and our thoughts remain\nSing her praises out across the valley, that echoes our refrain:\nGeneseo! Geneseo! send us on our way\nGeneseo! Geneseo! with our life's work we'll repay.\n</poem>\n\nAn older and longer version of the [[Alma Mater]] from a 1929 student handbook has three verses and a chorus:\n\n<blockquote>\n{{ordered list\n|1= ''Proudly it stands on the hillside so firm, with its banners floating on high.''<br>\n''The finest Normal in the land, for you we'll do or die.''\n}}\nChorus:<br>\n''Then cheer for Alma Mater, our foster mother dear.''<br>\n''May her sons and daughters ever, love her from year to year.''<br>\n''May they her memory cherish--in duty never fail,''<br>\n''Nor let her honor perish. To Geneseo all hail!''\n{{ordered list|start=2\n|2= ''Let us strive to all our standards raise in sport and studies too.''<br>\n''Show all the world we're fighting clean, in all that we may do.''\n\n|3= ''Others may cheer for their orange and black, or to other colors be true.''<br>\n''But we shall ever hold out love, for you our white and blue.''<ref>''Student Cooperative Government'', Geneseo State Normal School, 1929</ref>\n\n}}\n</blockquote>\n\n==College seal and logotype==\n\nThe Geneseo college seal, featured in the infobox above, was unveiled in July 1968. According to the college's office of publications, the seal is a representation of the college's location and mission: \"The circular design features a flame from the torch of knowledge surrounded by leaves symbolic of the bucolic setting of SUNY Geneseo and its growth. Both are atop waves symbolizing the historic Genesee River.\"<ref name=\"graphic_standards\">{{cite web |title=Graphic Standards |url=http://www.geneseo.edu/CMS/display.php?page=2417&dpt=commpubs |accessdate=2008-08-05 |publisher=SUNY Geneseo Office of Communications and Publications}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the college designed a logo to \"provide the College with an identity mark that was more readily identifiable than the College Seal and was not meant to replace the College Seal.\" Again drawing on the college's unique surroundings, \"the graphic underneath the word 'Geneseo' symbolizes the rolling and rural character of the surrounding Genesee Valley.\"  The [[typeface]] used in this logo, and in many other college publications, is ''Galliard''.<ref name=\"graphic_standards\"/>\n\nIn October 2012, Geneseo unveiled a new logotype, featured in the infobox above. Bill Caren, Geneseo's Associate Vice President of Enrollment, stated the new word mark reflected \"[Geneseo's] competitors' logos,\" which are less stylized.  \"If [Geneseo] wants to be perceived in the same category as its competitors,\" Caren added, \"it would be good to have a logo that corresponds on the same level.\" The logotype was met with mixed responses by the student body, although its implementation throughout campus continued unhindered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelamron.com/news/new-wordmark-incites-divisive-debate-1.2931002#.UayqQGQ0rv4|archive-date=2013-06-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630102445/http://www.thelamron.com/news/new-wordmark-incites-divisive-debate-1.2931002%23.UayqQGQ0rv4|url-status=dead|date=2012-10-18|last=Rose-Gross|first=Joanna|title=New wordmark incites divisive debate|publisher=Lamron|accessdate=2013-06-03}}</ref>\n\n\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Infobox college athletics\n| name = Geneseo Knights\n| logo =\n| logo_width = 220\n| university = State University of New York at Geneseo\n| association = NCAA\n| conference = [[State University of New York Athletic Conference]]\n| division = [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]\n| director = [[Mike Mooney (athletic director)|Mike Mooney]]\n| location = [[Geneseo, New York]]\n| teams = 20\n| stadium =\n| basketballarena= [[Schrader Gymnasium]]\n| arena2 = [[Ira S.

It is a constituent college of the [[State University of New York]]. Founded in 1826, it is the 66th oldest institute of higher education in the United States, 7th oldest college in New York, and 2nd oldest public school in New York (SUNY) after Potsdam (1816).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.4icu.org/us/oldest/|title=Oldest Universities in the United States {{!}} by foundation year|website=www.4icu.org|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref>\n\nFredonia was one of the state [[normal school|teachers' colleges]] traditionally specializing in music education, but now offers many programs in many areas, including a growing graduate division. The most popular areas of study include science, communication, music, education, and the social sciences. There are 82 majors and 41 minors.\n\nThe Fredonia campus, located in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]] (southwest of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]) was designed by prominent architects [[I.M. Pei]] and [[Henry N. Cobb]] in 1968.<ref>[http://www.pcf-p.com/a/i/ Pei, Cobb, Freed & Partners Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315220319/http://www.pcf-p.com/a/i/ |date=2015-03-15 }}, Accessed 6/14/2007</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Fredonia Academy (1826\u20131867)===\nOpened in 1826 as '''Fredonia Academy''' under its first principal Austin Smith, the academy enrolled eight students. The first classes began on October 4, 1826. Within one year the Academy had 136 students, 81 boys and 55 girls.<ref>[http://www.fredonia.edu/175thanniversary/history.htm Academy to State University: Fredonia's Story] Written by William Chazanof, Accessed 6/16/2007</ref> In 1827 it was a state normal school.<ref name=\"Anderson2015\">{{cite book|author=Keith Anderson|title=The Los Angeles State Normal School, UCLA's Forgotten Past: 1881-1919|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Jp5CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA175|date=29 August 2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-329-31719-2|pages=175\u2013}}{{self-published source|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Academy reached peak enrollment in 1856 with 217 students. The school was plagued by financial shortages and was forced to close its doors in 1867.\n\n===Normal School (1867\u20131948)===\nIn 1867, the college re-emerged for its second phase of existence, as a New York State Normal School. On December 2, 1867, the Normal (as it became commonly known) began classes with 147 students, 62 boys and 85 girls. For students preparing to be teachers, no tuition was charged, books were supplied, and travel costs were reimbursed; in return, students had to promise to teach after graduation. Those students not studying for the teaching profession paid tuition and provided their own textbooks.\n\nDuring its 82 years, Fredonia Normal had a tumultuous existence. With a fluctuating student enrollment and threats of state funding reductions, the school seemed to be in constant jeopardy of closing.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Nonetheless, gradually the school was upgraded. In 1930, {{convert|58|acre|m2}} of land west of Central Avenue in the Village of Fredonia were bought to house a future campus. In 1938, music building (Mason Hall) was the first to be constructed on the Central Avenue site. New York State Governor Herbert Lehman signed the Feinberg Law in 1942 that changed the Normal Schools into Teacher Colleges, statewide.\n\n===State University System (1948\u2013present)===\nWith the formation of the State University of New York on March 13, 1948, the college created a Division of the Humanities in 1958, and in 1960 Fredonia was selected by State University to grant the A.B. degree. Previously, Fredonia's curriculum was restricted for teacher training only.\n\nFrom the 1940s through the early 1960s, additional buildings were erected: Fenton Hall (administration), Jewett Hall (sciences), Dods Hall (physical education and athletics), an addition to Mason Hall, and residence halls Gregory, Alumni, McGinnies, Chautauqua, and Nixon.\n\nIn 1968, the master plan for the modern Central Avenue campus was drafted by the highly respected architectural firm of [[I.M. Pei]] & Partners of New York at the request of then-president Oscar E. Lanford. A complex came into being that consisted of the Rockefeller Arts Center (building for fine arts), Maytum Hall (administration), Daniel A. Reed Library, McEwen Hall, Campus Center student union (now Williams Center), Houghton Hall (sciences), and LoGrasso Medical Center (infirmary). Maytum Hall, McEwen Hall (lecture rooms), Reed Library, and the Williams Center were all inter-connected, including an elevated walkway connecting McEwen Hall and the Williams Center. Also included in the plan were the suite-style residence halls Kasling, Disney, Grissom, Eisenhower, and Erie Dining Hall (now closed); In 1970, Pei and Cobb returned to Fredonia to construct the second suite-style residence halls of Hemingway, Schulz, Igoe, and Hendrix.\n\nIn the early 1970s a second addition was made to Mason Hall (including practice rooms), science building Houghton Hall, and multi-discipline Thompson Hall.  In 1981, construction was finally begun on the long-awaited major indoor sports facility, Steele Hall, which had been delayed for nearly nine years due to state funding difficulties throughout much of the 1970s.  More recent campus buildings and additions have been the University Commons residence and dining hall, additions to Steele and Mason Halls, and another long-awaited project - the new science building adjoining Houghton Hall. A stadium for athletics - mainly soccer and lacrosse - which included an upgraded, lighted playing field, was recently built over the existing playing fields.\n\n===Presidents===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"150px\"|President\n! width=\"90px\"|Tenure\n!Notes\n|-\n|Joseph A.

Pei and Henry Cobb designed the master plan for the modernized campus in 1968. Many of the buildings are listed in architectural guides as examples of exceptional modern architecture. Some are described in architectural history books. The National Building Museum listed the SUNY Fredonia campus as one of I.M. Pei's ideal places to visit in its 1991 journal \"Blueprints.\"<ref>Campus bears unique stamp of I.M. Pei's vision, SUNY Fredonia News Services, Accessed 6/16/07, http://www.fredonia.edu/news/News/Archives/tabid/1101/ctl/ArticleView/mid/1878/articleId/84/Campus-bears-unique-stamp-of-IM-Peis-vision.aspx</ref>\n\nPei is credited with designing Maytum Hall, Williams Center, Reed Library, Rockefeller Arts Center, and McEwen Hall, as well as its characteristic circular perimeter road, aptly named Ring Road. The design of Daniel Reed Library earned Henry Cobb and I.M.

It is approximately the size of a regulation football field, provides seating for over 850 readers, and houses over 250,000 books. It is named for the late [[Daniel A. Reed]] (1875\u20131959), [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from the Fredonia area for over 40 years. A four-story addition to Reed Library was constructed in 1992, which includes several study areas, a scholarship center, atrium, elevators, tower study lounge which leads to a fifth story, and the Tutoring Center. The mission of the Reed Library is \"to provide quality services and to collect, organize, disseminate, teach, and facilitate access to information in support of the curricular needs of SUNY Fredonia's students and faculty, as well as the intellectual needs of the broader SUNY Fredonia community.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredonia.edu/library/about/mission.asp\n|title=Mission {{!}} State University of New York at Fredonia |date=2009-01-07 |author=Reed Library Faculty}}</ref>\n*'''Michael C. Rockefeller Arts Center''', constructed in 1968, is named after the youngest son of former [[Governor]] [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], who disappeared in 1961 during an anthropological expedition in [[New Guinea]]. Designed by I.M. Pei and Partners, Rockefeller Arts Center includes King Concert Hall (a 1,200-seat concert hall), Marvel Theatre (a 400-seat proscenium theatre), Alice E. Bartlett Theatre (a 200-seat maximum black box theatre), an art gallery, and 24 classrooms. This building houses the Department of Theatre and Dance, and the Department of Visual Arts and New Media. The arts center was opened in 1968 by Clint Norton as its first Managing Director. He was followed by Robert B. D'Angelo who served from 1970 to 1974 while he also served as a speech writer and adviser to then Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Following D'Angelo in the directorship were Ted Dede, Nancy Palmer, Katherine Rushworth and Radford Thomas. Jefferson Westwood has served as director since 1982.\n*'''Fenton Hall''' was named for the late [[Reuben Fenton]], U.S. Senator, and Governor, who was born in Carroll, Chautauqua County. Fenton Hall houses the office of the University President, the Graduate Studies office, as well as classrooms, academic departments and Sprout Caf\u00e9. Computer Science, Modern Languages, English, and Philosophy are some of the departments located in Fenton.\n*'''Mason Hall''' is home to the School of Music and was named after American music education pioneer [[Lowell Mason]]. This hall is actually three buildings, \"Old Mason\" (The oldest building on the present-day campus site), \"New Mason,\" and the recent addition of two rehearsal rooms, which are all connected together. Mason Hall includes over 100 personal practice rooms, several small ensemble practice rooms, and large ensemble rooms. Both Juliet J. Rosch Recital Hall and Diers Recital Hall are located here, as well as two state-of-the-art MIDI technology labs, and an extensive Studio Recording Department.\n*'''Maytum Hall''' is an eight-story, semi-circular office building and computer center, and was named after Arthur Maytum (1866\u20131953). He served as Chairman of the Board of Visitors of the Fredonia Normal School and Teachers college from 1928 to 1953. He also served as supervisor of the Town of Pomfret from 1931 to 1938. There is much speculation as to how many stories Maytum hall contains. Many contend that the central offices, along with the elevator stop at floor eight, and so should the floor count. However, the original president office was to be on the constructed ninth floor, but was moved due to lack of handicap access, along with a fear of riots shutting the president in during the late 1960s/early 1970s nationwide period of fervent student activism . When walking from Thompson or Fenton, you can see the very large patio window of the ninth floor. The building reopened in the Spring 2013 semester and features an all-new decor, new office partitions, data communication systems, and an upgraded sprinkler and ventilation system.\n*'''Steele Hall''' is mainly used as a sports center with a basketball court, indoor track, and an ice rink which are used for both campus and community events. It also contains classrooms, a newly constructed natatorium, raquetball courts, dancing practice rooms, and many other facilities.\n*'''Thompson Hall''' is the largest academic building at SUNY Fredonia. It houses the departments of Multicultural Affairs, Psychology, Political Science, Speech Pathology, Sociology, Business Administration, History, plus the College of Education. The building, planned during the period of nationwide campus upheavals in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was designed to be riot-proof, with its narrow stairwells, dimly lighted hallways, and no operable windows.\n*'''Houghton Hall and Jewett Hall''' are the two science buildings at SUNY Fredonia. They house the departments of Geology, Physics, Chemistry, and Biochemistry, and the 3-2 Cooperative Engineering Program.\n*'''LoGrasso Hall''' On campus medical services, along with counseling, and the office of international education.\n*'''McEwen Hall''' Four-level building, Contains lecture halls, Sheldon Media Labs, and Fredonia Radio Systems (WCVF-FM).\n*'''College Lodge''' operated by the Faculty Student Association at SUNY Fredonia \u2013 is a certified experiential training facility and conference and events center that offers a variety of workforce development, employee training, meetings and other services for businesses and organizations.

The incubator combines these resources and those of Fredonia, state and local government, area businesses, and the community in order to graduate businesses that are financially viable and freestanding.\n\n==Rankings==\n[[U.S. News and World Report]]'s 2016 edition of America's Best Colleges ranked Fredonia 66th on their list of Regional Universities (North). Fredonia's graduate program in Speech-Language Pathology is ranked 163rd.\n\n==Academic schools==\nThe university is organized into 3 colleges and 1 school:\n\n*College of Visual and Performing Arts\n*College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n*College of Education\n*School of Business\n\n==Residence halls==\nSUNY Fredonia has 14 residence halls. These halls consist of four single-sex and ten coeducational buildings. (Grissom Hall became co-Ed Fall 2016). Students also have a choice of building style: corridor, suite, kitchen-suite, or independent living. Corridor style residence halls are long, staggered hallways with no sections, whereas suites are short corridors with either staggered hallways extending from the main corridor, or doors leading into the individual suites. All rooms are double rooms though University Commons does have single rooms.\n\n==On campus student media==\n[[WCVF-FM]] is a public FM radio station located in McEwen Hall, broadcasting from the top of Maytum Hall on campus. Licensed to the State University of New York at Fredonia, the station broadcasts on 88.9&nbsp;MHz on the FM dial. \"CVF\" stands for \"Campus and Community Voice of Fredonia,\" the station's slogan. The station primarily features \"alternative\" rock, but includes an eclectic mix of genres at consistent times throughout the week.

WCVF-FM has a sister station WDVL which broadcasts via internet streaming and a local cable channel.\n\n''The Normal Leader'' was created in September 1899 by the Zetesian society, an all-male literary organization. ''The Normal Leader'' was a monthly newspaper, costing ten cents a copy or fifty cents for a yearly subscription. On September 28, 1936 ''The Normal Leader'' became ''The Leader'' on its Vol. XXXVI article No. 3 even though the school would not change its name to SUNY Fredonia until 1948. ''The Leader'' is produced by a team of Fredonia students, some of whom receive stipends from the Student Association. ''The Leader'' is printed by the ''Corry Journal'' in Corry, Pennsylvania and is distributed free on campus and in the surrounding community. Today, The Leader features mainly news which is pertinent to the SUNY Fredonia campus and community. This weekly publication comes out every Wednesday during the academic year and can be found around the SUNY Fredonia Campus.\n\n''[[WNYF-TV|WNYF]]'' is the [[Student television station]] of the University. WNYF is sponsored by the Student Association, and was founded in 1979 by two [[communications]] students. WNYF's programming includes student-produced programs ranging from entertainment, music, [[Educational television]] and even a student-written [[soap opera]]. In the station's first few months of existence, it began televising the annual [[dance marathon]] that raised funds for [[muscular dystrophy]].

It is a constituent college of the [[State University of New York]]. Founded in 1826, it is the 66th oldest institute of higher education in the United States, 7th oldest college in New York, and 2nd oldest public school in New York (SUNY) after Potsdam (1816).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.4icu.org/us/oldest/|title=Oldest Universities in the United States {{!}} by foundation year|website=www.4icu.org|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref>\n\nFredonia was one of the state [[normal school|teachers' colleges]] traditionally specializing in music education, but now offers many programs in many areas, including a growing graduate division. The most popular areas of study include science, communication, music, education, and the social sciences. There are 82 majors and 41 minors.\n\nThe Fredonia campus, located in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]] (southwest of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]) was designed by prominent architects [[I.M. Pei]] and [[Henry N. Cobb]] in 1968.<ref>[http://www.pcf-p.com/a/i/ Pei, Cobb, Freed & Partners Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315220319/http://www.pcf-p.com/a/i/ |date=2015-03-15 }}, Accessed 6/14/2007</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Fredonia Academy (1826\u20131867)===\nOpened in 1826 as '''Fredonia Academy''' under its first principal Austin Smith, the academy enrolled eight students. The first classes began on October 4, 1826. Within one year the Academy had 136 students, 81 boys and 55 girls.<ref>[http://www.fredonia.edu/175thanniversary/history.htm Academy to State University: Fredonia's Story] Written by William Chazanof, Accessed 6/16/2007</ref> In 1827 it was a state normal school.<ref name=\"Anderson2015\">{{cite book|author=Keith Anderson|title=The Los Angeles State Normal School, UCLA's Forgotten Past: 1881-1919|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Jp5CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA175|date=29 August 2015|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-329-31719-2|pages=175\u2013}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe Academy reached peak enrollment in 1856 with 217 students. The school was plagued by financial shortages and was forced to close its doors in 1867.\n\n===Normal School (1867\u20131948)===\nIn 1867, the college re-emerged for its second phase of existence, as a New York State Normal School. On December 2, 1867, the Normal (as it became commonly known) began classes with 147 students, 62 boys and 85 girls. For students preparing to be teachers, no tuition was charged, books were supplied, and travel costs were reimbursed; in return, students had to promise to teach after graduation. Those students not studying for the teaching profession paid tuition and provided their own textbooks.\n\nDuring its 82 years, Fredonia Normal had a tumultuous existence. With a fluctuating student enrollment and threats of state funding reductions, the school seemed to be in constant jeopardy of closing.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Nonetheless, gradually the school was upgraded. In 1930, {{convert|58|acre|m2}} of land west of Central Avenue in the Village of Fredonia were bought to house a future campus. In 1938, music building (Mason Hall) was the first to be constructed on the Central Avenue site. New York State Governor Herbert Lehman signed the Feinberg Law in 1942 that changed the Normal Schools into Teacher Colleges, statewide.\n\n===State University System (1948\u2013present)===\nWith the formation of the State University of New York on March 13, 1948, the college created a Division of the Humanities in 1958, and in 1960 Fredonia was selected by State University to grant the A.B. degree. Previously, Fredonia's curriculum was restricted for teacher training only.\n\nFrom the 1940s through the early 1960s, additional buildings were erected: Fenton Hall (administration), Jewett Hall (sciences), Dods Hall (physical education and athletics), an addition to Mason Hall, and residence halls Gregory, Alumni, McGinnies, Chautauqua, and Nixon.\n\nIn 1968, the master plan for the modern Central Avenue campus was drafted by the highly respected architectural firm of [[I.M. Pei]] & Partners of New York at the request of then-president Oscar E. Lanford. A complex came into being that consisted of the Rockefeller Arts Center (building for fine arts), Maytum Hall (administration), Daniel A. Reed Library, McEwen Hall, Campus Center student union (now Williams Center), Houghton Hall (sciences), and LoGrasso Medical Center (infirmary). Maytum Hall, McEwen Hall (lecture rooms), Reed Library, and the Williams Center were all inter-connected, including an elevated walkway connecting McEwen Hall and the Williams Center. Also included in the plan were the suite-style residence halls Kasling, Disney, Grissom, Eisenhower, and Erie Dining Hall (now closed); In 1970, Pei and Cobb returned to Fredonia to construct the second suite-style residence halls of Hemingway, Schulz, Igoe, and Hendrix.\n\nIn the early 1970s a second addition was made to Mason Hall (including practice rooms), science building Houghton Hall, and multi-discipline Thompson Hall.  In 1981, construction was finally begun on the long-awaited major indoor sports facility, Steele Hall, which had been delayed for nearly nine years due to state funding difficulties throughout much of the 1970s.  More recent campus buildings and additions have been the University Commons residence and dining hall, additions to Steele and Mason Halls, and another long-awaited project - the new science building adjoining Houghton Hall. A stadium for athletics - mainly soccer and lacrosse - which included an upgraded, lighted playing field, was recently built over the existing playing fields.\n\n===Presidents===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"150px\"|President\n! width=\"90px\"|Tenure\n!Notes\n|-\n|Joseph A.

Pei and Henry Cobb designed the master plan for the modernized campus in 1968. Many of the buildings are listed in architectural guides as examples of exceptional modern architecture. Some are described in architectural history books. The National Building Museum listed the SUNY Fredonia campus as one of I.M. Pei's ideal places to visit in its 1991 journal \"Blueprints.\"<ref>Campus bears unique stamp of I.M. Pei's vision, SUNY Fredonia News Services, Accessed 6/16/07, http://www.fredonia.edu/news/News/Archives/tabid/1101/ctl/ArticleView/mid/1878/articleId/84/Campus-bears-unique-stamp-of-IM-Peis-vision.aspx</ref>\n\nPei is credited with designing Maytum Hall, Williams Center, Reed Library, Rockefeller Arts Center, and McEwen Hall, as well as its characteristic circular perimeter road, aptly named Ring Road. The design of Daniel Reed Library earned Henry Cobb and I.M.

It is approximately the size of a regulation football field, provides seating for over 850 readers, and houses over 250,000 books. It is named for the late [[Daniel A. Reed]] (1875\u20131959), [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from the Fredonia area for over 40 years. A four-story addition to Reed Library was constructed in 1992, which includes several study areas, a scholarship center, atrium, elevators, tower study lounge which leads to a fifth story, and the Tutoring Center. The mission of the Reed Library is \"to provide quality services and to collect, organize, disseminate, teach, and facilitate access to information in support of the curricular needs of SUNY Fredonia's students and faculty, as well as the intellectual needs of the broader SUNY Fredonia community.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredonia.edu/library/about/mission.asp\n|title=Mission {{!}} State University of New York at Fredonia |date=2009-01-07 |author=Reed Library Faculty}}</ref>\n*'''Michael C. Rockefeller Arts Center''', constructed in 1968, is named after the youngest son of former [[Governor]] [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], who disappeared in 1961 during an anthropological expedition in [[New Guinea]]. Designed by I.M. Pei and Partners, Rockefeller Arts Center includes King Concert Hall (a 1,200-seat concert hall), Marvel Theatre (a 400-seat proscenium theatre), Alice E. Bartlett Theatre (a 200-seat maximum black box theatre), an art gallery, and 24 classrooms. This building houses the Department of Theatre and Dance, and the Department of Visual Arts and New Media. The arts center was opened in 1968 by Clint Norton as its first Managing Director. He was followed by Robert B. D'Angelo who served from 1970 to 1974 while he also served as a speech writer and adviser to then Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller. Following D'Angelo in the directorship were Ted Dede, Nancy Palmer, Katherine Rushworth and Radford Thomas. Jefferson Westwood has served as director since 1982.\n*'''Fenton Hall''' was named for the late [[Reuben Fenton]], U.S. Senator, and Governor, who was born in Carroll, Chautauqua County. Fenton Hall houses the office of the University President, the Graduate Studies office, as well as classrooms, academic departments and Sprout Caf\u00e9. Computer Science, Modern Languages, English, and Philosophy are some of the departments located in Fenton.\n*'''Mason Hall''' is home to the School of Music and was named after American music education pioneer [[Lowell Mason]]. This hall is actually three buildings, \"Old Mason\" (The oldest building on the present-day campus site), \"New Mason,\" and the recent addition of two rehearsal rooms, which are all connected together. Mason Hall includes over 100 personal practice rooms, several small ensemble practice rooms, and large ensemble rooms. Both Juliet J. Rosch Recital Hall and Diers Recital Hall are located here, as well as two state-of-the-art MIDI technology labs, and an extensive Studio Recording Department.\n*'''Maytum Hall''' is an eight-story, semi-circular office building and computer center, and was named after Arthur Maytum (1866\u20131953). He served as Chairman of the Board of Visitors of the Fredonia Normal School and Teachers college from 1928 to 1953. He also served as supervisor of the Town of Pomfret from 1931 to 1938. There is much speculation as to how many stories Maytum hall contains. Many contend that the central offices, along with the elevator stop at floor eight, and so should the floor count. However, the original president office was to be on the constructed ninth floor, but was moved due to lack of handicap access, along with a fear of riots shutting the president in during the late 1960s/early 1970s nationwide period of fervent student activism . When walking from Thompson or Fenton, you can see the very large patio window of the ninth floor. The building reopened in the Spring 2013 semester and features an all-new decor, new office partitions, data communication systems, and an upgraded sprinkler and ventilation system.\n*'''Steele Hall''' is mainly used as a sports center with a basketball court, indoor track, and an ice rink which are used for both campus and community events. It also contains classrooms, a newly constructed natatorium, raquetball courts, dancing practice rooms, and many other facilities.\n*'''Thompson Hall''' is the largest academic building at SUNY Fredonia. It houses the departments of Multicultural Affairs, Psychology, Political Science, Speech Pathology, Sociology, Business Administration, History, plus the College of Education. The building, planned during the period of nationwide campus upheavals in the late 1960s and early 1970s, was designed to be riot-proof, with its narrow stairwells, dimly lighted hallways, and no operable windows.\n*'''Houghton Hall and Jewett Hall''' are the two science buildings at SUNY Fredonia. They house the departments of Geology, Physics, Chemistry, and Biochemistry, and the 3-2 Cooperative Engineering Program.\n*'''LoGrasso Hall''' On campus medical services, along with counseling, and the office of international education.\n*'''McEwen Hall''' Four-level building, Contains lecture halls, Sheldon Media Labs, and Fredonia Radio Systems (WCVF-FM).\n*'''College Lodge''' operated by the Faculty Student Association at SUNY Fredonia \u2013 is a certified experiential training facility and conference and events center that offers a variety of workforce development, employee training, meetings and other services for businesses and organizations. Located in Brocton, NY,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.collegelodge.com/about.aspx| title=About the College Lodge| publisher=Faculty Student Association of State University College at Fredonia| accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref> surrounded by 198 acres of mostly wooded, natural surroundings in Chautauqua County.\n*'''Technology Incubator''' Fredonia Technology Incubator promotes economic growth in the Western Southern Tier of New York by supporting entrepreneurship and the development of new, innovative, technology-based companies into successful business ventures.

Fredonia's graduate program in Speech-Language Pathology is ranked 163rd.\n\n==Academic schools==\nThe university is organized into 3 colleges and 1 school:\n\n*College of Visual and Performing Arts\n*College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n*College of Education\n*School of Business\n\n==Residence halls==\nSUNY Fredonia has 14 residence halls. These halls consist of four single-sex and ten coeducational buildings. (Grissom Hall became co-Ed Fall 2016). Students also have a choice of building style: corridor, suite, kitchen-suite, or independent living. Corridor style residence halls are long, staggered hallways with no sections, whereas suites are short corridors with either staggered hallways extending from the main corridor, or doors leading into the individual suites. All rooms are double rooms though University Commons does have single rooms.\n\n==On campus student media==\n[[WCVF-FM]] is a public FM radio station located in McEwen Hall, broadcasting from the top of Maytum Hall on campus. Licensed to the State University of New York at Fredonia, the station broadcasts on 88.9&nbsp;MHz on the FM dial. \"CVF\" stands for \"Campus and Community Voice of Fredonia,\" the station's slogan. The station primarily features \"alternative\" rock, but includes an eclectic mix of genres at consistent times throughout the week. Listeners can catch blocks of Polka, Spanish, Blues, Jazz, Folk, Reggae, Hip Hop and anything in between. Live programs hosted by student and community jocks can be of any format/genre from talk, music, to radio drama.

WCVF-FM has a sister station WDVL which broadcasts via internet streaming and a local cable channel.\n\n''The Normal Leader'' was created in September 1899 by the Zetesian society, an all-male literary organization. ''The Normal Leader'' was a monthly newspaper, costing ten cents a copy or fifty cents for a yearly subscription. On September 28, 1936 ''The Normal Leader'' became ''The Leader'' on its Vol. XXXVI article No. 3 even though the school would not change its name to SUNY Fredonia until 1948. ''The Leader'' is produced by a team of Fredonia students, some of whom receive stipends from the Student Association. ''The Leader'' is printed by the ''Corry Journal'' in Corry, Pennsylvania and is distributed free on campus and in the surrounding community. Today, The Leader features mainly news which is pertinent to the SUNY Fredonia campus and community. This weekly publication comes out every Wednesday during the academic year and can be found around the SUNY Fredonia Campus.\n\n''[[WNYF-TV|WNYF]]'' is the [[Student television station]] of the University. WNYF is sponsored by the Student Association, and was founded in 1979 by two [[communications]] students. WNYF's programming includes student-produced programs ranging from entertainment, music, [[Educational television]] and even a student-written [[soap opera]].

Two master's degrees are available through the college's graduate institute: one in Liberal Arts, which is a modified version of the undergraduate curriculum (differing mostly in that the graduate students are not restricted to a set sequence of courses), and one in Eastern Classics, which applies most of the features of the undergraduate curriculum (seminars, preceptorials, language study and a set sequence of courses) to a list of classic works from India, China and Japan.

The college always maintained a small size, generally enrolling fewer than 500 men at a time.\n\nIn its early years, the college was at least nominally [[public university|public]]\u2014the college's founders had envisaged it as the [[Western Shore]] branch of a proposed \u201c[[University of Maryland]]\u201d but a lack of enthusiasm from the [[Maryland General Assembly]] and its [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] counterpart, [[Washington College (Maryland)|Washington College]], made this largely a paper institution. After years of inconsistent funding and litigation, the college accepted a smaller annual grant in lieu of being funded through the state's annual appropriations process.  During the Civil War, the college closed and its campus was used as a military hospital. In 1907 it became the undergraduate college of a loosely organized \"University of Maryland\" that included the [[University of Maryland at Baltimore|professional schools located in Baltimore]]. By 1920, when Maryland State College (founded in 1857 as Maryland Agricultural College) became the [[University of Maryland at College Park]], St. John's was a free-standing private institution.<ref name=\"St. John's College Press\"/>\n\nThe college curriculum has taken various forms throughout its history. It began with a general program of study in the liberal arts, but St. John's was a [[military school]] for much of the late 19th century and early 20th century.  It ended [[compulsory military training]] with [[Enoch Barton Garey|Major Enoch Garey's]] accession as president in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/local/annapolis-past-to-present-military-life-at-st-john-s/article_38a185cf-9d7f-54cb-a830-ec5265a08a13.html \n|work= The Capital\n|title=Annapolis, past to present: Military life at St. John's \n|last= Doyel\n|first= Ginger\n|date=2003-04-02\n|accessdate=2013-04-27 \n|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628203140/http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/local/annapolis-past-to-present-military-life-at-st-john-s/article_38a185cf-9d7f-54cb-a830-ec5265a08a13.html |archivedate=2013-06-28 \n}}</ref>\nGarey and the Navy instituted a [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] unit in September 1924, creating the first-ever collegiate Department of [[Naval Science]] in the United States.

They introduced a new program of study, which remains in effect today. Buchanan became dean of the college, while Barr assumed its presidency. In his guide ''Cool Colleges'', Donald Asher writes that the New Program was implemented to save the college from closing: \"Several benefactors convinced the college to reject a watered-down curriculum in favor of becoming a very distinctive academic community. Thus this great institution was reborn as a survival measure.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Asher|title=Cool Colleges|year=2007|publisher=Ten Speed Press|page=123|isbn=1-58008-839-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, [[Walter Lippman]] wrote a column praising liberal arts education as a bulwark against fascism, and said \"in the future, men will point to St. John's College and say that there was the seed-bed of the American renaissance.\"<ref name=\"radical\">Charles A.

They were sold to the general public as well as to students, and by 1941 the St. John's College bookshop was famous as the only source for English translations of works such as [[Copernicus]]'s ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s ''[[De Musica]]'', and [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.\n\nThe wartime years were difficult for the all-male St. John's. Enlistment and the draft all but emptied the college; 15 seniors graduated in 1943, eight in 1945, and three in 1946.<ref name=\"radical\"/> From 1940 to 1946, St. John's was repeatedly confronted with threats of its land being seized by the Navy for expansion of the neighboring [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]], and [[James Forrestal]], Secretary of the Navy, formally announced plans to do so in 1945. At the time, ''[[The New York Times]]'', which had expected a legal battle royale comparable to the [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|1819 ''Dartmouth'' case]], commented that \"although a small college of fewer than 200 students, St. John's has, because of its experimental liberal arts program, received more publicity and been the center of a greater academic controversy than most other colleges in the land. Its best-books program has been attacked and praised by leading educators of the day.\"<ref>\"St. John's and Navy Facing Fight In Courts Over College's Campus\", June 29, 1945, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe constant threat of eviction discouraged Stringfellow Barr. In late 1946 Forrestal withdrew the plan to take over St. John's in the face of public opposition and the disapproval of the [[House Naval Affairs Committee]], but Barr and Scott Buchanan were already committed to leaving St. John's and launching [[Liberal Arts, Inc.]], a new, similar college in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]]; that project eventually failed\u2014but thinking about other sites for the college eventually led to the opening of St. John's second campus in Santa Fe in 1964.\n\nSt John's had been founded as an all-white institution and continued as such in the early years of the New Program, with Barr actively discouraging Black students from applying.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=J. Winfree |title=A Search for the Liberal College: The Beginning of the St. John's Program |date=1983 |publisher=St. John's College Press |location=Annapolis, MD}}</ref> However, by 1948 faculty and student sentiment had shifted and students, with the support of the faculty and administration, persuaded a reluctant Board of Visitors and Governors to integrate the college and St. John's became the one of the first previously all-white colleges south of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to admit Black students voluntarily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjca.edu/asp/alumAssocMain.aspx?page=6834 |title=\"Letter from Martin A.

Weigle became president of St. John's. Following the chaotic and difficult period from 1940 to 1949, Weigle's presidency continued for 31 years,<ref>\"Richard Weigle, 80, Served as President Of St. John's College\" (Obituary), ''The New York Times'', December 17, 1992, p. B22.</ref> during which time the New Program and the college itself became well established.\n\nIn 1951, St. John's became [[coeducational]], admitting women for the first time in its then-254-year history. There was some objection from students because they had not been involved in\u2014nor even aware of\u2014the decision before it was announced to the media, and from some who believed that the college could not remain a serious institution were it to admit women. Martin Dyer reported that women who were admitted quickly proved they were the academic and intellectual equals of their male counterparts. As enrollment grew during the 1950s, and facing the coming larger [[Baby boomer|baby-boom generation]], thoughts turned again towards opening another campus\u2014but this time in addition to, not instead of, the one in Annapolis. Serious talk of expansion began in 1959 when the father of a student from [[Monterey, California]], suggested to President Weigle that he establish a new campus there. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ran an article on the college's possible expansion plans,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895177-1,00.html \"College Spawns College\"], ''Time Magazine'', December 26, 1960, accessed April 28, 2007</ref> and in addition to California, 32 offers came in to the college from [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alaska]], [[Florida]], [[Connecticut]], and other states. A group from the [[Monterey Peninsula]] told Weigle that they were definitely interested, though funding was a problem, and suitable land was a big question. There was also an offer of land in [[Claremont, California]], but competition with the other colleges there for students and financial contributions was a negative. The Riverside [[The Mission Inn Hotel & Spa|Mission Inn]] (in [[Riverside, California]]) was another possibility, but with only {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land and lots of renovations needed to the inn, funding was again a major question.\n\nNevertheless, all three locations were major contenders, when Robert McKinney (publisher of ''[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]]'' and a former SJC board member) called and told Weigle that a group of city leaders had long been looking for another college for Santa Fe. At a lunch Weigle attended at [[John Gaw Meem]]'s house on the outskirts of Santa Fe in late January 1961, Meem volunteered that he had a little piece of land ({{convert|214|acre|km2}}) that he would gladly donate to the college. Upon looking at it after lunch, Weigle instantly fell in love with it. A committee of four faculty members (Robert Bart, Barbara Leonard, Douglas Allanbrook, and William Darkey) then visited all four sites (the three in California, and Santa Fe) and, after much deliberation, recommended Santa Fe.<ref>\"The Colonization of a College: The Beginnings and Early History of St. John's College in Santa Fe\", by Richard D. Weigle, Fishergate Publishing Company (St. John's College Print Shop), Annapolis, 1985</ref>\n\nWestern mystery writer [[Tony Hillerman]] tells a slightly different story: The site selection committee, having originally expected to locate in Claremont, reluctantly accepted an invitation to inspect the site in Santa Fe. Hillerman says of the committeemen:{{quote|made pale from the weak sun of the coastal climate and their scholarly profession, generally urban, generally Eastern, solidly W.A.S.P. They came from a world which was old Anglo-Saxon family, old books, Greek and Latin literacy, prep schools and Blue Point oysters and Ivy League; a world bounded on the north by Boston... and on the south by Virginia.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Hillerman| date=2001|title=\"The Committee and the Mule Deer\", and from ''The Great Taos Bank Robbery: And Other True Stories of the Southwest| publisher=Harper| isbn =0-06-093712-2|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0060937122}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1961, the governing board of St. John's thus approved plans to establish a second college at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. Groundbreaking occurred on April 22, 1963, and the first classes began in 1964. As it turned out, shortly afterwards land was also donated to the college on the Monterey Peninsula, on condition that a campus be developed there by a certain date.\n\n==Academics==\n===Great Books program===\nThe [[Great Books]] program (often called simply \"the Program\" or \"the New Program\" at St. John's) was developed at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]], and [[Mortimer Adler]] in the mid-1930s as an alternative form of education to the then rapidly changing undergraduate curriculum. St. John's adopted the Great Books program in 1937, when the college was facing the possibility of financial and academic ruin. The Great Books program in use today was also heavily influenced by [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]], who was dean of the college in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe four-year program of study, nearly all of which is mandatory, requires that students read and discuss the works of many of Western civilization's most prominent contributors to philosophy, theology, mathematics, science, music, poetry, and literature. Tutorials (mathematics, language, and music), as well as seminar and laboratory, are discussion-based. In the mathematics tutorial students often demonstrate propositions that mathematicians throughout various ages have laid out. In the language tutorial student translations are presented (ancient Greek is studied in the first two years and French for the last two). The tutorials, with seminar and laboratory, constitute the classes. All classes, and in particular the seminar, are considered formal exercises; consequently, students address one another, as well as their teachers, by their honorific and last name during class.\n\nSt. John's avoids modern textbooks, lectures, and examinations, in favor of a series of manuals. While [[Academic grading in the United States#Numerical and letter grades|traditional (A to F) grades]] are given and provided on transcripts, the culture of the school de-emphasizes their importance and grades are released only at the request of the student. Grading is based largely on class participation and papers. Tutors, as faculty members are called at the college, play a non-directive role in the classroom, compared to mainstream colleges. However, at St. John's this varies by course and instructor. Class size is small on both campuses, with a student to tutor ratio of 7:1. Seminar is the largest class, with around 20 students, but led by two tutors. Daytime tutorials are smaller, typically ranging between 12 and 16 students and are led by one tutor. Preceptorials are the smallest class size, ranging between 3 and 9 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/about/quickfacts.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310231645/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/about/quickfacts.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe Program involves:\n* Four years of literature, philosophy, and political science in seminar\n* Four years of mathematics\n* Three years of laboratory science\n* Four years of language (Ancient Greek, Middle/Early English, and French)\n* Freshman year chorus followed by sophomore year music\n\nThe Great Books are not the only texts used at St. John's. Greek and French classes make use of supplemental materials that are more like traditional textbooks. Science laboratory courses and mathematics courses use manuals prepared by faculty members that combine source materials with workbook exercises. For example, the mathematics tutorial combines a 1905 paper by [[Albert Einstein]] with exercises that require the student to work through the mathematics used in the paper.<ref>Harty, Rosemary (2005), Director of Communications, St. John's College, Annapolis, personal communication (Source details of non-Great-Books materials used at St. John's)</ref>\n\n===Reading list===\nAlthough it varies from year to year and differs slightly between campuses, the '''Great Books reading list''' is the basis of the school's curriculum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/great-books-reading-list|title=St. John's College {{!}} Reading List|website=www.sjc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjc.edu/download_file/view/4724/3440|title=Great Books reading list in pdf format|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\n====Freshman year====\n{{div col}}\n* [[Homer]]: ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]''\n* [[Aeschylus]]: ''[[The Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|Libation Bearers]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]'', ''[[Prometheus Bound]]''\n* [[Sophocles]]: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]'', ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]''\n* [[Thucydides]]: ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian War]]''\n* [[Euripides]]: ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', ''[[The Bacchae]]''\n* [[Herodotus]]: ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]''\n* [[Aristophanes]]: ''[[The Clouds|Clouds]]'', ''[[The Frogs|Frogs]]''\n* [[Plato]]: ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]'', ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''\n* [[Aristotle]]: ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ''[[Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', ''[[On the Generation of Animals|Generation of Animals]]'' \n* [[Euclid]]: ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''\n* [[Lucretius]]: ''[[On the Nature of Things]]''\n* [[Plutarch]]: \"Lycurgus\" and \"Solon\" from the ''[[Parallel Lives]]''\n* [[Ptolemy]]: ''[[Almagest]]''\n* [[Blaise Pascal]]: ''[[Blaise Pascal#Contributions to the physical sciences|Treatise on the Equilibrium of Liquids]]''\n* [[Nicomachus]]: ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic|Arithmetic]]''\n* [[Antoine Lavoisier]]: ''[[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie|Elements of Chemistry]]''\n* [[William Harvey]]: ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|Motion of the Heart and Blood]]''\n* Essays by: [[Archimedes]], [[Gabriel Fahrenheit]], [[Amedeo Avogadro]], [[John Dalton]], [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], [[Edme Mariotte]], [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch]], [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], [[Hans Spemann]], [[Guy Beckley Stearns]], [[J.

The size and scope of the Institute have expanded so that currently both the Annapolis and Santa Fe campuses offer year-round graduate-level study based on the principles of the St. John's undergraduate program. Students in the Liberal Arts program explore the persisting questions of human existence by studying classic works of the western tradition. This program is organized into five semester-long thematic segments: Philosophy and Theology, Politics and Society, Literature, Mathematics and Natural Science, and History. Students earn a Master of Arts in Liberal Arts (MALA) by completing four of these five segments. A common curriculum provides the basis for a shared intellectual community; discussion with fellow students and faculty is the mode of learning both inside and outside the classroom. Each semester, students attend a seminar, a tutorial and a preceptorial\u2014all carried out as small-group discussions under the guidance of St. John's faculty members. These three types of classes are the framework of the distinctive St. John's educational experience.\n\n===Eastern Classics program===\nAt the Santa Fe campus, there is a program offering a [[Master of Arts]] in Eastern Classics (MAEC). This program is three semesters long and is designed to be completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program simply could not do justice to the Great Books of the three main Asian traditions ([[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]) by trying to squeeze in a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program therefore provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only [[Confucius]], [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], but also [[Mencius]], [[Xun Zi]], [[Han Feizi]], and [[Mozi]], as well as historical narratives by [[Sima Qian]] and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', the later movement of [[Neo-Confucianism]] and [[Zhu Xi]], narrative works such as ''[[Journey to the West]]'' or the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and the great Chinese poets, [[Li Bai]], [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] and [[Du Fu]]. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of [[Hinduism]] and the development of [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], as well as such literary masterpieces as the [[Mahabharata]], [[Shakuntala]], [[The Tale of Genji]], [[The Narrow Road to the Deep North]] and others. Students also take a language, either [[Sanskrit]] or [[Chinese language|Classical Chinese]].\n\n==Campuses==\n===Annapolis campus===\n[[File:St. John's College, Annapolis, MD.jpg|thumb|Annapolis campus]]\nSt. John's is located in the Historic Annapolis district, one block away from the Maryland State Capitol building. Its proximity to the [[United States Naval Academy]] (across King George Street) has inspired many a comparison to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Sparta]]. The schools carry on a spirited rivalry seen in the annual [[croquet]] match between the two schools on the front lawn of St. John's, which has been called by ''[[GQ]]'' ''\"the purest intercollegiate athletic event in America.\"'' {{As of| 2018}} St. John's has won 29 of the 36 annual matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sjc.edu/annapolis/events/croquet/facts||title=The Annapolis Cup \u2013 Croquet Match Fact Sheet |website=St. John's College |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> About the Johnnies' commitment to the event, one midshipman commented, \"They're out practicing croquet every afternoon!

It was opened in 1964 in response to the increase in qualified applicants at the Annapolis campus. The college chose to open a second campus rather than increase the size of the Annapolis campus. The second campus was part of a larger project, championed by then-college president Richard Weigle, which called for six campuses to be built across the country. St. John's abandoned the concept when it later sold a tract of land it owned in [[Monterey, California]]. The Santa Fe campus offers students a more secluded atmosphere than the Annapolis campus, with the vast [[Pecos Wilderness]] and [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] on its doorstep. The campus also boasts an expansive view of Santa Fe that extends to Los Alamos to the west.\n\nThe college maintains gear to facilitate student use of the outdoors, such as kayaks, rafts, hiking equipment, and sports equipment. Additionally, the college partners with Atalaya Search and Rescue to offer students training in [[search and rescue]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Campus Life in Santa Fe: St. John's College Search and Rescue|url= http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/campuslife/SF/search.shtml |accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the Santa Fe campus has begun initiatives to support programming related to writing and the visual arts.\n\n===Ptolemy Stone===\nBoth campuses have a Ptolemy Stone, an astronomical instrument invented by the ancient Greek astronomer [[Ptolemy]] to measure the [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of celestial bodies, in this case, the sun. The St. John's Ptolemy Stones are outdoor objects with a movable metal dial affixed (a prismical concrete column in [[Annapolis]] and a granite boulder in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]); this device was the precursor to the [[sextant]]. Freshman and sophomore math classes learn to use this stone to calculate the movement of the sun along the [[ecliptic]]. The students' use of the Ptolemy Stones underscores the mathematics and laboratory programs' connection to the practical experimentation and hands-on experience of the natural world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjca.edu |title=St. John's College &#124; Liberal Arts College with a World-Class Faculty |website=Sjca.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Student body==\nWithin the Class of 2022, 36 U.S. states and 15 countries are represented.

Davidoff, M.D., a graduate of St. John's in 1969 and of Columbia Medical School... said the medical schools to which he applied reacted to his unconventional preparation in two ways. \"Those who had not heard of St. John's were not impressed. Those who knew of the college generally waived requirements.\" Like most St. John's alumni who enter medical school, he took an undergraduate course in organic chemistry at another college. Dr. Davidoff... cited only one difficulty in adapting to medical school. \"I didn't have any interesting people to talk to,\" he recalled.<ref>\"Mixing Frogs and Aristotle,\" ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 4, 1975</ref>}}\n\n[[Medical school]] admissions requirements have become significantly more rigorous since 1975, however, and institutions are now unwilling to waive requirements.\n\nMotivational business speaker [[Zig Ziglar]] included a chapter entitled \"St. John's: A College That Works\" in a 1997 book.<ref>Zig Ziglar (1997), ''Something To Smile About: Encouragement And Inspiration For Life's Ups And Downs'', Nelson Books, {{ISBN|0-8407-9183-6}} [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0840791836 A9 online page images]</ref> He said St. John's holds fast to the \"medieval\" notion that all knowledge is one and states that \"the books they use are terribly hard.\" He notes that the school \"ranks fifth nationally in the number of graduates earning doctorates in the humanities\" and is impressed by the 81% of graduates entering education, engineering, law, medicine, and other professions. He concludes \"Sounds like St. John's is onto something. Maybe more schools should take that approach.\" St. John's College is also listed in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.\n\nSt. John's runs counter to the usual emphasis on rankings and selectivity. In the past, St. John's College chose not to participate in any collegiate rankings surveys and did not provide requested survey information. However, the school was still included in many ranking guides. In 2014, Annapolis President Christopher B. Nelson wrote a post to address the issue in his SignPosts for Liberal Education blog: <blockquote>After many years of refusing to participate at all in the rankings generated by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''\u2014one of the most prominent providers of college rankings\u2014St. John's this year submitted statistical information for its survey. This change in practice was prompted by engaged parents who increasingly were asking whether the underlying data about St. John's in ''U.S. News'' was reliable. Since we were not submitting information, we could not vouch for its reliability. Although St. John's would prefer not to be ranked, and has long asked not to be ranked, ''U.S. News'' continued to rank us. We concluded, therefore, that we had to supply statistical data in order to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information ''U.S. News'' was publishing about us.<ref>{{cite web|title = College Rankings \u2013 Ranking the Best Colleges \u2013 Unreliable Rankings|url = http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/09/12/college-rankings-good-judgment/|website = Christopher B.

There is no application fee, and standardized tests, like the [[SAT|Scholastic Assessment Test]], are optional. About three-quarters of the enrolled students ranked in the top half of their high school class, but only one fifth graduated in the top tenth.

The college always maintained a small size, generally enrolling fewer than 500 men at a time.\n\nIn its early years, the college was at least nominally [[public university|public]]\u2014the college's founders had envisaged it as the [[Western Shore]] branch of a proposed \u201c[[University of Maryland]]\u201d but a lack of enthusiasm from the [[Maryland General Assembly]] and its [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]] counterpart, [[Washington College (Maryland)|Washington College]], made this largely a paper institution. After years of inconsistent funding and litigation, the college accepted a smaller annual grant in lieu of being funded through the state's annual appropriations process.  During the Civil War, the college closed and its campus was used as a military hospital. In 1907 it became the undergraduate college of a loosely organized \"University of Maryland\" that included the [[University of Maryland at Baltimore|professional schools located in Baltimore]]. By 1920, when Maryland State College (founded in 1857 as Maryland Agricultural College) became the [[University of Maryland at College Park]], St. John's was a free-standing private institution.<ref name=\"St. John's College Press\"/>\n\nThe college curriculum has taken various forms throughout its history. It began with a general program of study in the liberal arts, but St. John's was a [[military school]] for much of the late 19th century and early 20th century.  It ended [[compulsory military training]] with [[Enoch Barton Garey|Major Enoch Garey's]] accession as president in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/local/annapolis-past-to-present-military-life-at-st-john-s/article_38a185cf-9d7f-54cb-a830-ec5265a08a13.html \n|work= The Capital\n|title=Annapolis, past to present: Military life at St. John's \n|last= Doyel\n|first= Ginger\n|date=2003-04-02\n|accessdate=2013-04-27 \n|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628203140/http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/local/annapolis-past-to-present-military-life-at-st-john-s/article_38a185cf-9d7f-54cb-a830-ec5265a08a13.html |archivedate=2013-06-28 \n}}</ref>\nGarey and the Navy instituted a [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] unit in September 1924, creating the first-ever collegiate Department of [[Naval Science]] in the United States.

They introduced a new program of study, which remains in effect today. Buchanan became dean of the college, while Barr assumed its presidency. In his guide ''Cool Colleges'', Donald Asher writes that the New Program was implemented to save the college from closing: \"Several benefactors convinced the college to reject a watered-down curriculum in favor of becoming a very distinctive academic community.

They were sold to the general public as well as to students, and by 1941 the St. John's College bookshop was famous as the only source for English translations of works such as [[Copernicus]]'s ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s ''[[De Musica]]'', and [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.\n\nThe wartime years were difficult for the all-male St. John's. Enlistment and the draft all but emptied the college; 15 seniors graduated in 1943, eight in 1945, and three in 1946.<ref name=\"radical\"/> From 1940 to 1946, St. John's was repeatedly confronted with threats of its land being seized by the Navy for expansion of the neighboring [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]], and [[James Forrestal]], Secretary of the Navy, formally announced plans to do so in 1945. At the time, ''[[The New York Times]]'', which had expected a legal battle royale comparable to the [[Dartmouth College v. Woodward|1819 ''Dartmouth'' case]], commented that \"although a small college of fewer than 200 students, St. John's has, because of its experimental liberal arts program, received more publicity and been the center of a greater academic controversy than most other colleges in the land. Its best-books program has been attacked and praised by leading educators of the day.\"<ref>\"St. John's and Navy Facing Fight In Courts Over College's Campus\", June 29, 1945, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe constant threat of eviction discouraged Stringfellow Barr. In late 1946 Forrestal withdrew the plan to take over St. John's in the face of public opposition and the disapproval of the [[House Naval Affairs Committee]], but Barr and Scott Buchanan were already committed to leaving St. John's and launching [[Liberal Arts, Inc.]], a new, similar college in [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]]; that project eventually failed\u2014but thinking about other sites for the college eventually led to the opening of St. John's second campus in Santa Fe in 1964.\n\nSt John's had been founded as an all-white institution and continued as such in the early years of the New Program, with Barr actively discouraging Black students from applying.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=J.

Weigle became president of St. John's. Following the chaotic and difficult period from 1940 to 1949, Weigle's presidency continued for 31 years,<ref>\"Richard Weigle, 80, Served as President Of St. John's College\" (Obituary), ''The New York Times'', December 17, 1992, p. B22.</ref> during which time the New Program and the college itself became well established.\n\nIn 1951, St. John's became [[coeducational]], admitting women for the first time in its then-254-year history. There was some objection from students because they had not been involved in\u2014nor even aware of\u2014the decision before it was announced to the media, and from some who believed that the college could not remain a serious institution were it to admit women. Martin Dyer reported that women who were admitted quickly proved they were the academic and intellectual equals of their male counterparts. As enrollment grew during the 1950s, and facing the coming larger [[Baby boomer|baby-boom generation]], thoughts turned again towards opening another campus\u2014but this time in addition to, not instead of, the one in Annapolis. Serious talk of expansion began in 1959 when the father of a student from [[Monterey, California]], suggested to President Weigle that he establish a new campus there. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' ran an article on the college's possible expansion plans,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895177-1,00.html \"College Spawns College\"], ''Time Magazine'', December 26, 1960, accessed April 28, 2007</ref> and in addition to California, 32 offers came in to the college from [[New Hampshire]], [[Oregon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alaska]], [[Florida]], [[Connecticut]], and other states. A group from the [[Monterey Peninsula]] told Weigle that they were definitely interested, though funding was a problem, and suitable land was a big question. There was also an offer of land in [[Claremont, California]], but competition with the other colleges there for students and financial contributions was a negative. The Riverside [[The Mission Inn Hotel & Spa|Mission Inn]] (in [[Riverside, California]]) was another possibility, but with only {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of land and lots of renovations needed to the inn, funding was again a major question.\n\nNevertheless, all three locations were major contenders, when Robert McKinney (publisher of ''[[The Santa Fe New Mexican]]'' and a former SJC board member) called and told Weigle that a group of city leaders had long been looking for another college for Santa Fe. At a lunch Weigle attended at [[John Gaw Meem]]'s house on the outskirts of Santa Fe in late January 1961, Meem volunteered that he had a little piece of land ({{convert|214|acre|km2}}) that he would gladly donate to the college. Upon looking at it after lunch, Weigle instantly fell in love with it. A committee of four faculty members (Robert Bart, Barbara Leonard, Douglas Allanbrook, and William Darkey) then visited all four sites (the three in California, and Santa Fe) and, after much deliberation, recommended Santa Fe.<ref>\"The Colonization of a College: The Beginnings and Early History of St. John's College in Santa Fe\", by Richard D. Weigle, Fishergate Publishing Company (St. John's College Print Shop), Annapolis, 1985</ref>\n\nWestern mystery writer [[Tony Hillerman]] tells a slightly different story: The site selection committee, having originally expected to locate in Claremont, reluctantly accepted an invitation to inspect the site in Santa Fe. Hillerman says of the committeemen:{{quote|made pale from the weak sun of the coastal climate and their scholarly profession, generally urban, generally Eastern, solidly W.A.S.P. They came from a world which was old Anglo-Saxon family, old books, Greek and Latin literacy, prep schools and Blue Point oysters and Ivy League; a world bounded on the north by Boston... and on the south by Virginia.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Hillerman| date=2001|title=\"The Committee and the Mule Deer\", and from ''The Great Taos Bank Robbery: And Other True Stories of the Southwest| publisher=Harper| isbn =0-06-093712-2|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0060937122}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1961, the governing board of St. John's thus approved plans to establish a second college at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. Groundbreaking occurred on April 22, 1963, and the first classes began in 1964. As it turned out, shortly afterwards land was also donated to the college on the Monterey Peninsula, on condition that a campus be developed there by a certain date.\n\n==Academics==\n===Great Books program===\nThe [[Great Books]] program (often called simply \"the Program\" or \"the New Program\" at St. John's) was developed at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Stringfellow Barr]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|Robert Hutchins]], and [[Mortimer Adler]] in the mid-1930s as an alternative form of education to the then rapidly changing undergraduate curriculum. St. John's adopted the Great Books program in 1937, when the college was facing the possibility of financial and academic ruin. The Great Books program in use today was also heavily influenced by [[Jacob Klein (philosopher)|Jacob Klein]], who was dean of the college in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThe four-year program of study, nearly all of which is mandatory, requires that students read and discuss the works of many of Western civilization's most prominent contributors to philosophy, theology, mathematics, science, music, poetry, and literature. Tutorials (mathematics, language, and music), as well as seminar and laboratory, are discussion-based. In the mathematics tutorial students often demonstrate propositions that mathematicians throughout various ages have laid out. In the language tutorial student translations are presented (ancient Greek is studied in the first two years and French for the last two). The tutorials, with seminar and laboratory, constitute the classes. All classes, and in particular the seminar, are considered formal exercises; consequently, students address one another, as well as their teachers, by their honorific and last name during class.\n\nSt. John's avoids modern textbooks, lectures, and examinations, in favor of a series of manuals. While [[Academic grading in the United States#Numerical and letter grades|traditional (A to F) grades]] are given and provided on transcripts, the culture of the school de-emphasizes their importance and grades are released only at the request of the student. Grading is based largely on class participation and papers. Tutors, as faculty members are called at the college, play a non-directive role in the classroom, compared to mainstream colleges. However, at St. John's this varies by course and instructor. Class size is small on both campuses, with a student to tutor ratio of 7:1. Seminar is the largest class, with around 20 students, but led by two tutors. Daytime tutorials are smaller, typically ranging between 12 and 16 students and are led by one tutor. Preceptorials are the smallest class size, ranging between 3 and 9 students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/about/quickfacts.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310231645/http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/about/quickfacts.shtml |archivedate=2009-03-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe Program involves:\n* Four years of literature, philosophy, and political science in seminar\n* Four years of mathematics\n* Three years of laboratory science\n* Four years of language (Ancient Greek, Middle/Early English, and French)\n* Freshman year chorus followed by sophomore year music\n\nThe Great Books are not the only texts used at St. John's. Greek and French classes make use of supplemental materials that are more like traditional textbooks. Science laboratory courses and mathematics courses use manuals prepared by faculty members that combine source materials with workbook exercises. For example, the mathematics tutorial combines a 1905 paper by [[Albert Einstein]] with exercises that require the student to work through the mathematics used in the paper.<ref>Harty, Rosemary (2005), Director of Communications, St. John's College, Annapolis, personal communication (Source details of non-Great-Books materials used at St. John's)</ref>\n\n===Reading list===\nAlthough it varies from year to year and differs slightly between campuses, the '''Great Books reading list''' is the basis of the school's curriculum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjc.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate/great-books-reading-list|title=St. John's College {{!}} Reading List|website=www.sjc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sjc.edu/download_file/view/4724/3440|title=Great Books reading list in pdf format|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\n====Freshman year====\n{{div col}}\n* [[Homer]]: ''[[Iliad]]'', ''[[Odyssey]]''\n* [[Aeschylus]]: ''[[The Oresteia#Agamemnon|Agamemnon]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Libation Bearers|Libation Bearers]]'', ''[[The Oresteia#The Eumenides|The Eumenides]]'', ''[[Prometheus Bound]]''\n* [[Sophocles]]: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', ''[[Philoctetes (Sophocles)|Philoctetes]]'', ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]''\n* [[Thucydides]]: ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian War]]''\n* [[Euripides]]: ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', ''[[The Bacchae]]''\n* [[Herodotus]]: ''[[The Histories of Herodotus|Histories]]''\n* [[Aristophanes]]: ''[[The Clouds|Clouds]]'', ''[[The Frogs|Frogs]]''\n* [[Plato]]: ''[[Meno]]'', ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', ''[[Plato's Republic|Republic]]'', ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''\n* [[Aristotle]]: ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ''[[Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics]]'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', ''[[On Generation and Corruption]]'', ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', ''[[On the Generation of Animals|Generation of Animals]]'' \n* [[Euclid]]: ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''\n* [[Lucretius]]: ''[[On the Nature of Things]]''\n* [[Plutarch]]: \"Lycurgus\" and \"Solon\" from the ''[[Parallel Lives]]''\n* [[Ptolemy]]: ''[[Almagest]]''\n* [[Blaise Pascal]]: ''[[Blaise Pascal#Contributions to the physical sciences|Treatise on the Equilibrium of Liquids]]''\n* [[Nicomachus]]: ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic|Arithmetic]]''\n* [[Antoine Lavoisier]]: ''[[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie|Elements of Chemistry]]''\n* [[William Harvey]]: ''[[Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus|Motion of the Heart and Blood]]''\n* Essays by: [[Archimedes]], [[Gabriel Fahrenheit]], [[Amedeo Avogadro]], [[John Dalton]], [[Stanislao Cannizzaro]], [[Rudolf Virchow]], [[Edme Mariotte]], [[Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch]], [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]], [[Hans Spemann]], [[Guy Beckley Stearns]], [[J.

The size and scope of the Institute have expanded so that currently both the Annapolis and Santa Fe campuses offer year-round graduate-level study based on the principles of the St. John's undergraduate program. Students in the Liberal Arts program explore the persisting questions of human existence by studying classic works of the western tradition. This program is organized into five semester-long thematic segments: Philosophy and Theology, Politics and Society, Literature, Mathematics and Natural Science, and History. Students earn a Master of Arts in Liberal Arts (MALA) by completing four of these five segments. A common curriculum provides the basis for a shared intellectual community; discussion with fellow students and faculty is the mode of learning both inside and outside the classroom. Each semester, students attend a seminar, a tutorial and a preceptorial\u2014all carried out as small-group discussions under the guidance of St. John's faculty members. These three types of classes are the framework of the distinctive St. John's educational experience.\n\n===Eastern Classics program===\nAt the Santa Fe campus, there is a program offering a [[Master of Arts]] in Eastern Classics (MAEC). This program is three semesters long and is designed to be completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program simply could not do justice to the Great Books of the three main Asian traditions ([[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]]) by trying to squeeze in a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program therefore provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only [[Confucius]], [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], but also [[Mencius]], [[Xun Zi]], [[Han Feizi]], and [[Mozi]], as well as historical narratives by [[Sima Qian]] and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', the later movement of [[Neo-Confucianism]] and [[Zhu Xi]], narrative works such as ''[[Journey to the West]]'' or the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' and the great Chinese poets, [[Li Bai]], [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] and [[Du Fu]]. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of [[Hinduism]] and the development of [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], as well as such literary masterpieces as the [[Mahabharata]], [[Shakuntala]], [[The Tale of Genji]], [[The Narrow Road to the Deep North]] and others. Students also take a language, either [[Sanskrit]] or [[Chinese language|Classical Chinese]].\n\n==Campuses==\n===Annapolis campus===\n[[File:St. John's College, Annapolis, MD.jpg|thumb|Annapolis campus]]\nSt. John's is located in the Historic Annapolis district, one block away from the Maryland State Capitol building. Its proximity to the [[United States Naval Academy]] (across King George Street) has inspired many a comparison to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Sparta]]. The schools carry on a spirited rivalry seen in the annual [[croquet]] match between the two schools on the front lawn of St. John's, which has been called by ''[[GQ]]'' ''\"the purest intercollegiate athletic event in America.\"'' {{As of| 2018}} St. John's has won 29 of the 36 annual matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sjc.edu/annapolis/events/croquet/facts||title=The Annapolis Cup \u2013 Croquet Match Fact Sheet |website=St. John's College |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> About the Johnnies' commitment to the event, one midshipman commented, \"They're out practicing croquet every afternoon!

It was opened in 1964 in response to the increase in qualified applicants at the Annapolis campus. The college chose to open a second campus rather than increase the size of the Annapolis campus. The second campus was part of a larger project, championed by then-college president Richard Weigle, which called for six campuses to be built across the country. St. John's abandoned the concept when it later sold a tract of land it owned in [[Monterey, California]]. The Santa Fe campus offers students a more secluded atmosphere than the Annapolis campus, with the vast [[Pecos Wilderness]] and [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] on its doorstep. The campus also boasts an expansive view of Santa Fe that extends to Los Alamos to the west.\n\nThe college maintains gear to facilitate student use of the outdoors, such as kayaks, rafts, hiking equipment, and sports equipment. Additionally, the college partners with Atalaya Search and Rescue to offer students training in [[search and rescue]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Campus Life in Santa Fe: St. John's College Search and Rescue|url= http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/campuslife/SF/search.shtml |accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the Santa Fe campus has begun initiatives to support programming related to writing and the visual arts.\n\n===Ptolemy Stone===\nBoth campuses have a Ptolemy Stone, an astronomical instrument invented by the ancient Greek astronomer [[Ptolemy]] to measure the [[Altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] of celestial bodies, in this case, the sun. The St. John's Ptolemy Stones are outdoor objects with a movable metal dial affixed (a prismical concrete column in [[Annapolis]] and a granite boulder in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]); this device was the precursor to the [[sextant]]. Freshman and sophomore math classes learn to use this stone to calculate the movement of the sun along the [[ecliptic]]. The students' use of the Ptolemy Stones underscores the mathematics and laboratory programs' connection to the practical experimentation and hands-on experience of the natural world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sjca.edu |title=St. John's College &#124; Liberal Arts College with a World-Class Faculty |website=Sjca.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}</ref>\n\n==Student body==\nWithin the Class of 2022, 36 U.S. states and 15 countries are represented.

Davidoff, M.D., a graduate of St. John's in 1969 and of Columbia Medical School... said the medical schools to which he applied reacted to his unconventional preparation in two ways. \"Those who had not heard of St. John's were not impressed. Those who knew of the college generally waived requirements.\" Like most St. John's alumni who enter medical school, he took an undergraduate course in organic chemistry at another college. Dr. Davidoff... cited only one difficulty in adapting to medical school. \"I didn't have any interesting people to talk to,\" he recalled.<ref>\"Mixing Frogs and Aristotle,\" ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 4, 1975</ref>}}\n\n[[Medical school]] admissions requirements have become significantly more rigorous since 1975, however, and institutions are now unwilling to waive requirements.\n\nMotivational business speaker [[Zig Ziglar]] included a chapter entitled \"St. John's: A College That Works\" in a 1997 book.<ref>Zig Ziglar (1997), ''Something To Smile About: Encouragement And Inspiration For Life's Ups And Downs'', Nelson Books, {{ISBN|0-8407-9183-6}} [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0840791836 A9 online page images]</ref> He said St. John's holds fast to the \"medieval\" notion that all knowledge is one and states that \"the books they use are terribly hard.\" He notes that the school \"ranks fifth nationally in the number of graduates earning doctorates in the humanities\" and is impressed by the 81% of graduates entering education, engineering, law, medicine, and other professions. He concludes \"Sounds like St. John's is onto something. Maybe more schools should take that approach.\" St. John's College is also listed in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.\n\nSt. John's runs counter to the usual emphasis on rankings and selectivity. In the past, St. John's College chose not to participate in any collegiate rankings surveys and did not provide requested survey information. However, the school was still included in many ranking guides. In 2014, Annapolis President Christopher B. Nelson wrote a post to address the issue in his SignPosts for Liberal Education blog: <blockquote>After many years of refusing to participate at all in the rankings generated by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]''\u2014one of the most prominent providers of college rankings\u2014St. John's this year submitted statistical information for its survey. This change in practice was prompted by engaged parents who increasingly were asking whether the underlying data about St. John's in ''U.S. News'' was reliable. Since we were not submitting information, we could not vouch for its reliability. Although St. John's would prefer not to be ranked, and has long asked not to be ranked, ''U.S. News'' continued to rank us. We concluded, therefore, that we had to supply statistical data in order to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information ''U.S. News'' was publishing about us.<ref>{{cite web|title = College Rankings \u2013 Ranking the Best Colleges \u2013 Unreliable Rankings|url = http://blogs.sjc.edu/christopher-nelson/2014/09/12/college-rankings-good-judgment/|website = Christopher B.
