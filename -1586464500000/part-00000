However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}).<ref name=\"trailer\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nThe players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first nine players were revealed on ''The Circle France''{{'}}s [[Instagram]] profile.<ref>{{cite web |author1=@circlegame |title=Qui d'autre ne peut pas attendre! \ud83d\ude4c regardez les joueurs entrer dans The Circle Tomorrow sur @NetflixFR |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-tq9EsAU9X/ |website=instagram.com |publisher=Instagram |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Harcourt wondered what a [[Reality competition|reality show]] would look like if the people never met face-to-face. He had also been considering the idea of a [[bird's-eye view]]-style documentary of an apartment building, seeing into each of their lives. He began to work on ''[[The Circle (franchise)|The Circle]]'' after hearing that [[Channel 4]] was looking for a reality-show format centered on social media.<ref name=\"insider\">{{cite web |last1=Smallman |first1=Etan |title=Inside 'The Circle,' Reality TV Gets a Social Media Filter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/television/the-circle-netflix.html |website=nytimes.com |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=30 December 2019 |location=London, United Kingdom |date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\n[[The Circle (British TV series)|The British version]] of the show premiered in 2018, and was renewed for its second season a few months after the first season ended.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tutton|first1=Charlotte|title=The Circle season 2 confirmed as Channel 4 series returns with a HUGE twist|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/1541465/the-circle-season-2-channel-4-series-return-new-twists-live-episode-how-long-on-prize-money-win|website=OK!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people. He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person.

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

The contents cover drafts of songs and poems, observations, ideas, [[epitaph]]s, etc.\n\n==Commonplace Books==\n[[Robert Burns]]'s two [[Commonplace books]], 1783 to 1785 and then a second 1787 to 1790, are personal compilations of early drafts of songs, prose and some poetry as well as observations on people, places and ideas. Copies of poetry, excerpts from books, quotations, moral, religious and philosophical, contemplative, etc. are included.<ref name=\"MB\"/> Such books are unique to the author's particular interests and often include passages found in other texts accompanied by the compiler's comments.\n\nThe term \"Commonplace\" derives from the [[Latin]] expression ''locus communis'' which translates as \"a general or common topic\". Generally the individual concerned collects material which have a common theme. Although they are private collections of information, they are not [[Diary|diaries]]. Keeping such a book was usually the pastime of the aristocracy with their ample leisure time, education and refinement.<ref name=\"MB\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.

The contents are of considerable value to those researching Robert Burns's life, personality, literary methodology, works and relationships. The abrupt abandonment is likely to relate to his efforts at composing new poems and revising existing works with thoughts of publication in mind.<ref name=\"JMA\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.

Mackay speculated that this may be because he was aware that [[Isabella Burns]], his youngest sister, was in the habit of secretly reading his compositions.<ref name=\"JMB\"/> The frequent quotations throughout from philosophers, poets and writers illustrate the unusual breadth and width of his reading as a farmer at the age of 24.\n\n===The Abridged Glenridell Manuscript version===\n[[File:Scott Douglas's 'ignorant critic' comment, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785.

A Biography of Robert Burns|publisher=Alloway Publishing Ltd|isbn=|page=469}}</ref> As stated, the [[folio]] has 42 pages and about 1250 lines of manuscript whilst the [[quarto]] abridgement covers pages 31 to 42, twelve pages with 232 lines of manuscript. Only two pieces of poetry are included, being 22 lines beginning ''Of all the numerous ills that hurt our peace'' and 20 lines of experimental [[blank verse]] beginning ''All devil as I am, a damned wretch''.<ref name=\"ED\">{{Cite book|last=Ewing|first=James|year=1938|title=Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|publisher=Gowans and Gray|isbn=|page=ix}}</ref>\n\nBurns prefaced the abridgement: ''On rummaging over some old papers, I lighted on a M.S.S. of my early years, in which I had determined to write myself out; as I was placed by Fortune among a class of men to whom my ideas would have been nonsense. I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''. At the end of the abridgement he wrote ''This is all that, & perhaps more than, is worth quoting, in my M.S.S.''<ref name=\"ED\"/>\n\n===Sequence of works===\nThe pages are numbered from 2 to 42 in Burns's own hand, with pages 1, 43 hard to read or absent and page 44 not apparently numbered. Page 1 carries the descriptive title ''Observations, Hints, Songs, Scraps of Poetry, etc. by Robt Burness; ...'' Page 2 was left blank by Burns, but was written on by John Syme. Page 44 was and remains entirely blank.<ref name=\"Mu\"/>\n\n===Comments, notes, additions and alterations===\n[[File:John Syme's editing comments, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785. Page 2.jpg|thumb|250px|John Syme's comments from page 2.]]\nThroughout the manuscripts are to be found comments and / or alterations, some by Robert Burns himself, the others by John Syme, James Currie, W. Scott Douglas and a 'W.R.'<ref name=\"ED\"/> These annotations are identifiable from their handwriting, appearance of the ink used, content, etc.\n\nJohn Syme, a good friend of Burns, visited James Currie at Liverpool with [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Gilbert Burns]] on 30 August 1797, as noted on page 1. ''W.R.'' commented much earlier, probably around 1786. James Currie had possession of the manuscript from January 1797.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William Scott Douglas (1878) apparently contributed at least one annotation, the ''..ignorant critic'' comment on page 13.\n\nBurns's comment on his lines of [[blank verse]] ''Intended for a tragedy'' on page 6 have been taken to infer that he had thoughts of writing a play.<ref name=\"ig\">{{Cite book|last=Grimble|first=Ian|year=1995|title=Robert Burns|publisher=Lomond Books|isbn=9781851527342|page=37}}</ref>\n\n===Who was W.R.?===\nThe 1786 annotator ''W.R.'' has only recently been tentatively identified. A William Ronald had been suggested by William Scott Douglas.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William was gauds boy to Burns at [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlea Farm]], helping him with the ploughing by encouraging and guiding the horses whilst carrying a plough staff to clean the ploughshare when it clogged with earth. He later became a farmer at [[Barkip|Mauleside]], a small estate near [[Beith]]. Little is known of his life and therefore his qualifications as a critic of Burns's work are open to question. ''W.R.'' appears to have been asked by Burns to help with the selection of material for inclusion in the first [[Kilmarnock]] edition of his [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect]].\n\nA more convincing identification is that of William Reid of Brash and Reid, booksellers, Glasgow. William had served his apprenticeship with Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson, also of Glasgow. In 1786 they were the largest printers, publishers and printers in city. John Reid, his son, recalled his father recounting the following:-\n\n\"''On one occasion, precise date now unknown, a stranger of most remarkable aspect, of rustic appearance and with a shepherd\u2019s plaid on his shoulders, presented himself to Mr. Reid on Dunlop and Wilson\u2019s premises\u2014with an introduction to him, it is believed, from his friend Gavin Turnbull. This stranger\u2019s errand was two-fold\u2014first to obtain publication, or more extensive publication, for a volume of poems, which he had in manuscript, or in printed sheets\u2014uncertain which\u2014in his hand; and second, an introduction through Mr. Reid or his employers to some of the wealthiest merchants in Glasgow, with a view to obtain a settlement for himself in the West Indies. He looked and spoke in the deepest distress\u2014in distress approaching to despair, and was occasionally moved even to tears.''\n\n''The poems he produced at the same time were of so great beauty, that, between sympathy and admiration, Mr. Reid was at a loss what to do. Finally, after discussing all the circumstances of the case and carefully scrutinising the poems, Mr. Reid, though a much younger man, affectionately struck his visitor on the shoulder and said, \u201cYour country, Sir, cannot afford to send you to the West Indies; you must go to Edinburgh and not to Jamaica.\u201d The stranger, we need hardly say, was Robert Burns. It was not in Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson's line to publish volumes, much less small volumes of poetry; but Mr. Reid, though still a youth, gave the unknown a letter of introduction to Mr. Creech, with whom he was personally acquainted, and the interview for the present terminated.''\"<ref>[https://burnsc21.glasgow.ac.uk/guest-blog-by-professor-patrick-scott-the-mysterious-wr-once-more-a-mid-victorian-reminiscence/?fbclid=IwAR2g0V3FIx_LVKSTpIlK_iKFpF9tGXaPXeeJN0NQRcUK84Ua9-o5b3RQoB4 Guest Blog by Professor Patrick Scott \u2013 The mysterious \u2018WR\u2019 once more: a mid-Victorian reminiscence.]</ref>\n\n===Details of the size, appearance, etc.===\nThe book is formed from eleven folio sheets on [[Laid paper|laid or chain and line]] paper that was folded to create a volume of size twelve and a half by seven and three-quarters inches, with twenty-two leaves and forty-four pages.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> They were originally ''broached with a course thread'' and were later bound in Morocco.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> By 1888 it was enclosed in a lockable rosewood box.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nBurns's writing was perfectly legible with relatively few alterations or corrections.

In January 1797 both Commonplace books were sent to [[James Currie (physician)|Dr James Currie]] in [[Liverpool]] who used some of this material in his ''The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns: With Explanatory and Glossarial Notes; And a Life of the Author'' which was he published in four volumes in 1800. Both of the Commonplace books remained with Dr Currie as did the other material, such as the [[Glenriddell Manuscripts]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> Shortly before his death in 1805 it narrowly escaped being burnt.<ref name=\"viii\">Ewing, p.viii</ref> William Wallace Currie, James's son, inherited the book and when he died in 1840 it again narrowly escaped destruction as his will instructed his wife to ''destroy or keep'' the manuscripts that were in his possession.<ref name=\"viii\"/> They passed to Sarah France Currie, James's daughter-in-law. Messrs. Puttick and Simpson of London on 2 May 1861 offered the book for auction as lot no. 203, but the catalogue did not indicate ownership, although the evidence suggests that the Currie Estate had instructed the sale.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nA London bookseller purchased the lot, paying only \u00a336, transferring it to Basil Montagu Pickering, another dealer who catalogued it but found no buyer. In 1868 another attempt realised several orders and the book was sent to John Adam of [[Greenock]]. John Duff inherited it in 1879 and on his death it was sold by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge of London. As lot no. 939 it was purchased by booksellers, Kerr & Richardson, for \u00a3101<ref name=\"viii\"/> and sold to Thomas Glen Arthur of Carrick House in [[Ayr]] and Glasgow. In 1891 it was sold to William Law through Kerr & Richardson, despite being included in Arthur's pivately-printed catalogue.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nWilliam Law lived at Honresfield House in Lancashire and after his death in 1901 it passed to Alfred Law, his brother. In 1913, 116 years after it was loaned to Dr James Curry, it passed to his nephew, [[Alfred Law|Sir Alfred Joseph Law]], who still held it in 1938 when a full facsimile was published by Gowans and Gray of [[Glasgow]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> The book is now owned by a private collector.\n\nIn 1896 William Law lent the book to the organisers of ''The Burns Exhibition'' held at The Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in Glasgow from 15 July to 31 October 1896. It is recorded and facsimiles of a few pages were included in the ''Memorial Catalogue of the Burns Exhibition'' published by William Hodge & Company in 1898.\n\nThe authors who had direct access to the original manuscript were [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] in 1800, R.H.Cromek in 1808, C.D.Lamont in 1872 and finally W. Scott Douglas in 1878.<ref name=\"WS\">{{Cite book|last=Ewing|first=James|year=1938|title=Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783-1785|publisher=Gowans and Gray|isbn=|page=x}}</ref>\n\n==The 1872 Adam-Lamont reproduction and the 1938 facsimile==\n[[File:Burns's self criticism, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785.

He was living in Edinburgh when the book was started and at [[Ellisland Farm]] when the last entry was made. The volume is sometimes known as the ''Edinburgh Journal'' and after the poet's death passed into the hands of [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] and was used in his 1800 publication of Burns's works.

The contents cover drafts of songs and poems, observations, ideas, [[epitaph]]s, etc.\n\n==Commonplace Books==\n[[Robert Burns]]'s two [[Commonplace books]], 1783 to 1785 and then a second 1787 to 1790, are personal compilations of early drafts of songs, prose and some poetry as well as observations on people, places and ideas. Copies of poetry, excerpts from books, quotations, moral, religious and philosophical, contemplative, etc. are included.<ref name=\"MB\"/> Such books are unique to the author's particular interests and often include passages found in other texts accompanied by the compiler's comments.\n\nThe term \"Commonplace\" derives from the [[Latin]] expression ''locus communis'' which translates as \"a general or common topic\". Generally the individual concerned collects material which have a common theme. Although they are private collections of information, they are not [[Diary|diaries]]. Keeping such a book was usually the pastime of the aristocracy with their ample leisure time, education and refinement.<ref name=\"MB\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.

The contents are of considerable value to those researching Robert Burns's life, personality, literary methodology, works and relationships. The abrupt abandonment is likely to relate to his efforts at composing new poems and revising existing works with thoughts of publication in mind.<ref name=\"JMA\">{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=James|year=2004|title=Burns.

Mackay speculated that this may be because he was aware that [[Isabella Burns]], his youngest sister, was in the habit of secretly reading his compositions.<ref name=\"JMB\"/> The frequent quotations throughout from philosophers, poets and writers illustrate the unusual breadth and width of his reading as a farmer at the age of 24.\n\n===The Abridged Glenridell Manuscript version===\n[[File:Scott Douglas's 'ignorant critic' comment, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785.

I had meant that the book would have lain by me, in the fond hope that, some time or other, even after I was no more, my thoughts would fall into the hands of somebody capable of appreciating their value''. At the end of the abridgement he wrote ''This is all that, & perhaps more than, is worth quoting, in my M.S.S.''<ref name=\"ED\"/>\n\n===Sequence of works===\nThe pages are numbered from 2 to 42 in Burns's own hand, with pages 1, 43 hard to read or absent and page 44 not apparently numbered. Page 1 carries the descriptive title ''Observations, Hints, Songs, Scraps of Poetry, etc. by Robt Burness; ...'' Page 2 was left blank by Burns, but was written on by John Syme. Page 44 was and remains entirely blank.<ref name=\"Mu\"/>\n\n===Comments, notes, additions and alterations===\n[[File:John Syme's editing comments, Robert Burns's Commonplace Book 1783 - 1785. Page 2.jpg|thumb|250px|John Syme's comments from page 2.]]\nThroughout the manuscripts are to be found comments and / or alterations, some by Robert Burns himself, the others by John Syme, James Currie, W. Scott Douglas and a 'W.R.'<ref name=\"ED\"/> These annotations are identifiable from their handwriting, appearance of the ink used, content, etc.\n\nJohn Syme, a good friend of Burns, visited James Currie at Liverpool with [[Gilbert Burns (farmer)|Gilbert Burns]] on 30 August 1797, as noted on page 1. ''W.R.'' commented much earlier, probably around 1786. James Currie had possession of the manuscript from January 1797.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William Scott Douglas (1878) apparently contributed at least one annotation, the ''..ignorant critic'' comment on page 13.\n\nBurns's comment on his lines of [[blank verse]] ''Intended for a tragedy'' on page 6 have been taken to infer that he had thoughts of writing a play.<ref name=\"ig\">{{Cite book|last=Grimble|first=Ian|year=1995|title=Robert Burns|publisher=Lomond Books|isbn=9781851527342|page=37}}</ref>\n\n===Who was W.R.?===\nThe 1786 annotator ''W.R.'' has only recently been tentatively identified. A William Ronald had been suggested by William Scott Douglas.<ref name=\"ED\"/> William was gauds boy to Burns at [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlea Farm]], helping him with the ploughing by encouraging and guiding the horses whilst carrying a plough staff to clean the ploughshare when it clogged with earth. He later became a farmer at [[Barkip|Mauleside]], a small estate near [[Beith]]. Little is known of his life and therefore his qualifications as a critic of Burns's work are open to question. ''W.R.'' appears to have been asked by Burns to help with the selection of material for inclusion in the first [[Kilmarnock]] edition of his [[Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect]].\n\nA more convincing identification is that of William Reid of Brash and Reid, booksellers, Glasgow. William had served his apprenticeship with Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson, also of Glasgow. In 1786 they were the largest printers, publishers and printers in city. John Reid, his son, recalled his father recounting the following:-\n\n\"''On one occasion, precise date now unknown, a stranger of most remarkable aspect, of rustic appearance and with a shepherd\u2019s plaid on his shoulders, presented himself to Mr. Reid on Dunlop and Wilson\u2019s premises\u2014with an introduction to him, it is believed, from his friend Gavin Turnbull. This stranger\u2019s errand was two-fold\u2014first to obtain publication, or more extensive publication, for a volume of poems, which he had in manuscript, or in printed sheets\u2014uncertain which\u2014in his hand; and second, an introduction through Mr. Reid or his employers to some of the wealthiest merchants in Glasgow, with a view to obtain a settlement for himself in the West Indies. He looked and spoke in the deepest distress\u2014in distress approaching to despair, and was occasionally moved even to tears.''\n\n''The poems he produced at the same time were of so great beauty, that, between sympathy and admiration, Mr. Reid was at a loss what to do. Finally, after discussing all the circumstances of the case and carefully scrutinising the poems, Mr. Reid, though a much younger man, affectionately struck his visitor on the shoulder and said, \u201cYour country, Sir, cannot afford to send you to the West Indies; you must go to Edinburgh and not to Jamaica.\u201d The stranger, we need hardly say, was Robert Burns. It was not in Messrs. Dunlop and Wilson's line to publish volumes, much less small volumes of poetry; but Mr. Reid, though still a youth, gave the unknown a letter of introduction to Mr. Creech, with whom he was personally acquainted, and the interview for the present terminated.''\"<ref>[https://burnsc21.glasgow.ac.uk/guest-blog-by-professor-patrick-scott-the-mysterious-wr-once-more-a-mid-victorian-reminiscence/?fbclid=IwAR2g0V3FIx_LVKSTpIlK_iKFpF9tGXaPXeeJN0NQRcUK84Ua9-o5b3RQoB4 Guest Blog by Professor Patrick Scott \u2013 The mysterious \u2018WR\u2019 once more: a mid-Victorian reminiscence.]</ref>\n\n===Details of the size, appearance, etc.===\nThe book is formed from eleven folio sheets on [[Laid paper|laid or chain and line]] paper that was folded to create a volume of size twelve and a half by seven and three-quarters inches, with twenty-two leaves and fourty-four pages.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> They were originally ''broached with a course thread'' and were later bound in Morocco.<ref name=\"Mu\"/> By 1888 it was enclosed in a lockable rosewood box.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nBurns's writing was perfectly legible with relatively few alterations or corrections.

In January 1797 both Commonplace books were sent to [[James Currie (physician)|Dr James Currie]] in [[Liverpool]] who used some of this material in his ''The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns: With Explanatory and Glossarial Notes; And a Life of the Author'' which was he published in four volumes in 1800. Both of the Commonplace books remained with Dr Currie as did the other material, such as the [[Glenriddell Manuscripts]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> Shortly before his death in 1805 it narrowly escaped being burnt.<ref name=\"viii\">Ewing, p.viii</ref> William Wallace Currie, James's son, inherited the book and when he died in 1840 it again narrowly escaped destruction as his will instructed his wife to ''destroy or keep'' the manuscripts that were in his possession.<ref name=\"viii\"/> They passed to Sarah France Currie, James's daughter-in-law. Messrs. Puttick and Simpson of London on 2 May 1861 offered the book for auction as lot no. 203, but the catalogue did not indicate ownership, although the evidence suggests that the Currie Estate had instructed the sale.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nA London bookseller purchased the lot, paying only \u00a336, transferring it to Basil Montagu Pickering, another dealer who catalogued it but found no buyer. In 1868 another attempt realised several orders and the book was sent to John Adam of [[Greenock]]. John Duff inherited it in 1879 and on his death it was sold by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge of London. As lot no. 939 it was purchased by booksellers, Kerr & Richardson, for \u00a3101<ref name=\"viii\"/> and sold to Thomas Glen Arthur of Carrick House in [[Ayr]] and Glasgow. In 1891 it was sold to William Law through Kerr & Richardson, despite being included in Arthur's pivately-printed catalogue.<ref name=\"viii\"/>\n\nWilliam Law lived at Honresfield House in Lancashire and after his death in 1901 it passed to Alfred Law, his brother. In 1913, 116 years after it was loaned to Dr James Curry, it passed to his nephew, [[Alfred Law|Sir Alfred Joseph Law]], who still held it in 1938 when a full facsimile was published by Gowans and Gray of [[Glasgow]].<ref name=\"viii\"/> The book is now owned by a private collector.\n\nIn 1896 William Law lent the book to the organisers of ''The Burns Exhibition'' held at The Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in Glasgow from 15 July to 31 October 1896. It is recorded and facsimiles of a few pages were included in the ''Memorial Catalogue of the Burns Exhibition'' published by William Hodge & Company in 1898.\n\nThe authors who had direct access to the original manuscript were [[James Currie (physician)|James Currie]] in 1800, R.H.Cromek in 1808, C.D.Lamont in 1872 and finally W.

{"title_page": "List of meteor air bursts", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nMany [[explosion]]s recorded in Earth's atmosphere are likely to be caused by the [[air burst]]s that result from [[meteor]]s exploding as they hit the thicker part of the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. These types of meteors are also known as [[fireball (meteor)|fireballs]] or [[Bolide|bolides]] with the brightest known as [[superbolide]]s. Before entering [[Earth's atmosphere]], these larger meteors were originally [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s of a few to several tens of metres in diameter, contrasting with the much smaller and much more common \"[[Meteoroid#Meteors|shooting stars]]\".\n\nThe most powerful recorded air burst is the 1908 [[Tunguska event]]. Extremely bright fireballs traveling across the sky are often witnessed from a distance, such as the 1947 [[Sikhote-Alin meteorite|Sikhote-Alin meteor]] and the 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]], both in Russia. If the bolide is large enough, fragments may survive such as the [[Chelyabinsk meteorite]]. Modern developments in [[infrasound]] detection by the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] and infrared [[Defense Support Program]] satellite technology have increased the likelihood of detecting airbursts.\n\n== Frequency ==\nThe table from Earth Impact Effects Program (EIEP) estimates the average frequency of airbursts and their energy yield in kilotons (kt) or megatons (Mt) of [[TNT equivalent]].\n[[File:SmallAsteroidImpacts-Frequency-Bolide-20141114.jpg|thumb|350px|World map of [[bolide]] events (1994\u20132013)<ref>{{cite news|title=We are not Alone: Government Sensors Shed New Light on Asteroid Hazards|url=http://www.universetoday.com/116355/we-are-not-alone-government-sensors-shed-new-light-on-asteroid-hazards/|accessdate=12 April 2015|newspaper=Universe Today}}</ref>]]\n{| class=\"wikitable floatcenter\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Stony asteroid impacts that generate an airburst<ref>{{cite web\n  |date=2010\n  |title=Earth Impact Effects Program\n  |publisher=Imperial College London / Purdue University\n  |author1=Robert Marcus |author2=H.

These types of meteors are also known as [[fireball (meteor)|fireballs]] or [[Bolide|bolides]] with the brightest known as [[superbolide]]s. Before entering [[Earth's atmosphere]], these larger meteors were originally [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s of a few to several tens of metres in diameter, contrasting with the much smaller and much more common \"[[Meteoroid#Meteors|shooting stars]]\".\n\nThe most powerful recorded air burst is the 1908 [[Tunguska event]]. Extremely bright fireballs traveling across the sky are often witnessed from a distance, such as the 1947 [[Sikhote-Alin meteorite|Sikhote-Alin meteor]] and the 2013 [[Chelyabinsk meteor]], both in Russia. If the bolide is large enough, fragments may survive such as the [[Chelyabinsk meteorite]]. Modern developments in [[infrasound]] detection by the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]] and infrared [[Defense Support Program]] satellite technology have increased the likelihood of detecting airbursts.\n\n== Frequency ==\nThe table from Earth Impact Effects Program (EIEP) estimates the average frequency of airbursts and their energy yield in kilotons (kt) or megatons (Mt) of [[TNT equivalent]].\n[[File:SmallAsteroidImpacts-Frequency-Bolide-20141114.jpg|thumb|350px|World map of [[bolide]] events (1994\u20132013)<ref>{{cite news|title=We are not Alone: Government Sensors Shed New Light on Asteroid Hazards|url=http://www.universetoday.com/116355/we-are-not-alone-government-sensors-shed-new-light-on-asteroid-hazards/|accessdate=12 April 2015|newspaper=Universe Today}}</ref>]]\n{| class=\"wikitable floatcenter\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Stony asteroid impacts that generate an airburst<ref>{{cite web\n  |date=2010\n  |title=Earth Impact Effects Program\n  |publisher=Imperial College London / Purdue University\n  |author1=Robert Marcus |author2=H.

He ruled [[Sapadalaksha]], the traditional Chahamana territory, in present-day north-western India. He controlled much of the present-day [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], and [[Delhi]]; and some parts of [[Punjab]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. His capital was located at Ajayameru (modern [[Ajmer]]), although the medieval folk legends describe him as the king of India's political centre Delhi to portray him as a representative of the pre-Islamic Indian power.\n\nEarly in his career, Prithviraj achieved military successes against several neighbouring Hindu kingdoms, most notably against the [[Chandelas of Jejakabhukti|Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]]. He also repulsed the early invasions by [[Muhammad of Ghor]], a ruler of the Muslim [[Ghurid]] dynasty. However, in 1192 CE, the Ghurids defeated Prithviraj at the [[Second battle of Tarain]], and executed him shortly after. His defeat at Tarain is seen as a landmark event in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]], and has been described in several semi-legendary accounts. The most popular of these accounts is ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', which presents him as a \"[[Rajput]]\", although the Rajput identity did not exist during his time.\n\n== Sources of information ==\n\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number, and were not issued by the king himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=38}} Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles. Besides the Muslim accounts of Battles of Tarain, he has been mentioned in several medieval ''[[k\u0101vya|kavya]]''s (epic poems) by Hindu and Jain authors. These include ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]'', ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' and ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]''. These texts contain eulogistic descriptions, and are, therefore, not entirely reliable.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=37}} ''Prithviraj Raso'', which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by the king's court poet [[Chand Bardai]]. However, it is full of exaggerated accounts many of which are worthless for the purposes of history.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}}\n\nOther chronicles and texts that mention Prithviraj include ''[[Prabandha-Chintamani]]'', ''[[Prabandha Kosha]]'' and ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]''. These were composed centuries after his death, and contain exaggerations and [[anachronistic]] anecdotes.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Prithviraj has also been mentioned in ''[[Kharatara Gaccha|Kharatara-Gachchha]]-[[Pattavali]]'', a Sanskrit text containing biographies of the Kharatara [[Jainism|Jain]] monks. While the work was completed in 1336 CE, the part that mentions Prithviraj was written around 1250 CE.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} The ''[[Alha-Khand]]a'' (or ''Alha Raso'') of the [[Chandela]] poet Jaganika also provides an exaggerated account of Prithviraj's war against the Chandelas.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}\n\nSome other Indian texts also mention Prithviraj, but do not provide much information of historical value. For example, the Sanskrit poem anthology ''[[Sharngadhara-paddhati]]'' (1363) contains a verse praising him, and the ''[[Kanhadade Prabandha]]'' (1455) mentions him as an earlier incarnation of the [[Chahamanas of Jalor|Jalore Chahamana]] king [[Viramadeva|Viramade]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=50}}\n\n== Early life ==\nPrithviraj was born to the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] king [[Someshvara (Chahamana dynasty)|Someshvara]] and queen Karpuradevi (a [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] princess).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} Both Prithviraj and his younger brother [[Hariraja]] were born in [[Gujarat]], where their father Someshvara was brought up at the [[Chaulukya]] court by his maternal relatives.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Prithviraj was born on the 12th day of the [[Jyeshtha (month)|Jyeshtha month]]. The text does not mention the year of his birth, but provides some of the [[horoscope|astrological planetary positions]] at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious. Based on these positions and assuming certain other planetary positions, [[Dasharatha Sharma]] calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=18}}\n\nThe medieval biographies of Prithviraj suggest that he was educated well. The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he mastered 6 languages; the ''Prithviraj Raso'' claims that he learned 14 languages, which appears to be an exaggeration. The ''Raso'' goes on to claim that he became well-versed in a number of subjects, including history, mathematics, medicine, military, painting, philosophy ([[mimamsa]]), and theology. Both the texts state that he was particularly proficient in [[archery]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=161}}\n\n== Early reign ==\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of [[Prithviraja II]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=156}} Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old. The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year. Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the [[regent]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then [[Vanaprastha|retired to the forest]]. However, this is doubtful.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nDuring his early years as the king, Prithviraj's mother managed the administration, assisted by a regency council.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nKadambavasa served as the chief minister of the kingdom during this period. He is also known as Kaimasa, Kaimash or Kaimbasa in the folk legends, which describe him as an able administrator and soldier devoted to the young king.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he was responsible for all the military victories during the early years of Prithviraj's reign. According to two different legends, Kadambavasa was later killed by Prithviraj. The ''Prithviraja-Raso'' claims that Prithviraj killed the minister after finding him in the apartment of the king's favourite concubine Karnati. ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' claims that a man named Pratapa-Simha conspired against the minister, and convinced Prithviraj that the minister was responsible for the repeated Muslim invasions. Both these claims appear to be historically inaccurate, as the much more historically reliable ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' does not mention any such incident.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nBhuvanaikamalla, the paternal uncle of Prithviraj's mother, was another important minister during this time.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', he was a valiant general who served Prithviraj as [[Garuda]] serves [[Vishnu]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=163}} The text also states that he was \"proficient in the art of subduing ''n\u0101ga''s\". According to the 15th-century historian [[Jonaraja]], \"naga\" here refers to elephants. However, [[Har Bilas Sarda]] interpreted Naga as the name of a tribe, and theorized that Bhuvanaikamalla defeated this tribe.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Prithviraj assumed actual control of the administration in 1180 CE (1237 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\n== Conflicts with Hindu rulers ==\n\n=== Nagarjuna ===\n\nThe first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna, and recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Gu\u1e0dapura; possibly modern [[Gurgaon]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]], and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Nagarjuna rebelled against Prithviraj's authority and occupied the fort of Gudapura.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=164}} Prithviraj besieged Gudapura with a large army comprising [[infantry]], [[camel cavalry|camels]], [[war elephant|elephants]] and [[horse cavalry|horses]]. Nagarjuna fled the fort, but Devabhata (possibly his general) continued to offer resistance. Ultimately, Prithviraj's army emerged victorious, and captured the wife, mother, and followers of Nagarjuna. According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', a garland made of the defeated soldiers' heads was hung across the Ajmer fort gate.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Bhadanakas ===\n\nTwo verses of ''Kharatara-Gachchha-[[Pattavali]]'' mention the victory of Prithviraj over the Bhadanakas, while describing a debate between two [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]]. This victory can be dated to sometime before 1182 CE, when the said debate took place.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nAccording to Cynthia Talbot, the Bhadanakas were an obscure dynasty who controlled the area around [[Bayana]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} According to Dasharatha Sharma, the Bhadanaka territory comprised the area around present-day [[Bhiwani district|Bhiwani]], [[Rewari district|Rewari]] and [[Alwar district|Alwar]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Chandelas of Jejakabhukti ===\n\nThe 1182\u201383 CE (1239 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day [[Bundelkhand]]), which was ruled by the [[Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}} Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as ''Prithviraj Raso'', ''Paramal Raso'', and ''[[Alha-Khand|Alha-Raso]]''.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=47}} Other texts such as ''Sarangadhara Paddhati'' and ''Prabandha Chintamani'' also mention Prithviraj's attack on Paramardi.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=168}} The ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a ''digvijaya'' (conquest of all the regions). This appears to be a reference to the start of Prithviraj's march to Jejakabhukti.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nThe legendary account of Prithviraj's campaign against the Chandelas goes like this: Prithviraj was returning to [[Delhi]] after marrying the daughter of Padamsen, when his contingent was attacked by the \"Turkic\" forces ([[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]]). His army repulsed the attacks, but suffered serious casualties in the process. Amid this chaos, the Chahamana soldiers lost their way, and unknowingly encamped in the Chandela capital [[Mahoba]]. They killed the Chandela royal gardener for objecting to their presence, which led to a skirmish between the two sides. The Chandela king Paramardi asked his general [[Udal of Mahoba|Udal]] to attack Prithviraj's camp, but Udal advised against this move. Paramardi's brother-in-law Mahil Parihar ruled modern-day [[Orai]]; he harboured ill-will against Paramardi, and instigated the king to go ahead with the attack. Prithviraj defeated Udal's contingent, and then left for Delhi. Subsequently, unhappy with Mahil's scheming, Udal and his brother [[Alha]] left the Chandela court. They started serving [[Jaichand]], the [[Gahadavala]] ruler of [[Kannauj]]. Mahil then secretly informed Prithviraj that Chandela kingdom had become weak in absence of its strongest generals. Prithviraj invaded the Chandela kingdom, and besieged Sirsagarh, which was held by Udal's cousin Malkhan. After failing to win over Malkhan through peaceful methods and losing eight generals, Prithviraj captured the fort. The Chandelas then appealed for a truce, and used this time to recall Alha and Udal from Kannauj. In support of the Chandelas, Jaichand dispatched an army led by his best generals, including two of his own sons. The combined Chandela-Gahadavala army attacked Prithviraj's camp, but was defeated. After his victory, Prithviraj sacked Mahoba. He then dispatched his general Chavand Rai to [[Kalinjar Fort]] to capture Paramardi. According to the various legends, Paramardi either died or retired shortly after the attack. Prithviraj returned to Delhi after appointing Pajjun Rai as the governor of Mahoba. Later, Paramardi's son recaptured Mahoba.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=120\u201325}}\n\nThe exact historicity of this legendary narrative is debatable. The Madanpur inscriptions establish that Prithviraj sacked Mahoba, but historical evidence indicates that he did not occupy Mahoba or Kalinjar. It is known that Paramardi did not die or retire immediately after the Chauhan victory; in fact, he continued ruling as a sovereign nearly a decade after Prithviraj's death.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=124\u201326}} It appears that Prithviraj only raided Jejakabhukti, and Paramardi regained control of his kingdom soon after his departure from Mahoba. Prithviraj was not able to annex the Chandela territory to his kingdom.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}}\n\n=== Chaulukyas of Gujarat ===\n\nThe ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj, and [[Bhima II]], the [[Chaulukya]] (Solanki) king of [[Gujarat]]. This implies that the two kings were previously at war.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} This war can be dated to sometime before 1187 CE (1244 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]). The [[Veraval]] inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraja\" (a reference to the belief that the moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=75}} Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=55}}\n\nThe historically unreliable ''Prithviraj Raso'' provides some details about the Chahamana-Chaulukya struggle.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}} According to it, both Prithviraj and Bhima wanted to marry Ichchhini, the Paramara princess of Abu. Prithviraj's marriage to her led to a rivalry between the two kings. Historian [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|G. H. Ojha]] dismisses this legend as fiction, because it states that Ichchhini was a daughter of Salakha, while Dharavarsha was the Paramara ruler of Abu at the time. Historian R. B. Singh, on the other hand, believes that Salakha was the head of another Paramara branch at Abu.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=170}} The ''Raso'' also mentions that Prithviraj's uncle Kanhadeva had killed seven sons of Bhima's uncle Sarangadeva. To avenge these murders, Bhima invaded the Chahamana kingdom and killed Prithviraj's father Someshvara, capturing [[Nagor]] in the process.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=171}} Prithviraj re-captured Nagor, and defeated and killed Bhima. This is known to be historically false, as the reign of Bhima II lasted nearly half a century after Prithviraj's death. Similarly, historical evidence suggests Bhima II was a child at the time of Someshvara's death, and therefore, could not have killed him.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\nDespite these discrepancies, there is some evidence of a battle between the Chahamanas and the Chaulukyas at Nagor. Two inscriptions found at Charlu village near [[Bikaner]] commemorate the death of [[Mohil]] soldiers at the battle of Nagor in 1184 CE (1241 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]). The Mohils are a branch of the Chauhans (the Chahamanas), and it is possible the inscriptions refer to the battle described in ''Prithviraj Raso''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=76\u201377}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=172\u201373}}\n\nSometime before 1187 CE, Jagaddeva Pratihara signed a peace treaty with Prithviraj. According to ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'', a chief named Abhayada once sought Jagaddeva's permission to attack and rob the wealthy visitors from Sapadalaksha country (the Chahamana territory). In response, Jagaddeva told Abhayada that he had concluded a treaty with Prithviraj with much difficulty. Jaggadeva then threatened to have Abhayada sewn in a donkey's belly if he harassed the people of Sapadalaksha. Historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]] theorizes that the Chahamana-Chaulukya conflict ended with some advantage for Prithviraj, as Jagaddeva appears to have been very anxious to preserve the treaty.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Paramaras of Abu ===\n\n[[Mount Abu|Abu]] was ruled by the Chaulukya feudatory Dharavarsha, who belonged to a branch of the [[Paramara dynasty]]. ''Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga'' by his younger brother Prahaladana describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu. This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas. It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Gahadavalas of Kannauj ===\n\nThe [[Gahadavala]] kingdom, centered around [[Kannauj]] and headed by another powerful king [[Jaichand|Jayachandra]], was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom. According to a legend mentioned in ''Prithviraj Raso'', Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter [[Samyogita]], leading to a rivalry between the two kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nThe legend goes like this: King Jaichand (Jayachandra) of Kannauj decided to conduct a [[Rajasuya]] ceremony to proclaim his supremacy. Prithviraj refused to participate in this ceremony, and thus, refused to acknowledge Jaichand as the supreme king. Jaichand's daughter Samyogita fell in love with Prithviraj after hearing about his heroic exploits, and declared that she would marry only him. Jaichand arranged a [[swayamvara]] (husband-selection) ceremony for his daughter, but did not invite Prithviraj. Nevertheless, Prithviraj marched to Kannauj with a hundred warriors and eloped with Samyogita. Two-third of his warriors sacrificed their life in fight against the Gahadavala army, allowing him to escape to Delhi with Samyogita. In Delhi, Prithviraj became infatuated with his new wife, and started spending most of his time with her. He started ignoring the state affairs, which ultimately led to his defeat against [[Muhammad of Ghor]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nThis legend is also mentioned in [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and Chandrashekhara's ''Surjana-Charita'' (which names the Gahadavala princess as \"Kantimati\"). ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Prithviraj fell in love with the incarnation of an [[apsara]] [[Tilottama]], although he had never seen this woman and was already married to other women. According to historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]], this is probably a reference to Samyogita. However, this legend is not mentioned in other historical sources such as ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'', ''Prabandha-Chintamani'', ''Prabandha-Kosha'' and ''Hammira-Mahakavya''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=78}} The Gahadavala records are also silent about this event, including the supposed Rajasuya performance by Jayachandra.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=175}}\n\nAccording to Dasharatha Sharma{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=79}} and R. B. Singh,{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=179}} there might be some historical truth in this legend, as it is mentioned in three different sources. All three sources place the event sometime before Prithviraj's final confrontation with [[Muhammad of Ghor]] in 1192 CE.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=80}}\n\n=== Other rulers ===\n[[File:Qila Rai Pithora 10.jpg|thumb|A statue at [[Qila Rai Pithora]] in Delhi]]\nThe ''Prithviraj Raso'' mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai, but these stories appear to be pure fiction. No historical records suggest existence of these persons.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}}\n\nThe construction of the now-ruined [[Qila Rai Pithora]] fort in [[Delhi]] is attributed to Prithviraj.{{sfn|Konstantin S Nossov|2012|p=53}} According to ''Prithviraj Raso'', Delhi's ruler [[Anangpal Tomar]] gave the city to his son-in-law Prithviraj, and was defeated when he wanted it back. This is historically inaccurate, as Delhi was annexed to the Chahamana territory by Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} In addition, historical evidence suggests that Anangpal Tomar died before the birth of Prithviraj. The claim about his daughter's marriage to Prithviraj appears to have been concocted at a later date.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=57}}\n\n== War with the Ghurids ==\n{{main article|First Battle of Tarain|Second Battle of Tarain}}\n\nPrithviraj's predecessors had faced multiple raids from the Muslim dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the [[Indian subcontinent]] by the 12th century.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=33\u201334}} By the late 12th century, the [[Ghazna]]-based [[Ghurid dynasty]] controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom. While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler [[Muhammad of Ghor]] crossed the [[Indus River]] and captured [[Multan]]. In 1178 CE, he invaded [[Gujarat]], which was ruled by the [[Chaulukya]]s (Solankis). During its march to Gujarat, the Ghurid army appears to have passed through the western frontier of the Chahamana kingdom, as evident by the destruction of several temples and sacking of the [[Bhati]]-ruled [[Lodhruva]].{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=40\u201342}} The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like [[Rahu]] to the Chahamana kingdom (in Hindu mythology, Rahu swallows the Sun, causing a [[solar eclipse]]). However, it does not mention any military engagement between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}} On its way to Gujarat, the Ghurid army besieged the [[Naddula]] (Nadol) fort, which was controlled by the [[Chahamanas of Naddula]]. Prithviraj's chief minister Kadambavasa advised him not to offer any assistance to the rivals of the Ghurids, and to stay away from this conflict.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} The Chahamanas did not immediately face a Ghurid invasion, because the Chaulukyas of Gujarat defeated Muhammad at the [[Battle of Kasahrada]] in 1178 CE, forcing the Ghurids to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nOver the next few years, Muhammad of Ghor consolidated his power in the territory to the west of the Chahamanas, conquering [[Peshawar]], [[Sindh]], and [[Punjab]]. He shifted his base from Ghazna to Punjab, and made attempts to expand his empire eastwards, which brought him into conflict with Prithviraj.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=183\u201384}}\n\n''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Muhammad of Ghor sent an ambassador to Prithviraj, but does not provide any details.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' (13th century CE) states that Muhammad sent his chief judge ''Qiwam-ul Mulk'' Ruknud Din Hamza to Prithviraj's court. The envoy tried to convince Prithviraj to \"abandon belligerence and pursue the path of rectitude\", but was unsuccessful. As a result, Muhammad decided to wage a war against Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe medieval Muslim writers mention only one or two battles between the two rulers. The ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' and ''[[Firishta|Tarikh-i-Firishta]]'' mention the two Battles of Tarain. ''Jami-ul-Hikaya'' and ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' mention only the second battle of Tarain, in which Prithviraj was defeated. However, the Hindu and Jain writers state that Prithviraj defeated Muhammad multiple times before being killed:{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that after defeating Muhammad for the first time, Prithviraj forced him to apologize to the princes whose territories he had ransacked, before letting him go. Muhammad invaded the Chahamana kingdom seven more times, but was defeated each time. However, his ninth invasion succeeded.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prithviraja Prabandha'' states that the two kings fought 8 battles;{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}} Prithviraj defeated and captured the Ghurid king in the first seven of these, but released him unharmed each time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}}\n* The ''Prabandha Kosha'' claims that Prithviraj captured Muhammad 20 times, but was himself imprisoned during the 21st battle. The ''Surjana Charita'' and ''Prithviraj Raso'' also enumerate 21 battles.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prabandha Chintamani'' gives the number of battles between Muhammad and Prithviraj as 22. It also states that Prithviraj's army defeated the preceding enemy king in a previous battle, in which a subordinate of Prithviraj heroically sacrificed himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=51}}\n\nWhile these accounts seem to exaggerate the number, it is possible that more than two engagements took place between the Ghurids and the Chahamanas during Prithviraj's reign.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=189}} The early victories mentioned by the Hindu and Jain writers probably refer to Prithviraj's successful repulsion of raids by Ghurid generals.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=81}}\n\n=== First battle of Tarain ===\n\nDuring 1190\u20131191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with [[Bathinda]]). He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the [[Qadi|Qazi]] of [[Tulak District|Tulak]], supported by 1200 horsemen. When Prithviraj learned about this, marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including Govindaraja of [[Delhi]]. According to the 16th-century Muslim historian [[Firishta]], his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}}\n\nMuhammad's original plan was to return to his base after conquering Tabarhindah, but when he heard about Prithviraj's march, he decided to put up a fight. He set out with an army, and encountered Prithviraj's forces at [[Tarain]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}} In the ensuing battle, Prithviraj's army decisively defeated the Ghurids. Muhammad of Ghor was injured and forced to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=82\u201384}}\n\nPrithviraj did not pursue the retreating Ghurid army, not wanting to invade hostile territory or misjudge Ghori's ambition.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} He only besieged the Ghurid garrison at Tabarhindah, which surrendered after 13 months of siege.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\n=== Second battle of Tarain ===\n[[File:The last stan of Rajputs against Muhammadans.jpg|thumb|A 19th century [[artist's impression|artist's imagination]] of the Second battle of Tarain]]\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight. This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor. According to ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad of Ghor returned to [[Ghazna]], and made preparations to avenge his defeat. According to ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'', he gathered a well-equipped army of 120,000 select [[Afghans|Afghan]], [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] horsemen over the next few months. He then marched towards the Chahamana kingdom via [[Multan]] and [[Lahore]], aided by Vijayaraja of [[Jammu]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\nPrithviraj had been left without any allies as a result of his wars against the neighbouring Hindu kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=88}} Nevertheless, he managed to gather a large army to counter the Ghurids. The 16th century Muslim historian [[Firishta]] estimated the strength of Prithviraj's army as 300,000 horses and 3,000 elephants, in addition to a large infantry.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}} This is most likely a gross exaggeration, aimed at emphasizing the scale of the Ghurid victory.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} Prithviraj's camp, which comprised 150 feudatory chiefs, wrote a letter to Muhammad of Ghor, promising him no harm if he decided to return to his own country. Muhammad insisted that he needed time to confer his [[Ghazna]]-based brother [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad|Ghiyath al-Din]]. According to Firishta, he agreed to a truce until he received an answer from his brother. However, he planned an attack against the Chahamanas.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Jawami ul-Hikayat]]'', Muhammad assigned a few men to keep the fires in his camp burning at night, while he marched off in another direction with the rest of his army. This gave the Chahamanas an impression that the Ghurid army was still encamped, observing the truce. After reaching several miles away, Muhammad formed four divisions, with 10,000 archers each. He kept the rest of his army in reserve. He ordered the four divisions to launch an attack on the Chahamana camp, and then pretend a retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAt dawn, the four divisions of the Ghurid army attacked the Chahamana camp, while Prithviraj was still asleep. After a brief fight, the Ghurid divisions pretended to retreat in accordance with Muhammad's strategy. Prithviraj was thus lured into chasing them, and by the afternoon, the Chahamana army was exhausted as a result of this pursuit. At this point, Muhammad led his reserve force and attacked the Chahamanas, decisively defeating them. According to ''Taj-ul-Maasir'', Prithviraj's camp lost 100,000 men (including Govindaraja of Delhi) in this debacle. Prithviraj himself tried to escape on a horse, but was pursued and caught near the Sarasvati fort (possibly modern [[Sirsa]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=86}} Subsequently, Muhammad of Ghor captured Ajmer after killing several thousand defenders, enslaved many more, and destroyed the city's temples.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n=== Jain accounts of Prithviraj's downfall ===\n\n''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' by the 14th century Jain scholar Merutunga states that Prithviraj cut off the ears of one of his ministers, who guided the Ghurid invaders to his camp as revenge. Prithviraj was in deep sleep after a day of religious fasting, and therefore, was easily captured. {{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\n''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' by the 15th century Jain scholar Nayachandra Suri states that after his initial defeat, the Ghurid king raised a fresh army with the support of a neighboring king, and marched to Delhi. Before the battle, he bribed Prithviraj's master of horses and musicians with gold coins. The master of horses had trained Prithviraj's horse to prance to drumbeats. The Ghurids attacked the Chahamana camp just before dawn, when Prithviraj was sleeping. Prithviraj tried to escape on his horse, but his musicians sounded the drums. The horse started prancing, and the invaders easily captured Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\nAccording to another Jain text, ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]'', Prithviraj's minister Kaimbasa and his spear-bearer Pratapasimha were not on good terms. Kaimbasa once complained to king against Pratapasimha, who convinced the king that Kaimbasa was aiding the Ghurids. An angry Prithviraj attempted to kill Kaimbasa with an arrow one night, but ended up killing another man. When his bard Chand Baliddika admonished him, the king dismissed both the bard and the minister.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}} At the time of Ghurid invasion of Delhi, Prithviraj had been sleeping for ten days. When the Ghurids came close, his sister woke him up: Prithviraj tried to flee on a horse, but Kaimbasa helped the Ghurids capture him by telling them about a certain sound that caused his horse to prance.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:Pritviraj Chauhan coins.jpg|thumb|Coins of Prithviraj Chauhan]]\n\nMost medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to the Chahamana capital [[Ajmer]], where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid [[vassal]]. Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}} This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}} although another possibility is that the Ghurids initially used Chahamana-style coinage to ensure greater acceptance of their own coinage in the former Chahamana territory.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince [[Govindaraja IV|Govindaraja]] on the throne of Ajmer, which further supports this theory.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}}\n\nThe various sources differ on the exact circumstances:{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n* The contemporary Muslim historian Hasan Nizami states that Prithviraj was caught conspiring against Muhammad, prompting the Ghurid king to order his beheading. Nizami does not describe the nature of this conspiracy.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* According to ''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' (c. 1304), Muhammad took him to Ajmer, intending to let him rule as a vassal. However, in Ajmer, he saw paintings depicting Muslims being killed by pigs in the Chahamana gallery. Enraged, he beheaded Prithviraj with an axe.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n* ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' states that Prithviraj refused to eat food after being captured. The noblemen of the Ghurid king suggested that he release Prithviraj, just like the Chahamana king had done to him in the past. But Muhammad ignored their advice, and Prithviraj died in captivity.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' (dated 15th century or earlier) states the Ghurids placed Prithviraj in gold chains, and brought him to Delhi. Prithviraj reproached the Ghurid king for not following his example of releasing the captured enemy. Some days later, while imprisoned in Ajmer, Prithviraj asked his ex-minister Kaimbasa for his bow-and-arrows to kill Muhammad in the court, which was held in front of the house where he was imprisoned. The treacherous minister supplied him the bow-and-arrows, but secretly informed Muhammad of his plan. As a result, Muhammad did not sit at his usual place, and instead kept a metal statue there. Prithviraj fired an arrow at the statue, breaking it into two. As a punishment, Muhammad had him cast into a pit and [[stoning|stoned]] to death.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=54}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=206-207}}\n\nThe 13th-century Persian historian [[Minhaj-i-Siraj]] states that Prithviraj was \"sent to hell\" after being captured. The 16th-century historian [[Firishta]] also supports this account.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=205}} According to historian [[Satish Chandra]], Minhaj's account suggests that Prithviraj was executed immediately after his defeat,{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=26}} but R. B. Singh believes that no such conclusion can be drawn from Minhaj's writings.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=205}} ''Viruddha-Vidhi Vidhvansa'' by the Hindu writer Lakshmidhara claims that Prithviraj was killed on the battlefield.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n\nThe ''Prithviraj Raso'' claims that Prithviraj was taken to Ghazna as a prisoner, and blinded. On hearing this, the poet [[Chand Bardai]] traveled to Ghazna and tricked Muhammad of Ghor into watching an archery performance by the blind Prithviraj. During this performance, Prithviraj shot the arrow in the direction of Muhammad's voice and killed him.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}} Shortly after, Prithviraj and Chand Bardai killed each other.<ref>Krishnadatt Paliwal (1988) \"Epic (Hindi)\" ''In'' Datta, Amaresh (1988) ''The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature: Volume Two: Devraj to Jyoti'', Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, India, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1178 page 1178], {{ISBN|81-260-1194-7}}</ref> This is a fictional narrative, not supported by historical evidence: Muhammad of Ghor continued to rule for more than a decade after Prithviraj's death.<ref name=\"Kaviraj\">Kaviraj Syamaldas (1886) \"The Antiquity, Authenticity and Genuineness of the epic called the Prithviraj Rasa and commonly ascribed to Chand Bardai\" Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. 55, pt.1,</ref>{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\nAfter Prithviraj's death, the Ghurids appointed his son Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer as their vassal. In 1192 CE, Prithviraj's younger brother [[Hariraja]] dethroned Govindaraja, and recaptured a part of his ancestral kingdom. Govindaraja moved to Ranastambhapura (modern [[Ranthambore Fort|Ranthambore]]), where he established a [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|new Chahamana branch]] of vassal rulers. Hariraja was later defeated by the Ghurid general [[Qutb al-Din Aibak]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=100\u201301}}\n\n== Cultural activities ==\n\nPrithviraj had a dedicated ministry for [[pandit]]s (scholars) and poets, which was under the charge of Padmanabha. His court had a number of poets and scholars, including:{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=88}}\n* Jayanaka, a poet-historian who wrote ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]''\n* Vidyapati Gauda\n* Vagisvara Janardana\n* Vishvarupa, a poet\n* Prithvibhata, a royal bard (identified as [[Chand Bardai]] by some scholars)\n\n''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions a debate that took place between the [[Jain]] monks Jinapati Suri and Padmaprabha at Naranayana (modern Narena near Ajmer). Prithviraj had encamped there at the time. Jinapati was later invited to Ajmer by a rich Jain merchant. There, Prithviraj issued him a ''jaya-patra'' (certificate of victory).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Inscriptions ===\n<mapframe text=\"Find-spots of inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign, in present-day India\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" zoom=\"5\" longitude=\"74.84\" latitude=\"25.98\">\n{\n\t\"type\": \"FeatureCollection\",\n\t\"features\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"Feature\",\n\t\t\t\"properties\": { \"marker-symbol\": \"star\", \"title\": \"[[Ajmer]]\", \"description\": \"Ajayameru (modern Ajmer) was the capital of Prithviraj.

In contrast, the ''Hammira Mahakavya'', also written by a Jain author, presents him as a brave man whose subordinates turned against him out of pure greed. The ''Hammira Mahakavya'', which was probably intended to please a Chauhan lord, retains the elements of the Jain tradition that occur in the two ''Prabandha'' texts, but also attempts to glorify Prithviraj who was an ancestor of the text's hero [[Hammiradeva|Hammira]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', a legendary text patronized largely by the [[Rajput]] courts,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=13}} portrays Prithviraj as a great hero.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=32}} Prithviraj's dynasty was classified as one of the Rajput clans in the later period, including in ''Prithviraj Raso'', although the \"Rajput\" identity did not exist during his time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=33, 121}}\n\nOver time, Prithviraj came to be portrayed as a patriotic Hindu warrior who fought against Muslim enemies.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=24}} He is remembered as a king whose reign separated the two major epochs of Indian history.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=5}} The convention of portraying Prithviraj as a Hindu king defeated as part of the Islamic conquest of India appears to have started with [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' (early 13th century). Nizami presents his narrative as a description of \"war with enemies of the faith\" and of how \"the Islamic way of life was established in the land of the Hindus.\"{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' as well as well as the later text ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' (c. 1260) present the Ghurid victory over Prithviraj as an important milestone leading to the establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=49}}\n\nThe 16th century legends describe him as the ruler of India's political centre [[Delhi]] (rather than [[Ajmer]], which was his actual capital).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=6\u20137}} For example, [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' does not associate the Chahamana dynasty with Ajmer at all.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=73}} Prithviraj's association with Delhi in these legends further strengthened his status as a symbol of pre-Islamic Indian power.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=26}}\n\nPrithviraj has been described as \"the last Hindu emperor\" in eulogies. This designation is inaccurate, as several stronger Hindu rulers flourished in [[South India]] after him, and even some contemporary Hindu rulers in northern India were at least as powerful as him. Nevertheless, the 19th century British officer [[James Tod]] repeatedly used this term to describe Prithviraj in his ''Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han''. Tod was influenced by the medieval [[Persian language]] Muslim accounts, which present Prithviraj as a major ruler and portray his defeat as a major milestone in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]]. After Tod, several narratives continued to describe Prithviraj as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=3}} For example, the inscriptions at the Ajmer memorial (''smarak'') to Prithviraj also honour him as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=16}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer and Delhi.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=265}} A number of movies and television serials have been made on his life. These include the [[Hindi]] movie ''Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan'' and the Hindi television serial ''[[Dharti Ka Veer Yodha Prithviraj Chauhan]]'' (2006\u20132009). The animated movie ''Veer Yodha Prithviraj Chauhan'' (2008) was released in English, Hindi, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages. He was also one of the first historical figures to be covered in ''[[Amar Chitra Katha]]'' (No. 25).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=266}} Many of these modern retellings depict Prithviraj as a flawless hero, and emphasize a message of Hindu national unity.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=267}} \n\nIn September 2019, a historical drama film ''[[Prithviraj (film)|Prithviraj]]'' starring [[Akshay Kumar]] in titular role was announced by [[Yash Raj Films]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/akshay-kumar-to-play-prithviraj-chauhan-in-biopic-titled-prithviraj/article29373215.ece|title=Akshay Kumar to play Prithviraj Chauhan in biopic titled \u2018Prithviraj\u2019 |website=The Hindu |access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/akshay-kumar-announces-historical-drama-prithviraj-on-his-52nd-birthday-gifts-fans-teaser-see-video-1597021-2019-09-09|title=Akshay Kumar announces historical drama Prithviraj on his 52nd birthday, gifts fans teaser|date=2019-09-09|website=India Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{ref begin}}\n* {{cite book |author=Cynthia Talbot |title=The Last Hindu Emperor: Prithviraj Cauhan and the Indian Past, 1200\u20132000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3DjCgAAQBAJ |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9781107118560 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |author=Dasharatha Sharma |authorlink=Dasharatha Sharma |title=Early Chauh\u0101n Dynasties |publisher=S.

He ruled [[Sapadalaksha]], the traditional Chahamana territory, in present-day north-western India. He controlled much of the present-day [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], and [[Delhi]]; and some parts of [[Punjab]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. His capital was located at Ajayameru (modern [[Ajmer]]), although the medieval folk legends describe him as the king of India's political centre Delhi to portray him as a representative of the pre-Islamic Indian power.\n\nEarly in his career, Prithviraj achieved military successes against several neighbouring Hindu kingdoms, most notably against the [[Chandelas of Jejakabhukti|Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]]. He also repulsed the early invasions by [[Muhammad of Ghor]], a ruler of the Muslim [[Ghurid]] dynasty. However, in 1192 CE, the Ghurids defeated Prithviraj at the [[Second battle of Tarain]], and executed him shortly after. His defeat at Tarain is seen as a landmark event in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]], and has been described in several semi-legendary accounts. The most popular of these accounts is ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', which presents him as a \"[[Rajput]]\", although the Rajput identity did not exist during his time.\n\n== Sources of information ==\n\nThe extant inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign are few in number, and were not issued by the king himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=38}} Much of the information about him comes from the medieval legendary chronicles. Besides the Muslim accounts of Battles of Tarain, he has been mentioned in several medieval ''[[k\u0101vya|kavya]]''s (epic poems) by Hindu and Jain authors. These include ''[[Prithviraja Vijaya]]'', ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' and ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]''. These texts contain eulogistic descriptions, and are, therefore, not entirely reliable.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' is the only surviving literary text from the reign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=37}} ''Prithviraj Raso'', which popularized Prithviraj as a great king, is purported to be written by the king's court poet [[Chand Bardai]].\n\nOther chronicles and texts that mention Prithviraj include ''[[Prabandha-Chintamani]]'', ''[[Prabandha Kosha]]'' and ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]''. These were composed centuries after his death, and contain exaggerations and [[anachronistic]] anecdotes.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Prithviraj has also been mentioned in ''[[Kharatara Gaccha|Kharatara-Gachchha]]-[[Pattavali]]'', a Sanskrit text containing biographies of the Kharatara [[Jainism|Jain]] monks. While the work was completed in 1336 CE, the part that mentions Prithviraj was written around 1250 CE.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} The ''[[Alha-Khand]]a'' (or ''Alha Raso'') of the [[Chandela]] poet Jaganika also provides an exaggerated account of Prithviraj's war against the Chandelas.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}\n\nSome other Indian texts also mention Prithviraj, but do not provide much information of historical value. For example, the Sanskrit poem anthology ''[[Sharngadhara-paddhati]]'' (1363) contains a verse praising him, and the ''[[Kanhadade Prabandha]]'' (1455) mentions him as an earlier incarnation of the [[Chahamanas of Jalor|Jalore Chahamana]] king [[Viramadeva|Viramade]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=50}}\n\n== Early life ==\nPrithviraj was born to the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chahamana]] king [[Someshvara (Chahamana dynasty)|Someshvara]] and queen Karpuradevi (a [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuri]] princess).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} Both Prithviraj and his younger brother [[Hariraja]] were born in [[Gujarat]], where their father Someshvara was brought up at the [[Chaulukya]] court by his maternal relatives.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=69}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Prithviraj was born on the 12th day of the [[Jyeshtha (month)|Jyeshtha month]]. The text does not mention the year of his birth, but provides some of the [[horoscope|astrological planetary positions]] at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious. Based on these positions and assuming certain other planetary positions, [[Dasharatha Sharma]] calculated the year of Prithviraj's birth as 1166 CE (1223 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=18}}\n\nThe medieval biographies of Prithviraj suggest that he was educated well. The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he mastered 6 languages; the ''Prithviraj Raso'' claims that he learned 14 languages, which appears to be an exaggeration. The ''Raso'' goes on to claim that he became well-versed in a number of subjects, including history, mathematics, medicine, military, painting, philosophy ([[mimamsa]]), and theology. Both the texts state that he was particularly proficient in [[archery]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=161}}\n\n== Early reign ==\nPrithviraj moved from Gujarat to Ajmer, when his father Someshvara was crowned the Chahamana king after the death of [[Prithviraja II]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=156}} Someshvara died in 1177 CE (1234 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]), when Prithviraj was around 11 years old. The last inscription from Someshvara's reign and the first inscription from Prithviraj's reign are both dated to this year. Prithviraj, who was a minor at the time, ascended the throne with his mother as the [[regent]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that Someshvara himself installed Prithviraj on the throne, and then [[Vanaprastha|retired to the forest]]. However, this is doubtful.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nDuring his early years as the king, Prithviraj's mother managed the administration, assisted by a regency council.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=38}}\n\nKadambavasa served as the chief minister of the kingdom during this period. He is also known as Kaimasa, Kaimash or Kaimbasa in the folk legends, which describe him as an able administrator and soldier devoted to the young king.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=72}} ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' states that he was responsible for all the military victories during the early years of Prithviraj's reign. According to two different legends, Kadambavasa was later killed by Prithviraj. The ''Prithviraja-Raso'' claims that Prithviraj killed the minister after finding him in the apartment of the king's favourite concubine Karnati. ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' claims that a man named Pratapa-Simha conspired against the minister, and convinced Prithviraj that the minister was responsible for the repeated Muslim invasions. Both these claims appear to be historically inaccurate, as the much more historically reliable ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' does not mention any such incident.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nBhuvanaikamalla, the paternal uncle of Prithviraj's mother, was another important minister during this time.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}} According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', he was a valiant general who served Prithviraj as [[Garuda]] serves [[Vishnu]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=163}} The text also states that he was \"proficient in the art of subduing ''n\u0101ga''s\". According to the 15th-century historian [[Jonaraja]], \"naga\" here refers to elephants. However, [[Har Bilas Sarda]] interpreted Naga as the name of a tribe, and theorized that Bhuvanaikamalla defeated this tribe.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to historian Dasharatha Sharma, Prithviraj assumed actual control of the administration in 1180 CE (1237 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\n== Conflicts with Hindu rulers ==\n\n=== Nagarjuna ===\n\nThe first military achievement of Prithviraj was his suppression of a revolt by his cousin Nagarjuna, and recapture of Gudapura (IAST: Gu\u1e0dapura; possibly modern [[Gurgaon]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} Nagarjuna was a son of Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]], and the struggle for the Chahamana throne had led to a rivalry between the two branches of the family.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=73}}\n\nAccording to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', Nagarjuna rebelled against Prithviraj's authority and occupied the fort of Gudapura.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=164}} Prithviraj besieged Gudapura with a large army comprising [[infantry]], [[camel cavalry|camels]], [[war elephant|elephants]] and [[horse cavalry|horses]]. Nagarjuna fled the fort, but Devabhata (possibly his general) continued to offer resistance. Ultimately, Prithviraj's army emerged victorious, and captured the wife, mother, and followers of Nagarjuna. According to ''Prithviraja Vijaya'', a garland made of the defeated soldiers' heads was hung across the Ajmer fort gate.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Bhadanakas ===\n\nTwo verses of ''Kharatara-Gachchha-[[Pattavali]]'' mention the victory of Prithviraj over the Bhadanakas, while describing a debate between two [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]]. This victory can be dated to sometime before 1182 CE, when the said debate took place.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=167}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nAccording to Cynthia Talbot, the Bhadanakas were an obscure dynasty who controlled the area around [[Bayana]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} According to Dasharatha Sharma, the Bhadanaka territory comprised the area around present-day [[Bhiwani district|Bhiwani]], [[Rewari district|Rewari]] and [[Alwar district|Alwar]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\n=== Chandelas of Jejakabhukti ===\n\nThe 1182\u201383 CE (1239 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]) Madanpur inscriptions from Prithviraj's reign claim that he \"laid to waste\" Jejakabhukti (present-day [[Bundelkhand]]), which was ruled by the [[Chandela]] king [[Paramardi]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}} Prithviraj's invasion of the Chandela territory is also described in the later folk legends, such as ''Prithviraj Raso'', ''Paramal Raso'', and ''[[Alha-Khand|Alha-Raso]]''.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=47}} Other texts such as ''Sarangadhara Paddhati'' and ''Prabandha Chintamani'' also mention Prithviraj's attack on Paramardi.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=168}} The ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions that Prithviraj had embarked upon a ''digvijaya'' (conquest of all the regions). This appears to be a reference to the start of Prithviraj's march to Jejakabhukti.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=74}}\n\nThe legendary account of Prithviraj's campaign against the Chandelas goes like this: Prithviraj was returning to [[Delhi]] after marrying the daughter of Padamsen, when his contingent was attacked by the \"Turkic\" forces ([[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]]). His army repulsed the attacks, but suffered serious casualties in the process. Amid this chaos, the Chahamana soldiers lost their way, and unknowingly encamped in the Chandela capital [[Mahoba]]. They killed the Chandela royal gardener for objecting to their presence, which led to a skirmish between the two sides. The Chandela king Paramardi asked his general [[Udal of Mahoba|Udal]] to attack Prithviraj's camp, but Udal advised against this move. Paramardi's brother-in-law Mahil Parihar ruled modern-day [[Orai]]; he harboured ill-will against Paramardi, and instigated the king to go ahead with the attack. Prithviraj defeated Udal's contingent, and then left for Delhi. Subsequently, unhappy with Mahil's scheming, Udal and his brother [[Alha]] left the Chandela court. They started serving [[Jaichand]], the [[Gahadavala]] ruler of [[Kannauj]]. Mahil then secretly informed Prithviraj that Chandela kingdom had become weak in absence of its strongest generals. Prithviraj invaded the Chandela kingdom, and besieged Sirsagarh, which was held by Udal's cousin Malkhan. After failing to win over Malkhan through peaceful methods and losing eight generals, Prithviraj captured the fort. The Chandelas then appealed for a truce, and used this time to recall Alha and Udal from Kannauj. In support of the Chandelas, Jaichand dispatched an army led by his best generals, including two of his own sons. The combined Chandela-Gahadavala army attacked Prithviraj's camp, but was defeated. After his victory, Prithviraj sacked Mahoba. He then dispatched his general Chavand Rai to [[Kalinjar Fort]] to capture Paramardi. According to the various legends, Paramardi either died or retired shortly after the attack. Prithviraj returned to Delhi after appointing Pajjun Rai as the governor of Mahoba. Later, Paramardi's son recaptured Mahoba.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=120\u201325}}\n\nThe exact historicity of this legendary narrative is debatable. The Madanpur inscriptions establish that Prithviraj sacked Mahoba, but historical evidence indicates that he did not occupy Mahoba or Kalinjar. It is known that Paramardi did not die or retire immediately after the Chauhan victory; in fact, he continued ruling as a sovereign nearly a decade after Prithviraj's death.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=124\u201326}} It appears that Prithviraj only raided Jejakabhukti, and Paramardi regained control of his kingdom soon after his departure from Mahoba. Prithviraj was not able to annex the Chandela territory to his kingdom.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}}\n\n=== Chaulukyas of Gujarat ===\n\nThe ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'' mentions a peace treaty between Prithviraj, and [[Bhima II]], the [[Chaulukya]] (Solanki) king of [[Gujarat]]. This implies that the two kings were previously at war.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=39}} This war can be dated to sometime before 1187 CE (1244 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]]). The [[Veraval]] inscription states that Bhima's prime minister Jagaddeva Pratihara was \"the moon to the lotus-like queens of Prithviraja\" (a reference to the belief that the moon-rise causes a day-blooming lotus to close its petals).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=75}} Since Bhima was a minor at the time, it appears that Jagaddeva led the campaign on the Chaulukya side.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=55}}\n\nThe historically unreliable ''Prithviraj Raso'' provides some details about the Chahamana-Chaulukya struggle.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}} According to it, both Prithviraj and Bhima wanted to marry Ichchhini, the Paramara princess of Abu. Prithviraj's marriage to her led to a rivalry between the two kings. Historian [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|G. H. Ojha]] dismisses this legend as fiction, because it states that Ichchhini was a daughter of Salakha, while Dharavarsha was the Paramara ruler of Abu at the time. Historian R. B. Singh, on the other hand, believes that Salakha was the head of another Paramara branch at Abu.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=170}} The ''Raso'' also mentions that Prithviraj's uncle Kanhadeva had killed seven sons of Bhima's uncle Sarangadeva. To avenge these murders, Bhima invaded the Chahamana kingdom and killed Prithviraj's father Someshvara, capturing [[Nagor]] in the process.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=171}} Prithviraj re-captured Nagor, and defeated and killed Bhima. This is known to be historically false, as the reign of Bhima II lasted nearly half a century after Prithviraj's death. Similarly, historical evidence suggests Bhima II was a child at the time of Someshvara's death, and therefore, could not have killed him.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\nDespite these discrepancies, there is some evidence of a battle between the Chahamanas and the Chaulukyas at Nagor. Two inscriptions found at Charlu village near [[Bikaner]] commemorate the death of [[Mohil]] soldiers at the battle of Nagor in 1184 CE (1241 [[Vikram Samvat|VS]]). The Mohils are a branch of the Chauhans (the Chahamanas), and it is possible the inscriptions refer to the battle described in ''Prithviraj Raso''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=76\u201377}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=172\u201373}}\n\nSometime before 1187 CE, Jagaddeva Pratihara signed a peace treaty with Prithviraj. According to ''Kharatara-Gachchha-Pattavali'', a chief named Abhayada once sought Jagaddeva's permission to attack and rob the wealthy visitors from Sapadalaksha country (the Chahamana territory). In response, Jagaddeva told Abhayada that he had concluded a treaty with Prithviraj with much difficulty. Jaggadeva then threatened to have Abhayada sewn in a donkey's belly if he harassed the people of Sapadalaksha. Historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]] theorizes that the Chahamana-Chaulukya conflict ended with some advantage for Prithviraj, as Jagaddeva appears to have been very anxious to preserve the treaty.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Paramaras of Abu ===\n\n[[Mount Abu|Abu]] was ruled by the Chaulukya feudatory Dharavarsha, who belonged to a branch of the [[Paramara dynasty]]. ''Partha-Parakrama-Vyayoga'' by his younger brother Prahaladana describes Prithviraj's night attack on Abu. This attack, according to the text, was a failure for the Chahamanas. It probably happened during the Gujarat campaign of Prithviraj.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=76}}\n\n=== Gahadavalas of Kannauj ===\n\nThe [[Gahadavala]] kingdom, centered around [[Kannauj]] and headed by another powerful king [[Jaichand|Jayachandra]], was located to the east of the Chahamana kingdom. According to a legend mentioned in ''Prithviraj Raso'', Prithviraj eloped with Jayachandra's daughter [[Samyogita]], leading to a rivalry between the two kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nThe legend goes like this: King Jaichand (Jayachandra) of Kannauj decided to conduct a [[Rajasuya]] ceremony to proclaim his supremacy. Prithviraj refused to participate in this ceremony, and thus, refused to acknowledge Jaichand as the supreme king. Jaichand's daughter Samyogita fell in love with Prithviraj after hearing about his heroic exploits, and declared that she would marry only him. Jaichand arranged a [[swayamvara]] (husband-selection) ceremony for his daughter, but did not invite Prithviraj. Nevertheless, Prithviraj marched to Kannauj with a hundred warriors and eloped with Samyogita. Two-third of his warriors sacrificed their life in fight against the Gahadavala army, allowing him to escape to Delhi with Samyogita. In Delhi, Prithviraj became infatuated with his new wife, and started spending most of his time with her. He started ignoring the state affairs, which ultimately led to his defeat against [[Muhammad of Ghor]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nThis legend is also mentioned in [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l-Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and Chandrashekhara's ''Surjana-Charita'' (which names the Gahadavala princess as \"Kantimati\"). ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Prithviraj fell in love with the incarnation of an [[apsara]] [[Tilottama]], although he had never seen this woman and was already married to other women. According to historian [[Dasharatha Sharma]], this is probably a reference to Samyogita. However, this legend is not mentioned in other historical sources such as ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'', ''Prabandha-Chintamani'', ''Prabandha-Kosha'' and ''Hammira-Mahakavya''.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=78}} The Gahadavala records are also silent about this event, including the supposed Rajasuya performance by Jayachandra.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=175}}\n\nAccording to Dasharatha Sharma{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=79}} and R. B. Singh,{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=179}} there might be some historical truth in this legend, as it is mentioned in three different sources. All three sources place the event sometime before Prithviraj's final confrontation with [[Muhammad of Ghor]] in 1192 CE.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=80}}\n\n=== Other rulers ===\n[[File:Qila Rai Pithora 10.jpg|thumb|A statue at [[Qila Rai Pithora]] in Delhi]]\nThe ''Prithviraj Raso'' mentions that Prithviraj defeated Nahar Rai of Mandovara and the Mughal chief Mudgala Rai, but these stories appear to be pure fiction. No historical records suggest existence of these persons.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}}\n\nThe construction of the now-ruined [[Qila Rai Pithora]] fort in [[Delhi]] is attributed to Prithviraj.{{sfn|Konstantin S Nossov|2012|p=53}} According to ''Prithviraj Raso'', Delhi's ruler [[Anangpal Tomar]] gave the city to his son-in-law Prithviraj, and was defeated when he wanted it back. This is historically inaccurate, as Delhi was annexed to the Chahamana territory by Prithviraj's uncle [[Vigraharaja IV]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=162}} In addition, historical evidence suggests that Anangpal Tomar died before the birth of Prithviraj. The claim about his daughter's marriage to Prithviraj appears to have been concocted at a later date.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=57}}\n\n== War with the Ghurids ==\n{{main article|First Battle of Tarain|Second Battle of Tarain}}\n\nPrithviraj's predecessors had faced multiple raids from the Muslim dynasties that had captured the north-western areas of the [[Indian subcontinent]] by the 12th century.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=33\u201334}} By the late 12th century, the [[Ghazna]]-based [[Ghurid dynasty]] controlled the territory to the west of the Chahamana kingdom. While Prithviraj was still a child, in 1175 CE, the Ghurid ruler [[Muhammad of Ghor]] crossed the [[Indus River]] and captured [[Multan]]. In 1178 CE, he invaded [[Gujarat]], which was ruled by the [[Chaulukya]]s (Solankis). During its march to Gujarat, the Ghurid army appears to have passed through the western frontier of the Chahamana kingdom, as evident by the destruction of several temples and sacking of the [[Bhati]]-ruled [[Lodhruva]].{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|pp=40\u201342}} The ''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that the activities of the Ghurid army were like [[Rahu]] to the Chahamana kingdom (in Hindu mythology, Rahu swallows the Sun, causing a [[solar eclipse]]). However, it does not mention any military engagement between the two kingdoms.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}} On its way to Gujarat, the Ghurid army besieged the [[Naddula]] (Nadol) fort, which was controlled by the [[Chahamanas of Naddula]]. Prithviraj's chief minister Kadambavasa advised him not to offer any assistance to the rivals of the Ghurids, and to stay away from this conflict.{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=41}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} The Chahamanas did not immediately face a Ghurid invasion, because the Chaulukyas of Gujarat defeated Muhammad at the [[Battle of Kasahrada]] in 1178 CE, forcing the Ghurids to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nOver the next few years, Muhammad of Ghor consolidated his power in the territory to the west of the Chahamanas, conquering [[Peshawar]], [[Sindh]], and [[Punjab]]. He shifted his base from Ghazna to Punjab, and made attempts to expand his empire eastwards, which brought him into conflict with Prithviraj.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=183\u201384}}\n\n''Prithviraja Vijaya'' mentions that Muhammad of Ghor sent an ambassador to Prithviraj, but does not provide any details.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=80\u201381}} [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' (13th century CE) states that Muhammad sent his chief judge ''Qiwam-ul Mulk'' Ruknud Din Hamza to Prithviraj's court. The envoy tried to convince Prithviraj to \"abandon belligerence and pursue the path of rectitude\", but was unsuccessful. As a result, Muhammad decided to wage a war against Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe medieval Muslim writers mention only one or two battles between the two rulers. The ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' and ''[[Firishta|Tarikh-i-Firishta]]'' mention the two Battles of Tarain. ''Jami-ul-Hikaya'' and ''Taj-ul-Maasir'' mention only the second battle of Tarain, in which Prithviraj was defeated. However, the Hindu and Jain writers state that Prithviraj defeated Muhammad multiple times before being killed:{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Hammira Mahakavya'' claims that after defeating Muhammad for the first time, Prithviraj forced him to apologize to the princes whose territories he had ransacked, before letting him go. Muhammad invaded the Chahamana kingdom seven more times, but was defeated each time. However, his ninth invasion succeeded.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prithviraja Prabandha'' states that the two kings fought 8 battles;{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}} Prithviraj defeated and captured the Ghurid king in the first seven of these, but released him unharmed each time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}}\n* The ''Prabandha Kosha'' claims that Prithviraj captured Muhammad 20 times, but was himself imprisoned during the 21st battle. The ''Surjana Charita'' and ''Prithviraj Raso'' also enumerate 21 battles.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=186\u201388}}\n* The ''Prabandha Chintamani'' gives the number of battles between Muhammad and Prithviraj as 22. It also states that Prithviraj's army defeated the preceding enemy king in a previous battle, in which a subordinate of Prithviraj heroically sacrificed himself.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=51}}\n\nWhile these accounts seem to exaggerate the number, it is possible that more than two engagements took place between the Ghurids and the Chahamanas during Prithviraj's reign.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=189}} The early victories mentioned by the Hindu and Jain writers probably refer to Prithviraj's successful repulsion of raids by Ghurid generals.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=81}}\n\n=== First battle of Tarain ===\n\nDuring 1190\u20131191 CE, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Chahamana territory, and captured Tabarhindah or Tabar-e-Hind (identified with [[Bathinda]]). He placed it under the charge of Zia-ud-din, the [[Qadi|Qazi]] of [[Tulak District|Tulak]], supported by 1200 horsemen. When Prithviraj learned about this, marched towards Tabarhindah with his feudatories, including Govindaraja of [[Delhi]]. According to the 16th-century Muslim historian [[Firishta]], his force comprised 200,000 horses and 3,000 elephants.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}}\n\nMuhammad's original plan was to return to his base after conquering Tabarhindah, but when he heard about Prithviraj's march, he decided to put up a fight. He set out with an army, and encountered Prithviraj's forces at [[Tarain]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=82}} In the ensuing battle, Prithviraj's army decisively defeated the Ghurids. Muhammad of Ghor was injured and forced to retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|pp=82\u201384}}\n\nPrithviraj did not pursue the retreating Ghurid army, not wanting to invade hostile territory or misjudge Ghori's ambition.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} He only besieged the Ghurid garrison at Tabarhindah, which surrendered after 13 months of siege.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\n=== Second battle of Tarain ===\n[[File:The last stan of Rajputs against Muhammadans.jpg|thumb|A 19th century [[artist's impression|artist's imagination]] of the Second battle of Tarain]]\nPrithviraj seems to have treated the first battle of Tarain as merely a frontier fight. This view is strengthened by the fact that he made little preparations for any future clash with Muhammad of Ghor. According to ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', during the period preceding his final confrontation with the Ghurids, he neglected the affairs of the state and spent time in merry-making.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}}{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}}\n\nMeanwhile, Muhammad of Ghor returned to [[Ghazna]], and made preparations to avenge his defeat. According to ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'', he gathered a well-equipped army of 120,000 select [[Afghans|Afghan]], [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] horsemen over the next few months. He then marched towards the Chahamana kingdom via [[Multan]] and [[Lahore]], aided by Vijayaraja of [[Jammu]].{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=84}}\n\nPrithviraj had been left without any allies as a result of his wars against the neighbouring Hindu kings.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=88}} Nevertheless, he managed to gather a large army to counter the Ghurids. The 16th century Muslim historian [[Firishta]] estimated the strength of Prithviraj's army as 300,000 horses and 3,000 elephants, in addition to a large infantry.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}} This is most likely a gross exaggeration, aimed at emphasizing the scale of the Ghurid victory.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=25}} Prithviraj's camp, which comprised 150 feudatory chiefs, wrote a letter to Muhammad of Ghor, promising him no harm if he decided to return to his own country. Muhammad insisted that he needed time to confer his [[Ghazna]]-based brother [[Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad|Ghiyath al-Din]]. According to Firishta, he agreed to a truce until he received an answer from his brother. However, he planned an attack against the Chahamanas.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Jawami ul-Hikayat]]'', Muhammad assigned a few men to keep the fires in his camp burning at night, while he marched off in another direction with the rest of his army. This gave the Chahamanas an impression that the Ghurid army was still encamped, observing the truce. After reaching several miles away, Muhammad formed four divisions, with 10,000 archers each. He kept the rest of his army in reserve. He ordered the four divisions to launch an attack on the Chahamana camp, and then pretend a retreat.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=85}}\n\nAt dawn, the four divisions of the Ghurid army attacked the Chahamana camp, while Prithviraj was still asleep. After a brief fight, the Ghurid divisions pretended to retreat in accordance with Muhammad's strategy. Prithviraj was thus lured into chasing them, and by the afternoon, the Chahamana army was exhausted as a result of this pursuit. At this point, Muhammad led his reserve force and attacked the Chahamanas, decisively defeating them. According to ''Taj-ul-Maasir'', Prithviraj's camp lost 100,000 men (including Govindaraja of Delhi) in this debacle. Prithviraj himself tried to escape on a horse, but was pursued and caught near the Sarasvati fort (possibly modern [[Sirsa]]).{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=86}} Subsequently, Muhammad of Ghor captured Ajmer after killing several thousand defenders, enslaved many more, and destroyed the city's temples.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n=== Jain accounts of Prithviraj's downfall ===\n\n''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' by the 14th century Jain scholar Merutunga states that Prithviraj cut off the ears of one of his ministers, who guided the Ghurid invaders to his camp as revenge. Prithviraj was in deep sleep after a day of religious fasting, and therefore, was easily captured. {{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\n''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' by the 15th century Jain scholar Nayachandra Suri states that after his initial defeat, the Ghurid king raised a fresh army with the support of a neighboring king, and marched to Delhi. Before the battle, he bribed Prithviraj's master of horses and musicians with gold coins. The master of horses had trained Prithviraj's horse to prance to drumbeats. The Ghurids attacked the Chahamana camp just before dawn, when Prithviraj was sleeping. Prithviraj tried to escape on his horse, but his musicians sounded the drums. The horse started prancing, and the invaders easily captured Prithviraj.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}\n\nAccording to another Jain text, ''[[Prithviraja Prabandha]]'', Prithviraj's minister Kaimbasa and his spear-bearer Pratapasimha were not on good terms. Kaimbasa once complained to king against Pratapasimha, who convinced the king that Kaimbasa was aiding the Ghurids. An angry Prithviraj attempted to kill Kaimbasa with an arrow one night, but ended up killing another man. When his bard Chand Baliddika admonished him, the king dismissed both the bard and the minister.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=53}} At the time of Ghurid invasion of Delhi, Prithviraj had been sleeping for ten days. When the Ghurids came close, his sister woke him up: Prithviraj tried to flee on a horse, but Kaimbasa helped the Ghurids capture him by telling them about a certain sound that caused his horse to prance.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n=== Death ===\n[[File:Pritviraj Chauhan coins.jpg|thumb|Coins of Prithviraj Chauhan]]\n\nMost medieval sources state that Prithviraj was taken to the Chahamana capital [[Ajmer]], where Muhammad planned to reinstate him as a Ghurid [[vassal]]. Sometime later, Prithviraj rebelled against Muhammad, and was killed for treason.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}} This is corroborated by numismatic evidence: some 'horse-and-bullman'-style coins bearing names of both Prithviraj and \"Muhammad bin Sam\" were issued from the Delhi mint,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}} although another possibility is that the Ghurids initially used Chahamana-style coinage to ensure greater acceptance of their own coinage in the former Chahamana territory.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} After Prithviraj's death, Muhammad installed the Chahamana prince [[Govindaraja IV|Govindaraja]] on the throne of Ajmer, which further supports this theory.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=208\u201309}}\n\nThe various sources differ on the exact circumstances:{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\n* The contemporary Muslim historian Hasan Nizami states that Prithviraj was caught conspiring against Muhammad, prompting the Ghurid king to order his beheading. Nizami does not describe the nature of this conspiracy.{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* According to ''[[Prabandha Chintamani]]'' (c. 1304), Muhammad took him to Ajmer, intending to let him rule as a vassal. However, in Ajmer, he saw paintings depicting Muslims being killed by pigs in the Chahamana gallery. Enraged, he beheaded Prithviraj with an axe.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=52}}{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n* ''[[Hammira Mahakavya]]'' states that Prithviraj refused to eat food after being captured. The noblemen of the Ghurid king suggested that he release Prithviraj, just like the Chahamana king had done to him in the past. But Muhammad ignored their advice, and Prithviraj died in captivity.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=207}}\n* ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'' (dated 15th century or earlier) states the Ghurids placed Prithviraj in gold chains, and brought him to Delhi. Prithviraj reproached the Ghurid king for not following his example of releasing the captured enemy. Some days later, while imprisoned in Ajmer, Prithviraj asked his ex-minister Kaimbasa for his bow-and-arrows to kill Muhammad in the court, which was held in front of the house where he was imprisoned. The treacherous minister supplied him the bow-and-arrows, but secretly informed Muhammad of his plan. As a result, Muhammad did not sit at his usual place, and instead kept a metal statue there. Prithviraj fired an arrow at the statue, breaking it into two. As a punishment, Muhammad had him cast into a pit and [[stoning|stoned]] to death.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=54}}{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|pp=206-207}}\n\nThe 13th-century Persian historian [[Minhaj-i-Siraj]] states that Prithviraj was \"sent to hell\" after being captured. The 16th-century historian [[Firishta]] also supports this account.{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=205}} According to historian [[Satish Chandra]], Minhaj's account suggests that Prithviraj was executed immediately after his defeat,{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2006|p=26}} but R. B.

On hearing this, the poet [[Chand Bardai]] traveled to Ghazna and tricked Muhammad of Ghor into watching an archery performance by the blind Prithviraj. During this performance, Prithviraj shot the arrow in the direction of Muhammad's voice and killed him.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=13\u201320}} Shortly after, Prithviraj and Chand Bardai killed each other.<ref>Krishnadatt Paliwal (1988) \"Epic (Hindi)\" ''In'' Datta, Amaresh (1988) ''The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature: Volume Two: Devraj to Jyoti'', Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, India, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1178 page 1178], {{ISBN|81-260-1194-7}}</ref> This is a fictional narrative, not supported by historical evidence: Muhammad of Ghor continued to rule for more than a decade after Prithviraj's death.<ref name=\"Kaviraj\">Kaviraj Syamaldas (1886) \"The Antiquity, Authenticity and Genuineness of the epic called the Prithviraj Rasa and commonly ascribed to Chand Bardai\" Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. 55, pt.1,</ref>{{sfn|Dasharatha Sharma|1959|p=87}}\n\nAfter Prithviraj's death, the Ghurids appointed his son Govindaraja on the throne of Ajmer as their vassal.

Govindaraja moved to Ranastambhapura (modern [[Ranthambore Fort|Ranthambore]]), where he established a [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|new Chahamana branch]] of vassal rulers.

B. Singh, at its height, Prithviraj's empire extended from [[Sutlej river]] in the west to the [[Betwa River|Betwa river]] in the east, and from the [[Himalayan foothills]] in the north to the foot of Mount Abu in the south. Thus, it included parts of present-day [[Rajasthan]], southern [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], northern [[Madhya Pradesh]], and western [[Uttar Pradesh]].{{sfn|R. B. Singh|1964|p=182}}\n\nOnly seven inscriptions dated to Prithviraj's reign are available; none of these were issued by the king himself:{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=38}}\n* Barla or Badla inscription, 1177 CE (1234 [[Vikrama Samvat|VS]])\n* [[Phalodi]] inscription, 1179 CE (1236 VS): records the grants made by Prithviraj's vassal ''Ranaka'' Katiya.{{sfn|R.

Somani|1976|p=48}}\n** Inscription 2: Names Prithviraj's father ([[Someshvara (Chahamana dynasty)|Someshvara]]) and grandfather ([[Arnoraja]]), and states that he plundered [[Jejakabhukti]] (the Chandela territory){{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=48}}\n** Inscription 3: Contains names of [[Shiva]] (Tryambaka, Chandrashekhara, and Tripuranta).{{sfn|R. V. Somani|1976|p=48}}\n* [[Udaipur]] Victoria Hall Museum inscription, 1187 CE (1244 VS)\n* [[Bisaldeo temple|Visalpur]] (Bisalpur near Tonk) inscription, 1187 CE (1244 VS)\n\n=== Characterization ===\n[[File:Prithviraj Raso.jpg|thumb|left|The cover of a ''Prithviraj Raso'' version published by the [[Nagari Pracharini Sabha]]]]\n\nThe early Sanskrit descriptions of Prithviraj, from 14th and 15th centuries, present him as a mediocre, unsuccessful king who was memorable only for his defeat against a foreign king.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=32}} ''Prabandha-Chintamani'' and ''Prithviraja-Prabandha'', written by Jain authors, portray him as an inept and unworthy king who was responsible for his own downfall, and whose mistreatment of his devout subordinates turned them into traitors. In contrast, the ''Hammira Mahakavya'', also written by a Jain author, presents him as a brave man whose subordinates turned against him out of pure greed. The ''Hammira Mahakavya'', which was probably intended to please a Chauhan lord, retains the elements of the Jain tradition that occur in the two ''Prabandha'' texts, but also attempts to glorify Prithviraj who was an ancestor of the text's hero [[Hammiradeva|Hammira]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=54-55}}\n\n''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', a legendary text patronized largely by the [[Rajput]] courts,{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=13}} portrays Prithviraj as a great hero.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=32}} Prithviraj's dynasty was classified as one of the Rajput clans in the later period, including in ''Prithviraj Raso'', although the \"Rajput\" identity did not exist during his time.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=33, 121}}\n\nOver time, Prithviraj came to be portrayed as a patriotic Hindu warrior who fought against Muslim enemies.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=24}} He is remembered as a king whose reign separated the two major epochs of Indian history.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=5}} The convention of portraying Prithviraj as a Hindu king defeated as part of the Islamic conquest of India appears to have started with [[Hasan Nizami]]'s ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' (early 13th century). Nizami presents his narrative as a description of \"war with enemies of the faith\" and of how \"the Islamic way of life was established in the land of the Hindus.\"{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=45}} ''Tajul-Ma'asir'' as well as well as the later text ''[[Tabaqat-i Nasiri]]'' (c. 1260) present the Ghurid victory over Prithviraj as an important milestone leading to the establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]].{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=49}}\n\nThe 16th century legends describe him as the ruler of India's political centre [[Delhi]] (rather than [[Ajmer]], which was his actual capital).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|pp=6\u20137}} For example, [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]]'s ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' does not associate the Chahamana dynasty with Ajmer at all.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=73}} Prithviraj's association with Delhi in these legends further strengthened his status as a symbol of pre-Islamic Indian power.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=26}}\n\nPrithviraj has been described as \"the last Hindu emperor\" in eulogies. This designation is inaccurate, as several stronger Hindu rulers flourished in [[South India]] after him, and even some contemporary Hindu rulers in northern India were at least as powerful as him. Nevertheless, the 19th century British officer [[James Tod]] repeatedly used this term to describe Prithviraj in his ''Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han''. Tod was influenced by the medieval [[Persian language]] Muslim accounts, which present Prithviraj as a major ruler and portray his defeat as a major milestone in the [[Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent|Islamic conquest of India]]. After Tod, several narratives continued to describe Prithviraj as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=3}} For example, the inscriptions at the Ajmer memorial (''smarak'') to Prithviraj also honour him as \"the last Hindu emperor\".{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=16}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nMemorials dedicated to Prithviraj have been constructed in Ajmer and Delhi.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=265}} A number of movies and television serials have been made on his life. These include the [[Hindi]] movie ''Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan'' and the Hindi television serial ''[[Dharti Ka Veer Yodha Prithviraj Chauhan]]'' (2006\u20132009). The animated movie ''Veer Yodha Prithviraj Chauhan'' (2008) was released in English, Hindi, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] languages. He was also one of the first historical figures to be covered in ''[[Amar Chitra Katha]]'' (No. 25).{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=266}} Many of these modern retellings depict Prithviraj as a flawless hero, and emphasize a message of Hindu national unity.{{sfn|Cynthia Talbot|2015|p=267}} \n\nIn September 2019, a historical drama film ''[[Prithviraj (film)|Prithviraj]]'' starring [[Akshay Kumar]] in titular role was announced by [[Yash Raj Films]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/akshay-kumar-to-play-prithviraj-chauhan-in-biopic-titled-prithviraj/article29373215.ece|title=Akshay Kumar to play Prithviraj Chauhan in biopic titled \u2018Prithviraj\u2019 |website=The Hindu |access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/bollywood/story/akshay-kumar-announces-historical-drama-prithviraj-on-his-52nd-birthday-gifts-fans-teaser-see-video-1597021-2019-09-09|title=Akshay Kumar announces historical drama Prithviraj on his 52nd birthday, gifts fans teaser|date=2019-09-09|website=India Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{ref begin}}\n* {{cite book |author=Cynthia Talbot |title=The Last Hindu Emperor: Prithviraj Cauhan and the Indian Past, 1200\u20132000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3DjCgAAQBAJ |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2015 |isbn=9781107118560 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |author=Dasharatha Sharma |authorlink=Dasharatha Sharma |title=Early Chauh\u0101n Dynasties |publisher=S.
