The railway station of [[Chittorgarh]] is located on a [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge]] line and falls under the administrative control of [[Western Railway Zone]] of [[Indian Railways]] and consists of seven main railway platforms.\n\nChittaurgarh Junction is connected by rail with [[Jaipur]] via [[Bhilwara]], [[Ajmer]] Kishangarh, [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] via [[Bundi]], [[Jodhpur]] via [[Ajmer]], [[Indore Junction BG]], [[Bhopal]], [[Indore Mhow]], [[Ujjain]], [[Ratlam]], [[Nagda Junction]], [[Ajmer]] and [[Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station|Hazrat Nizamuddin]], [[Bandra Terminus]], [[Mysuru]], [[New Jalpaiguri]] by many broad gauge trains. The city is also connected to Udaipur City via [[Mavli]] Jn. Some weekly trains to [[Hyderabad]], [[Kolkata]], [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Agra]], [[Mathura]], [[Kanpur]] , [[Rameshwaram]], [[Patliputra]] pass through this station.\n\n==History==\n\n===Rajputana Malwa Railway===\nRajputana-Malwa railway was about {{convert|720|mi}} long and was one of the oldest and most important tracks when India became independent. It started from Ahmadabad, ran into the Rajputana near Abu Road facing south-west, and then ran north-east to Bandikui, where one branch led to Agra and another to Delhi. It also had branches from Ajmer south to Nimach via [[Chittorgarh]] and from Phulera north-east to Rewari.\n\nThe line was constructed between 1874 and 1881 with the exception of the chord last mentioned, which was a later extension. The Indian government assigned the [[Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway]] Company (BB&CI) to work on the line since 1885. Before 1882, the Rajputana-Malwa Railway was known as the Rajputana State Railway. It was a [[metre gauge]] ({{track gauge|1m|disp=or}}) railway line which ran from Delhi to Indore Junction and to Ahmedabad via Chittorgarh. It was opened on 18 August 1876. \n\nThe railway was renamed Rajputana-Malwa Railway when a new line from Ajmer to Khandwa via Chittorgarh, [[Ujjain]] and [[Mhow]] was added to it. On 9 March 1885, Jodhpur was connected to this network from Marwar Junction with metre gauge track and later became part of the Jodhpur - Bikaner Railway.\n\n===Udaipur-Chittaurgarh Railway===\nUdaipur-Chitor link, a portion of the Bina-Guna-Baran, was named after the towns it connects. It was the property of the Udaipur Durbar. The railway was {{convert|67|mi}} long and was constructed between 1895 and 1899. It began operation in 1898. The capital expenditure was nearly 21 lakhs up to the end of 1904. The net profits averaged about 5 per cent.\n\n===Western Railway===\n====The past====\nThe rail link of Ratlam Division has a history of more than 130 years. The metre gauge section was started in 1874, while the broad gauge ({{track gauge|1676mm|disp=or}}) came into existence in 1893. It is a major junction and a rail division of Indian Railways on metre and broad gauge lines. Four major railway tracks pass through Ratlam City; these are towards Mumbai, Delhi, Ajmer and Khandwa, in which the railway track along Khandwa is a metre gauge track.\n\nNeemuch - Nasirabad railway construction planning was made for joining Rajputana railway and Nasirabad Scindia railway to Neemuch.  Although the survey of Neemuch - Nasirabad railway was carried out in 1871-72, construction started in 1879, and the work completed in March 1881.\n\n====The present====\nThe broad gauge portion extends from Godhra to Bhopal, Ujjain to Indore and Ratlam to Chanderia via Chittaurgarh Junction. The metre gauge portion of the division extends from Ujjain to Khandwa.\n\n==Track gauge==\nThe chittaurgarh junction [[track gauge]] is {{track gauge|1676mm}} [[broad gauge]] (BG).

It was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on May 21, 2000, after an unfinished version leaked to radio. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, placing her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark, eventually attaining a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=314 562 846-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\"/> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

They decided to use Jackson's chorus, and include Jam's chorus towards the end of the track.

It was released as a [[Single (music)|single]] on May 21, 2000, after an unfinished version leaked to radio. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, placing her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single reached number five in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark, eventually attaining a silver certification in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer.
