In a carrier, the presence of the malaria parasite causes the red blood cells with defective haemoglobin to rupture prematurely, making the ''[[Plasmodium]]'' parasite unable to reproduce. Further, the polymerization of Hb affects the ability of the parasite to digest Hb in the first place. Therefore, in areas where malaria is a problem, people's chances of survival actually increase if they carry sickle cell trait (selection for the heterozygote).\n\nIn the United States, with no endemic malaria, the prevalence of sickle cell anaemia among people of African ancestry is lower (about 0.25%) than among people in [[West Africa]] (about 4.0%) and is falling. Without endemic malaria, the sickle cell mutation is purely disadvantageous and tends to decline in the affected population by [[natural selection]], and now artificially through [[Genetic testing|prenatal genetic screening]]. However, the African American community descends from a significant admixture of several African and non-African ethnic groups and also represents the descendants of survivors of slavery and the slave trade. Thus, a degree of genetic dilution via crossbreeding with non-African people and high health-selective pressure through slavery (especially the slave trade and the frequently deadly [[Middle Passage]]) may be the most plausible explanations for the lower prevalence of sickle cell anaemia (and, possibly, other genetic diseases) among African Americans compared to West Africans.

For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manages on [[NSAID]]s (such as [[diclofenac]] or [[naproxen]]). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; [[patient-controlled analgesia]]  devices are commonly used in this setting.

Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nCarlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad, who is dispatched later by Carlos. The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office for them to realize that Bard is holed up in a hospital, with Bard demanding them to retrieve him. As Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill radios Carlos as she is attacked by a heavily mutated Nemesis in front of the city's Clock Tower. She manages to down Nemesis, but it infects her with the virus before escaping, causing her to fall unconscious. Carlos finds Jill roughly half a day later and takes her to Spencer Memorial Hospital, where they have traced Bard\u2019s location. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. After drowning in acid, Nemesis further mutates, and Jill uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai long enough for Jill to shoot and incapacitate him. When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an unknown figure retrieves the destroyed vaccine case from their apartment.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its announcement in 2019.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Palumbo |first1=Alessio |title='Resident

As Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill radios Carlos as she is attacked by a heavily mutated Nemesis in front of the city's Clock Tower. She manages to down Nemesis, but it infects her with the virus before escaping, causing her to fall unconscious. Carlos finds Jill roughly half a day later and takes her to Spencer Memorial Hospital, where they have traced Bard\u2019s location. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. After drowning in acid, Nemesis further mutates, and Jill uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai long enough for Jill to shoot and incapacitate him. When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, an unknown figure retrieves the destroyed vaccine case from their apartment.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its announcement in 2019.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Palumbo |first1=Alessio |title='Resident

The most common ones are small, egg-shaped and attached to a multi-speed battery pack by a long cord. They may be remotely controlled. Butterfly strap-ons, vibrating panties, and [[cock ring]]s are types of hands-free clitoral vibrators.  '''Butterfly strap-ons''' are small vibrators with adjustable straps on the woman's waist and hips. '''Vibrating panties''' are [[panties]] with an extra pouch in front into which a small vibrator is placed. They are usually remote controlled, such as via an app on a mobile device, and can be worn outside of the home, such as in an office, car, etc. The remote control can be entrusted to the wearer's partner, but its range is limited, and the vibrator can also be remotely controlled via an app installed on both mobile devices. However, these vibrators are not silent, producing an audible humming sound when active. '''Cock rings''' feature a vibrating bullet, to stimulate the clitoris during intercourse, as well as an erection enhancer.\n\nSome hands-free vibrators are waterproof.\n\nThere are also dual type of vibrators which provide stimulation to both the clitoris and [[G-spot]]. Some clitoral vibrators may be inserted into the vagina. These typically have a small arm near the base of the vibrator, providing simultaneous clitoral and vaginal stimulation. Variations include vibrators shaped like narrow bullets, animals, ergonomic forms, miniature rockets and large human tongues.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Anal vibrator]]\n* [[Clitoral pump]]\n* [[G-spot vibrator]]\n*[[Hitachi Magic Wand]]\n* [[Love egg]]\n* [[Rabbit vibrator]]\n* [[Waterproof vibrator]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Female sex toys]]\n[[Category:Vibrators]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sex Toy}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:Hitachi-magic-wand.jpg|thumb|Electronic vibrator: Hitachi Magic Wand]]\n'''Clitoral vibrators''' are [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrators]] designed to externally stimulate a woman's [[clitoris]] for her sexual pleasure and [[orgasm]].

Clitoral vibrators have been designed to resemble lipsticks, mobile telephones, sponges, and many other everyday items.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:Forced orgasm vibrator belt.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[wand vibrator]] belt for hands-free use]]\n\nMost vibrators can be used for clitoral stimulation, but there are a few distinct types of vibrator available. \n\n'''Manual''' clitoral vibrators come in a wide variety of designs.

However, they are generally powerful, offering more intense stimulation and better durability.<ref name=\"christophertrout\" /> There are also battery operated vibrators, as well as small ones that can be worn on a finger, and used for couples' play. \n\n'''Hands-free''' clitoral vibrators are generally smaller, less powerful devices held in place by straps or a harness. The most common ones are small, egg-shaped and attached to a multi-speed battery pack by a long cord. They may be remotely controlled. Butterfly strap-ons, vibrating panties, and [[cock ring]]s are types of hands-free clitoral vibrators.  '''Butterfly strap-ons''' are small vibrators with adjustable straps on the woman's waist and hips. '''Vibrating panties''' are [[panties]] with an extra pouch in front into which a small vibrator is placed. They are usually remote controlled, such as via an app on a mobile device, and can be worn outside of the home, such as in an office, car, etc. The remote control can be entrusted to the wearer\u2019s partner, but its range is limited, and the vibrator can also be remotely controlled via an app installed on both mobile devices. However, these vibrators are not silent, producing an audible humming sound when active. '''Cock rings''' feature a vibrating bullet, to stimulate the clitoris during intercourse, as well as an erection enhancer.\n\nSome hands-free vibrators are waterproof.\n\nThere are also dual type of vibrators which provide stimulation to both the clitoris and [[G-spot]]. Some clitoral vibrators may be inserted into the vagina. These typically have a small arm near the base of the vibrator, providing simultaneous clitoral and vaginal stimulation. Variations include vibrators shaped like narrow bullets, animals, ergonomic forms, miniature rockets and large human tongues.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Anal vibrator]]\n* [[Clitoral pump]]\n* [[G-spot vibrator]]\n*[[Hitachi Magic Wand]]\n* [[Love egg]]\n* [[Rabbit vibrator]]\n* [[Waterproof vibrator]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Female sex toys]]\n[[Category:Vibrators]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTypes:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoral_vibrator"}

The flowers are typically large, axillary, solitary, bisexual, and epiperigynous, with a [[perianth]] consisting of distinct, spirally arranged [[tepal]]s and a [[hypanthium]]. The [[stamen]]s are numerous and in spiral or whorled clusters, and the [[gynoecium]] has numerous inferior ovaries per carpel. Placentation is parietal, and the fruit is a berry with arillate seeds. Prickly pear species can vary greatly in habit; most are shrubs, but some, such as ''[[Opuntia echios]]'' of the Gal\u00e1pagos, are trees.\n\n===Ecology===\n{{See also|Prickly pears in Australia}}\n''O. ficus-indica'' thrives in regions with mild winters having a prolonged dry spell followed by hot summers with occasional rain and relatively low humidity.<ref name=cabi/> A mean annual rainfall of {{convert|350-500|mm|in|abbr=on}} provides good growth rates.<ref name=cabi/> ''O. ficus-indica'' proliferates in various soils ranging from sub[[acid]] to sub[[alkaline]], with clay content not exceeding 15\u201320% and the soil well-drained.<ref name=cabi/> The shallow root system enables the plant to grow in shallow, loose soils, such as on mountain slopes.<ref name=cabi/> ''Opuntia'' spreads into large clonal colonies, which contribute to its being considered a [[noxious weed]] in some places.<ref name=cabi/><ref name=\"griffith2004\">{{cite journal | last1 = Griffith | first1 = M.

In the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], six different species are found: [[Opuntia echios|''O. echios'']], [[Opuntia galapageia|''O. galapageia'']], [[Opuntia helleri|''O. helleri'']], [[Opuntia insularis|''O. insularis'']], [[Opuntia saxicola|''O. saxicola'']], and [[Opuntia megasperma|''O. megasperma'']]. These species are divided into 14 different varieties; most of these are confined to one or a few islands, so they have been described as \"an excellent example of [[adaptive radiation]]\".<ref>Fitter, Fitter, and Hosking, Wildlife of the Galapagos (2000)</ref> On the whole, islands with tall, trunked varieties have giant tortoises, and islands lacking tortoises have low or prostrate forms of ''Opuntia''. Prickly pears are a prime source of food for the common giant tortoises in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, so they are important in the food web.\n\n[[Charles Darwin]] was the first to note that these cacti have [[thigmotaxis|thigmotactic]] [[anther]]s; when the anthers are touched, they curl over, depositing their [[pollen]]. This movement can be seen by gently poking the anthers of an open ''Opuntia'' [[flower]]. The same trait has [[convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] in other species (e.g. ''[[Lophophora]]'').\n\nThe first introduction of prickly pears into [[Australia]] is ascribed to Governor [[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] and the earliest colonists in 1788. Brought from [[Brazil]] to [[Sydney]], prickly pear grew in Sydney, New South Wales, where they were rediscovered in a farmer's garden in 1839. They appear to have spread from New South Wales and caused great ecological damage in the eastern states. They are also found in the Mediterranean region of [[Northern Africa]], especially in [[Tunisia]], where they grow all over the countryside, and in parts of [[Southern Europe]], especially [[Spain]], where they grow in the east, south-east, and south of the country, and also in [[Malta]], where they grow all over the islands. They can be found in enormous numbers in parts of [[South Africa]], where they were introduced from South America. \nPrickly pears are considered an [[invasive species]] in [[Prickly pears in Australia|Australia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Hawaii]], among other locations.<ref name=cabi/>\n\nPrickly pears (mostly ''[[Opuntia stricta]]'') were originally imported into Europe during the 1500s<ref name=cabi/> and Australia in the 18th century for gardens, and were later used as a natural agricultural fencing<ref name=\"patt\">Patterson, Ewen K. 1936.

It is locally known there as ''beles'' and is abundant during the late summer and early autumn (late July through September). The ''beles'' from the holy monastery of [[Debre Bizen]] is said to be particularly sweet and juicy. In [[Libya]], it is a popular summer fruit and called by the locals ''Hindi'', which literally means ''Indian''.\n\nIn [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], and other parts of the [[Middle East]], prickly pears of the yellow and orange varieties are grown by the side of farms, beside railway tracks and other otherwise non[[cultivable]] land. It is sold in summer by street vendors, and is considered a refreshing fruit for that season.\n\n''Tungi'' is the local [[Saint Helena|St. Helenian]] name for cactus pears. The plants ([[Opuntia ficus-indica|Indian fig opuntia]]) were originally brought to the island by the colonial ivory traders from East Africa in the 1850s. ''Tungi'' cactus now grows wild in the dry coastal regions of the island. Three principal cultivars of ''tungi'' grow on the island: the 'English' with yellow fruit; the 'Madeira' with large red fruit; and the small, firm 'spiny red'.Tungi also gives its name to a local Spirit distilled at The St Helena distillery at Alarm Forest, the most remote distillery in the world, made entirely from  the opuntia cactus.\n\n===Phytochemicals and folk medicine===\n[[File:PricklyPearClose.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up image of prickly pear fruit: Apart from the large spines, note the glochids (the fine prickles, or bristles) that readily dislodge and may cause skin and eye irritation.]]\n''Opuntia'' contains a range of [[phytochemicals]] in variable quantities, such as [[polyphenols]], [[dietary minerals]] and [[betalain]]s.<ref name=\"jfi\">{{Cite journal |display-authors=1 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01679.x| pmid = 20722901| title = Physicochemical, Nutritional, and Functional Characterization of Fruits Xoconostle (Opuntia matudae) Pears from Central-M\u00e9xico Region| journal = Journal of Food Science| volume = 75| issue = 6| pages = C485\u201392| year = 2010| last1 = Guzm\u00e1n-Maldonado | first1 = S.

These species are divided into 14 different varieties; most of these are confined to one or a few islands, so they have been described as \"an excellent example of [[adaptive radiation]]\".<ref>Fitter, Fitter, and Hosking, Wildlife of the Galapagos (2000)</ref> On the whole, islands with tall, trunked varieties have giant tortoises, and islands lacking tortoises have low or prostrate forms of ''Opuntia''. Prickly pears are a prime source of food for the common giant tortoises in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, so they are important in the food web.\n\n[[Charles Darwin]] was the first to note that these cacti have [[thigmotaxis|thigmotactic]] [[anther]]s; when the anthers are touched, they curl over, depositing their [[pollen]]. This movement can be seen by gently poking the anthers of an open ''Opuntia'' [[flower]]. The same trait has [[convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] in other species (e.g. ''[[Lophophora]]'').\n\nThe first introduction of prickly pears into [[Australia]] is ascribed to Governor [[Arthur Phillip|Phillip]] and the earliest colonists in 1788. Brought from [[Brazil]] to [[Sydney]], prickly pear grew in Sydney, New South Wales, where they were rediscovered in a farmer's garden in 1839. They appear to have spread from New South Wales and caused great ecological damage in the eastern states. They are also found in the Mediterranean region of [[Northern Africa]], especially in [[Tunisia]], where they grow all over the countryside, and in parts of [[Southern Europe]], especially [[Spain]], where they grow in the east, south-east, and south of the country, and also in [[Malta]], where they grow all over the islands. They can be found in enormous numbers in parts of [[South Africa]], where they were introduced from South America. \nPrickly pears are considered an [[invasive species]] in [[Prickly pears in Australia|Australia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Hawaii]], among other locations.<ref name=cabi/>\n\nPrickly pears (mostly ''[[Opuntia stricta]]'') were originally imported into Europe during the 1500s<ref name=cabi/> and Australia in the 18th century for gardens, and were later used as a natural agricultural fencing<ref name=\"patt\">Patterson, Ewen K. 1936.

In Australia, they quickly became a widespread [[invasive weed]], eventually converting {{convert|101000|mi2|km2|abbr=on}} of farming land into an impenetrable green jungle of prickly pear, in places {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. Scores of farmers were driven off their land by what they called the \"green hell\"; their abandoned homes were crushed under the cactus growth, which  advanced at a rate of {{convert|1000000|acre|km2 sqmi|1|abbr=on}} per year.<ref name=\"patt\"/> In 1919, the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] established the Commonwealth Prickly Pear Board to coordinate efforts with state governments to eradicate the weed.

It is locally known there as ''beles'' and is abundant during the late summer and early autumn (late July through September). The ''beles'' from the holy monastery of [[Debre Bizen]] is said to be particularly sweet and juicy. In [[Libya]], it is a popular summer fruit and called by the locals ''Hindi'', which literally means ''Indian''.\n\nIn [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], and other parts of the [[Middle East]], prickly pears of the yellow and orange varieties are grown by the side of farms, beside railway tracks and other otherwise non[[cultivable]] land. It is sold in summer by street vendors, and is considered a refreshing fruit for that season.\n\n''Tungi'' is the local [[Saint Helena|St. Helenian]] name for cactus pears. The plants ([[Opuntia ficus-indica|Indian fig opuntia]]) were originally brought to the island by the colonial ivory traders from East Africa in the 1850s. ''Tungi'' cactus now grows wild in the dry coastal regions of the island. Three principal cultivars of ''tungi'' grow on the island: the 'English' with yellow fruit; the 'Madeira' with large red fruit; and the small, firm 'spiny red'.Tungi also gives its name to a local Spirit distilled at The St Helena distillery at Alarm Forest, the most remote distillery in the world, made entirely from  the opuntia cactus.\n\n===Phytochemicals and folk medicine===\n[[File:PricklyPearClose.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up image of prickly pear fruit: Apart from the large spines, note the glochids (the fine prickles, or bristles) that readily dislodge and may cause skin and eye irritation.]]\n''Opuntia'' contains a range of [[phytochemicals]] in variable quantities, such as [[polyphenols]], [[dietary minerals]] and [[betalain]]s.<ref name=\"jfi\">{{Cite journal |display-authors=1 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01679.x| pmid = 20722901| title = Physicochemical, Nutritional, and Functional Characterization of Fruits Xoconostle (Opuntia matudae) Pears from Central-M\u00e9xico Region| journal = Journal of Food Science| volume = 75| issue = 6| pages = C485\u201392| year = 2010| last1 = Guzm\u00e1n-Maldonado | first1 = S.

This insect, a primarily [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[parasite]], lives on [[cactus|cacti]] from the genus ''Opuntia'', feeding on moisture and nutrients in the cactus sap.

After an infant was born, the umbilical cord was cut and tied, and then the baby was washed, rubbed with salt and oil, and wrapped with strips of cloth. These strips kept the newborn child warm and also ensured that the child's limbs would grow straight. {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|16:4|KJV|}} describes Israel as unswaddled, a metaphor for abandonment.\n<ref name=\"bibleEnc\">\n{{cite encyclopedia\n | last = Bromiley\n | first = Geoffrey W.\n | encyclopedia = The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia\n | title = Swaddling\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6OJvO2jMCr8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA670#v=onepage&q=&f=false\n | accessdate = 2009-12-15\n | edition = reprint, revised\n | year = 1995\n | publisher = Wm.

A stay band would be attached to the forehead and the shoulders to secure the head. Babies would be swaddled like this until about 8 or 9 months.<ref name=Alison>\n{{cite book\n  |last = Sim\n  |first = Alison\n  |title = The Tudor Housewife\n  |publisher = [[McGill-Queen's Press]]\n  |year = 1998\n  |page = 26\n  |isbn = 978-0-7509-3774-0\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Swiss surgeon [[Felix W\u00fcrtz]] (approx. 1500 to approx. 1598) was the first who criticized aspects of swaddling openly.<ref>W\u00fcrtz (1612), p. 726 f.</ref>\n\n{{quote|I also saw right and straight children created by God and born into this world by humans, who became nevertheless bent and lame men, who never got straight and healthy thighs.

There was an association of neglect with swaddling, especially regarding [[wetnurse]]s who would leave babies in their care swaddled for long periods without washing or comforting them.<ref>\n{{cite book\n  |last = DeMause\n  |first = Lloyd\n  |title = The Emotional Life of Nations\n  |publisher = [[Other Press]]\n  |page = 322\n  |url = http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/eln08_childrearing.html\n  |year = 2002\n  |isbn = 978-1-892746-98-6\n}}\n</ref> More than a hundred years after W\u00fcrtz, physicians and philosophers from England began to openly criticize swaddling and finally demanded its complete abolishment. The British philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) rejected swaddling in his 1693 publication ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'', becoming a lobbyist for not binding babies at all.<ref>Locke (1779), p. 12.</ref> This thought was very controversial during the time, but slowly gained ground, first in England and later elsewhere in Western Europe.\n\n[[William Cadogan (childcare)|William Cadogan]] (1711\u20131797) seems to have been the first physician, who pleaded for the complete abolition of swaddling. In his \"Essay upon Nursing\" of 1748, he expressed his view of contemporary child care, swaddling, the topic of too much clothing for infants and overfeeding. He wrote:\n\n{{quote|But besides the Mischief arising from the Weight and Heat of these Swaddling-cloaths, they are put on so tight, and the Child is so cramp'd by them, that its Bowels have not room, nor the Limbs any Liberty, to act and exert themselves in the free easy Manner they ought. This is a very hurtful Circumstance, for Limbs that are not used, will never be strong, and such tender Bodies cannot bear much Pressure.<ref>Cadogan (1748), p. 10.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] baby of the [[Nez Perce tribe]], 1911]]\n\nPhilosophers and physicians more and more began to reject swaddling in the 18th century. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] wrote in his book ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' in 1762:\n\n{{quote| The child has hardly left the mother's [[womb]], it has hardly begun to move and stretch its limbs, when it is given new bonds. It is wrapped in swaddling bands, laid down with its head fixed, its legs stretched out, and its arms by its sides; it is wound round with linen and bandages of all sorts so that it cannot move [\u2026]. Whence comes this unreasonable custom? From an unnatural practice. Since mothers despise their primary duty and do not wish to [[Breastfeeding|nurse]] their own children, they have had to entrust them to [[Wetnurse|mercenary women]]. These women thus become mothers to a stranger's children, who by nature mean so little to them that they seek only to spare themselves trouble. A child unswaddled would need constant watching; well swaddled it is cast into a corner and its cries are ignored [\u2026]. It is claimed that infants left free would assume faulty positions and make movements which might injure the proper development of their limbs. This is one of the vain rationalizations of our false wisdom which experience has never confirmed. Out of the multitude of children who grow up with the full use of their limbs among nations wiser than ourselves, you never find one who hurts himself or maims himself; their movements are too feeble to be dangerous, and when they assume an injurious position, [[pain]] warns them to change it. }}\n\nAlthough this form of swaddling has fallen out of favour in the [[Western world]], many Eastern cultures and [[Tribe|tribal people]] still use it.<ref> See van Sleuwen, et al. (2007), p. e1097</ref>\n\n==Modern swaddling==\n\nThe swaddling clothes of [[mediaeval]] [[Madonna and Child]] paintings are now replaced with cotton receiving blankets, cotton muslin wraps, or specialised \"winged\" baby swaddles. Modern swaddling is becoming increasingly popular today as a means of settling and soothing irritable infants and helping babies sleep longer with fewer awakenings. Since the early 1990s, the medical community has recommended placing babies on their back to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. As studies proved swaddled babies sleep better in the back sleeping position, swaddling has become increasingly popular and recommended so parents avoid the dangerous stomach sleeping position. \nSwaddling also prevents newborns waking themselves with their [[Moro reflex]].<ref name=\"waking\"/>\n\n[[File:3 week old swaddled infant.png|left|thumb|A modern application of swaddling]]\n\nLoose and ineffective swaddling techniques made while using an undersized blanket can generally be kicked off by a wakeful baby. It is important for caregivers to accomplish a secure swaddle to ensure the blanket does not become loose and the baby remains wrapped during the sleep period. The act of swaddling does carry a risk of the baby overheating if the caregiver uses multiple blankets that are too thick or uses thick fluffy fabric that creates excessive thermal insulation.<ref name=\"Risks\">\n{{cite journal\n| last        = van Gestel\n| first       = Josephus Petrus Johannes\n |author2=Monique Pauline L\u2019Hoir |author3=Maartje ten Berge |author4=Nicolaas Johannes Georgius Jansen |author5=Frans Berend Pl\u00f6tz\n| date        = 6 December 2002\n| title       = Risks of Ancient Practices in Modern Times\n| journal     =  Pediatrics\n| volume      = 110\n| issue       = 6\n| pages       = e78\n| doi        = 10.1542/peds.110.6.e78\n| pmid        = 12456945\n}}\n</ref>\n\nModern specialized baby swaddles are designed to make it easier to swaddle a baby than with traditional square blanket. They are typically fabric blankets in a triangle, 'T' or 'Y' shape, with 'wings' that fold around the baby's torso or down over the baby's shoulders and around underneath the infant. Some of these products employ Velcro patches or other fasteners. Some parents prefer a specialized device because of the relative ease of use, and many parents prefer a large square receiving blanket or wrap because they can get a tighter and custom fit and the baby will not outgrow the blanket.\n\nTo avoid hip dysplasia risk, the swaddle should be done in such a way that the baby is able to move his or her legs freely at the hip.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_swaddling-your-baby_125.bc | title=Swaddling your baby}}</ref> This is more easily done with a large blanket that can keep the arms in place while allowing the legs flexibility, all while allowing for proper hip development.\n\nBy the time the baby is learning to roll over, often around 4\u20135 months, parents and caregivers should transition the baby from swaddling to a less restrictive covering for sleep. If the baby can roll over, then it is important for the baby to have use of its hands and arms to adjust his or her head position after rolling over.\nThe traditional swaddling uses flat strings for babies to be tied; care is needed not to tie them too hard or blood flow would be restricted.\n\n===Regional variations===\nSwaddling is still practiced worldwide.<ref>See Frenken (2011 a), p. 321-351, Frenken (2011 b), p. 233 ff..</ref> In some countries, swaddling is the standard treatment of babies. In Turkey, for instance, 93.1% of all babies become swaddled in the traditional way.<ref>See Caglayan et al (1991), p. 117, the statistics are from the Turkish population and health survey (1978), Ankara, p. 78, 82, 114.</ref> According to the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), 39% of all documented contemporary non-industrialized cultures show swaddling practices; further 19% use other methods of movement restriction for infants.<ref>See Nelson et al. (2000), p. e 77.</ref> Some authors assume that the popularity of swaddling is growing in the U.S., Great Britain and the Netherlands.<ref>See van Sleuwen (2007), p. e1097.</ref> A British sample showed up 19.4% of the babies are swaddled at night.<ref>See Bacon et al. (1991), p. 630.</ref> In Germany, swaddling is not used as routine care measure and experiences relatively little acceptance, as the missing mentioning of this practice in the standard work on regulatory disturbances of Papusek shows.<ref>See Meyer & Erler (2009), p. 24, also Papusek et al., p. 20, 408.</ref>\n\n===Medical uses===\nSwaddling as a medical intervention with a clearly limited indication range is used in the care practices of premature babies or crybabies with brain-organically provable damage.<ref>Van Sleuwen et al. (2007), p. e1097, e1101, e1102 and e1103.</ref> Also swaddling is used for reducing pain in such care actions as collecting blood at the heel.<ref>See Fearon et al. (1997), p. 222 ff. Swaddling here had a pain reducing effect.</ref> The swaddling of these premature babies (very low birth weight infants) takes place only very loosely. It is meant to hold the weak arms at the body and make certain movements possible.<ref>See Short et al. (1996), p. 25; illustration on p. 27.</ref> This \"swaddling\" is something completely different from traditional swaddling in the stretched position.\n\n== Psychological and physiological effects ==\n\nModern medical studies of swaddling use a form that is considerably shorter and less severe than the historical forms. The classical study by Lipton ''et al.'' of 1965 dealt with a modern swaddling form. The researchers described the two main effects of tightly wrapping babies: they are motorically calm and sleep much.<ref>See Lipton, ''et al.'' (1965), S. 560 ff.</ref> These effects are detected by means of various psycho-physiological parameters, such as heart rate, sleep duration and duration of crying. The research group around the Dutch biologist van Sleuwen in 2007 confirms this picture in their latest meta-analysis of medical studies on swaddling and its effects.<ref>See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2007), p. e1097.</ref>\n\nHowever, severe restrictions on the scope of these studies should be kept in mind, because most of the positive effects mentioned by van Sleuwen ''et al.'' are not related to normally developed newborns, but to impaired babies, namely [[premature babies]] and babies with detectable organic brain damage.<ref>See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2007), p. e1097, e1101, e1102 and especially p. e1103, where 3 of 5 central and empirically convincing effects are concerned with immature babies!</ref>\nSwaddling enhances the REM sleep (active sleep) and also the whole sleep duration.<ref>Vgl. Franco, ''et al.'' (2005), S. 1307 ff.; Chisholm (1983), S. 83</ref>\nThe effect of swaddling on the regulatory disturbance excessive crying is not very convincing: By adding the swaddling there is an immediate \"calming\" effect on children, but after a few days the effect of the introduction of regularity with swaddling is exactly the same as the regularity on its own.<ref>See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2003), (2006) und (2007)</ref> In other words: after a few days swaddling is completely unnecessary. It is therefore contraindicated to address the potential risk of swaddling, because the effect is only for a short term available, but after a little while is negligible.<ref>See Long (2007)</ref>\n\n=== Motor development ===\nTwo studies based on [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] did not show a delay in the onset of walking caused by the restraint of the use of the [[cradleboard]].<ref>See Dennis (1940 a), p. 107; Chisholm (1983), p. 83.</ref> In other areas of the motor development, clear delays of the development show up even when mild restrictions take place.<ref>Aldolph et al. (2010), p. 72 ff.</ref> A Japanese study concluded that the application of the basket cradle (''ejiko'') leads to a delayed onset of walking.<ref>See Lipton et al (1965), S. 564 mentioning Sofue, T.; Suye, H.; Murakami, T (1957). Anthropological study of Ejiko, Japanese cradle for child. Journal of the anthropological society of Nippon, 66, S. 77-91.</ref> An older Austrian study showed that swaddled Albanian babies showed a delayed ability to crawl and reach things with their hands.<ref>See Danzinger & Frankl (1934), S. 235; see also Frenken (2011), S. 44 ff.</ref> This shows the need for further substantial scientific clarifying regarding the impairment of motor skills by swaddling.\n\n=== Sudden infant death syndrome ===\nThe effects of swaddling on the [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) are unclear.<ref name=Moon2012>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moon RY, Fu L | title = Sudden infant death syndrome: an update. | journal =  Pediatrics in Review| volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 314\u201320 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22753789 | doi = 10.1542/pir.33-7-314 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83591967943a4c1b111919b4eeff9d24c38460c9 }}</ref> A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3275 |pmid=27244847 |title=Swaddling and the Risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Meta-analysis |journal= Pediatrics|volume=137 |issue=6 |pages=e20153275 |year=2016 |last1=Pease |first1=A.

Swaddling may even increase the risk when babies sleep in the prone position; it reduces the risk if they sleep in the supine position.<ref>See Thach (2009), p. 461, Richardson et al. (2009), p. 475 ff.</ref> A recent study demonstrated now, that swaddling is apparently a risk factor for SIDS, although the opposite was often previously assumed: Of the babies who died of SIDS, 24% were swaddled; in the control-groups only 6% were swaddled.<ref>See Blair et al.

Traditional tight swaddling simulates a strait jacket and prevents baby from moving their arms to self-settle.\n* In the most important contemporary study on swaddling practices in maternity wards by Bystrova et al., it is shown that swaddling in the hours after birth is linked with delayed recovery from post-natal weight loss.<ref>See Bystrova et al.

After an infant was born, the umbilical cord was cut and tied, and then the baby was washed, rubbed with salt and oil, and wrapped with strips of cloth.

The British philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) rejected swaddling in his 1693 publication ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'', becoming a lobbyist for not binding babies at all.<ref>Locke (1779), p. 12.</ref> This thought was very controversial during the time, but slowly gained ground, first in England and later elsewhere in Western Europe.\n\n[[William Cadogan (childcare)|William Cadogan]] (1711\u20131797) seems to have been the first physician, who pleaded for the complete abolition of swaddling. In his \"Essay upon Nursing\" of 1748, he expressed his view of contemporary child care, swaddling, the topic of too much clothing for infants and overfeeding. He wrote:\n\n{{quote|But besides the Mischief arising from the Weight and Heat of these Swaddling-cloaths, they are put on so tight, and the Child is so cramp'd by them, that its Bowels have not room, nor the Limbs any Liberty, to act and exert themselves in the free easy Manner they ought. This is a very hurtful Circumstance, for Limbs that are not used, will never be strong, and such tender Bodies cannot bear much Pressure.<ref>Cadogan (1748), p. 10.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] baby of the [[Nez Perce tribe]], 1911]]\n\nPhilosophers and physicians more and more began to reject swaddling in the 18th century. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] wrote in his book ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'' in 1762:\n\n{{quote| The child has hardly left the mother's [[womb]], it has hardly begun to move and stretch its limbs, when it is given new bonds. It is wrapped in swaddling bands, laid down with its head fixed, its legs stretched out, and its arms by its sides; it is wound round with linen and bandages of all sorts so that it cannot move [\u2026]. Whence comes this unreasonable custom? From an unnatural practice. Since mothers despise their primary duty and do not wish to [[Breastfeeding|nurse]] their own children, they have had to entrust them to [[Wetnurse|mercenary women]]. These women thus become mothers to a stranger's children, who by nature mean so little to them that they seek only to spare themselves trouble. A child unswaddled would need constant watching; well swaddled it is cast into a corner and its cries are ignored [\u2026]. It is claimed that infants left free would assume faulty positions and make movements which might injure the proper development of their limbs. This is one of the vain rationalizations of our false wisdom which experience has never confirmed. Out of the multitude of children who grow up with the full use of their limbs among nations wiser than ourselves, you never find one who hurts himself or maims himself; their movements are too feeble to be dangerous, and when they assume an injurious position, [[pain]] warns them to change it. }}\n\nAlthough this form of swaddling has fallen out of favour in the [[Western world]], many Eastern cultures and [[Tribe|tribal people]] still use it.<ref> See van Sleuwen, et al. (2007), p. e1097</ref>\n\n==Modern swaddling==\n\nThe swaddling clothes of [[mediaeval]] [[Madonna and Child]] paintings are now replaced with cotton receiving blankets, cotton muslin wraps, or specialised \"winged\" baby swaddles. Modern swaddling is becoming increasingly popular today as a means of settling and soothing irritable infants and helping babies sleep longer with fewer awakenings. Since the early 1990s, the medical community has recommended placing babies on their back to sleep to reduce the risk of SIDS. As studies proved swaddled babies sleep better in the back sleeping position, swaddling has become increasingly popular and recommended so parents avoid the dangerous stomach sleeping position. \nSwaddling also prevents newborns waking themselves with their [[Moro reflex]].<ref name=\"waking\"/>\n\n[[File:3 week old swaddled infant.png|left|thumb|A modern application of swaddling]]\n\nLoose and ineffective swaddling techniques made while using an undersized blanket can generally be kicked off by a wakeful baby. It is important for caregivers to accomplish a secure swaddle to ensure the blanket does not become loose and the baby remains wrapped during the sleep period. The act of swaddling does carry a risk of the baby overheating if the caregiver uses multiple blankets that are too thick or uses thick fluffy fabric that creates excessive thermal insulation.<ref name=\"Risks\">\n{{cite journal\n| last        = van Gestel\n| first       = Josephus Petrus Johannes\n |author2=Monique Pauline L\u2019Hoir |author3=Maartje ten Berge |author4=Nicolaas Johannes Georgius Jansen |author5=Frans Berend Pl\u00f6tz\n| date        = 6 December 2002\n| title       = Risks of Ancient Practices in Modern Times\n| journal     =  Pediatrics\n| volume      = 110\n| issue       = 6\n| pages       = e78\n| doi        = 10.1542/peds.110.6.e78\n| pmid        = 12456945\n}}\n</ref>\n\nModern specialized baby swaddles are designed to make it easier to swaddle a baby than with traditional square blanket. They are typically fabric blankets in a triangle, 'T' or 'Y' shape, with 'wings' that fold around the baby's torso or down over the baby's shoulders and around underneath the infant. Some of these products employ Velcro patches or other fasteners. Some parents prefer a specialized device because of the relative ease of use, and many parents prefer a large square receiving blanket or wrap because they can get a tighter and custom fit and the baby will not outgrow the blanket.\n\nTo avoid hip dysplasia risk, the swaddle should be done in such a way that the baby is able to move his or her legs freely at the hip.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_swaddling-your-baby_125.bc | title=Swaddling your baby}}</ref> This is more easily done with a large blanket that can keep the arms in place while allowing the legs flexibility, all while allowing for proper hip development.\n\nBy the time the baby is learning to roll over, often around 4\u20135 months, parents and caregivers should transition the baby from swaddling to a less restrictive covering for sleep. If the baby can roll over, then it is important for the baby to have use of its hands and arms to adjust his or her head position after rolling over.\nThe traditional swaddling uses flat strings for babies to be tied; care is needed not to tie them too hard or blood flow would be restricted.\n\n===Regional variations===\nSwaddling is still practiced worldwide.<ref>See Frenken (2011 a), p. 321-351, Frenken (2011 b), p. 233 ff..</ref> In some countries, swaddling is the standard treatment of babies. In Turkey, for instance, 93.1% of all babies become swaddled in the traditional way.<ref>See Caglayan et al (1991), p. 117, the statistics are from the Turkish population and health survey (1978), Ankara, p. 78, 82, 114.</ref> According to the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF), 39% of all documented contemporary non-industrialized cultures show swaddling practices; further 19% use other methods of movement restriction for infants.<ref>See Nelson et al. (2000), p. e 77.</ref> Some authors assume that the popularity of swaddling is growing in the U.S., Great Britain and the Netherlands.<ref>See van Sleuwen (2007), p. e1097.</ref> A British sample showed up 19.4% of the babies are swaddled at night.<ref>See Bacon et al. (1991), p. 630.</ref> In Germany, swaddling is not used as routine care measure and experiences relatively little acceptance, as the missing mentioning of this practice in the standard work on regulatory disturbances of Papusek shows.<ref>See Meyer & Erler (2009), p. 24, also Papusek et al., p. 20, 408.</ref>\n\n===Medical uses===\nSwaddling as a medical intervention with a clearly limited indication range is used in the care practices of premature babies or crybabies with brain-organically provable damage.<ref>Van Sleuwen et al. (2007), p. e1097, e1101, e1102 and e1103.</ref> Also swaddling is used for reducing pain in such care actions as collecting blood at the heel.<ref>See Fearon et al. (1997), p. 222 ff. Swaddling here had a pain reducing effect.</ref> The swaddling of these premature babies (very low birth weight infants) takes place only very loosely. It is meant to hold the weak arms at the body and make certain movements possible.<ref>See Short et al. (1996), p. 25; illustration on p. 27.</ref> This \"swaddling\" is something completely different from traditional swaddling in the stretched position.\n\n== Psychological and physiological effects ==\n\nModern medical studies of swaddling use a form that is considerably shorter and less severe than the historical forms. The classical study by Lipton ''et al.'' of 1965 dealt with a modern swaddling form. The researchers described the two main effects of tightly wrapping babies: they are motorically calm and sleep much.<ref>See Lipton, ''et al.'' (1965), S. 560 ff.</ref> These effects are detected by means of various psycho-physiological parameters, such as heart rate, sleep duration and duration of crying. The research group around the Dutch biologist van Sleuwen in 2007 confirms this picture in their latest meta-analysis of medical studies on swaddling and its effects.<ref>See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2007), p. e1097.</ref>\n\nHowever, severe restrictions on the scope of these studies should be kept in mind, because most of the positive effects mentioned by van Sleuwen ''et al.'' are not related to normally developed newborns, but to impaired babies, namely [[premature babies]] and babies with detectable organic brain damage.<ref>See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2007), p. e1097, e1101, e1102 and especially p. e1103, where 3 of 5 central and empirically convincing effects are concerned with immature babies!</ref>\nSwaddling enhances the REM sleep (active sleep) and also the whole sleep duration.<ref>Vgl. Franco, ''et al.'' (2005), S. 1307 ff.; Chisholm (1983), S. 83</ref>\nThe effect of swaddling on the regulatory disturbance excessive crying is not very convincing: By adding the swaddling there is an immediate \"calming\" effect on children, but after a few days the effect of the introduction of regularity with swaddling is exactly the same as the regularity on its own.<ref>See van Sleuwen, ''et al.'' (2003), (2006) und (2007)</ref> In other words: after a few days swaddling is completely unnecessary. It is therefore contraindicated to address the potential risk of swaddling, because the effect is only for a short term available, but after a little while is negligible.<ref>See Long (2007)</ref>\n\n=== Motor development ===\nTwo studies based on [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] did not show a delay in the onset of walking caused by the restraint of the use of the [[cradleboard]].<ref>See Dennis (1940 a), p. 107; Chisholm (1983), p. 83.</ref> In other areas of the motor development, clear delays of the development show up even when mild restrictions take place.<ref>Aldolph et al. (2010), p. 72 ff.</ref> A Japanese study concluded that the application of the basket cradle (''ejiko'') leads to a delayed onset of walking.<ref>See Lipton et al (1965), S. 564 mentioning Sofue, T.; Suye, H.; Murakami, T (1957). Anthropological study of Ejiko, Japanese cradle for child. Journal of the anthropological society of Nippon, 66, S. 77-91.</ref> An older Austrian study showed that swaddled Albanian babies showed a delayed ability to crawl and reach things with their hands.<ref>See Danzinger & Frankl (1934), S. 235; see also Frenken (2011), S. 44 ff.</ref> This shows the need for further substantial scientific clarifying regarding the impairment of motor skills by swaddling.\n\n=== Sudden infant death syndrome ===\nThe effects of swaddling on the [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS) are unclear.<ref name=Moon2012>{{cite journal |vauthors=Moon RY, Fu L | title = Sudden infant death syndrome: an update. | journal =  Pediatrics in Review| volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 314\u201320 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22753789 | doi = 10.1542/pir.33-7-314 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/83591967943a4c1b111919b4eeff9d24c38460c9 }}</ref> A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3275 |pmid=27244847 |title=Swaddling and the Risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: A Meta-analysis |journal= Pediatrics|volume=137 |issue=6 |pages=e20153275 |year=2016 |last1=Pease |first1=A.

S. }}</ref>\n\nSwaddling was supposed to keep babies on their back, in order to prevent SIDS. Swaddling itself is not seen as a protective factor for SIDS. Swaddling may even increase the risk when babies sleep in the prone position; it reduces the risk if they sleep in the supine position.<ref>See Thach (2009), p. 461, Richardson et al. (2009), p. 475 ff.</ref> A recent study demonstrated now, that swaddling is apparently a risk factor for SIDS, although the opposite was often previously assumed: Of the babies who died of SIDS, 24% were swaddled; in the control-groups only 6% were swaddled.<ref>See Blair et al. (2009). In the sample, one quarter of the babies who died of SIDS were swaddled. See also Richardson et al. (2009).</ref>\n\n=== Documented negative effects ===\nSeveral empirical studies show evidence of negative effects of swaddling. \n* Swaddling, especially traditional forms, increases the risk for hip dysplasia.<ref>See Kutlu et al. (1992), p. 598 f.</ref><ref>Akman et al. (2007), p. 290</ref><ref>Chaarani et al. (2002)</ref><ref>Kremli et al.

(2007), p. e1101.</ref> In one case, a heavily wrapped child died of hyperthermia.<ref>See van Gestel et al. (2002). See also Task Force on Infant Sleep Position and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (2000), p. 654.</ref>\n*In one study, the risk of developing respiratory infections increased fourfold by swaddling.<ref>See Yurdakok et al. (1990), p. 878</ref>\n* A pediatrician found in his sample the flattening of the occipital aspect of the head of babies, who were wrapped tightly and lay in their traditional cradles.<ref>See Bloch (1966). p. 645 (Kurdish sample), also Young (2005) for a prehistoric indigenous population.</ref>\n* Tight chest wrapping or swaddling has been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. Traditional tight swaddling simulates a strait jacket and prevents baby from moving their arms to self-settle.\n* In the most important contemporary study on swaddling practices in maternity wards by Bystrova et al., it is shown that swaddling in the hours after birth is linked with delayed recovery from post-natal weight loss.<ref>See Bystrova et al. (2007 a), p. 29 ff.</ref> A positive effect on the recovery is given by direct skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby in the hours after birth.<ref>See Bystrova et al. (2007 a), p. 37 f.; also Bystrova et al. (2003), p. 324.</ref> Skin-to-skin contact was shown to reduce the impact of the stress of being born, with babies maintaining their body temperature to a greater degree than those swaddled in a nursery.<ref>See also Kennell & MacGrath (2003), p. 273.</ref>\n* The recent results of an investigation of Bystrova et al. demonstrate that maternal behavior develops less under swaddling conditions, and reciprocity within the mother-child dyad is reduced.<ref>See Bystrova (2008), p. 46.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Babywearing]]\n* [[Childbirth]]\n* [[Infant massage]]\n* [[Infant's binder]]\n* [[Kangaroo care]]\n* [[Psychohistory#Psychogenic mode|Psychohistory]]\n* [[Sleeping bag (infant)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{refbegin|2}}\n*Adolph, Karen E.; Karasik (Vishnevetsky), Lana B.; Tamis-LeMonda, Catherine S.

[https://www.shaylocomotives.com/data/lima/sn-666.htm ''Lima Locomotive & Machine Co.

That report further stated that the Maytown company bought the locomotive in 1903 \u2013 nine years before the Maytown company began railroad operations.  That 1960 report has often been repeated.  Messrs. Taber and Casler resided in Pennsylvania.  It is not known who their 1950\u2019s Washington State correspondent might have been.  The correspondent did not recall that Climax #167 had been converted to standard gauge or that it had been reduced to 2-truck or that it had been owned by White Bros./White Star Lumber Co. beginning in 1903 and for at least nine more years.  Because the correspondent is unknown, because the correspondent did not recall much about the locomotive, because the Maytown railroad did not exist until long after 1903, and because the Maytown company is not known to have owned any Climax locomotives, the known evidence suggests that the Maytown Lumber Co. did not own Climax #167.</ref>\n|- bgcolor=#DDDDDD\n|USA 10\n|[[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]\n|{{whyte|4-6-0}}\n{{convert|16010|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}\n|Jan.\n1916\n|42768\n|Originally, [[East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad|East Tennessee & Western North Carolina R.R.]] #10.

''See'', Kemp (1957). \u201cReports on the White Pass & Yukon Route,\u201d at pp. 92-93 (freight car notes compiled in July 1957).  According to Mr. Kemp\u2019s July 1957-recorded observations, there were two caboose bodies on private properties in Skagway [1st 905, 1st 911], but there were no boxcar bodies thereon.  Also, according to Mr. Kemp, at least 23 freight cars had been dumped into the Skagway River by July 1957, but only seven tenders had been dumped into the river by then.  An eighth tender superstructure (ex-#66, nee #69) would be dumped into the river later that same year.  ''See'', Stutz (2013). \u201cDumped Tender Shells,\u201d White Pass Fanlist No. 12191 (Tender E).  Its underframe had been removed to build Flatcar #1200 in April that year.  This suggests that retired railroad cars were still being dumped into the Skagway River in 1957.  Empirical evidence corroborates Mr. Kemp\u2019s observations.  Of the thirteen 1899-1906 WP&YR boxcars and refrigerator cars observed and identified by number ''after'' 1958, eleven (85%) had been \u201cphased out\u201d ''in'' 1958.  The two cars retired before 1958 had been maintenance of way boxcars with windows cut in them; one of the two (#642) was retained as a yard office in Whitehorse; the other (#602) was placed on a trash laden, derelict lot in Skagway.  Of the eleven numerically identified 1899-1906 cars which were transferred to and used by the local residents, ''all'' had been \u201cphased out\u201d in favor of intermodal containers in 1958 (##436, 440, 506, 518, 530, 570, 626, 656, 666, 670, 682, some now demolished).</ref><ref name=NotSquareHole>The Mile 2.9/Broadway Station boxcar is 28 feet long and has no evidence that an ore door ever existed at the bottom of its \u201cA\u201d end.  Among the 1958 phase-out boxcars, only four met these criteria ''and'' did not exist at some other location (##530, 538, 540, 590).  Of these four, the list can be further narrowed to those three boxcars built in 1899 which bear numbers lower than 568.  The pre-568 number is determined by the round holes which engaged the truss rod bolts.  These holes are located on the ends of the car next to the corner plates.  On boxcars which bear numbers lower than 568, these holes are round, and there are no smaller holes located adjacent to them.  On boxcars which bear numbers higher than 566, the holes are square, with two smaller round holes located adjacent to the square holes.  The Klondike Highway boxcar has the pre-#568 round truss rod bolt holes.

Of the three pre-#568 boxcars, #538 can be eliminated because photographic evidence shows that #538 had a major hole in the door on its right side, because the metal strap at the bottom of this door had a slight bowing, and because the Mile 2.9/Broadway Station boxcar does not reflect having had either defect.  Of the two remaining boxcars, #530 is the only one which has been reported to exist since 1958.  #530 has been reported to exist in 1976 \u2013 just three years before it disappeared and the Broadway Station restaurant appeared.

Sixteen of the 17 bodies cannot be the 4\u00bd Alley body, based on three reasons.  Only #746 is not eliminated by these reasons.  First, eight of these bodies (##702, 704, 706, 710, 712, 720, 730, 758) are eliminated because they had been built in 1909, while the 4\u00bd Alley body has 1910 built coupler pockets.  Second, six of the nine remaining bodies (##708, 718, 1st 734, 2nd 734 [ex-728], 742, 754) are eliminated because, at one or more times, they have existed at locations different from the then-location of the 4\u00bd Alley body.  Third, two of the three remaining bodies (#714 and #738) are eliminated because photos of them disclose damages which are inconsistent with the condition of the 4\u00bd Alley body.  '''The foregoing reasons alone indicate that the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar body must have been #746.'''  In addition to the foregoing reasons, ''all'' WP&YR C.&S.-type boxcar bodies except ##714, 1st 734, 736, 746, 748, and 754 are eliminated from being the 4\u00bd Alley body because of its 1910 coupler pockets and because its underframe has been detached.  Of those last six bodies, ##714, 1st 734, and 754 are eliminated because photos of them disclose damages which are inconsistent with the condition of the 4\u00bd Alley body.  Of the remaining three bodies, #736 and #748 are eliminated because they never had their corresponding C&S numbers recorded.  Most likely, the latter two bodies had been demolished before the attempt was made to record the C&S numbers.  (#736 is also eliminated because it was a powder car, while the 4\u00bd Alley body had not been part of a powder car.)  As with the first three reasons, only #746 is not eliminated.  Furthermore, the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar and #754 had nearly identical histories for a time after their underframes were detached.  During this initial time, both were located at the same address, both had lumber loading doors installed at their ends, and both were eventually repainted.  Since the number of 754 had been recorded before repainting, it is likely that the number of the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar was also recorded before repainting, which would make the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar #746.

Place names \u2026 are words which can be isolated, recorded, understood and learned by a non-speaker of the language and they can remain in English versions \u2026\u201d).  However, in order to represent aboriginal place names in writing, the pronunciations of these names had to be conformed to [[English phonology]].  The aboriginal languages had no [[Alphabet|written alphabet]].  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=aeu.ark:/13960/t4xh03z07;view=1up;seq=8 Glave, Edward J.

Furthermore, they had about 12 [[Phone (phonetics)|sounds]] that do not occur in English.  Therefore, there were no symbols which corresponded to these non-English sounds.  If the aboriginal place names were to be preserved in writing, the pronunciations had to be conformed to English sounds.\n\nAn example of a sound which does not occur in English is the initial [[consonant]] in the word ''Tlingit''.  It is a lateral sound, which means that it is made to the side of the tongue.  Begin by holding the tip of the tongue against the roof of the mouth, as you would when you begin to pronounce a /d/ or /t/ sound.  Then drop a side of the tongue and make a /thl/ sound on that side.\n\nIn addition, aboriginal place names usually describe some prominent characteristic of the place.  ''See'', Cruikshank (1990) \u201cGetting the Words Right,\u201d at page 63 (\u201c[3] ''Names provide a unique way of encoding information''.  Many of the names reflect changes in landscape or in movements of plants and animals.\u201d).  Descriptive place names were needed as a tool to guide the traveler.  ''See'', {{cite book|title=The Kohklux Map|author=[[George Davidson (geographer)|Davidson, George]]|publisher=Yukon Historical & Museums Assn.|year=1883}}, at page 25.  The aboriginal traveler had to commit to memory only the description of a place, and no additional arbitrary name.  This was of assistance, because the aboriginal languages had not been reduced to writing prior to the arrival of the English or [[Russian language|Russian]] language.\n\nAs a consequence of having access ''only'' to information that could be remembered, people in the pre-1900 aboriginal societies had to deal with the world quite differently from people today.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|White Pass and Yukon Route}}\n* [http://wpyr.com Official company website]\n* [http://www.whitepassfan.net White Pass Fan Website by Boerries Burkhardt]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of White Pass And Yukon Route Locomotives And Cars}}\n[[Category:Narrow gauge railroads in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Narrow gauge railways in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Narrow gauge railways in Yukon]]\n", "text_old": "The [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] railroad has had a large variety of [[locomotive]]s and [[railroad car]]s.\n\n==White Pass steam locomotives==\n<span style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\">Locomotives with dark grey</span> have been scrapped, while <span style=\"background: #EEEEEE\">locomotives with light grey</span> have been either put on display, or sold to other railroads.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\nor ''Name''\n!Builder\n![[Whyte notation|Whyte Type]]\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n[[Tractive force|Tractive Effort]] (1942)<ref name=Tractive>Since 1942, WP&YR computed the tractive effort of steam locomotives by taking 20% of the weight on drivers.</ref>\n!Date\nBuilt\n!Shop No.\n!Remarks\n|- bgcolor=#EEEEEE\n|''Duchess''\n|[[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]\n|{{whyte|2-4-0|T}}\n{{convert|2900|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}\n|Sep.\n1878\n|4424\n|No [[Railway air brake|train brake]].

Because the correspondent is unknown, because the correspondent did not recall much about the locomotive, because the Maytown railroad did not exist until long after 1903, and because the Maytown company is not known to have owned any Climax locomotives, the known evidence suggests that the Maytown Lumber Co. did not own Climax #167.</ref>\n|- bgcolor=#DDDDDD\n|USA 10\n|[[Baldwin Locomotive Works]]\n|{{whyte|4-6-0}}\n{{convert|16010|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}\n|Jan.\n1916\n|42768\n|Originally, [[East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad|East Tennessee & Western North Carolina R.R.]] #10.

In March 1882, a New York newspaper had reported the rumor \u201cof one case where locomotives were completed according to order, but were not delivered, because the purchasers could not pay for them.\u201d  The newspaper also reported Mr. Grant\u2019s statement that this rumor \u201crelated to [an] establishment [other] than his own.\u201d  [http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%25209%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%25201882%2520Mar-Aug%2520Grayscale%2FNew%2520York%2520NY%2520Sun%25201882%2520Mar-Aug%2520Grayscale%2520-%25200142.pdf 49 ''The Sun'' (New York), No. 212 (March 31, 1882), page 3], Col. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5 (Locomotives Going Cheap).

As set forth above, shop #1442 had been completed before the 10 TC&StL locomotives were built.

According to Mr. Kemp\u2019s July 1957-recorded observations, there were two caboose bodies on private properties in Skagway [1st 905, 1st 911], but there were no boxcar bodies thereon.  Also, according to Mr. Kemp, at least 23 freight cars had been dumped into the Skagway River by July 1957, but only seven tenders had been dumped into the river by then.  An eighth tender superstructure (ex-#66, nee #69) would be dumped into the river later that same year.  ''See'', Stutz (2013). \u201cDumped Tender Shells,\u201d White Pass Fanlist No. 12191 (Tender E).  Its underframe had been removed to build Flatcar #1200 in April that year.  This suggests that retired railroad cars were still being dumped into the Skagway River in 1957.  Empirical evidence corroborates Mr. Kemp\u2019s observations.  Of the thirteen 1899-1906 WP&YR boxcars and refrigerator cars observed and identified by number ''after'' 1958, eleven (85%) had been \u201cphased out\u201d ''in'' 1958.  The two cars retired before 1958 had been maintenance of way boxcars with windows cut in them; one of the two (#642) was retained as a yard office in Whitehorse; the other (#602) was placed on a trash laden, derelict lot in Skagway.  Of the eleven numerically identified 1899-1906 cars which were transferred to and used by the local residents, ''all'' had been \u201cphased out\u201d in favor of intermodal containers in 1958 (##436, 440, 506, 518, 530, 570, 626, 656, 666, 670, 682, some now demolished).</ref><ref name=NotSquareHole>The Mile 2.9/Broadway Station boxcar is 28 feet long and has no evidence that an ore door ever existed at the bottom of its \u201cA\u201d end.

Of these four, the list can be further narrowed to those three boxcars built in 1899 which bear numbers lower than 568.  The pre-568 number is determined by the round holes which engaged the truss rod bolts.  These holes are located on the ends of the car next to the corner plates.  On boxcars which bear numbers lower than 568, these holes are round, and there are no smaller holes located adjacent to them.  On boxcars which bear numbers higher than 566, the holes are square, with two smaller round holes located adjacent to the square holes.

Of the three pre-#568 boxcars, #538 can be eliminated because photographic evidence shows that #538 had a major hole in the door on its right side, because the metal strap at the bottom of this door had a slight bowing, and because the Mile 2.9/Broadway Station boxcar does not reflect having had either defect.

Sixteen of the 17 bodies cannot be the 4\u00bd Alley body, based on three reasons.  Only #746 is not eliminated by these reasons.  First, eight of these bodies (##702, 704, 706, 710, 712, 720, 730, 758) are eliminated because they had been built in 1909, while the 4\u00bd Alley body has 1910 built coupler pockets.  Second, six of the nine remaining bodies (##708, 718, 1st 734, 2nd 734 [ex-728], 742, 754) are eliminated because, at one or more times, they have existed at locations different from the then-location of the 4\u00bd Alley body.  Third, two of the three remaining bodies (#714 and #738) are eliminated because photos of them disclose damages which are inconsistent with the condition of the 4\u00bd Alley body.  '''The foregoing reasons alone indicate that the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar body must have been #746.'''  In addition to the foregoing reasons, ''all'' WP&YR C.&S.-type boxcar bodies except ##714, 1st 734, 736, 746, 748, and 754 are eliminated from being the 4\u00bd Alley body because of its 1910 coupler pockets and because its underframe has been detached.  Of those last six bodies, ##714, 1st 734, and 754 are eliminated because photos of them disclose damages which are inconsistent with the condition of the 4\u00bd Alley body.  Of the remaining three bodies, #736 and #748 are eliminated because they never had their corresponding C&S numbers recorded.  Most likely, the latter two bodies had been demolished before the attempt was made to record the C&S numbers.  (#736 is also eliminated because it was a powder car, while the 4\u00bd Alley body had not been part of a powder car.)  As with the first three reasons, only #746 is not eliminated.  Furthermore, the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar and #754 had nearly identical histories for a time after their underframes were detached.  During this initial time, both were located at the same address, both had lumber loading doors installed at their ends, and both were eventually repainted.  Since the number of 754 had been recorded before repainting, it is likely that the number of the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar was also recorded before repainting, which would make the 4\u00bd Alley boxcar #746.

For that reason, the [[documentary evidence]] reflects that the Holikachuks had borrowed the contraction ''\u0172\u0173g Han'' [White Water River] from Gwich\u2019in, and erroneously assumed that this contraction had the same literal meaning as the corresponding Yup\u2019ik name ''Kuigpak'' [River-big].\n\n==See also==\nFor the complete roster of White Pass boats, ''see'', [[List of steamboats on the Yukon River]].\n\nFor the complete roster of White Pass winter stages, ''see'', [[Overland Trail (Yukon)]].\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n'''Notes on Aboriginal Place Names'''\n\nIt is common for aboriginal place names to remain in English.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40316196.pdf Cruikshank, Julie (1990) \u201cGetting the Words Right: Perspectives on Naming and Places in Athapaskan Oral History.\u201d 27 ''Arctic Anthropology'' (No. 1) 52, 63.] (\u201c[2] ''Names can persist''.  Place names \u2026 are words which can be isolated, recorded, understood and learned by a non-speaker of the language and they can remain in English versions \u2026\u201d).  However, in order to represent aboriginal place names in writing, the pronunciations of these names had to be conformed to [[English phonology]].  The aboriginal languages had no [[Alphabet|written alphabet]].  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=aeu.ark:/13960/t4xh03z07;view=1up;seq=8 Glave, Edward J. (1892). \u201cPioneer Packhorses in Alaska \u2013 1.\u201d 44 ''Century Magazine''  673 (September 1892)] (no written language); {{cite book|title=Travels to the Alseck|author=Glave|year=2013}}, at page 5.  Furthermore, they had about 12 [[Phone (phonetics)|sounds]] that do not occur in English.  Therefore, there were no symbols which corresponded to these non-English sounds.  If the aboriginal place names were to be preserved in writing, the pronunciations had to be conformed to English sounds.\n\nAn example of a sound which does not occur in English is the initial [[consonant]] in the word ''Tlingit''.  It is a lateral sound, which means that it is made to the side of the tongue.  Begin by holding the tip of the tongue against the roof of the mouth, as you would when you begin to pronounce a /d/ or /t/ sound.  Then drop a side of the tongue and make a /thl/ sound on that side.\n\nIn addition, aboriginal place names usually describe some prominent characteristic of the place.  ''See'', Cruikshank (1990) \u201cGetting the Words Right,\u201d at page 63 (\u201c[3] ''Names provide a unique way of encoding information''.  Many of the names reflect changes in landscape or in movements of plants and animals.\u201d).  Descriptive place names were needed as a tool to guide the traveler.  ''See'', {{cite book|title=The Kohklux Map|author=[[George Davidson (geographer)|Davidson, George]]|publisher=Yukon Historical & Museums Assn.|year=1883}}, at page 25.  The aboriginal traveler had to commit to memory only the description of a place, and no additional arbitrary name.  This was of assistance, because the aboriginal languages had not been reduced to writing prior to the arrival of the English or [[Russian language|Russian]] language.\n\nAs a consequence of having access ''only'' to information that could be remembered, people in the pre-1900 aboriginal societies had to deal with the world quite differently from people today.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|White Pass and Yukon Route}}\n* [http://wpyr.com Official company website]\n* [http://www.whitepassfan.net White Pass Fan Website by Boerries Burkhardt]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of White Pass And Yukon Route Locomotives And Cars}}\n[[Category:Narrow gauge railroads in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Narrow gauge railways in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Narrow gauge railways in Yukon]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOrigins of White Pass station, passenger car, and preserved boat names:Copyedit, fixing duplicated words: people", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_White_Pass_and_Yukon_Route_locomotives_and_cars"}

Unfortunately, conducting well-replicated studies of the effects of multiple interacting stressors on bee colonies is exceedingly difficult.

The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants.

First, the variety of pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD makes it difficult to test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances over the course of a season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place [[pollen]] and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.\n\n[[File:Imidacloprid USA 2012.png|thumb|left|Imidacloprid map of use, US, 2012 (estimated)]]\nTo date, most of the evaluation of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied on the use of surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid [[Imidacloprid effects on bee population|imidacloprid]] (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present.

In September 2007, results of a large-scale statistical [[RNA]] [[sequencing]] study of afflicted and unafflicted colonies were reported. RNA from all organisms in a colony was sequenced and compared with sequence databases to detect the presence of pathogens.

High doses of treatment or the use of miticides for an extended period of time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A study at the University of Texas in Austin found that commonly used antibiotics found in beekeeping to prevent disease lower the gut microbial levels in honeybees, making them more susceptible to disease.

This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions.\"<ref name=\"BBC NEWS\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739798.stm | work=BBC News | title=Why are Europe's bees dying? | date=20 November 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/beekeeping/8050583/Study-finds-causes-of-Colony-Collapse-Disorder-in-bees.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ian | last=Douglas | title=Study finds causes of Colony Collapse Disorder in bees | date=8 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Economic and ecological impact ==\n{{see also|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}\nHoney bees are not native to [[the Americas]], therefore their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural and ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in [[monoculture]] situations\u2014where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).\n\nThe phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as [[almond]] growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Nesting site density and distribution affect Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) reproductive success and almond yield in a commercial orchard|last = Artz|first = DR|date = November 2013|journal = Insect Conservation and Diversity|doi = 10.1111/icad.12026|volume=6|issue = 6|pages=715\u201324}}</ref> In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Morse, R.A. |author2=Calderone, N.W. |title=The value of honey bees as pollinators of US crops in 2000 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |year=2000 |url=http://www.beeculture.com/content/PollinationReprint07.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815060751/http://www.beeculture.com/content/PollinationReprint07.pdf |archivedate=15 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  California almond production increased from 370 million pounds in 1995 to a record 2,500 million pounds in 2019, with an increase of over 30% in the last decade alone.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 California almond forecast |url=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/California/Publications/Specialty_and_Other_Releases/Almond/Forecast/201905almpd.pdf |website=USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service |accessdate=9 November 2019 |date=10 May 2019}}</ref>  Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almonds.com/pollination|title=Honey Bees Are Essential for a Successful Almond Crop|publisher=California Almonds}}</ref> Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.<ref name=\"Oldroyd\" />\n\nThey are responsible for [[pollination]] of approximately one third of the United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, [[peach]]es, apples, pears, [[cherry|cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[Cranberry|cranberries]], [[watermelon]]s, [[cantaloupe]]s, [[cucumber]]s, and [[strawberry|strawberries]].

The defective rectum indicates nutritional disruption or water imbalance, whereas rectal enteroliths suggest a malfunction of excretory physiology which might further lead to constipation and poor [[osmoregulation]] in CCD bees.

Sixty-five different [[primary transcript|RNA transcripts]] have been determined as potential signs for CCD status.

Unfortunately, conducting well-replicated studies of the effects of multiple interacting stressors on bee colonies is exceedingly difficult.

The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants.

First, the variety of pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD makes it difficult to test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances over the course of a season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place [[pollen]] and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred.\n\n[[File:Imidacloprid USA 2012.png|thumb|left|Imidacloprid map of use, US, 2012 (estimated)]]\nTo date, most of the evaluation of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied on the use of surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid [[Imidacloprid effects on bee population|imidacloprid]] (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present.

In September 2007, results of a large-scale statistical [[RNA]] [[sequencing]] study of afflicted and unafflicted colonies were reported. RNA from all organisms in a colony was sequenced and compared with sequence databases to detect the presence of pathogens.

High doses of treatment or the use of miticides for an extended period of time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A study at the University of Texas in Austin found that commonly used antibiotics found in beekeeping to prevent disease lower the gut microbial levels in honeybees, making them more susceptible to disease.

This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions.\"<ref name=\"BBC NEWS\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739798.stm | work=BBC News | title=Why are Europe's bees dying? | date=20 November 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/beekeeping/8050583/Study-finds-causes-of-Colony-Collapse-Disorder-in-bees.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ian | last=Douglas | title=Study finds causes of Colony Collapse Disorder in bees | date=8 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Economic and ecological impact ==\n{{see also|List of crop plants pollinated by bees}}\nHoney bees are not native to [[the Americas]], therefore their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural and ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in [[monoculture]] situations\u2014where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).\n\nThe phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as [[almond]] growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Nesting site density and distribution affect Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) reproductive success and almond yield in a commercial orchard|last = Artz|first = DR|date = November 2013|journal = Insect Conservation and Diversity|doi = 10.1111/icad.12026|volume=6|issue = 6|pages=715\u201324}}</ref> In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Morse, R.A. |author2=Calderone, N.W. |title=The value of honey bees as pollinators of US crops in 2000 |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |year=2000 |url=http://www.beeculture.com/content/PollinationReprint07.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815060751/http://www.beeculture.com/content/PollinationReprint07.pdf |archivedate=15 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  California almond production increased from 370 million pounds in 1995 to a record 2,500 million pounds in 2019, with an increase of over 30% in the last decade alone.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 California almond forecast |url=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/California/Publications/Specialty_and_Other_Releases/Almond/Forecast/201905almpd.pdf |website=USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service |accessdate=9 November 2019 |date=10 May 2019}}</ref>  Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almonds.com/pollination|title=Honey Bees Are Essential for a Successful Almond Crop|publisher=California Almonds}}</ref> Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.<ref name=\"Oldroyd\" />\n\nThey are responsible for [[pollination]] of approximately one third of the United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, [[peach]]es, apples, pears, [[cherry|cherries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[Cranberry|cranberries]], [[watermelon]]s, [[cantaloupe]]s, [[cucumber]]s, and [[strawberry|strawberries]]. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., [[squash bee]]s on cucurbits<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Vincent J. |last1=Tepedino |date=April 1981 |title=The Pollination Efficiency of the Squash Bee (''Peponapis pruinosa'') and the Honey Bee (''Apis mellifera'') on Summer Squash (''Cucurbita pepo'') |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=359\u201377 |jstor=25084168}}</ref>), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).\n\nHowever, even though on a per-individual basis, many other species are actually more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or as effectively as honey bees\u2014in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via [[saturation pollination]] for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the [[beekeeping]] industry.
