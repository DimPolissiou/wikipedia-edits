It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[John Gavin]], [[Vera Miles]], and [[Martin Balsam]], and was based on the [[Psycho (novel)|1959 novel of the same name]] by [[Robert Bloch]]. The film centers on an encounter between a secretary, [[Marion Crane]] (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's owner-manager, [[Norman Bates]] (Perkins), and its aftermath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24944/Psycho/full-synopsis.html|title=Psycho (1960) - Full Synopsis - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Psycho'' was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film ''[[North by Northwest]]'', having been filmed on a low budget, in black-and-white, and by a television crew. The film initially received mixed reviews, but outstanding [[box office|box-office]] returns prompted critical reevaluation. ''Psycho'' was nominated for four [[33rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Leigh and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hitchcock.\n\n''Psycho'' is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films<ref>''Psycho'' is the top listed Hitchcock film in ''The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time'' by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and the highest Hitchcock film on [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]].</ref> and praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars.

In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a lunchtime tryst in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]] hotel, real-estate secretary [[Marion Crane]] and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1959|r=-3|fmt=eq}})  cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives.\n\nEn route to Fairvale, Marion stops her car on the side of the road and falls asleep. She is awakened the next morning by a state patrol trooper who follows Marion after questioning her and growing suspicious about her skittish behavior. Marion stops at a [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California automobile dealership and trades in her [[Ford Mainline]], with its Arizona license plates, for a [[Ford Custom]] 300 with California tags. The officer spots Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.\n\nDuring a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]], invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] about bringing a woman into their [[Carpenter Gothic|Gothic]] home, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life apart from her.\n\nMoved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death. After seeing blood, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions \u2013 including (unbeknownst to him) the stolen money \u2013 into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.\n\nA week later, Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. Arbogast sleuths local motels and discovers Marion spent a night at the Bates Motel. He questions Norman, whose stammering, skittishness and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After Norman implies that Marion met his mother, Arbogast asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, a mysterious figure stabs him to death.\n\nWhen Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. Sam sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam visit the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.\n\nAt the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a [[chef's knife]] and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam \u2013 having regained consciousness \u2013 subdues him.\n\nAt the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]], dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This \"Mother\" personality is as jealous and possessive as Mrs. Bates was while alive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" kills her. As \"Mother\", Norman killed two young girls before stabbing Marion and Arbogast to death. The psychiatrist says the \"Mother\" personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, \"Mother\"{{'}}s voice-over protests that the murders were Norman's doing. Marion's car is towed from the swamp.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Norman Bates in \"Psycho\" (1960).jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Perkins]]' performance as [[Norman Bates]] won him considerable critical praise.]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as [[Marion Crane]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane]]\n* [[John Gavin]] as Sam Loomis\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Private Investigator Milton Arbogast\n* [[John McIntire]] as Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as Dr. Richmond\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Tom Cassidy\n* [[Pat Hitchcock]] as Caroline\n* [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] as George Lowery\n* [[Lurene Tuttle]] as Mrs. Chambers\n* [[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]] as California Charlie\n* [[Mort Mills]] as Highway Patrol Officer\n* [[Francis De Sales (actor)|Francis De Sales]] as Deputy District Attorney Alan Deats (uncredited)\n* [[George Eldredge]] as Police Chief James Mitchell (uncredited)\n* [[Robert Osborne]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Virginia Gregg]], [[Paul Jasmin]], and [[Jeanette Nolan]] as the voice of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma \"Mother\" Bates]] (uncredited).

Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a [[serial killer]], having been charged with murder only twice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref>\n[[File:Psycho House, Motel and car composite.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.59|The ''Psycho'' set on the [[Universal Studios Lot]], featuring a [[Ford Custom 300]] similar to that driven by [[Janet Leigh]] in the film, is now part of the studio tour at the [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] theme park.]]\n[[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the novel in his \"Criminals at Large\" column and decided to show the book to her employer, even though studio readers at [[Paramount Pictures]] had already rejected its premise for a film.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>  Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel's surprises.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Hitchcock, who had come to face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives balked at Hitchcock's proposal and refused to provide his usual budget.<ref name=\"Rebello23\"/> In response, Hitchcock offered to film ''Psycho'' quickly and cheaply in black and white using his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television series crew. Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Novel adaptation===\nJames P.

Stefano found the character of Norman Bates\u2014who, in the book, is middle-aged, overweight, and more overtly unstable\u2014unsympathetic, but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins.<ref name=\"leigh3637\"/> Stefano eliminated Bates' drinking,<ref name=\"Rebello 1990 39\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=39}}</ref> which evidently necessitated removing Bates' \"becoming\" the Mother personality when in a drunken stupor.

Smith notes that, \"Her story occupies only two of the novel's 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=15}}</ref> He likewise notes there is no hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays a maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman Bates after Marion's murder.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano |title=Interview in Creative ScreenWriting Journal.

Stefano wanted to give the audience \"indications that something was quite wrong, but it could not be spelled out or overdone.\"<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> In his book of interviews with Hitchcock, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] notes that the novel \"cheats\" by having extended conversations between Norman and \"Mother\" and stating what Mother is \"doing\" at various given moments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=268}}</ref>\n\nThe first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix.<ref name=\"leigh3334\">Leigh, pp. 33\u201334</ref> Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience's attention on the solution to the mystery,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=16}}</ref> and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> Instead of having Sam explain Norman's [[psychopathology|pathology]] to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Leigh, 39\">Leigh, p. 39</ref> (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother while writing the script.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Caminer|Gallagher|1996}}</ref> The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Marion is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect, since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=47}}</ref> The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell.

The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane)  hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point.

Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the [[dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\".<ref name=\"Truffaut\">{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=273}}</ref> Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist.

When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] asked about the extent of Bass' contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|title=Psycho: The Title Credits|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> According to Bill Krohn's ''Hitchcock At Work'', Bass' first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution.<ref name=\"Krohn\">{{Harvnb|Krohn|2003}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nKrohn's analysis of the production of ''Psycho'' in his book ''Hitchcock at Work'', while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene\u2014most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nKrohn's research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|\u00c9clair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'', Hitchcock's wife, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to [[Patricia Hitchcock]], talking in Laurent Bouzereau's \"making of\" documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.<ref>Leigh, pp. 176, 42</ref>\n\nIt is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the shower scene never once shows a knife puncturing flesh.<ref>Leigh, p. 169</ref><ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=December 6, 1998 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=December 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Harmetz, Aljean |title=Janet Leigh, 77, Shower Taker of 'Psycho,' Is Dead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 5, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/movies/05leigh.html?ex=1254715200&en=596717cddaea56ef&ei=5090 |accessdate=December 1, 2006 |authorlink=Aljean Harmetz}}</ref> However, a frame by frame analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |title=8 frames of \"Psycho\" |date=May 8, 2008 |work=hitchcockwiki.com |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409193048/http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |archivedate=April 9, 2010 }}</ref> Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open.<ref>Leigh, p. 131</ref> She never realized until she first watched the film \"how vulnerable and defenseless one is\".<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/>\n\nLeigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant:\n{{Quote\n|text=Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters.

It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence, right from the opening scene in which Sam and Marion are shown as lovers sharing the same bed, with Marion in a bra.<ref name=\"Psychof\" /> In the Production Code standards of that time, unmarried couples shown in the same bed would have been taboo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voxy.co.nz/entertainment/psycho-%E2%80%93-classic-hitchcock-horror-turns-50/1117/51910|title=Psycho \u2013 Classic Hitchcock Horror Turns 50|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother controversial issue was the [[gender bending]] element.

The viewer is unaware of the [[gender dysphoria]] until, at the end of the movie, it is revealed that Bates is a [[crossdresser]] in the [[attempted murder]] of Lila. At the station, Sam asks why Bates was dressed that way. The police officer, ignorant of Bates' split personality, bluntly utters that Bates is a [[transvestite]]. The psychiatrist corrects him and says, \"Not exactly\". He explains that Bates believes that he is his own mother when he dresses in her clothes.<ref name=\"Oever2012\">{{cite book|last=Oever|first=Roel van den|title=Mama's Boy: Momism and Homophobia in Postwar American Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H1MDVe9B0UEC&pg=PA111 |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |date=September 24, 2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9781137274052 |pages=111\u2013113 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 1990 book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', the censors in charge of enforcing the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in.<ref name=\"Leigh112\">Leigh, p. 112</ref> The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since board members did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.<ref name=\"Leigh112\" />\n\nAnother cause of concern for the censors was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet, with its contents (torn-up note paper) fully visible.

In Britain, the [[BBFC]] requested cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.<ref name=\"leigh105106\">Leigh, pp. 105\u20136</ref>\n\nThe most controversial move was Hitchcock's \"no late admission\" policy for the film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as [[Henri-Georges Clouzot|Clouzot]] had done the same in France for ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Diabolique]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=21}}</ref> Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" /> At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" />\n\n==Promotion==\n[[File:Psycho Theatrical Trailer (1960).webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=364|Original trailer for ''Psycho'']]\nHitchcock did most of the promotion on his own, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of them revealing the plot.<ref>Leigh, p. 95</ref> Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which, despite possibly affecting their reviews,<ref name=\"leigh105106\"/> certainly preserved the secret.\n\nThe film's original [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is \"tracked\" with Herrmann's ''Psycho'' theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]''; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had [[Vera Miles]] don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, \"''Psycho''\", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965. \n[[File:Psycho 1960 Lobby Card.jpg|thumb|<center>Lobby card for a 1969 reissue.</center>]]\nA year later, [[CBS]] purchased the television rights for $450,000.

As a result of the [[Apollo 1|Apollo pad fire]] of January 27, 1967, the network washed its hands of ''Psycho''.<ref name=\"Leigh187\">Leigh, p. 187</ref>\n\nShortly afterward Paramount included the film in its first syndicated package of post-1950 movies, \"Portfolio I\". [[WABC-TV]] in New York City was the first station in the country to air ''Psycho'' (with some scenes significantly edited), on its late-night movie series, ''The Best of Broadway'', on June 24, 1967.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1967/06/01/archives/wabc-to-tone-down-psycho-for-june-24.html WABC TO TONE DOWN 'PSYCHO' FOR JUNE 24].

This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.<ref name=\"leigh99102\"/> It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to ''Psycho'' and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.<ref>Stephen Rebello, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Soft Skull Press, Berkeley, 1990.</ref><ref>Leigh, p. 141</ref> ''Psycho'' was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $32 million for the studio on release, and $18 million by the end of the year. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $50 million in domestic theaters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film shattered attendance records at the [[London]] Plaza [[Movie theatre|Cinema]], but nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's [[expatriate]] status.<ref name=\"leigh103106\">Leigh, pp. 103\u2013106</ref> Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised.

The site's critical consensus states, \"Infamous for its shower scene, but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre. Because ''Psycho'' was filmed with tact, grace, and art, Hitchcock didn't just create modern horror, he validated it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/psycho//|title=Psycho (1960)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Themes and style==\n===Subversion of romance through irony===\nIn ''Psycho'', Hitchcock subverts the romantic elements that are seen in most of his work. The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200\u2013201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes, \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness.\" The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption.\" <ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put\nhis mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains, {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225\u2013256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\">Leigh, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\"/>\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167 |url=}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony |last= Allen |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-231-13575-7 |page=161 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Psychoanalytic interpretation===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. \"The shower scene is both feared and desired,\" wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski. \"Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\"/>\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the ''[[superego]]'', where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ''[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'', where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]''. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

It stars [[Anthony Perkins]], [[Janet Leigh]], [[John Gavin]], [[Vera Miles]], and [[Martin Balsam]], and was based on the [[Psycho (novel)|1959 novel of the same name]] by [[Robert Bloch]]. The film centers on an encounter between a secretary, [[Marion Crane]] (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's owner-manager, [[Norman Bates]] (Perkins), and its aftermath.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/24944/Psycho/full-synopsis.html|title=Psycho (1960) - Full Synopsis - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Psycho'' was seen as a departure from Hitchcock's previous film ''[[North by Northwest]]'', having been filmed on a low budget, in black-and-white, and by a television crew. The film initially received mixed reviews, but outstanding [[box office|box-office]] returns prompted critical reevaluation. ''Psycho'' was nominated for four [[33rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Leigh and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hitchcock.\n\n''Psycho'' is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films<ref>''Psycho'' is the top listed Hitchcock film in ''The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time'' by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and the highest Hitchcock film on [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]].</ref> and praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars. Often ranked among [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], it set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/psycho/|title=''Psycho'' reviews|accessdate=April 17, 2010|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> and is widely considered to be the earliest example of the [[slasher film]] genre.\n\nAfter Hitchcock's death in 1980, [[Universal Studios]] began producing follow-ups: three [[Psycho (franchise)|sequels]], a [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]], a [[Bates Motel (film)|made-for-television spin-off]], and [[Bates Motel (TV series)|a prequel television series]] set in the 2010s. In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a lunchtime tryst in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]] hotel, real-estate secretary [[Marion Crane]] and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1959|r=-3|fmt=eq}})  cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives.\n\nEn route to Fairvale, Marion stops her car on the side of the road and falls asleep. She is awakened the next morning by a state patrol trooper who follows Marion after questioning her and growing suspicious about her skittish behavior. Marion stops at a [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California automobile dealership and trades in her [[Ford Mainline]], with its Arizona license plates, for a [[Ford Custom]] 300 with California tags. The officer spots Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.\n\nDuring a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]], invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] about bringing a woman into their [[Carpenter Gothic|Gothic]] home, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life apart from her.\n\nMoved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death. After seeing blood, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions \u2013 including (unbeknownst to him) the stolen money \u2013 into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.\n\nA week later, Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. Arbogast sleuths local motels and discovers Marion spent a night at the Bates Motel. He questions Norman, whose stammering, skittishness and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After Norman implies that Marion met his mother, Arbogast asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, a mysterious figure stabs him to death.\n\nWhen Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. Sam sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam visit the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.\n\nAt the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a [[chef's knife]] and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam \u2013 having regained consciousness \u2013 subdues him.\n\nAt the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]], dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This \"Mother\" personality is as jealous and possessive as Mrs. Bates was while alive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" kills her. As \"Mother\", Norman killed two young girls before stabbing Marion and Arbogast to death. The psychiatrist says the \"Mother\" personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, \"Mother\"{{'}}s voice-over protests that the murders were Norman's doing. Marion's car is towed from the swamp.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Norman Bates in \"Psycho\" (1960).jpg|thumb|[[Anthony Perkins]]' performance as [[Norman Bates]] won him considerable critical praise.]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Janet Leigh]] as [[Marion Crane]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane]]\n* [[John Gavin]] as Sam Loomis\n* [[Martin Balsam]] as Private Investigator Milton Arbogast\n* [[John McIntire]] as Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers\n* [[Simon Oakland]] as Dr. Richmond\n* [[Frank Albertson]] as Tom Cassidy\n* [[Pat Hitchcock]] as Caroline\n* [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] as George Lowery\n* [[Lurene Tuttle]] as Mrs. Chambers\n* [[John Anderson (actor)|John Anderson]] as California Charlie\n* [[Mort Mills]] as Highway Patrol Officer\n* [[Francis De Sales (actor)|Francis De Sales]] as Deputy District Attorney Alan Deats (uncredited)\n* [[George Eldredge]] as Police Chief James Mitchell (uncredited)\n* [[Robert Osborne]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Ted Knight]] as Police Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Virginia Gregg]], [[Paul Jasmin]], and [[Jeanette Nolan]] as the voice of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma \"Mother\" Bates]] (uncredited).

Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to her, and dressed in women's clothes. However, unlike Bates, Gein is not strictly considered a [[serial killer]], having been charged with murder only twice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref>\n[[File:Psycho House, Motel and car composite.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.59|The ''Psycho'' set on the [[Universal Studios Lot]], featuring a [[Ford Custom 300]] similar to that driven by [[Janet Leigh]] in the film, is now part of the studio tour at the [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] theme park.]]\n[[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's long-time assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the novel in his \"Criminals at Large\" column and decided to show the book to her employer, even though studio readers at [[Paramount Pictures]] had already rejected its premise for a film.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref>  Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to preserve the novel's surprises.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Hitchcock, who had come to face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. He disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives balked at Hitchcock's proposal and refused to provide his usual budget.<ref name=\"Rebello23\"/> In response, Hitchcock offered to film ''Psycho'' quickly and cheaply in black and white using his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television series crew. Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Novel adaptation===\nJames P.

Stefano found the character of Norman Bates\u2014who, in the book, is middle-aged, overweight, and more overtly unstable\u2014unsympathetic, but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins.<ref name=\"leigh3637\"/> Stefano eliminated Bates' drinking,<ref name=\"Rebello 1990 39\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=39}}</ref> which evidently necessitated removing Bates' \"becoming\" the Mother personality when in a drunken stupor. Also gone is Bates' interest in [[spiritualism]], the [[occult]] and [[pornography]].<ref>Tangentially mentioned by interviewer of Stefano [http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano Joseph Stefano] but generally given less attention than the film's omission of Bates' alcoholism and pornography.</ref> Hitchcock and Stefano elected to open the film with scenes in Marion's life and not introduce Bates at all until 20 minutes into the film, rather than open with Bates reading a history book as Bloch does.<ref name=\"Rebello 1990 39\"/> Indeed, writer Joseph W. Smith notes that, \"Her story occupies only two of the novel's 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=15}}</ref> He likewise notes there is no hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays a maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman Bates after Marion's murder.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano |title=Interview in Creative ScreenWriting Journal.

Stefano wanted to give the audience \"indications that something was quite wrong, but it could not be spelled out or overdone.\"<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> In his book of interviews with Hitchcock, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] notes that the novel \"cheats\" by having extended conversations between Norman and \"Mother\" and stating what Mother is \"doing\" at various given moments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=268}}</ref>\n\nThe first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix.<ref name=\"leigh3334\">Leigh, pp. 33\u201334</ref> Also changed is the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience's attention on the solution to the mystery,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2009|p=16}}</ref> and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap.<ref name=\"screenwriting-stefano\"/> Instead of having Sam explain Norman's [[psychopathology|pathology]] to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Leigh, 39\">Leigh, p. 39</ref> (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother while writing the script.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Caminer|Gallagher|1996}}</ref> The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Marion is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect, since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=47}}</ref> The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about \"Mother\" without tipping that something was being hidden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/wiki/Creative_Screenwriting_-_Interview_with_Joseph_Stefano |title=Interview with Stefano |publisher=Hitchcockwiki.com |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}</ref> As Janet Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.<ref name=\"Leigh, 39\"/>\n\n===Pre-production===\nParamount, whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did not want Hitchcock to make ''Psycho''. Paramount was expecting ''[[List of unproduced Hitchcock projects#No Bail for the Judge (1958\u20131961)|No Bail for the Judge]]'' starring [[Audrey Hepburn]], who became pregnant and had to bow out, leading Hitchcock to scrap the production.

Green]] to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio.<ref name=\"leigh2426\">Leigh, pp. 24\u201326</ref> Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between [[Gorman, California|Gorman]] and [[Fresno]], California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. Footage of her driving into Bakersfield to trade her car is also shown. They also provided the location shots for the scene in which she is discovered sleeping in her car by the highway patrolman.<ref name=\"leigh2426\"/> In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix, Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible; rather than re-shoot the footage, Hitchcock chose to add a graphic to the opening scene marking the date as \"Friday, December the Eleventh\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=90}}</ref>\n\nGreen also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes such as those belonging to Marion and her sister.<ref name=\"leigh2426\"/> He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor.<ref name=\"leigh2426\"/> The look of the Bates house was modeled on [[Edward Hopper]]'s painting ''The House by the Railroad,''<ref>{{Harvnb|Wagstaff|2004|p=234}} See also Liner notes to CD recording of score by Joel McNeely & Royal Scottish National Orchestra</ref> a fanciful portrait of the [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] home at 18 Conger Avenue in [[Haverstraw, New York]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/96may/hopper/hopper.htm |title=''Someplace Like Home: An eerily familiar house rises in many American landscapes'' by Paul Bochner.

Leigh took the joke well, and she wondered whether it was done to keep her on edge and thus more in character or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience.<ref>Leigh, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\nDuring shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane)  hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by assistant director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the [[dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\".<ref name=\"Truffaut\">{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=273}}</ref> Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.<ref>Leigh, pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\n[[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo]] is a signature occurrence in most of his films.

When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] asked about the extent of Bass' contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|title=Psycho: The Title Credits|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> According to Bill Krohn's ''Hitchcock At Work'', Bass' first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution.<ref name=\"Krohn\">{{Harvnb|Krohn|2003}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nKrohn's analysis of the production of ''Psycho'' in his book ''Hitchcock at Work'', while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene\u2014most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nKrohn's research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|\u00c9clair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'', Hitchcock's wife, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to [[Patricia Hitchcock]], talking in Laurent Bouzereau's \"making of\" documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences.<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/> Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimation to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.<ref>Leigh, pp. 176, 42</ref>\n\nIt is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the shower scene never once shows a knife puncturing flesh.<ref>Leigh, p. 169</ref><ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=December 6, 1998 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=December 1, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Harmetz, Aljean |title=Janet Leigh, 77, Shower Taker of 'Psycho,' Is Dead |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 5, 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/movies/05leigh.html?ex=1254715200&en=596717cddaea56ef&ei=5090 |accessdate=December 1, 2006 |authorlink=Aljean Harmetz}}</ref> However, a frame by frame analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |title=8 frames of \"Psycho\" |date=May 8, 2008 |work=hitchcockwiki.com |accessdate=April 24, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409193048/http://www.hitchcockwiki.com/blog/?p=274 |archivedate=April 9, 2010 }}</ref> Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it, that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open.<ref>Leigh, p. 131</ref> She never realized until she first watched the film \"how vulnerable and defenseless one is\".<ref name=\"dvddoc\"/>\n\nLeigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant:\n{{Quote\n|text=Marion had decided to go back to Phoenix, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she were stepping into the baptismal waters.

The viewer is unaware of the [[gender dysphoria]] until, at the end of the movie, it is revealed that Bates is a [[crossdresser]] in the [[attempted murder]] of Lila. At the station, Sam asks why Bates was dressed that way. The police officer, ignorant of Bates' split personality, bluntly utters that Bates is a [[transvestite]]. The psychiatrist corrects him and says, \"Not exactly\".

Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in.<ref name=\"Leigh112\">Leigh, p. 112</ref> The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set.

In Britain, the [[BBFC]] requested cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was objected to. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast, and a shot of Norman's mother's corpse were removed.<ref name=\"leigh105106\">Leigh, pp. 105\u20136</ref>\n\nThe most controversial move was Hitchcock's \"no late admission\" policy for the film, which was unusual for the time. It was not entirely original as [[Henri-Georges Clouzot|Clouzot]] had done the same in France for ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Diabolique]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=21}}</ref> Hitchcock thought that if people entered the theater late and never saw the star actress Janet Leigh, they would feel cheated.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" /> At first theater owners opposed the idea, claiming that they would lose business.

It is \"tracked\" with Herrmann's ''Psycho'' theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]''; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had [[Vera Miles]] don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, \"''Psycho''\", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.<ref name=\"Leigh9697\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe film was so successful that it was reissued to theaters in 1965. \n[[File:Psycho 1960 Lobby Card.jpg|thumb|<center>Lobby card for a 1969 reissue.</center>]]\nA year later, [[CBS]] purchased the television rights for $450,000.

This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.<ref name=\"leigh99102\"/> It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to ''Psycho'' and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.<ref>Stephen Rebello, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Soft Skull Press, Berkeley, 1990.</ref><ref>Leigh, p. 141</ref> ''Psycho'' was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $32 million for the studio on release, and $18 million by the end of the year. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $50 million in domestic theaters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film shattered attendance records at the [[London]] Plaza [[Movie theatre|Cinema]], but nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's [[expatriate]] status.<ref name=\"leigh103106\">Leigh, pp. 103\u2013106</ref> Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised.

The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200\u2013201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes, \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness.\" The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption.\" <ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put\nhis mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains, {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225\u2013256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\">Leigh, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\"/>\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167 |url=}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony |last= Allen |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-231-13575-7 |page=161 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Psychoanalytic interpretation===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. \"The shower scene is both feared and desired,\" wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski. \"Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\"/>\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the ''[[superego]]'', where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ''[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'', where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]''. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0642\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u064a\u0633\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0636\n\n\u0647\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0631\u0627\u0636\u064a \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f\n\nAirway \n\n<br />\n== ay ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].

If any of these deviate from normal, this may indicate an underlying problem (such as with [[Cheyne-Stokes respiration]])\n* Chest deformity and movement - The chest should rise and fall equally on both sides, and should be free of deformity.  Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as [[pneumothorax]] or [[haemothorax]]\n* Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or [[stridor]] (which indicates airway obstruction)\n* Checking for [[surgical emphysema]] which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a [[pneumothorax]]\n* [[Auscultation]] and [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] of the chest by using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities\n* Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing\n\n== Circulation ==\nOnce oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body.\n\n===Non-breathing patients===\nCirculation is the original meaning of the \"C\" as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a [[carotid]] [[pulse]], before taking any further treatment steps.\n\nIn modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cjstudios.com/Aquatics/new_cpr_standards.htm|title=New CPR Standards|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation.

This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead\n* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses\n* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock\n* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals\n* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)\n* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]\n\n== Variations ==\nNearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).\n\n===ABCD===\nThere are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC).

For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n== Airway ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].

This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead\n* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses\n* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock\n* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals\n* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)\n* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]\n\n== Variations ==\nNearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).\n\n===ABCD===\nThere are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC).

He was elected a Member of Parliament for [[Beverley (UK Parliament constituency)|Beverley]] in the five Parliaments between 1625 and 1640, and served as [[Sheriff of Yorkshire]] in 1634. In 1639 he was deprived by the king of his office of Governor of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], and joining the parliamentary party, he refused to pay [[Ship money|ship-money]]. In January 1642 Hotham was ordered by Parliament to seize the town of Hull, where there was a large store of munitions of war; this was at once carried out by his son [[John Hotham the younger]]. Hotham senior took command of Hull and in April 1642 refused to admit King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the town. Later he promised his prisoner, [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol]], that he would surrender the town to the king, but when Charles appeared again he refused a second time and drove away the besiegers.{{sfn| Chisholm|1911|p=803}}\n\nMeanwhile, Hotham the younger was taking an active part in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]], but was soon at variance with other parliamentary leaders, especially with [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] and his son Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], and complaints about his conduct and that of his troops were made by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and by Colonel [[John Hutchinson (Colonel)|John Hutchinson]]. Soon both the Hothams were corresponding with the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], and Hotham the younger was probably ready to betray Hull; these proceedings became known to Parliament, and in June 1643 father and son were captured and taken to [[London]].{{sfn| Chisholm|1911|p=803}}\n\n==Death & burial==\n[[File:John Hotham Tomb South Dalton.jpg|thumb|Monument to Sir John Hotham in St Mary's Church, [[South Dalton]] (near Scorborough),<ref>http://www.daltonestate.co.uk/history</ref> supported by figures of the [[cardinal virtues]]]]\nAfter a long delay they were tried by [[court-martial]], were found guilty and were sentenced to death.

His mother has been variously given as Julian Stanhope, a daughter of [[Michael Stanhope (died 1552)|Sir Michael Stanhope]] of [[Shelford, Nottinghamshire|Shelford]], [[Nottinghamshire]]{{sfn| Chisholm|1911|p=803}} or as Jane Legard, a daughter of Richard Legard of Rysome, Yorkshire.<ref>Scott; Healy</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe fought on the continent of Europe during the early part of the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{sfn| Chisholm|1911|p=803}} In 1622 he was made a [[baronet]]. He was elected a Member of Parliament for [[Beverley (UK Parliament constituency)|Beverley]] in the five Parliaments between 1625 and 1640, and served as [[Sheriff of Yorkshire]] in 1634. In 1639 he was deprived by the king of his office of Governor of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], and joining the parliamentary party, he refused to pay [[Ship money|ship-money]]. In January 1642 Hotham was ordered by Parliament to seize the town of Hull, where there was a large store of munitions of war; this was at once carried out by his son [[John Hotham the younger]]. Hotham senior took command of Hull and in April 1642 refused to admit King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the town. Later he promised his prisoner, [[George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol]], that he would surrender the town to the king, but when Charles appeared again he refused a second time and drove away the besiegers.{{sfn| Chisholm|1911|p=803}}\n\nMeanwhile, Hotham the younger was taking an active part in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]], but was soon at variance with other parliamentary leaders, especially with [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] and his son Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]], and complaints about his conduct and that of his troops were made by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and by Colonel [[John Hutchinson (Colonel)|John Hutchinson]]. Soon both the Hothams were corresponding with the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], and Hotham the younger was probably ready to betray Hull; these proceedings became known to Parliament, and in June 1643 father and son were captured and taken to [[London]].{{sfn| Chisholm|1911|p=803}}\n\n==Death & burial==\n[[File:John Hotham Tomb South Dalton.jpg|thumb|Monument to Sir John Hotham in St Mary's Church, [[South Dalton]] (near Scorborough),<ref>http://www.daltonestate.co.uk/history</ref> supported by figures of the [[cardinal virtues]]]]\nAfter a long delay they were tried by [[court-martial]], were found guilty and were sentenced to death. The younger Hotham was beheaded at [[Tower Hill]] on 2 January 1645, and despite of efforts made by the [[House of Lords]] and the [[Presbyterians]] to save him, his father suffered the same fate on the following day. Both were buried at the nearby church of [[All Hallows-by-the-Tower]]. {{sfn|Scott|2008}} A tomb monument was erected in his memory in St Mary's Church, South Dalton.

The nation achieved independence from Britain on 27 April 1961, and [[Milton Margai]] became the first Prime Minister. Margai's political party was the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP), under the leadership of [[Albert Margai]], and it narrowly lost the 1967 Sierra Leone parliamentary elections to the main opposition party of the [[All People's Congress]] (APC) led by [[Siaka Stevens]]. \n\nStevens was a political strongman who ruled Sierra Leone from 1967 to 1985 when he retired from politics due to poor health. On 19 April 1971, Stevens' government abolished Sierra Leone's parliamentary system and declared Sierra Leone a presidential republic. From 1978 to 1985, president Stevens\" APC party was the only legal political party in Sierra Leone. The multiparty democratic [[constitution of Sierra Leone]] was adopted in 1991 by the government of President [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], Stevens' hand-picked successor, just as the rebel group [[Revolutionary United Front]] led by [[Foday Sankoh]] launched a brutal civil war in the country.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of Junior soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Captain [[Valentine Strasser]] overthrew President Momoh, and Sierra Leone was under Military rule from 1992 to 1996 during the civil war. The country returned to a democratically elected government when the military Junta under Brigadier General [[Julius Maada Bio]] handed the presidency to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] of the SLPP after his victory in the 1996 election. However, the Sierra Leone military overthrew President Kabbah in a coup on 25 May 1997, and Major General [[Johnny Paul Koroma]] became the country's head of state. A coalition of West African [[Ecowas]] armed forces led by [[Nigeria]] then reinstated President Kabbah by military force in February 1998, and the leaders of the coup were executed after they were sentenced to death by a Sierra Leone military court. In January 2002, President Kabbah announced the end of the civil war with the help of Ecowas, the British government, the African Union, and the United Nations. Sierra Leone has had an uninterrupted democratic government from 1998 to present.\n\nSixteen ethnic groups inhabit Sierra Leone, each with its own language and customs. The two largest and most influential are the [[Temne people|Temne]] and [[Mende people]]. The Temne are predominantly found in the northwest and the Mende in the southeast. About two percent of the population are the [[Krio people]], who are descendants of freed American and West Indian slaves. English is the official language used in schools and government administration, but [[Krio language|Krio]] is the most widely spoken language, an [[English-based creole]] used by 98 percent of the population. Krio unites all the ethnic groups in the country, especially in their trade and social interaction.\n\nSierra Leone is 77 percent Muslim, with an influential Christian minority of 22 percent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census |url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_pop_structure_and_pop_distribution.pdf |website=Statistics Sierra Leone}}</ref> The country is regarded as one of the most religiously tolerant countries in the world.

The official documentation known as the [[Book of Negroes]] lists thousands of freed slaves whom the British evacuated from the nascent United States and resettled in colonies elsewhere in [[British North America]] (north to Canada, or south to the West Indies).\n\nIn 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in Sierra Leone in what was called the \"[[Province of Freedom]]\". It intended to resettle some of the \"[[Black Poor]] of London\", some of whom were African-Americans freed by the British during the war. About 400 blacks and 60 whites reached Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787. The group also included some [[West Indies|West Indians]] of African descent from London. After they established [[Granville Town]], most of the first group of colonists died, owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ([[Temne people|Temne]]), who resisted their encroachment.

They founded [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination from nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]. [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]] pressed British authorities for relief and more aid; together with British abolitionist [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]], the [[Sierra Leone Company]] was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa. In 1792 nearly 1200&nbsp;persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second (and only permanent) Colony of Sierra Leone and the settlement of [[Freetown]] on 11 March 1792. In Sierra Leone they were called the [[Nova Scotian Settlers]], the ''Nova Scotians'', or the ''Settlers''.\n\nThe Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the [[American South]]; they also continued American fashion and American manners. In addition, many continued to practice [[Methodism]] in Freetown. Black settlers in Sierra Leone enjoyed much more autonomy in that they were more politically engaged. Black immigrants elected different levels of political representatives, 'tithingmen', who represented each dozen settlers, and 'hundreders' who represented larger amounts. This sort of representation was not available in Nova Scotia.<ref>Gilbert, Alan. ''Black Patriots and Loyalists: Fighting for Emancipation in the War for Independence''. University of Chicago 2012, p. 229</ref> The initial process of society-building in Freetown, however, was a harsh struggle.

In 1799 some of the settlers revolted. The Crown subdued the revolt by bringing in forces of more than 500&nbsp;[[Jamaican Maroons]], whom they transported from [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]] via Nova Scotia in 1800. Led by Colonel Montague James, the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt, and in the process they secured the best houses and farms.<ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: 2005), pp. 380\u2013383.</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1808, [[Thomas Ludlam (colonialist)|Thomas Ludlam]], the Governor of the Sierra Leone Company and a leading abolitionist, surrendered the Company's charter.

Its members represented both British who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company, which held the (British) monopoly on Sierra Leone trade.<ref>Harris, Sheldon H.

These Liberated Africans or ''[[recaptives]]'' were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the Jamaican Maroons.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some of the recaptives who were not sold as apprentices were forced to join the Navy. Many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. For example, some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more Western sounding one. Though some people happily embraced these changes because they considered it as being part of the community, some were not happy with these changes and wanted to keep their own identity. Many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving Sierra Leone and going back to their original villages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schwarz|first=Suzanne|date=5 January 2013|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Enslaved Africans: Sierra Leone, c. 1808\u201319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267884583}}</ref> They built a flourishing trade in flowers and beads on the West African coast.\n\nThese returned Africans were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. During the 19th century, freed black Americans, some [[Americo Liberian]] 'refugees', and particularly West Indians, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples created a new creole ethnicity called the [[Krio people]] (initially called Creoles) and a trading language, [[Krio language|Krio]], which became commonly used among many of the ethnicities in the country.\n\n=== Colonial era (1800\u20131961) ===\n\n{{Main|Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate}}\n\nThe settlement of Sierra Leone in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans who were brought to the colony after the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807. Upon arrival in Sierra Leone, each \"recaptive\" was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities would be entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. However, oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track. In addition, differences between the Register of Liberated Africans of 1808 and the List of Captured Negroes of 1812 (which emulated the 1808 document) revealed some disparities in the entries of the recaptives, specifically in the names; many recaptives decided to change their given names to more [[anglicised]] versions which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in Sierra Leone.\n\nAccording to the British Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the recaptives could be subject to apprenticeships led by British colonists in Sierra Leone and the males enlisted into the Army or Navy. In many instances, the recaptives who were assigned to apprenticeships were sold for $20, giving the apprenticeship system qualities similar to slavery.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Suzanne|date=2012|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Liberated Africans: Sierra Leone in the Early Nineteenth Century|url=|journal=History in Africa|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> It is documented that the recaptive apprentices were unpaid and the settlers who they were appointed to had devices which could be used to discipline them, namely sticks. According to Suzanne Schwartz, a historian on colonial Sierra Leone, in June 1808 a group of 21 men and women ran away to the nearby native settlement of Robiss and upon recapture were imprisoned by the settlers in Sierra Leone, thus contributing to the slavery-like qualities of the apprenticeship system.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\"/> [[File:Bai Bureh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bai Bureh]], Temne leader of the [[Hut Tax War of 1898]] against British rule]]\n\nIn the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region, who also administered the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]) and the [[Gambia]] settlements. Sierra Leone developed as the educational centre of British West Africa. The British established [[Fourah Bay College]] here in 1827, which rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\n[[File:Bai Bureh (1898).jpg|thumb|Temne leader Bai Bureh seen here in 1898 after his surrender, sitting relaxed in his traditional dress with a handkerchief in his hands, while a Sierra Leonean [[Royal West African Frontier Force|Royal West African Frontier]] soldier stands guard next to him ]]\n\nThe British interacted mostly with the Krios in Freetown, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. In addition, educated Krios held numerous positions in the colonial government, giving them status and good-paying positions. Following the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the UK decided that it needed to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what was described by the European powers as \"effective occupation\" of territories. In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the Sierra Leone Protectorate.<ref name=\"harris40\">Harris, David (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5RxmwC6aNwC&pg=PA1 ''Civil War and Democracy in West Africa: Conflict Resolution, Elections and Justice in Sierra Leone and Liberia''], I.B. Tauris. p. 40</ref> With this change, the British began to expand their administration in the region, recruiting British citizens to posts, and pushing Krios out of positions in government and even the desirable residential areas in Freetown.<ref name=\"harris40\"/>\n\nIn addition, the British annexation of the Protectorate interfered with the sovereignty of indigenous chiefs. They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually as had been previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longtime allies, such as [[Bai Bureh]], chief of Kasseh, a community on the Small Scarcies River. He was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the Hut Tax war in 1898.<ref name=\"abraham\">{{cite journal\n  |title = Bai Bureh, The British, and the Hut Tax War\n  |last = Abraham\n  |first = Arthur\n  |journal = [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]]\n  |issn = 0361-7882\n  |volume = 7\n  |issue = 1\n  |year = 1974\n  |pages = 99\u2013106\n  |doi = 10.2307/216556\n  |jstor = 216556\n  }}</ref>\n\nColonel Frederic Cardew, military governor of the Protectorate, in 1898 established a new tax on dwellings and demanded that the chiefs use their peoples to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew, stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes. Tensions over the new colonial requirements, and the administration's suspicions about the chiefs led to the [[Hut Tax War of 1898|Hut Tax war of 1898]], also called the Temne-Mende War. The British fired first. The Northern front of majority Temne people was led by [[Bai Bureh]]. The Southern front, consisting mostly of [[Mende people]], entered conflict somewhat later and for different reasons.\n\nFor several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces, but the British troops and Bureh's warriors suffered hundreds of fatalities.<ref>[http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html History], Sierra-leone.org, Retrieved 17 January 2007.</ref> Bai Bureh finally surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings.

The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country.\n\nIn 1924, the UK government divided Sierra Leone into a Colony and a Protectorate, with different political systems constitutionally defined for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the hinterland areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most of the proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered that in the colony. The Krios, led by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson|Isaac Wallace-Johnson]], opposed the proposals, as they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the Krios in the Colony.\n\nIn 1951, educated protectorate leaders from different groups, including [[Sir]] [[Milton Margai]], [[Lamina Sankoh]], [[Siaka Stevens]], Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha, [[John Karefa-Smart]], Kande Bureh, Sir [[Albert Margai]], [[Amadu Wurie]] and Sir [[Banja Tejan-Sie]] joined together with the powerful [[paramount chiefs]] in the protectorate to form the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] or SLPP as the party of the protectorate.

He was neither corrupt nor did he make a lavish display of his power or status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes8.html|title=Sierra Leone Web - Sierra Leonean Heroes - Achievement of Independence|website=www.sierra-leone.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> He based the government on the [[rule of law]] and the separation of powers, with multiparty political institutions and fairly viable representative structures. Margai used his conservative ideology to lead Sierra Leone without much strife. He appointed government officials to represent various ethnic groups. Margai employed a brokerage style of politics, by sharing political power among political parties and interest groups; and with the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces, most of whom were key allies of his government.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Final years of democracy (1964\u20131967)===\n\nUpon Milton Margai's unexpected death in 1964, his [[half-brother]], Sir [[Albert Margai]], was appointed as Prime Minister by parliament. Sir Albert's leadership was briefly challenged by Foreign Minister [[John Karefa-Smart]], who questioned Sir Albert's succession to the SLPP leadership position. Karefa-Smart led a prominent small minority faction within the SLPP party in opposition of Albert Margai as Prime Minister. However, Kareefa-Smart failed to receive strong support within the SLPP and the SLPP dominated members of parliament in his attempt to have Albert Margai stripped of his position as the leader of the SLPP and prime minister of the country. The large majority of SLPP members backed Albert Margai over Kareefa-Smart. Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as Prime Minister, he dismissed several senior government officials who had served under his elder brother Milton's government, viewing them as a threat to his administration, including Kareefa-Smart.\n\nSir Albert resorted to increasingly [[authoritarian]] actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), whilst attempting to establish a [[one-party state]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Sir Albert was opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs, many of whom had been key allies of his late brother Sir Milton. Accordingly, they began to consider Sir Albert a threat to the ruling houses across the country. Margai appointed many non-Creoles to the country's [[civil service]] in [[Freetown]], in an overall diversification of the civil service in the capital, which had been dominated by members of the Creole ethnic group. As a result, Albert Margai became unpopular in the Creole community, many of whom had supported Sir Milton. Margai was accused of favoring members of his own Mende ethnic group for prominent positions.\n\nIn 1967, riots broke out in Freetown against Margai's policies; in response he declared a [[state of emergency]] across the country. Sir Albert was accused of corruption and of a policy of [[affirmative action]] in favor of his own [[Mende people|Mende]] ethnic group.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Pham |first = John-Peter |title = Child soldiers, adult interests: the global dimensions of the Sierra Leonean tragedy |publisher = Nova Publishers |year = 2005 |pages = 33\u201335 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZnPFKpwoIkIC&pg=PA32 |isbn = 978-1-59454-671-6 |accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref> Although possessing the full backing of the country's security forces, he called for free and fair elections.\n\n=== Military coups (1967\u20131968) ===\n\nThe APC, with its leader [[Siaka Stevens]], narrowly won a small majority of seats in Parliament over the SLPP in a closely contested [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1967|1967 general election]]. Stevens was sworn in as Prime Minister on 21 March 1967.\n\nWithin hours after taking office, Stevens was ousted in a bloodless [[military coup]] led by [[Brigadier General]] [[David Lansana]], the commander of the [[Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces|Sierra Leone Armed Forces]]. He was a close ally of Albert Margai, who had appointed him to the position in 1964. Lansana placed Stevens under [[house arrest]] in Freetown and insisted that the determination of Prime Minister should await the election of the tribal representatives to the House. Upon his release, Stevens went into exile in [[Guinea]].\n\nOn 23 March 1967, a group of military officers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Brigadier General [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]], overrode this action by a coup d'\u00e9tat; they seized control of the government, arresting Lansana, and suspending the constitution. The group set up the [[National Reformation Council]] (NRC), with Andrew Juxon-Smith as its chairman and Head of State of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrover.com/history/sierra_leone_history.html |title=History of Sierra Leone |publisher=Worldrover.com |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 April 1968 a group of low ranking soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army who called themselves the [[Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement]] (ACRM), led by Brigadier General [[John Amadu Bangura]], [[Sergeants' Coup (Sierra Leone)|overthrew]] the NRC [[Military junta|junta]].

Stevens had campaigned on a platform of bringing the tribes together under [[socialist]] principles. During his first decade or so in power, Stevens renegotiated some of what he called \"useless prefinanced schemes\" contracted by his predecessors, both Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC. Some of these policies by the SLPP and the NRC were said to have left the country in an economically deprived state.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nStevens reorganised the country's oil refinery, the government-owned Cape Sierra Hotel, and a cement factory.<ref>David Harris. Sierra Leone: A Political History., pp. 67-70 New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. {{ISBN|9780199361762}}. $30.00</ref> He cancelled Juxon-Smith's construction of a church and mosque on the grounds of Victoria Park (since mid 2017 ''Freetown Amusement Park''). Stevens began efforts that would later bridge the distance between the provinces and the city. Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces, and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown.\n\nUnder pressure of several coup attempts, real or perceived, Stevens' rule grew more and more [[authoritarian]], and his relationship with some of his ardent supporters deteriorated. He removed the SLPP party from competitive politics in general elections, some believed, through the use of violence and intimidation. To maintain the support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as the head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces.\n\nAfter the return to civilian rule, by-elections were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. Calm was not completely restored. In November 1968, unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country. Many senior officers in the Sierra Leone Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens' policies and his handling of the Sierra Leone Military, but none could confront Stevens. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister, was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens. The army was devoted to Bangura, and this made him potentially dangerous to Stevens. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. After a trial that lasted a few months, Bangura was [[convicted]] and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. On 29 March 1970, Brigadier Bangura was executed by hanging in Freetown.\n\nAfter the execution of Bangura, a group of soldiers loyal to the executed Brigadier Bangura held a [[mutiny]] in the capital Freetown and in some other parts of the country in opposition of Stevens' government. Dozens of soldiers were arrested and [[convicted]] by a [[court martial]] in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny against president Stevens. Among the soldiers arrested was a little known army [[Corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh]], a strong supporter of Bangura. Corporal Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown.\n\nIn April 1971, a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president. In the 1972 by-elections the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.<ref>{{Cite book |last =Rotberg |first =Robert I. |title =State failure and state weakness in a time of terror |publisher = Brookings Institution Press|year =2003 |page = 80 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=oajfCpTpgCIC&pg=PA80|isbn = 978-0-8157-7574-4|accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAn alleged plot to overthrow president Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed. In mid 1974, Guinean soldiers, requested by Stevens, were in the country to help maintain his hold on power as Stevens was a close ally of then Guinean president [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]]. In March 1976, Stevens was elected without opposition for a second five-year term as president. On 19 July 1975, 14 senior army and government officials including David Lansana, former cabinet minister Mohamed Sorie Forna (father of writer [[Aminatta Forna]]), Brigadier General Ibrahim Bash Taqi and Lieutenant Habib Lansana Kamara were executed after being convicted of allegedly attempting a coup to topple president Stevens' government.\n\nIn 1977, a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted Sierra Leone politics. The demonstration was quickly put down by the army and Stevens' own personal Special Security Division (SSD) force, a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and to maintain his hold on power.<ref>[http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 Politicized security forces or tribalized national politics; which is which?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901024455/http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 |date=1 September 2012 }}.

[[Sierra Leonean parliamentary election, 1977|A general election]] was called later that year in which corruption was again endemic; the APC won 74 seats and the SLPP 15. In 1978, the APC-dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a [[one-party state]]. The 1978 constitution made the APC the only legal political party in Sierra Leone.<ref name=Gberie>Gberie, Lansana (1998). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/30/ War and state collapse: The case of Sierra Leone]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University</ref> This move led to another major demonstration against the government in many parts of the country, but again it was put down by the army and Stevens' SSD forces.\n\nStevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption, but on a positive note, he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war. He built several government institutions that are still in use today.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Stevens also reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government.\n\nSiaka Stevens retired from politics in November 1985 after being in power for eighteen years. The APC named a new presidential candidate to succeed Stevens at their last delegate conference held in Freetown in November 1985. He was [[Major General]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], the head of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and Stevens' own choice to succeed him. As head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, Major General Momoh was very loyal to Stevens, who had appointed him to the position. Like Stevens, Momoh was also a member of the minority [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] ethnic group.\n\nMomoh was elected president as the only contesting candidate, without any opposition, and was sworn in as Sierra Leone's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown. A one-party parliamentary election between APC members was held in May 1986. President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally, Major General Mohamed Tarawalie to succeed him as the head of the Sierra Leone Military. Major General Tarawalie was also a strong loyalist and key supporter of president Momoh. President Momoh named James Bambay Kamara as the head of the [[Sierra Leone Police]]. Bambay Kamara was a key loyalist and strong supporter of President Momoh. Momoh broke away from former president Siaka Stevens, by integrating the powerful SSD into the Sierra Leone Police as a special [[paramilitary force]] of the Sierra Leone Police. Under President Stevens, the SSD had been a powerful personal force used to maintain his hold on power, independent from the Sierra Leone Military and Sierra Leone Police Force. The Sierra Leone Police under Bambay Kamara's leadership, was accused of physical violence, arrest and intimidation against critics of President Momoh's government.\n\nPresident Momoh's strong links with the army and his verbal attacks on corruption earned him much-needed initial support among Sierra Leoneans. With the lack of new faces in the new APC cabinet under president Momoh and the return of many of the old faces from Stevens' government, criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens.\n\nThe next couple of years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption, which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers. To formalise his war against corruption, President Momoh announced a \"[[Code of Conduct]] for Political Leaders and Public Servants.\" After an alleged attempt to overthrow President Momoh in March 1987, more than 60 senior government officials were arrested, including Vice President [[Francis Minah]], who was removed from office, convicted of plotting the coup, and executed by [[hanging]] in 1989 along with 5 others.\n\n=== Sierra Leone Civil War (1991\u20132002) ===\n\n{{Further|Sierra Leone Civil War}}\n\n[[File:School destroyed by Sierra Leone Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A school in [[Koindu]] destroyed during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Civil War]]; in total 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.<ref name=\"ilab\"/>]]\n\nIn October 1990, owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reform, president Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution. Based on the commission's recommendations a constitution re-establishing a multi-party system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60% majority vote, becoming effective on 1 October 1991. There was great suspicion that president Momoh was not serious about his promise of political reform, as APC rule continued to be increasingly marked by abuses of power.\n\nThe brutal civil war that was going on in neighbouring [[Liberia]] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in Sierra Leone. [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] \u2013 then leader of the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] \u2013 reportedly helped form the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]] under the command of former Sierra Leonean army [[corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh|Foday Saybana Sankoh]], an ethnic Temne from [[Tonkolili District]] in Northern Sierra Leone. Sankoh was a British trained former army corporal who had also undergone guerrilla training in Libya. Taylor's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of Nigerian dominated peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone who were opposed to his rebel movement in Liberia.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of young soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army, led by seven army officers \u2014 Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, Captain [[Valentine Strasser]], Sergeant [[Solomon Musa]], Captain [[Komba Mondeh]], Lieutenant [[Tom Nyuma]], Captain [[Julius Maada Bio]] and Captain Komba Kambo\u2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |title=NPRC's Komba Kambo Speaks After Eleven Years Of Silence!: Sierra Leone News |publisher=News.sl |accessdate=17 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185702/http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> launched a [[military coup]] that sent president Momoh into [[exile]] in Guinea, and the young soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country.<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://salonenow.blogspot.com/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html#!/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html |title=SIERRA LEONE NOW: Attempts To Launder Maada Bio's Battered Image Fail...

Strasser became the world's youngest Head of State when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday. The NPRC junta established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters, and was exclusively made up of the highest ranking NPRC soldiers, included Strasser himself and the original soldiers who toppled president Momoh.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/>\n\nOne of the highest ranking soldiers of the NPRC Junta, Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, a trusted ally of Strasser, was assassinated, allegedly by Major S.I.M. Turay, a key loyalist of ousted president Momoh. A heavily armed military manhunt took place across the country to find Lieutenant Sandy's killer. However, the main suspect, Major S.I.M Turay, went into hiding and fled the country to Guinea, fearing for his life. Dozens of soldiers loyal to the ousted president Momoh were arrested, including Colonel Kahota M. Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay. Lieutenant Sandy was given a [[state funeral]] and his funeral prayers service at the [[cathedral]] church in Freetown was attended by many high-ranking soldiers of the NPRC junta, including Strasser himself and NPRC deputy leader Sergeant Solomon Musa.\n\nThe NPRC Junta immediately suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, limited [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] and enacted a rule-by-decree policy, in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial, and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded.\n\nThe NPRC Junta maintained relations with the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and strengthened support for Sierra Leone-based [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] troops fighting in Liberia. On 28 December 1992, an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government of Strasser, aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu, Colonel Kahota M.S. Dumbuya and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, was foiled. Several Junior army officers led by Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot. The coup plot led to the [[firing squad]] execution of seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army including Colonel Kahota M Dumbuya, Major Yayah Kanu and Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura. Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison, including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, were also executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardtimespress.org/artman/publish/article_4699.shtml |title=Standard Times Press Sierra Leone's NPRC's Ruthlessness No Death Certificates For 29 Sierra Leoneans |publisher=Standardtimespress.org |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 July 1994 the deputy NPRC leader Sergeant Solomon Musa, who was very popular with the general population, particularly in Freetown, was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser, an accusation Sergeant Musa denied. Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Julius Maada Bio, who was instantly promoted by Strasser to [[Brigadier]].\n\nThe NPRC proved to be nearly as ineffectual as the Momoh-led APC government in repelling the RUF. More and more of the country fell to RUF fighters, and by 1994 they held much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were at the edge of Freetown. In response, the NPRC hired several hundred mercenaries from the private firm [[Executive Outcomes]]. Within a month they had driven RUF fighters back to enclaves along Sierra Leone's borders, and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of Sierra Leone.\n\nWith Strasser's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant [[Solomon Musa]] no longer around to defend him, Strasser's leadership within the NPRC Supreme Council of State was not considered much stronger. On 16 January 1996, after about four years in power, Strasser was arrested in a palace coup at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown by his fellow NPRC soldiers.<ref name=\"FSL Vol 2 No 1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |title=FSL Vol 2 No 1 |publisher=Focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928012312/http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |archive-date=28 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a [[military helicopter]] to [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]].\n\nIn his first public broadcast to the nation following the 1996 coup, Brigadier Bio stated that his support for returning Sierra Leone to a democratically elected civilian government and his commitment to ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+Sierra+Leone+fell+into+the+hands+of+young+soldiers.-a0254314002 |title=How Sierra Leone fell into the hands of young soldiers|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Promises of a return to civilian rule were fulfilled by Bio, who handed power over to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), after the conclusion of elections in early 1996. President Kabbah took power with a great promise of ending the civil war. President Kabbah opened [[dialogue]] with the RUF and invited RUF leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations.\n\nOn 25 May 1997, seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie, loyal to the detained [[Major General]] [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in Guinea and they established the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC). Corporal Gborie quickly went to the SLBS FM 99.9 headquarters in Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty. The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State.\n\nKoroma suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations, shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government, with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government. Within days, Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants who came to the city in thousands. The Kamajors, a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy [[Defence Minister]] [[Samuel Hinga Norman]], remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of Sierra Leone from the soldiers.\n\n=== Kabbah's government and the end of civil war (2002\u20132014) ===\n\n{{update|section|date=February 2013}}\n\nAfter nine months in office, the junta was overthrown by the Nigerian-led [[ECOMOG]] forces, and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998.

But in May, when nearly all [[Nigeria]]n forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern Sierra Leone, [[Foday Sankoh|Sankoh]]'s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [[hostage]] as the peace accord effectively collapsed. The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched [[Operation Khukri]] to end the siege. The Operation was successful with Indian and British [[Special Forces]] being the main contingents.\n\nThe situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]], originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals. However, the British exceeded their original mandate, and took full military action to finally defeat the rebels and restore order. The British were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war. Elements of the [[British Army]], together with administrators and politicians, remain in Sierra Leone to this day,{{when|date=October 2019}} helping train the armed forces, improve the infrastructure of the country and administer financial and material aid.

of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF), are the unified armed forces of Sierra Leone responsible for the territorial security of Sierra Leone's border and defending the national interests of Sierra Leone within the framework of its international obligations. The armed forces were formed after independence in 1961, on the basis of elements of the former British [[Royal West African Frontier Force]] present in the country. The Sierra Leone Armed Forces consists of around 15,500 personnel, comprising the largest Sierra Leone Army,<ref>[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/wafrsu/siers100.html Armed forces (Sierra Leone) Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments], June 2008</ref> the Sierra Leone Navy and the Sierra Leone Air Wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Air-Forces/Summary-Sierra-Leone.html |title=Summary (Sierra Leone) \u2013 Jane's World Air Forces |publisher=Janes.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[President of Sierra Leone]] is the [[Commander in Chief]] of the military, with the Minister of Defence responsible for defence policy and the formulation of the armed forces. The current Sierra Leonean Defence Minister is retired Major [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]]. The Military of Sierra Leone also has a [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Sierra Leone)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] who is a uniformed [[military official]] responsible for the administration and the operational control of the Sierra Leone military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200511647.shtml |title=In Sierra Leone, Army Chief of Defence Staff Commends Troops |publisher=News.sl |date=26 March 2009 |author=Turay, Aruna |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327084222/http://www.news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200511647.shtml |archivedate=27 March 2012  }}</ref> [[Brigadier General]] [[Alfred Nelson-Williams]] who was appointed by president Koroma succeeded the retired [[Major General]] [[Edward Sam M'boma]] on 12 September 2008 as the Chief of Defence Staff of the Military.<ref>New Vision, Freetown, 15 September 2008</ref>\n\nBefore Sierra Leone gained independence in 1961, the military was known as the Royal Sierra Leone Military Force. The military seized control in 1968, bringing the [[National Reformation Council]] into power. On 19 April 1971, when Sierra Leone became a republic, the Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces were renamed the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Force (RSLMF).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daco-sl.org/encyclopedia/1_gov/1_6rslaf.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070308/http://www.daco-sl.org/encyclopedia/1_gov/1_6rslaf.htm |archivedate=11 January 2010 |title=Partners: Sierra Leone Armed Forces |publisher=Daco-sl.org |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The RSLMF remained a single-service organisation until 1979, when the Sierra Leone Navy was established. In 1995 Defence Headquarters was established, and the Sierra Leone Air Wing formed. The RSLMF was renamed as the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone (AFRSL).\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\n\nLaw enforcement in Sierra Leone is primarily the responsibility of the [[Sierra Leone Police]] (SLP), which is accountable to the Minister of Internal Affairs (appointed by the president). Sierra Leone Police was established by the [[British colony]] in 1894; it is one of the oldest police forces in West Africa. It works to prevent crime, protect life and property, detect and prosecute offenders, maintain [[public order]], ensure safety and security, and enhance access to justice. The Sierra Leone Police is headed by the [[Inspector General of Police]], the professional head of the Sierra Leone Police force, who is appointed by the [[President of Sierra Leone]].\n\nEach one of [[Districts of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone's 14 districts]] is headed by a district police commissioner who is the professional head of their respective district. These Police Commissioners report directly to the Inspector General of Police at the Sierra Leone Police headquarters in [[Freetown]]. The current Inspector General of Police is [[Brima Acha Kamara]], who was appointed to the position by former president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]].\n\n=== Human rights ===\n\n{{Main|Human rights in Sierra Leone}}\n\nMale [[LGBT rights in Sierra Leone|same-sex sexual activity]] is illegal under Section 61 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], and imprisonment for life is possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611181908/http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf |archive-date=11 June 2012 |title=State Sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws criminalising same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults |publisher=The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association |editor= Lucas Paoli Itaborahy |date=May 2012 |page=35}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\n{{Main|Economy of Sierra Leone}}[[File:Sierra Leone Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Sierra Leone's exports]]\n\nBy the 1990s economic activity was declining and economic infrastructure had become seriously degraded. Over the next decade much of the formal economy was destroyed in the country's civil war. Since the end of hostilities in January 2002, massive infusions of outside assistance have helped Sierra Leone begin to recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=5f07db80-0c1e-4b66-9ebb-cfb4989d1e47@sessionmgr103|title=Economic Methodology: Paradox of Ceteris Paribus (CP) Law in the Context of...: Full Text Finder Results|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=16 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nMuch of the recovery will depend on the success of the government's efforts to limit corruption by officials, which many feel was the chief cause for the civil war. A key indicator of success will be the effectiveness of government management of its diamond sector.\n\nThere is high unemployment, particularly among the youth and ex-combatants. Authorities have been slow to implement reforms in the civil service, and the pace of the privatisation programme is also slackening and donors have urged its advancement.\n\nThe currency is the [[Sierra Leonean leone|leone]]. The [[central bank]] is the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]]. Sierra Leone operates a floating [[exchange rate]] system, and foreign currencies can be exchanged at any of the commercial banks, recognised foreign exchange [[Service bureau|bureaux]] and most hotels. Credit card use is limited in Sierra Leone, though they may be used at some hotels and restaurants. There are a few internationally linked [[automated teller machine]]s that accept [[Visa card]]s in Freetown operated by ProCredit Bank.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\n{{Further|Agriculture in Sierra Leone}}\n\n[[File:Sierra Leone rice farmer.jpg|thumb|A farmer with his rice harvest in Sierra Leone.

The country is among the top ten diamond producing nations. Mineral exports remain the main [[currency]] earner. Sierra Leone is a major producer of gem-quality diamonds. Though rich in diamonds, it has historically struggled to manage their exploitation and export.\n\nSierra Leone is known for its [[blood diamond]]s that were mined and sold to diamond conglomerates during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], to buy the weapons that fuelled its atrocities.<ref>{{cite news|title=UN targets 'blood diamonds' trade|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3117421.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|date=1 August 2003}}</ref> In the 1970s and early 1980s, economic growth rate slowed because of a decline in the mining sector and increasing corruption among government officials.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable infobox\" style=\"margin-right: 0; margin-left: 1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 115%;\" |Percentage of GDP by sector (2007)<ref name=\"AFEC\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |Sector\n! scope=\"col\" |Percentage<br/> of GDP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1\n|Agriculture\n|58.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2\n|Other services\n|10.4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |3\n|Trade and tourism\n|9.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |4\n|Wholesale and retail trade\n|9.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |5\n|Mining and quarrying\n|4.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |6\n|Government Services\n|4.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |7\n|Manufacturing and handicrafts\n|2.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |8\n|Construction\n|1.7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |9\n|Electricity and water\n|0.4\n|}\n\nAnnual production of Sierra Leone's diamond estimates range between US$250 million\u2013$300&nbsp;million. Some of that is [[Smuggling|smuggled]], where it is possibly used for [[money laundering]] or financing illicit activities. Formal exports have dramatically improved since the civil war, with efforts to improve the management of them having some success. In October 2000, a UN-approved certification system for exporting diamonds from the country was put in place and led to a dramatic increase in legal exports. In 2001, the government created a mining community development fund ([[Ministry of Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)|DACDF]]), which returns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities. The fund was created to raise local communities' stake in the legal diamond trade.\n\nSierra Leone has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]], a [[titanium]] ore used as [[paint]] pigment and [[welding]] rod coatings.\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n{{Main|Transport in Sierra Leone}}\n\n[[File:Kenema-Kailahun Road.jpg|thumb|The road from [[Kenema]] to [[Kailahun District]]]]\n\nThere are a number of systems of transport in Sierra Leone, which has a road, air and water infrastructure, including a network of highways and several airports. There are {{convert|11,300|km|abbr=off}} of highways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|904|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"CIA\"/> are paved (about 8% of the roads). Sierra Leone's highways are linked to [[Conakry]], Guinea, and [[Monrovia]], Liberia.\n\nSierra Leone has the largest [[natural harbour]] on the African continent, allowing international shipping through the [[Queen Elizabeth II Quay]] in the [[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|Cline Town]] area of eastern Freetown or through Government Wharf in central Freetown. There are {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} of waterways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=on}} are navigable year-round. Major port cities are [[Bonthe]], [[Freetown]], [[Sherbro Island]] and [[Pepel]].\n\nThere are ten [[regional airport]]s in Sierra Leone, and one [[international airport]]. The [[Lungi International Airport]] located in the coastal town of [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]] in Northern Sierra Leone is the primary airport for domestic and international travel to or from Sierra Leone. Passengers cross the river to Aberdeen [[Heliport]]s in Freetown by [[hovercraft]], ferry or a [[helicopter]]. Helicopters are also available from the airport to other major cities in the country. The airport has [[Pavement (material)|paved]] runways longer than {{convert|3,047|m|abbr=off}}. The other airports have unpaved runways, and seven have runways from {{convert|914|to|1,523|m|abbr=off}} long; the remaining two have shorter runways.\n\nSierra Leone appears on the EU list of prohibited countries with regard to the certification of airlines. This means that no airline registered in Sierra Leone may operate services of any kind within the European Union. This is due to substandard safety standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |title=List of banned E.U. air carriers |accessdate=11 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325010606/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009  }}. ec.europa.eu</ref>\n\nAs of May 2014 the country's only [[Lungi International Airport|international airport]] had regularly scheduled direct flights to London, Paris, Brussels and most major cities in West Africa.\n\nIn September 2014 there were many Districts with travel restrictions including Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Tonkolili, and Port Loko because of [[Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone|Ebola]].<ref>[http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml Sierra Leone News : Africell Presents Second Consignment of Food to all Quarantined Homes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141855/http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml |date=6 October 2014 }}.

The largest and most influential are the [[Mende people|Mende]] at about 32.2% and the [[Temne people|Temne]] at about 31.6%. The Temne predominate in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Sierra Leone]] and the [[Western Area, Sierra Leone|some areas around the capital of Sierra Leone]]. The Mende predominate in [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|South]]-Eastern Sierra Leone (with the exception of [[Kono District]]).\n\nThe vast majority of Temne are Muslims at over 85%; and with a significant Christian minority at about 10%. The Mende are also Muslim majority at about 70%, though with a large Christian minority at about 30%. Sierra Leone's national politics centres on the competition between the north-west, dominated by the Temne, and the south-east dominated by the Mende. The vast majority of the Mende support the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP); while the majority of the Temne support the [[All People's Congress]] (APC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewpeople.com/national-news/politics/item/1764-sierra-leone-the-temnes-and-the-politics-of-the-all-peoples%E2%80%99-congress-apc |title=Sierra Leone: The Temnes and the Politics of the All Peoples' Congress (APC) |publisher=Thenewpeople.com |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Mende, who are believed to be descendants of the [[Mane people|Mane]], originally occupied the Liberian hinterland. They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century. The Temne are said to migrated from [[Futa Jallon]], which is in present-day [[Guinea]].\n\nThe third-largest ethnic group are the [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] at about 8.4% of the population. The Limba are [[indigenous peoples|native]] people of Sierra Leone. They have no tradition of origin, and it is believed that they have lived in Sierra Leone since before the European encounter. The Limba are primarily found in Northern Sierra Leone, particularly in [[Bombali District|Bombali]], [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and [[Koinadugu District]]. The Limba are about 60% Christian and 40% Muslims. The Limba are close political allies of the neighbouring Temne.\n\nSince Independence, the Limba have traditionally been very influential in Sierra Leone's politics, along with the Mende. The vast majority of Limba support the All People's Congress (APC) political party. Sierra Leone's first and second presidents, [[Siaka Stevens]] and [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], respectively, were both ethnic Limba. Sierra Leone's current [[Defense Minister]] [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]] is an ethnic Limba.\n \nOne of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the [[Fula people|Fula]] at around 3.8% of the population. Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Fula migrant settlers from the [[Fouta Djalon]] region of Guinea, they live primarily in the northeast and the western area of Sierra Leone. The Fula are virtually all Muslims at over 99%. The Fula are primarily [[merchant|traders]], and many live in middle-class homes. Because of their trading, the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country.\n\nThe other ethnic groups are the [[Mandingo people of Sierra Leone|Mandingo]] (also known as [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]). They are descendants of [[Merchant|traders]] from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country. They predominate in the large towns, most notably [[Karina, Sierra Leone|Karina]], in Bombali District in the north; [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]] and [[Falaba]] in Koinadugu District in the north; and [[Yengema]], [[Kono District]] in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims at over 99\u2105. Sierra Leone's third president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], and Sierra Leone's first Vice-President [[Sorie Ibrahim Koroma]] were both ethnic Mandingo.\n\nNext in proportion are the [[Kono people|Kono]], who live primarily in [[Kono District]] in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners. The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians, though with an influential Muslim minority. Sierra Leone's former Vice-President [[Samuel Sam-Sumana|Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana]] is an ethnic Kono.\n\nThe small but significant [[Krio people]] (descendants of freed African American, [[West Indian]] and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885) make up about 3% of the population. They primarily occupy the capital city of [[Freetown]] and its surrounding [[Western Area]]. Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated \u2013 they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development.\n\nThe Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone's judiciary and Freetown's elected city council. One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions, they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service, beginning during the colonial years. They continue to be influential in the civil service. The vast majority of Krios are Christians at about 90%, though with a small but significant Muslim minority at 10% known locally as Oku.\n\nOther minority ethnic groups are the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko]], who are related to the Mandingo, and are largely Muslims. The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north, particularly in [[Koinadugu District]]. The Kuranko are primarily farmers; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military. The current Governor of the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]] [[Kaifala Marah]] is an ethnic Kuranko. The Kuranko are largely Muslim majority.\n\nThe [[Loko people|Loko]] in the north are native people of Sierra Leone, believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter. Like the neighbouring Temne, the Loko are Muslim majority. The [[Susu people|Susu]] and their related [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]] The Susu and their related Yalunka are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in Kambia and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka kingdom was established in the early 5th 7th century before Mali empire, which was extended from Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Conakry to the northern part of Sierra Leone. They are the original owners of the Futa Djallon region covered by a vars land area both the Susu and Yalunka people are descendants of the Mande people. They are virtually all Muslims. The Yalunka, also spelled Jallonke, Yalonga, Djallonk\u00e9, Djallonka or Dialonk\u00e9, are a Mande people who have lived in the Djallon, a mountainous region in Sierra Leone, Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau and Guinea Conakry West Africa over 520 years ago. The name Yalunka literally means \"inhabitants of the Jallon (mountains).\" Manga Sewa was born in Falaba, Solima chiefdom, in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone to Yalunka parents. His father was a Yalunka paramount chief of Solima, a prosperous chieftaincy. Its capital, Falaba, was on the rich trading routes leading to the coast. Manga Sewa's father had a number of wives and dozens of children.are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka are both descendants of migrants from Guinea; and they both are virtually all Muslims at over 99%.\n\nThe [[Kissi people|Kissi]] live further inland in South-Eastern Sierra Leone. They predominate in the large town of [[Koindu]] and its surrounding areas in Kailahun District. The vast majority of Kissi are Christians. The much smaller [[Vai people|Vai]] and [[Kru people|Kru]] peoples are primarily found in [[Kailahun District|Kailahun]] and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia. The Kru predominate in the Kroubay neighbourhood in the capital Freetown. The Vai are largely Muslim majority at about 90%, while the Kru are virtually all Christians at over 99%.\n\nOn the coast in [[Bonthe District]] in the south are the [[Sherbro people|Sherbro]]. Native to Sierra Leone, they have occupied [[Sherbro Island]] since it was founded. The Sherbro are primarily [[fisherman]] and [[farmers]], and they are predominantly found in Bonthe District. The Sherbro are virtually all Christians, and their paramount chiefs had a history of intermarriage with British colonists and traders.\n\nA small number of Sierra Leoneans are of partial or full [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] ancestry, descendants of traders who first came to the nation in the 19th century. They are locally known as Sierra Leonean-Lebanese. The Sierra Leonean-Lebanese community are primarily traders and they mostly live in middle-class households in the urban areas, primarily in [[Freetown]], [[Bo, Sierra Leone|Bo]], [[Kenema]], [[Koidu|Koidu Town]] and [[Makeni]].\n\n== Gender equality ==\n\n=== Household ===\n\nAlthough women account for about 50 percent of the population in Sierra Leone, only 28 percent are household heads.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_gender.pdf|title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census Thematic Report on Gender |last=Fatou Taqi |author2=Marian Vinnie-Wilson |author3=Alimatu Vandi |first=Fatou, Marian, Alimatu|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref> As in the rest of the countries, education is a key factor in succeeding in aspects such as a well-paid job and covering the needs of a house. Rural areas are the most common to lack access to education having only male-headed four percent ahead of females with basic education and 1.2 percent more at post-graduate level.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nIn Sierra Leone, normally, men are automatically positioned as household heads; and their status does not change if their marital status changes over time.<ref name=\":03\" /> However, female household does change depending on their marital status. A woman can be the head of the house only if she remains single for the rest of her life. But if a woman gets married, she will not be entitled as the head of the house anymore.<ref name=\":03\" /> Females can take over the household head if they become widowed or divorced.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nIn the labour field, it is expected that the household will financially provide the needs of the family. However, females face gender discrimination making them the target of lower incomes and financial struggle.<ref name=\":03\" /> In numbers, females present a lower per cent (6.3) versus males (15.2) when it comes to be paid employees.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n=== War ===\n\nChildren who have been forced to be part of a war have experienced severe mental and emotional damage in Sierra Leone. However, the damage and way to deal with the effects of war depends on the gender of the kids. Both genders experienced and were involved in high levels of violence. Females, experiencing higher levels of rapes, presented greater signs of depression and anxiety.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|date=2011-07-01|title=Sierra Leone's Child Soldiers: War Exposures and Mental Health Problems by Gender|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=49|issue=1|pages=21\u201328|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.09.021|pmid=21700152|pmc=3124662|issn=1054-139X|last1=Betancourt|first1=Theresa S.|last2=Borisova|first2=Ivelina I.|last3=de la Soudi\u00e8re|first3=Marie|last4=Williamson|first4=John}}</ref> Males, on the other hand, presented higher levels of anxiety and hostility.<ref name=\":12\" /> Males also showed to be more vulnerable to depression after losing a care giver.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Epidemics (Ebola) ===\n\nWith women being more than half the population of Sierra Leone, they contribute in great part to the country's economy and society.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/14/ebola-women-sierra-leone|title=We can no longer ignore Ebola's wider impact \u2013 particularly on women {{!}} Jeanne Kamara|last=Freetown|first=Jeanne Kamara in|date=2014-10-14|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> Sierra Leonean women in care-giving positions were particularly susceptible to the disease because of the potential close contact with infected individuals.

Only 20% of the urban population and 1% of the rural population had access to piped drinking water in their home.

A strong free journalistic tradition developed with the creation of a number of newspapers. In the 1860s, the country became a journalist hub for Africa, with professionals travelling to the country from across the continent. At the end of the 19th century, the industry went into decline, and when radio was introduced in the 1930s, it became the primary communication media in the country.\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service]] (SLBS) was created by the colonial government in 1934 making it the earliest English language radio broadcaster service in West Africa. The service began broadcasting television in 1963, with coverage extended to all the districts in the country in 1978. In April 2010, the SLBS merged with the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping radio station in Sierra Leone to form the [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icfj.org/node/37444 |title=At Long Last, Recruitment Begins at Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation &#124; ICFJ \u2013 International Center for Journalists |publisher=ICFJ |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194354/http://www.icfj.org/node/37444 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slbc.sl/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SLBC-REPORT-Final-Copy.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811043953/http://www.slbc.sl/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SLBC-REPORT-Final-Copy.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) Maiden Report 2010-2011}}</ref> the government-owned current national broadcaster in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sierra Leone constitution guarantees [[freedom of speech]], and [[freedom of the press]]; however, the government maintains strong control of media, and at times restricts these rights in practice.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation |url=http://www.trust.org/item/20131024140514-sg47u/ |title=Sierra Leone \u2013 Editorial criticizing president prompts multiple proceedings |publisher=Trust.org |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/sierra-leone-editors-arrested-after-publishing-article-comparing-president-to-a-rat/2013/10/21/168d8172-3a53-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20131025175049/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/sierra-leone-editors-arrested-after-publishing-article-comparing-president-to-a-rat/2013/10/21/168d8172-3a53-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 October 2013 | title=Sierra Leone editors arrested after publishing article comparing pres\u2026| date=25 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|last=Greenslade |first=Roy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/oct/25/press-freedom-sierraleone |title=Editor arrested for comparing Sierra Leone president to a rat &#124; Media |journal=The Guardian |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/21/sierra-leone-editors-arrested-after-publishing-article-comparing-president-to/ |title=Sierra Leone editors arrested after publishing article comparing president to a rat |publisher=Fox News |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africareview.com/News/Sierra-Leone-intensifies-media-crackdown/-/979180/2043834/-/u0oloaz/-/index.html |title=Sierra Leone intensifies media crackdown \u2013 News |publisher=africareview.com |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201310250762.html |title=Sierra Leone: In Sierra Leone, Journalists Held On Libel, Sedition Charges |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> Some subjects are seen as taboo by society and members of the political elite; imprisonment and violence have been used by the political establishment against journalists.<ref>{{cite web\n |last =Wilson\n |first =Harry\n |year =2005\n |title =Press Freedoms and Human Rights:2005 Year End Press Freedom Brief\n |publisher =Commonwealth Press Union\n |url =http://www.cpu.org.uk/pf_2005_review.html\n |accessdate =20 April 2008\n |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071124131843/http://www.cpu.org.uk/pf_2005_review.html\n |archivedate =24 November 2007\n |url-status =dead\n |df =dmy-all\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Annual06\"/>\n\nUnder legislation enacted in 1980, all newspapers must register with the Ministry of Information and pay sizeable registration fees.

Stations mainly consist of local commercial stations with a limited broadcast range, combined with a few stations with national coverage \u2013 [[Capital Radio Sierra Leone]] being the largest of the commercial stations.\n\nThe United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) ran one of the most popular stations in the country, broadcasting programs in a range of languages. The UN mission were restructured in 2008 and it was decided that the UN Radio would be merged with SLBS to form the new Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). This merger eventually happened in 2011 after the necessary legislation was enacted. SLBC transmits radio on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and has two television services, one of which is uplinked by satellite for international consumption. FM relays of [[BBC World Service]] (in Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni), [[Radio France Internationale]] (Freetown only) and [[Voice of America]] (Freetown only) are also broadcast.\n\nOutside the capital Freetown and other major cities, television is not watched by a great many people, although Bo, Kenema and Makeni are served by their own relays of the main SLBC service. There are three free terrestrial television stations in Sierra Leone, one run by the government SLBC and the other two are private stations in Freetown, Star TV which is run by the owner of the ''Standard Times'' newspaper and AYV - Africa Young Voices. There are a number of religious funded TV stations that operate intermittently. Two other commercial TV operators (ABC and AIT) closed after they were not profitable. In 2007, a pay-per-view service was also introduced by GTV as part of a pan-African television service in addition to the nine-year-old sub-Saharan Digital satellite television service (DStv) originating from Multichoice Africa in South Africa. GTV subsequently went out of business, leaving DStv as the only provider of subscription satellite television in the country. A number of organisations planned to operate digital terrestrial subscription TV services, with Multichoice's Go TV having built infrastructure ahead of getting a licence and ultimately failing to get a license. ITV and SATCON are currently operational.\n\nInternet access in Sierra Leone has been sparse but is on the increase, especially since the introduction of 3G/4G cellular phone services across the country. There are several main [[internet service providers]] (ISPs) operating in the country. Freetown has [[internet caf\u00e9s]] and other businesses offering internet access. Problems experienced with access to the Internet include an intermittent electricity supply and a slow connection speed in the country outside Freetown.\n\n=== Arts ===\n\n{{Further|Art in Sierra Leone|Music of Sierra Leone}}\n\nThe arts in Sierra Leone are a mixture of tradition and hybrid African and western styles.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Banham|first = Martin |title = A history of theatre in Africa|publisher =Cambridge University Press |year =2004|page = 171|url =https://books.google.com/?id=RZXtk9bCZ-8C&pg=PA171|isbn=978-0-521-80813-2|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Conteh |first = Prince Sorie |title = Traditionalists, Muslims, and Christians in Africa: interreligious encounters and dialogue|publisher =Cambria Press |year =2009|pages = 23\u201324|url =https://books.google.com/?id=HpAuyiMRTDcC&pg=PA23|isbn=978-1-60497-596-3|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Manson |first =Katrina |first2=James |last2=Knight |title = Sierra Leone|publisher = Bradt Travel Guides|year =2009|pages = 42\u201345|url =https://books.google.com/?id=VxRcEzkFs-wC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-1-84162-222-4|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Temne.

Children, youth and adult are frequently seen playing [[street football]] across Sierra Leone. There are organised youth and adult football tournaments across the country, and there are various primary and secondary schools with football teams across Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sierra Leone national football team, popularly known as the [[Leone Stars]], represents the country in international competitions. It has never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] but participated in the [[1994 African Cup of Nations|1994]] and [[1996 African Cup of Nations]]. When the national football team, the Leone Stars, have a match, Sierra Leoneans across the country come together united in support of the national team and people rush to their local radio and television stations to follow the live match. The country's national television network, The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) broadcasts the national football team live match, along with many local radio stations across the country.\n\nWhen the Leone Stars win an important match, many youth across the county rush to the street to celebrate. Many of the Sierra Leone national team footballers play for teams based in Europe although virtually all of them started professional football in the [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]]. Many of the national team footballers are celebrities across Sierra Leone and they are often well known by the general population. Some of Sierra Leonean international footballers include [[Mohamed Kallon]], [[Mohamed Bangura (footballer)|Mohamed Bangura]], [[Rodney Strasser]], [[Kei Kamara]], [[Ibrahim Teteh Bangura]], [[Mustapha Dumbuya]], [[Christian Caulker]], [[Al Bangura|Alhassan Bangura]], [[Sheriff Suma]], [[Mohamed Kamara]], [[Umaru Bangura]] and [[Julius Wobay|Julius Gibrilla Woobay]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]] is the top professional football league in Sierra Leone and is controlled by the [[Sierra Leone Football Association]]. Fourteen clubs from across the country compete in the Sierra Leone Premier League. The two biggest and most successful football clubs are [[East End Lions]] and [[Mighty Blackpool]]. East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool have an intense rivalry and when they play each other the national stadium in Freetown is often sold out and supporters of both clubs often clash with each other before and after the game. There is a huge police presence inside and outside the national stadium during a match between the two great rivals to prevent a clash. Many Sierra Leonean youth follow the local football league.\n\nMany Sierra Leonean youth, children and adults follow the major football leagues in Europe, particularly the English [[Premier League]], Italian [[Serie A]], Spanish [[La Liga]], German [[Bundesliga]] and French [[Ligue 1]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone cricket team]] represents Sierra Leone in international cricket competitions, and is among the best in West Africa. It became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] in 2002. It made its international debut at the 2004 African Affiliates Championship, where it finished last of eight teams. But at the equivalent tournament in 2006, Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League, it finished as runner-up to [[Mozambique]], and just missed a promotion to Division Two.\n\nIn 2009, the Sierra Leone Under-19 team finished second in the African Under-19 Championship in Zambia, thus qualifying for the Under-19 World Cup qualifying tournament with nine other teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/403002.html |title=Cricinfo article Uganda and Sierra Leone Win Through |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> However, the team was unable to obtain Canadian visas to play in the tournament, which was held in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/423890.html |title=Visa Issues End Sierra Leone's World Cup Dream |publisher=Cricinfo article |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBasketball is not a very popular sport in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone national basketball team represents Sierra Leone in international men's basketball competitions and is controlled by the Sierra Leone Basketball Federation.\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is popular among a small portion of the youth population. NBA superstars [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Kevin Durant]] are popular among Sierra Leone's youthful population. Former NBA stars, in particular [[Michael Jordan]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Magic Johnson]] are popular in the country. Michael Jordan in particular is the most famous basketball player in the country and he is very popular among the general population.

The nation achieved independence from Britain on 27 April 1961, and [[Milton Margai]] became the first Prime Minister. Margai's political party was the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP), under the leadership of [[Albert Margai]], and it narrowly lost the 1967 Sierra Leone parliamentary elections to the main opposition party of the [[All People's Congress]] (APC) led by [[Siaka Stevens]]. \n\nStevens was a political strongman who ruled Sierra Leone from 1967 to 1985 when he retired from politics due to poor health. On 19 April 1971, Stevens' government abolished Sierra Leone's parliamentary system and declared Sierra Leone a presidential republic. From 1978 to 1985, president Stevens\" APC party was the only legal political party in Sierra Leone. The multiparty democratic [[constitution of Sierra Leone]] was adopted in 1991 by the government of President [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], Stevens' hand-picked successor, just as the rebel group [[Revolutionary United Front]] led by [[Foday Sankoh]] launched a brutal civil war in the country.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of Junior soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Captain [[Valentine Strasser]] overthrew President Momoh, and Sierra Leone was under Military rule from 1992 to 1996 during the civil war. The country returned to a democratically elected government when the military Junta under Brigadier General [[Julius Maada Bio]] handed the presidency to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] of the SLPP after his victory in the 1996 election. However, the Sierra Leone military overthrew President Kabbah in a coup on 25 May 1997, and Major General [[Johnny Paul Koroma]] became the country's head of state. A coalition of West African [[Ecowas]] armed forces led by [[Nigeria]] then reinstated President Kabbah by military force in February 1998, and the leaders of the coup were executed after they were sentenced to death by a Sierra Leone military court. In January 2002, President Kabbah announced the end of the civil war with the help of Ecowas, the British government, the African Union, and the United Nations. Sierra Leone has had an uninterrupted democratic government from 1998 to present.\n\nSixteen ethnic groups inhabit Sierra Leone, each with its own language and customs. The two largest and most influential are the [[Temne people|Temne]] and [[Mende people]]. The Temne are predominantly found in the northwest and the Mende in the southeast. About two percent of the population are the [[Krio people]], who are descendants of freed American and West Indian slaves. English is the official language used in schools and government administration, but [[Krio language|Krio]] is the most widely spoken language, an [[English-based creole]] used by 98 percent of the population. Krio unites all the ethnic groups in the country, especially in their trade and social interaction.\n\nSierra Leone is 77 percent Muslim, with an influential Christian minority of 22 percent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census |url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_pop_structure_and_pop_distribution.pdf |website=Statistics Sierra Leone}}</ref> The country is regarded as one of the most religiously tolerant countries in the world.

It is also among the largest producers of [[titanium]] and [[bauxite]] and a major producer of gold, and it has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]].

Originally named ''Serra Leoa'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"Lioness Mountains\") by Portuguese explorer [[Pedro de Sintra]] in 1462, the modern name is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] spelling, which was introduced by [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and subsequently copied by other European [[cartography|mapmakers]].<ref>https://reignministries.org/5-things-know-sierra-leone/ 5 Thing to Know About Sierra Leone</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Sierra Leone}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n\n[[File:Prehistoric pottery shards, Sierra Leone.jpg|thumb|Fragments of [[prehistoric]] [[pottery]] from [[Kamabai]] Rock Shelter]]\n\n[[File:Bunce Island 1805.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bunce Island]], 1805, during the period the slave factory was run by [[Sir John Anderson, 1st Baronet, of Mill Hill|John]] and [[Alexander Anderson (slave trader)|Alexander Anderson]]]]\n\n[[File:slaves sierra leone.jpg|thumb|An 1835 illustration of liberated Africans arriving in Sierra Leone]]\n\n[[File:Freetown, Sierra Leone ca 1856.jpg|thumb|The colony of Freetown in 1856]]\n\n[[File:Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p.55) - Copy.jpg|thumb|Houses at Sierra-Leone (May 1853, X, p.55)<ref name=\"Juvenile1853\">{{cite journal|title=Houses at Sierra-Leone|journal=The Wesleyan Juvenile Offering: A Miscellany of Missionary Information for Young Persons|date=May 1853|volume=X|page=55|url=https://archive.org/details/wesleyanjuvenil19socigoog|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nArchaeological finds show that Sierra Leone has been inhabited continuously for at least 2,500 years,<ref name=\"Culture of Sierra Leone\">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Sa-Th/Sierra-Leone.html|title=Culture of Sierra Leone|author=Countries and Their Cultures|accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref> populated successively by societies who migrated from other parts of Africa.<ref name=\"Sierra Leone History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-55344/Sierra-Leone|title=Sierra Leone History|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The people adopted the use of iron by the 9th century and by 1000 AD agriculture was being practised along the coast.<ref name=\"Sierra Leone - History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Sierra-Leone-HISTORY.html|title=Sierra Leone \u2013 History|author=Encyclopedia of the Nations|accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref> The climate changed considerably and boundaries among different ecological zones changed as well, affecting migration and conquest.<ref name=\"brooks\"/>\n\nSierra Leone's dense tropical rainforest and swampy environment was considered impenetrable; it was also host to the [[tsetse fly]], which carried a disease fatal to horses and the [[zebu]] cattle used by the [[Mande people]].

In 1462, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Pedro de Sintra]] mapped the hills surrounding what is now Freetown Harbour, naming the shaped formation ''Serra da Leoa'' or \"Serra Leoa\" ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Lioness Mountains]]).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Kingfisher Geography encyclopedia''. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}. p. 180</ref> The Spanish rendering of this geographic formation is ''Sierra Leona'', which later was adapted and, misspelled, became the country's current name.

The official documentation known as the [[Book of Negroes]] lists thousands of freed slaves whom the British evacuated from the nascent United States and resettled in colonies elsewhere in [[British North America]] (north to Canada, or south to the West Indies).\n\nIn 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in Sierra Leone in what was called the \"[[Province of Freedom]]\". It intended to resettle some of the \"[[Black Poor]] of London\", some of whom were African-Americans freed by the British during the war. About 400 blacks and 60 whites reached Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787. The group also included some [[West Indies|West Indians]] of African descent from London. After they established [[Granville Town]], most of the first group of colonists died, owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ([[Temne people|Temne]]), who resisted their encroachment. The 64&nbsp;remaining colonists established a second Granville Town.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Pham |first = John-Peter |title = Child Soldiers, Adult Interests: The Global Dimensions of the Sierra Leonean Tragedy |publisher = Nova Publishers |year = 2005 |pages = 4\u20138 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZnPFKpwoIkIC&pg=PA4 |isbn = 978-1-59454-671-6 |accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>Michael Sivapragasam, ''Why Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783\u20131815?''

They founded [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination from nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]. [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]] pressed British authorities for relief and more aid; together with British abolitionist [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]], the [[Sierra Leone Company]] was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa. In 1792 nearly 1200&nbsp;persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second (and only permanent) Colony of Sierra Leone and the settlement of [[Freetown]] on 11 March 1792. In Sierra Leone they were called the [[Nova Scotian Settlers]], the ''Nova Scotians'', or the ''Settlers''.\n\nThe Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the [[American South]]; they also continued American fashion and American manners. In addition, many continued to practice [[Methodism]] in Freetown. Black settlers in Sierra Leone enjoyed much more autonomy in that they were more politically engaged. Black immigrants elected different levels of political representatives, 'tithingmen', who represented each dozen settlers, and 'hundreders' who represented larger amounts. This sort of representation was not available in Nova Scotia.<ref>Gilbert, Alan. ''Black Patriots and Loyalists: Fighting for Emancipation in the War for Independence''. University of Chicago 2012, p. 229</ref> The initial process of society-building in Freetown, however, was a harsh struggle.

In 1799 some of the settlers revolted. The Crown subdued the revolt by bringing in forces of more than 500&nbsp;[[Jamaican Maroons]], whom they transported from [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]] via Nova Scotia in 1800. Led by Colonel Montague James, the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt, and in the process they secured the best houses and farms.<ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: 2005), pp. 380\u2013383.</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1808, [[Thomas Ludlam (colonialist)|Thomas Ludlam]], the Governor of the Sierra Leone Company and a leading abolitionist, surrendered the Company's charter.

Its members represented both British who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company, which held the (British) monopoly on Sierra Leone trade.<ref>Harris, Sheldon H.

These Liberated Africans or ''[[recaptives]]'' were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the Jamaican Maroons.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some of the recaptives who were not sold as apprentices were forced to join the Navy. Many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. For example, some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more Western sounding one. Though some people happily embraced these changes because they considered it as being part of the community, some were not happy with these changes and wanted to keep their own identity. Many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving Sierra Leone and going back to their original villages.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schwarz|first=Suzanne|date=5 January 2013|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Enslaved Africans: Sierra Leone, c. 1808\u201319|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267884583}}</ref> They built a flourishing trade in flowers and beads on the West African coast.\n\nThese returned Africans were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. During the 19th century, freed black Americans, some [[Americo Liberian]] 'refugees', and particularly West Indians, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples created a new creole ethnicity called the [[Krio people]] (initially called Creoles) and a trading language, [[Krio language|Krio]], which became commonly used among many of the ethnicities in the country.\n\n=== Colonial era (1800\u20131961) ===\n\n{{Main|Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate}}\n\nThe settlement of Sierra Leone in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans who were brought to the colony after the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807. Upon arrival in Sierra Leone, each \"recaptive\" was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities would be entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. However, oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track. In addition, differences between the Register of Liberated Africans of 1808 and the List of Captured Negroes of 1812 (which emulated the 1808 document) revealed some disparities in the entries of the recaptives, specifically in the names; many recaptives decided to change their given names to more [[anglicised]] versions which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in Sierra Leone.\n\nAccording to the British Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the recaptives could be subject to apprenticeships led by British colonists in Sierra Leone and the males enlisted into the Army or Navy. In many instances, the recaptives who were assigned to apprenticeships were sold for $20, giving the apprenticeship system qualities similar to slavery.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Suzanne|date=2012|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Liberated Africans: Sierra Leone in the Early Nineteenth Century|url=|journal=History in Africa|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> It is documented that the recaptive apprentices were unpaid and the settlers who they were appointed to had devices which could be used to discipline them, namely sticks. According to Suzanne Schwartz, a historian on colonial Sierra Leone, in June 1808 a group of 21 men and women ran away to the nearby native settlement of Robiss and upon recapture were imprisoned by the settlers in Sierra Leone, thus contributing to the slavery-like qualities of the apprenticeship system.<ref name=\"Schwartz 2012\"/> [[File:Bai Bureh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bai Bureh]], Temne leader of the [[Hut Tax War of 1898]] against British rule]]\n\nIn the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region, who also administered the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]) and the [[Gambia]] settlements. Sierra Leone developed as the educational centre of British West Africa. The British established [[Fourah Bay College]] here in 1827, which rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].\n\n[[File:Bai Bureh (1898).jpg|thumb|Temne leader Bai Bureh seen here in 1898 after his surrender, sitting relaxed in his traditional dress with a handkerchief in his hands, while a Sierra Leonean [[Royal West African Frontier Force|Royal West African Frontier]] soldier stands guard next to him ]]\n\nThe British interacted mostly with the Krios in Freetown, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. In addition, educated Krios held numerous positions in the colonial government, giving them status and good-paying positions. Following the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885, the UK decided that it needed to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what was described by the European powers as \"effective occupation\" of territories. In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the Sierra Leone Protectorate.<ref name=\"harris40\">Harris, David (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5RxmwC6aNwC&pg=PA1 ''Civil War and Democracy in West Africa: Conflict Resolution, Elections and Justice in Sierra Leone and Liberia''], I.B. Tauris. p. 40</ref> With this change, the British began to expand their administration in the region, recruiting British citizens to posts, and pushing Krios out of positions in government and even the desirable residential areas in Freetown.<ref name=\"harris40\"/>\n\nIn addition, the British annexation of the Protectorate interfered with the sovereignty of indigenous chiefs. They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually as had been previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longtime allies, such as [[Bai Bureh]], chief of Kasseh, a community on the Small Scarcies River. He was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the Hut Tax war in 1898.<ref name=\"abraham\">{{cite journal\n  |title = Bai Bureh, The British, and the Hut Tax War\n  |last = Abraham\n  |first = Arthur\n  |journal = [[The International Journal of African Historical Studies]]\n  |issn = 0361-7882\n  |volume = 7\n  |issue = 1\n  |year = 1974\n  |pages = 99\u2013106\n  |doi = 10.2307/216556\n  |jstor = 216556\n  }}</ref>\n\nColonel Frederic Cardew, military governor of the Protectorate, in 1898 established a new tax on dwellings and demanded that the chiefs use their peoples to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew, stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes. Tensions over the new colonial requirements, and the administration's suspicions about the chiefs led to the [[Hut Tax War of 1898|Hut Tax war of 1898]], also called the Temne-Mende War. The British fired first. The Northern front of majority Temne people was led by [[Bai Bureh]]. The Southern front, consisting mostly of [[Mende people]], entered conflict somewhat later and for different reasons.\n\nFor several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces, but the British troops and Bureh's warriors suffered hundreds of fatalities.<ref>[http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html History], Sierra-leone.org, Retrieved 17 January 2007.</ref> Bai Bureh finally surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings.

The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country.\n\nIn 1924, the UK government divided Sierra Leone into a Colony and a Protectorate, with different political systems constitutionally defined for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the hinterland areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most of the proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered that in the colony. The Krios, led by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson|Isaac Wallace-Johnson]], opposed the proposals, as they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the Krios in the Colony.\n\nIn 1951, educated protectorate leaders from different groups, including [[Sir]] [[Milton Margai]], [[Lamina Sankoh]], [[Siaka Stevens]], Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha, [[John Karefa-Smart]], Kande Bureh, Sir [[Albert Margai]], [[Amadu Wurie]] and Sir [[Banja Tejan-Sie]] joined together with the powerful [[paramount chiefs]] in the protectorate to form the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] or SLPP as the party of the protectorate.

Karefa-Smart led a prominent small minority faction within the SLPP party in opposition of Albert Margai as Prime Minister. However, Kareefa-Smart failed to receive strong support within the SLPP and the SLPP dominated members of parliament in his attempt to have Albert Margai stripped of his position as the leader of the SLPP and prime minister of the country. The large majority of SLPP members backed Albert Margai over Kareefa-Smart. Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as Prime Minister, he dismissed several senior government officials who had served under his elder brother Milton's government, viewing them as a threat to his administration, including Kareefa-Smart.\n\nSir Albert resorted to increasingly [[authoritarian]] actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), whilst attempting to establish a [[one-party state]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Sir Albert was opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs, many of whom had been key allies of his late brother Sir Milton.

Stevens had campaigned on a platform of bringing the tribes together under [[socialist]] principles. During his first decade or so in power, Stevens renegotiated some of what he called \"useless prefinanced schemes\" contracted by his predecessors, both Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC. Some of these policies by the SLPP and the NRC were said to have left the country in an economically deprived state.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nStevens reorganised the country's oil refinery, the government-owned Cape Sierra Hotel, and a cement factory.<ref>David Harris. Sierra Leone: A Political History., pp. 67-70 New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. {{ISBN|9780199361762}}. $30.00</ref> He cancelled Juxon-Smith's construction of a church and mosque on the grounds of Victoria Park (since mid 2017 ''Freetown Amusement Park''). Stevens began efforts that would later bridge the distance between the provinces and the city. Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces, and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown.\n\nUnder pressure of several coup attempts, real or perceived, Stevens' rule grew more and more [[authoritarian]], and his relationship with some of his ardent supporters deteriorated. He removed the SLPP party from competitive politics in general elections, some believed, through the use of violence and intimidation. To maintain the support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as the head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces.\n\nAfter the return to civilian rule, by-elections were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. Calm was not completely restored. In November 1968, unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country. Many senior officers in the Sierra Leone Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens' policies and his handling of the Sierra Leone Military, but none could confront Stevens. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister, was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens. The army was devoted to Bangura, and this made him potentially dangerous to Stevens. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. After a trial that lasted a few months, Bangura was [[convicted]] and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. On 29 March 1970, Brigadier Bangura was executed by hanging in Freetown.\n\nAfter the execution of Bangura, a group of soldiers loyal to the executed Brigadier Bangura held a [[mutiny]] in the capital Freetown and in some other parts of the country in opposition of Stevens' government. Dozens of soldiers were arrested and [[convicted]] by a [[court martial]] in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny against president Stevens. Among the soldiers arrested was a little known army [[Corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh]], a strong supporter of Bangura. Corporal Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown.\n\nIn April 1971, a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president. In the 1972 by-elections the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.<ref>{{Cite book |last =Rotberg |first =Robert I. |title =State failure and state weakness in a time of terror |publisher = Brookings Institution Press|year =2003 |page = 80 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=oajfCpTpgCIC&pg=PA80|isbn = 978-0-8157-7574-4|accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nAn alleged plot to overthrow president Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed. In mid 1974, Guinean soldiers, requested by Stevens, were in the country to help maintain his hold on power as Stevens was a close ally of then Guinean president [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]]. In March 1976, Stevens was elected without opposition for a second five-year term as president. On 19 July 1975, 14 senior army and government officials including David Lansana, former cabinet minister Mohamed Sorie Forna (father of writer [[Aminatta Forna]]), Brigadier General Ibrahim Bash Taqi and Lieutenant Habib Lansana Kamara were executed after being convicted of allegedly attempting a coup to topple president Stevens' government.\n\nIn 1977, a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted Sierra Leone politics. The demonstration was quickly put down by the army and Stevens' own personal Special Security Division (SSD) force, a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and to maintain his hold on power.<ref>[http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 Politicized security forces or tribalized national politics; which is which?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901024455/http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 |date=1 September 2012 }}.

[[Sierra Leonean parliamentary election, 1977|A general election]] was called later that year in which corruption was again endemic; the APC won 74 seats and the SLPP 15. In 1978, the APC-dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a [[one-party state]]. The 1978 constitution made the APC the only legal political party in Sierra Leone.<ref name=Gberie>Gberie, Lansana (1998). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/30/ War and state collapse: The case of Sierra Leone]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University</ref> This move led to another major demonstration against the government in many parts of the country, but again it was put down by the army and Stevens' SSD forces.\n\nStevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption, but on a positive note, he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war. He built several government institutions that are still in use today.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Stevens also reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government.\n\nSiaka Stevens retired from politics in November 1985 after being in power for eighteen years. The APC named a new presidential candidate to succeed Stevens at their last delegate conference held in Freetown in November 1985. He was [[Major General]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], the head of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and Stevens' own choice to succeed him. As head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, Major General Momoh was very loyal to Stevens, who had appointed him to the position. Like Stevens, Momoh was also a member of the minority [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] ethnic group.\n\nMomoh was elected president as the only contesting candidate, without any opposition, and was sworn in as Sierra Leone's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown. A one-party parliamentary election between APC members was held in May 1986. President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally, Major General Mohamed Tarawalie to succeed him as the head of the Sierra Leone Military. Major General Tarawalie was also a strong loyalist and key supporter of president Momoh. President Momoh named James Bambay Kamara as the head of the [[Sierra Leone Police]]. Bambay Kamara was a key loyalist and strong supporter of President Momoh. Momoh broke away from former president Siaka Stevens, by integrating the powerful SSD into the Sierra Leone Police as a special [[paramilitary force]] of the Sierra Leone Police. Under President Stevens, the SSD had been a powerful personal force used to maintain his hold on power, independent from the Sierra Leone Military and Sierra Leone Police Force. The Sierra Leone Police under Bambay Kamara's leadership, was accused of physical violence, arrest and intimidation against critics of President Momoh's government.\n\nPresident Momoh's strong links with the army and his verbal attacks on corruption earned him much-needed initial support among Sierra Leoneans. With the lack of new faces in the new APC cabinet under president Momoh and the return of many of the old faces from Stevens' government, criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens.\n\nThe next couple of years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption, which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers. To formalise his war against corruption, President Momoh announced a \"[[Code of Conduct]] for Political Leaders and Public Servants.\" After an alleged attempt to overthrow President Momoh in March 1987, more than 60 senior government officials were arrested, including Vice President [[Francis Minah]], who was removed from office, convicted of plotting the coup, and executed by [[hanging]] in 1989 along with 5 others.\n\n=== Sierra Leone Civil War (1991\u20132002) ===\n\n{{Further|Sierra Leone Civil War}}\n\n[[File:School destroyed by Sierra Leone Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A school in [[Koindu]] destroyed during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Civil War]]; in total 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.<ref name=\"ilab\"/>]]\n\nIn October 1990, owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reform, president Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution. Based on the commission's recommendations a constitution re-establishing a multi-party system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60% majority vote, becoming effective on 1 October 1991. There was great suspicion that president Momoh was not serious about his promise of political reform, as APC rule continued to be increasingly marked by abuses of power.\n\nThe brutal civil war that was going on in neighbouring [[Liberia]] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in Sierra Leone. [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] \u2013 then leader of the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] \u2013 reportedly helped form the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]] under the command of former Sierra Leonean army [[corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh|Foday Saybana Sankoh]], an ethnic Temne from [[Tonkolili District]] in Northern Sierra Leone. Sankoh was a British trained former army corporal who had also undergone guerrilla training in Libya. Taylor's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of Nigerian dominated peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone who were opposed to his rebel movement in Liberia.\n\nOn 29 April 1992, a group of young soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army, led by seven army officers \u2014 Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, Captain [[Valentine Strasser]], Sergeant [[Solomon Musa]], Captain [[Komba Mondeh]], Lieutenant [[Tom Nyuma]], Captain [[Julius Maada Bio]] and Captain Komba Kambo\u2014<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |title=NPRC's Komba Kambo Speaks After Eleven Years Of Silence!: Sierra Leone News |publisher=News.sl |accessdate=17 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185702/http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> launched a [[military coup]] that sent president Momoh into [[exile]] in Guinea, and the young soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country.<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|url=http://salonenow.blogspot.com/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html#!/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html |title=SIERRA LEONE NOW: Attempts To Launder Maada Bio's Battered Image Fail...

Strasser became the world's youngest Head of State when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday. The NPRC junta established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters, and was exclusively made up of the highest ranking NPRC soldiers, included Strasser himself and the original soldiers who toppled president Momoh.<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/>\n\nOne of the highest ranking soldiers of the NPRC Junta, Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, a trusted ally of Strasser, was assassinated, allegedly by Major S.I.M. Turay, a key loyalist of ousted president Momoh. A heavily armed military manhunt took place across the country to find Lieutenant Sandy's killer. However, the main suspect, Major S.I.M Turay, went into hiding and fled the country to Guinea, fearing for his life. Dozens of soldiers loyal to the ousted president Momoh were arrested, including Colonel Kahota M. Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay. Lieutenant Sandy was given a [[state funeral]] and his funeral prayers service at the [[cathedral]] church in Freetown was attended by many high-ranking soldiers of the NPRC junta, including Strasser himself and NPRC deputy leader Sergeant Solomon Musa.\n\nThe NPRC Junta immediately suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, limited [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] and enacted a rule-by-decree policy, in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial, and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded.\n\nThe NPRC Junta maintained relations with the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and strengthened support for Sierra Leone-based [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] troops fighting in Liberia. On 28 December 1992, an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government of Strasser, aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu, Colonel Kahota M.S. Dumbuya and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, was foiled. Several Junior army officers led by Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot. The coup plot led to the [[firing squad]] execution of seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army including Colonel Kahota M Dumbuya, Major Yayah Kanu and Sergeant Mohamed Lamin Bangura. Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison, including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, were also executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardtimespress.org/artman/publish/article_4699.shtml |title=Standard Times Press Sierra Leone's NPRC's Ruthlessness No Death Certificates For 29 Sierra Leoneans |publisher=Standardtimespress.org |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 July 1994 the deputy NPRC leader Sergeant Solomon Musa, who was very popular with the general population, particularly in Freetown, was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser, an accusation Sergeant Musa denied. Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Julius Maada Bio, who was instantly promoted by Strasser to [[Brigadier]].\n\nThe NPRC proved to be nearly as ineffectual as the Momoh-led APC government in repelling the RUF. More and more of the country fell to RUF fighters, and by 1994 they held much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were at the edge of Freetown. In response, the NPRC hired several hundred mercenaries from the private firm [[Executive Outcomes]]. Within a month they had driven RUF fighters back to enclaves along Sierra Leone's borders, and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of Sierra Leone.\n\nWith Strasser's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant [[Solomon Musa]] no longer around to defend him, Strasser's leadership within the NPRC Supreme Council of State was not considered much stronger. On 16 January 1996, after about four years in power, Strasser was arrested in a palace coup at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown by his fellow NPRC soldiers.<ref name=\"FSL Vol 2 No 1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |title=FSL Vol 2 No 1 |publisher=Focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928012312/http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |archive-date=28 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a [[military helicopter]] to [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]].\n\nIn his first public broadcast to the nation following the 1996 coup, Brigadier Bio stated that his support for returning Sierra Leone to a democratically elected civilian government and his commitment to ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+Sierra+Leone+fell+into+the+hands+of+young+soldiers.-a0254314002 |title=How Sierra Leone fell into the hands of young soldiers|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Promises of a return to civilian rule were fulfilled by Bio, who handed power over to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), after the conclusion of elections in early 1996. President Kabbah took power with a great promise of ending the civil war. President Kabbah opened [[dialogue]] with the RUF and invited RUF leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations.\n\nOn 25 May 1997, seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie, loyal to the detained [[Major General]] [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in Guinea and they established the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC). Corporal Gborie quickly went to the SLBS FM 99.9 headquarters in Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty. The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State.\n\nKoroma suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations, shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government, with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government. Within days, Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants who came to the city in thousands. The Kamajors, a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy [[Defence Minister]] [[Samuel Hinga Norman]], remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of Sierra Leone from the soldiers.\n\n=== Kabbah's government and the end of civil war (2002\u20132014) ===\n\n{{update|section|date=February 2013}}\n\nAfter nine months in office, the junta was overthrown by the Nigerian-led [[ECOMOG]] forces, and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998. On 19 October 1998 24 soldiers in the Sierra Leone army were executed by firing squad after they were convicted in a [[court martial]] in Freetown, some for orchestrating the 1997 coup that overthrew President Kabbah and others for failure to reverse the mutiny.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr51/019/1998/en/ Document \u2013 Sierra Leone: Imminent execution / death penalty / legal concern |Amnesty International] .

The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the [[UN Security Council]] voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000, and later to 13,000. But in May, when nearly all [[Nigeria]]n forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern Sierra Leone, [[Foday Sankoh|Sankoh]]'s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [[hostage]] as the peace accord effectively collapsed. The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched [[Operation Khukri]] to end the siege. The Operation was successful with Indian and British [[Special Forces]] being the main contingents.\n\nThe situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]], originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals. However, the British exceeded their original mandate, and took full military action to finally defeat the rebels and restore order. The British were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war. Elements of the [[British Army]], together with administrators and politicians, remain in Sierra Leone to this day,{{when|date=October 2019}} helping train the armed forces, improve the infrastructure of the country and administer financial and material aid.

Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and many became refugees in [[Guinea]] and [[Liberia]]. In 2001, UN forces moved into rebel-held areas and began to disarm rebel soldiers. By January 2002, the war was declared over. In May 2002, [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|Kabbah]] was re-elected president by a landslide. By 2004, the disarmament process was complete. Also in 2004, a UN-backed [[war crime]]s court began holding trials of senior leaders from both sides of the war. In December 2005, UN peacekeeping forces pulled out of Sierra Leone.\n\nIn August 2007, Sierra Leone held presidential and parliamentary elections. However, no presidential candidate won the 50% plus one vote majority stipulated in the constitution on the first round of voting.

of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF), are the unified armed forces of Sierra Leone responsible for the territorial security of Sierra Leone's border and defending the national interests of Sierra Leone within the framework of its international obligations. The armed forces were formed after independence in 1961, on the basis of elements of the former British [[Royal West African Frontier Force]] present in the country. The Sierra Leone Armed Forces consists of around 15,500 personnel, comprising the largest Sierra Leone Army,<ref>[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/wafrsu/siers100.html Armed forces (Sierra Leone) Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments], June 2008</ref> the Sierra Leone Navy and the Sierra Leone Air Wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Air-Forces/Summary-Sierra-Leone.html |title=Summary (Sierra Leone) \u2013 Jane's World Air Forces |publisher=Janes.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[President of Sierra Leone]] is the [[Commander in Chief]] of the military, with the Minister of Defence responsible for defence policy and the formulation of the armed forces. The current Sierra Leonean Defence Minister is retired Major [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]]. The Military of Sierra Leone also has a [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Sierra Leone)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] who is a uniformed [[military official]] responsible for the administration and the operational control of the Sierra Leone military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200511647.shtml |title=In Sierra Leone, Army Chief of Defence Staff Commends Troops |publisher=News.sl |date=26 March 2009 |author=Turay, Aruna |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327084222/http://www.news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200511647.shtml |archivedate=27 March 2012  }}</ref> [[Brigadier General]] [[Alfred Nelson-Williams]] who was appointed by president Koroma succeeded the retired [[Major General]] [[Edward Sam M'boma]] on 12 September 2008 as the Chief of Defence Staff of the Military.<ref>New Vision, Freetown, 15 September 2008</ref>\n\nBefore Sierra Leone gained independence in 1961, the military was known as the Royal Sierra Leone Military Force. The military seized control in 1968, bringing the [[National Reformation Council]] into power. On 19 April 1971, when Sierra Leone became a republic, the Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces were renamed the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Force (RSLMF).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daco-sl.org/encyclopedia/1_gov/1_6rslaf.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070308/http://www.daco-sl.org/encyclopedia/1_gov/1_6rslaf.htm |archivedate=11 January 2010 |title=Partners: Sierra Leone Armed Forces |publisher=Daco-sl.org |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The RSLMF remained a single-service organisation until 1979, when the Sierra Leone Navy was established. In 1995 Defence Headquarters was established, and the Sierra Leone Air Wing formed. The RSLMF was renamed as the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone (AFRSL).\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\n\nLaw enforcement in Sierra Leone is primarily the responsibility of the [[Sierra Leone Police]] (SLP), which is accountable to the Minister of Internal Affairs (appointed by the president). Sierra Leone Police was established by the [[British colony]] in 1894; it is one of the oldest police forces in West Africa. It works to prevent crime, protect life and property, detect and prosecute offenders, maintain [[public order]], ensure safety and security, and enhance access to justice. The Sierra Leone Police is headed by the [[Inspector General of Police]], the professional head of the Sierra Leone Police force, who is appointed by the [[President of Sierra Leone]].\n\nEach one of [[Districts of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone's 14 districts]] is headed by a district police commissioner who is the professional head of their respective district. These Police Commissioners report directly to the Inspector General of Police at the Sierra Leone Police headquarters in [[Freetown]]. The current Inspector General of Police is [[Brima Acha Kamara]], who was appointed to the position by former president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]].\n\n=== Human rights ===\n\n{{Main|Human rights in Sierra Leone}}\n\nMale [[LGBT rights in Sierra Leone|same-sex sexual activity]] is illegal under Section 61 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], and imprisonment for life is possible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611181908/http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf |archive-date=11 June 2012 |title=State Sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws criminalising same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults |publisher=The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association |editor= Lucas Paoli Itaborahy |date=May 2012 |page=35}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Economy ==\n\n{{Main|Economy of Sierra Leone}}[[File:Sierra Leone Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Sierra Leone's exports]]\n\nBy the 1990s economic activity was declining and economic infrastructure had become seriously degraded. Over the next decade much of the formal economy was destroyed in the country's civil war. Since the end of hostilities in January 2002, massive infusions of outside assistance have helped Sierra Leone begin to recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=5f07db80-0c1e-4b66-9ebb-cfb4989d1e47@sessionmgr103|title=Economic Methodology: Paradox of Ceteris Paribus (CP) Law in the Context of...: Full Text Finder Results|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=16 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nMuch of the recovery will depend on the success of the government's efforts to limit corruption by officials, which many feel was the chief cause for the civil war. A key indicator of success will be the effectiveness of government management of its diamond sector.\n\nThere is high unemployment, particularly among the youth and ex-combatants. Authorities have been slow to implement reforms in the civil service, and the pace of the privatisation programme is also slackening and donors have urged its advancement.\n\nThe currency is the [[Sierra Leonean leone|leone]]. The [[central bank]] is the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]]. Sierra Leone operates a floating [[exchange rate]] system, and foreign currencies can be exchanged at any of the commercial banks, recognised foreign exchange [[Service bureau|bureaux]] and most hotels. Credit card use is limited in Sierra Leone, though they may be used at some hotels and restaurants. There are a few internationally linked [[automated teller machine]]s that accept [[Visa card]]s in Freetown operated by ProCredit Bank.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\n{{Further|Agriculture in Sierra Leone}}\n\n[[File:Sierra Leone rice farmer.jpg|thumb|A farmer with his rice harvest in Sierra Leone.

The country is among the top ten diamond producing nations. Mineral exports remain the main [[currency]] earner. Sierra Leone is a major producer of gem-quality diamonds. Though rich in diamonds, it has historically struggled to manage their exploitation and export.\n\nSierra Leone is known for its [[blood diamond]]s that were mined and sold to diamond conglomerates during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], to buy the weapons that fuelled its atrocities.<ref>{{cite news|title=UN targets 'blood diamonds' trade|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3117421.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|date=1 August 2003}}</ref> In the 1970s and early 1980s, economic growth rate slowed because of a decline in the mining sector and increasing corruption among government officials.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable infobox\" style=\"margin-right: 0; margin-left: 1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+ style=\"font-size: 115%;\" |Percentage of GDP by sector (2007)<ref name=\"AFEC\"/>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Rank\n! scope=\"col\" |Sector\n! scope=\"col\" |Percentage<br/> of GDP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |1\n|Agriculture\n|58.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |2\n|Other services\n|10.4\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |3\n|Trade and tourism\n|9.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |4\n|Wholesale and retail trade\n|9.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |5\n|Mining and quarrying\n|4.5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |6\n|Government Services\n|4.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |7\n|Manufacturing and handicrafts\n|2.0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |8\n|Construction\n|1.7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |9\n|Electricity and water\n|0.4\n|}\n\nAnnual production of Sierra Leone's diamond estimates range between US$250 million\u2013$300&nbsp;million. Some of that is [[Smuggling|smuggled]], where it is possibly used for [[money laundering]] or financing illicit activities. Formal exports have dramatically improved since the civil war, with efforts to improve the management of them having some success. In October 2000, a UN-approved certification system for exporting diamonds from the country was put in place and led to a dramatic increase in legal exports. In 2001, the government created a mining community development fund ([[Ministry of Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)|DACDF]]), which returns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities. The fund was created to raise local communities' stake in the legal diamond trade.\n\nSierra Leone has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]], a [[titanium]] ore used as [[paint]] pigment and [[welding]] rod coatings.\n\n=== Transport infrastructure ===\n\n{{Main|Transport in Sierra Leone}}\n\n[[File:Kenema-Kailahun Road.jpg|thumb|The road from [[Kenema]] to [[Kailahun District]]]]\n\nThere are a number of systems of transport in Sierra Leone, which has a road, air and water infrastructure, including a network of highways and several airports. There are {{convert|11,300|km|abbr=off}} of highways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|904|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"CIA\"/> are paved (about 8% of the roads). Sierra Leone's highways are linked to [[Conakry]], Guinea, and [[Monrovia]], Liberia.\n\nSierra Leone has the largest [[natural harbour]] on the African continent, allowing international shipping through the [[Queen Elizabeth II Quay]] in the [[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|Cline Town]] area of eastern Freetown or through Government Wharf in central Freetown. There are {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} of waterways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=on}} are navigable year-round. Major port cities are [[Bonthe]], [[Freetown]], [[Sherbro Island]] and [[Pepel]].\n\nThere are ten [[regional airport]]s in Sierra Leone, and one [[international airport]]. The [[Lungi International Airport]] located in the coastal town of [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]] in Northern Sierra Leone is the primary airport for domestic and international travel to or from Sierra Leone. Passengers cross the river to Aberdeen [[Heliport]]s in Freetown by [[hovercraft]], ferry or a [[helicopter]]. Helicopters are also available from the airport to other major cities in the country. The airport has [[Pavement (material)|paved]] runways longer than {{convert|3,047|m|abbr=off}}. The other airports have unpaved runways, and seven have runways from {{convert|914|to|1,523|m|abbr=off}} long; the remaining two have shorter runways.\n\nSierra Leone appears on the EU list of prohibited countries with regard to the certification of airlines. This means that no airline registered in Sierra Leone may operate services of any kind within the European Union. This is due to substandard safety standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |title=List of banned E.U. air carriers |accessdate=11 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325010606/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009  }}. ec.europa.eu</ref>\n\nAs of May 2014 the country's only [[Lungi International Airport|international airport]] had regularly scheduled direct flights to London, Paris, Brussels and most major cities in West Africa.\n\nIn September 2014 there were many Districts with travel restrictions including Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Tonkolili, and Port Loko because of [[Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone|Ebola]].<ref>[http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml Sierra Leone News : Africell Presents Second Consignment of Food to all Quarantined Homes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141855/http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml |date=6 October 2014 }}.

The Temne predominate in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Sierra Leone]] and the [[Western Area, Sierra Leone|some areas around the capital of Sierra Leone]]. The Mende predominate in [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|South]]-Eastern Sierra Leone (with the exception of [[Kono District]]).\n\nThe vast majority of Temne are Muslims at over 85%; and with a significant Christian minority at about 10%. The Mende are also Muslim majority at about 70%, though with a large Christian minority at about 30%. Sierra Leone's national politics centres on the competition between the north-west, dominated by the Temne, and the south-east dominated by the Mende. The vast majority of the Mende support the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP); while the majority of the Temne support the [[All People's Congress]] (APC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewpeople.com/national-news/politics/item/1764-sierra-leone-the-temnes-and-the-politics-of-the-all-peoples%E2%80%99-congress-apc |title=Sierra Leone: The Temnes and the Politics of the All Peoples' Congress (APC) |publisher=Thenewpeople.com |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Mende, who are believed to be descendants of the [[Mane people|Mane]], originally occupied the Liberian hinterland. They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century. The Temne are said to migrated from [[Futa Jallon]], which is in present-day [[Guinea]].\n\nThe third-largest ethnic group are the [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] at about 8.4% of the population. The Limba are [[indigenous peoples|native]] people of Sierra Leone. They have no tradition of origin, and it is believed that they have lived in Sierra Leone since before the European encounter. The Limba are primarily found in Northern Sierra Leone, particularly in [[Bombali District|Bombali]], [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and [[Koinadugu District]]. The Limba are about 60% Christian and 40% Muslims. The Limba are close political allies of the neighbouring Temne.\n\nSince Independence, the Limba have traditionally been very influential in Sierra Leone's politics, along with the Mende. The vast majority of Limba support the All People's Congress (APC) political party. Sierra Leone's first and second presidents, [[Siaka Stevens]] and [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], respectively, were both ethnic Limba. Sierra Leone's current [[Defense Minister]] [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]] is an ethnic Limba.\n \nOne of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the [[Fula people|Fula]] at around 3.8% of the population. Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Fula migrant settlers from the [[Fouta Djalon]] region of Guinea, they live primarily in the northeast and the western area of Sierra Leone. The Fula are virtually all Muslims at over 99%. The Fula are primarily [[merchant|traders]], and many live in middle-class homes. Because of their trading, the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country.\n\nThe other ethnic groups are the [[Mandingo people of Sierra Leone|Mandingo]] (also known as [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]). They are descendants of [[Merchant|traders]] from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country. They predominate in the large towns, most notably [[Karina, Sierra Leone|Karina]], in Bombali District in the north; [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]] and [[Falaba]] in Koinadugu District in the north; and [[Yengema]], [[Kono District]] in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims at over 99\u2105. Sierra Leone's third president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], and Sierra Leone's first Vice-President [[Sorie Ibrahim Koroma]] were both ethnic Mandingo.\n\nNext in proportion are the [[Kono people|Kono]], who live primarily in [[Kono District]] in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners. The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians, though with an influential Muslim minority. Sierra Leone's former Vice-President [[Samuel Sam-Sumana|Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana]] is an ethnic Kono.\n\nThe small but significant [[Krio people]] (descendants of freed African American, [[West Indian]] and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885) make up about 3% of the population. They primarily occupy the capital city of [[Freetown]] and its surrounding [[Western Area]]. Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated \u2013 they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development.\n\nThe Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone's judiciary and Freetown's elected city council. One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions, they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service, beginning during the colonial years. They continue to be influential in the civil service. The vast majority of Krios are Christians at about 90%, though with a small but significant Muslim minority at 10% known locally as Oku.\n\nOther minority ethnic groups are the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko]], who are related to the Mandingo, and are largely Muslims. The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north, particularly in [[Koinadugu District]]. The Kuranko are primarily farmers; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military. The current Governor of the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]] [[Kaifala Marah]] is an ethnic Kuranko. The Kuranko are largely Muslim majority.\n\nThe [[Loko people|Loko]] in the north are native people of Sierra Leone, believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter. Like the neighbouring Temne, the Loko are Muslim majority. The [[Susu people|Susu]] and their related [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]] The Susu and their related Yalunka are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in Kambia and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka kingdom was established in the early 5th 7th century before Mali empire, which was extended from Mali, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Guinea Conakry to the northern part of Sierra Leone.

A strong free journalistic tradition developed with the creation of a number of newspapers. In the 1860s, the country became a journalist hub for Africa, with professionals travelling to the country from across the continent. At the end of the 19th century, the industry went into decline, and when radio was introduced in the 1930s, it became the primary communication media in the country.\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service]] (SLBS) was created by the colonial government in 1934 making it the earliest English language radio broadcaster service in West Africa. The service began broadcasting television in 1963, with coverage extended to all the districts in the country in 1978. In April 2010, the SLBS merged with the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping radio station in Sierra Leone to form the [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icfj.org/node/37444 |title=At Long Last, Recruitment Begins at Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation &#124; ICFJ \u2013 International Center for Journalists |publisher=ICFJ |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194354/http://www.icfj.org/node/37444 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slbc.sl/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SLBC-REPORT-Final-Copy.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811043953/http://www.slbc.sl/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SLBC-REPORT-Final-Copy.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) Maiden Report 2010-2011}}</ref> the government-owned current national broadcaster in Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sierra Leone constitution guarantees [[freedom of speech]], and [[freedom of the press]]; however, the government maintains strong control of media, and at times restricts these rights in practice.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation |url=http://www.trust.org/item/20131024140514-sg47u/ |title=Sierra Leone \u2013 Editorial criticizing president prompts multiple proceedings |publisher=Trust.org |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/sierra-leone-editors-arrested-after-publishing-article-comparing-president-to-a-rat/2013/10/21/168d8172-3a53-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20131025175049/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/sierra-leone-editors-arrested-after-publishing-article-comparing-president-to-a-rat/2013/10/21/168d8172-3a53-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=25 October 2013 | title=Sierra Leone editors arrested after publishing article comparing pres\u2026| date=25 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite newspaper|last=Greenslade |first=Roy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/oct/25/press-freedom-sierraleone |title=Editor arrested for comparing Sierra Leone president to a rat &#124; Media |journal=The Guardian |date=25 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/10/21/sierra-leone-editors-arrested-after-publishing-article-comparing-president-to/ |title=Sierra Leone editors arrested after publishing article comparing president to a rat |publisher=Fox News |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africareview.com/News/Sierra-Leone-intensifies-media-crackdown/-/979180/2043834/-/u0oloaz/-/index.html |title=Sierra Leone intensifies media crackdown \u2013 News |publisher=africareview.com |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201310250762.html |title=Sierra Leone: In Sierra Leone, Journalists Held On Libel, Sedition Charges |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> Some subjects are seen as taboo by society and members of the political elite; imprisonment and violence have been used by the political establishment against journalists.<ref>{{cite web\n |last =Wilson\n |first =Harry\n |year =2005\n |title =Press Freedoms and Human Rights:2005 Year End Press Freedom Brief\n |publisher =Commonwealth Press Union\n |url =http://www.cpu.org.uk/pf_2005_review.html\n |accessdate =20 April 2008\n |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071124131843/http://www.cpu.org.uk/pf_2005_review.html\n |archivedate =24 November 2007\n |url-status =dead\n |df =dmy-all\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Annual06\"/>\n\nUnder legislation enacted in 1980, all newspapers must register with the Ministry of Information and pay sizeable registration fees.

Stations mainly consist of local commercial stations with a limited broadcast range, combined with a few stations with national coverage \u2013 [[Capital Radio Sierra Leone]] being the largest of the commercial stations.\n\nThe United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) ran one of the most popular stations in the country, broadcasting programs in a range of languages. The UN mission were restructured in 2008 and it was decided that the UN Radio would be merged with SLBS to form the new Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). This merger eventually happened in 2011 after the necessary legislation was enacted. SLBC transmits radio on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and has two television services, one of which is uplinked by satellite for international consumption. FM relays of [[BBC World Service]] (in Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni), [[Radio France Internationale]] (Freetown only) and [[Voice of America]] (Freetown only) are also broadcast.\n\nOutside the capital Freetown and other major cities, television is not watched by a great many people, although Bo, Kenema and Makeni are served by their own relays of the main SLBC service. There are three free terrestrial television stations in Sierra Leone, one run by the government SLBC and the other two are private stations in Freetown, Star TV which is run by the owner of the ''Standard Times'' newspaper and AYV - Africa Young Voices. There are a number of religious funded TV stations that operate intermittently. Two other commercial TV operators (ABC and AIT) closed after they were not profitable. In 2007, a pay-per-view service was also introduced by GTV as part of a pan-African television service in addition to the nine-year-old sub-Saharan Digital satellite television service (DStv) originating from Multichoice Africa in South Africa. GTV subsequently went out of business, leaving DStv as the only provider of subscription satellite television in the country. A number of organisations planned to operate digital terrestrial subscription TV services, with Multichoice's Go TV having built infrastructure ahead of getting a licence and ultimately failing to get a license. ITV and SATCON are currently operational.\n\nInternet access in Sierra Leone has been sparse but is on the increase, especially since the introduction of 3G/4G cellular phone services across the country. There are several main [[internet service providers]] (ISPs) operating in the country. Freetown has [[internet caf\u00e9s]] and other businesses offering internet access. Problems experienced with access to the Internet include an intermittent electricity supply and a slow connection speed in the country outside Freetown.\n\n=== Arts ===\n\n{{Further|Art in Sierra Leone|Music of Sierra Leone}}\n\nThe arts in Sierra Leone are a mixture of tradition and hybrid African and western styles.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Banham|first = Martin |title = A history of theatre in Africa|publisher =Cambridge University Press |year =2004|page = 171|url =https://books.google.com/?id=RZXtk9bCZ-8C&pg=PA171|isbn=978-0-521-80813-2|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Conteh |first = Prince Sorie |title = Traditionalists, Muslims, and Christians in Africa: interreligious encounters and dialogue|publisher =Cambria Press |year =2009|pages = 23\u201324|url =https://books.google.com/?id=HpAuyiMRTDcC&pg=PA23|isbn=978-1-60497-596-3|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last =Manson |first =Katrina |first2=James |last2=Knight |title = Sierra Leone|publisher = Bradt Travel Guides|year =2009|pages = 42\u201345|url =https://books.google.com/?id=VxRcEzkFs-wC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-1-84162-222-4|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Temne.

Children, youth and adult are frequently seen playing [[street football]] across Sierra Leone. There are organised youth and adult football tournaments across the country, and there are various primary and secondary schools with football teams across Sierra Leone.\n\nThe Sierra Leone national football team, popularly known as the [[Leone Stars]], represents the country in international competitions. It has never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] but participated in the [[1994 African Cup of Nations|1994]] and [[1996 African Cup of Nations]]. When the national football team, the Leone Stars, have a match, Sierra Leoneans across the country come together united in support of the national team and people rush to their local radio and television stations to follow the live match. The country's national television network, The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) broadcasts the national football team live match, along with many local radio stations across the country.\n\nWhen the Leone Stars win an important match, many youth across the county rush to the street to celebrate. Many of the Sierra Leone national team footballers play for teams based in Europe although virtually all of them started professional football in the [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]]. Many of the national team footballers are celebrities across Sierra Leone and they are often well known by the general population. Some of Sierra Leonean international footballers include [[Mohamed Kallon]], [[Mohamed Bangura (footballer)|Mohamed Bangura]], [[Rodney Strasser]], [[Kei Kamara]], [[Ibrahim Teteh Bangura]], [[Mustapha Dumbuya]], [[Christian Caulker]], [[Al Bangura|Alhassan Bangura]], [[Sheriff Suma]], [[Mohamed Kamara]], [[Umaru Bangura]] and [[Julius Wobay|Julius Gibrilla Woobay]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]] is the top professional football league in Sierra Leone and is controlled by the [[Sierra Leone Football Association]]. Fourteen clubs from across the country compete in the Sierra Leone Premier League. The two biggest and most successful football clubs are [[East End Lions]] and [[Mighty Blackpool]]. East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool have an intense rivalry and when they play each other the national stadium in Freetown is often sold out and supporters of both clubs often clash with each other before and after the game. There is a huge police presence inside and outside the national stadium during a match between the two great rivals to prevent a clash. Many Sierra Leonean youth follow the local football league.\n\nMany Sierra Leonean youth, children and adults follow the major football leagues in Europe, particularly the English [[Premier League]], Italian [[Serie A]], Spanish [[La Liga]], German [[Bundesliga]] and French [[Ligue 1]].\n\nThe [[Sierra Leone cricket team]] represents Sierra Leone in international cricket competitions, and is among the best in West Africa. It became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] in 2002. It made its international debut at the 2004 African Affiliates Championship, where it finished last of eight teams. But at the equivalent tournament in 2006, Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League, it finished as runner-up to [[Mozambique]], and just missed a promotion to Division Two.\n\nIn 2009, the Sierra Leone Under-19 team finished second in the African Under-19 Championship in Zambia, thus qualifying for the Under-19 World Cup qualifying tournament with nine other teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/403002.html |title=Cricinfo article Uganda and Sierra Leone Win Through |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> However, the team was unable to obtain Canadian visas to play in the tournament, which was held in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/423890.html |title=Visa Issues End Sierra Leone's World Cup Dream |publisher=Cricinfo article |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBasketball is not a very popular sport in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone national basketball team represents Sierra Leone in international men's basketball competitions and is controlled by the Sierra Leone Basketball Federation.\n\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is popular among a small portion of the youth population. NBA superstars [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Kevin Durant]] are popular among Sierra Leone's youthful population. Former NBA stars, in particular [[Michael Jordan]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Magic Johnson]] are popular in the country. Michael Jordan in particular is the most famous basketball player in the country and he is very popular among the general population. Current NBA youngstar [[Victor Oladipo]] is of Sierra Leonean descent, as his father is a native of Sierra Leone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-26/sports/38042288_1_dematha-gym-dunk-contest/2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519112746/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-26/sports/38042288_1_dematha-gym-dunk-contest/2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 May 2013 |title=Washington Post: Breaking News, World, US, DC News & Analysis |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough tennis is not very popular in the country, up-and-coming American player [[Frances Tiafoe]] is the son of two Sierra Leoneans who emigrated to the United States.\n\nSierra Leone is the first African country to join the [[International Floorball Federation]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Sierra Leone|Africa}}\n\n*[[Index of Sierra Leone-related articles]]\n\n*[[Outline of Sierra Leone]]\n\n*[[2014 Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone]]\n\n*{{Books-inline|Sierra Leone}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n===Further reading===\n\n*Acemoglu, Daron, Tristan Reed, and James A.

In 1579 he married Alice Spencer, the youngest daughter of [[John Spencer (sheriff)|Sir John Spencer of Althorp]] by his marriage to Catherine Kytson.\n\nFerdinando was a supporter of the arts, enjoying music, dance, poetry, and singing, but above all he loved the [[theatre]]. He was the [[patron]] of many writers, including  [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], and [[William Shakespeare]]. Shakespeare may have been employed by Strange in his early years as one of [[Lord Strange's Men]], when this troupe of acrobats and tumblers was reorganized, emphasizing the performing of plays. By 1590, Strange's was allied with the [[Admiral's Men]], performing at [[The Theatre]] (owned by [[James Burbage]], father of [[Richard Burbage]]).\n\nDuring this period, Ferdinando remained circumspect about his true opinions on religion and other matters. The Jesuit writer [[Robert Parsons (Jesuit)|Robert Parsons]] expressed frustration, stating that \"diverse men\" were not satisfied \"with the course of this lord hitherto\". Parsons hoped that the accession of the Stanleys to the English throne might aid the Roman Catholic cause, but that \"the Earl of Derby's religion is held to be doubtful, as some do think him to be of all three religions [Roman Catholic; Church of England; Puritan] and others of none.\" Parsons added that \"no side will esteem or trust him\" because of this.<ref name = \"man\">Lawrence Manley, \"From Strange's Men to Pembroke's Men: 2 \"Henry VI\" and \"The First Part of the Contention\".\", ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', vol. 54, No. 3 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 253-287.</ref> Nevertheless, Elizabeth's chief minister [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] received several reports that \"[[Papists]]\" were attempting to build support for Ferdinando, whom they might agree unanimously to make king, as one of his informants stated.<ref name = \"man\"/>\n\n==Earl of Derby==\n\n===Cultural patronage===\nFerdinando's father died on 25 September 1593, and he succeeded him as Earl of Derby. Lord Strange's Men were accordingly renamed to \"Derby's Men\". Scholars believe that Shakespeare was involved with this company of players both as actor and playwright. The troupe produced ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and the trilogy of ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'', and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]''. Some of these plays may contain oblique references to the Stanley family's political position at the time.<ref name = \"man\"/>\n\nFerdinando was considered \"of an exalted genius as well as birth\", and during the absence of his father on State business he ably discharged the duties of the [[Lord Lieutenant|Lieutenancies]] of [[Lancashire]] and [[Cheshire]]. He was both a poet and author, enjoying the society of eminent [[Elizabethan]] men of letters. [[Edmund Spenser]], the poet, personified Ferdinando as \"Amyntas\", and his Countess as \"Amaryllis\". In 1610, a collection of English poems entitled ''Belvedere; or the Garden of the Muses'' was published which included work which may be by Ferdinando, but without his name being attached to it, and the identification remains to a large extent a matter of conjecture.\n\n===Hesketh plot===\nAfter his succession to his father's titles and estates, more reports of Roman Catholic plots on Ferdinando's behalf reached Burghley, particularly of a priest in Rome who had said of the new Earl of Derby that he \"though he were of no religion, should find friends to decide a nearer estate [to the throne]\". English rebels who had fled overseas sent a man named Richard Hesketh to urge Ferdinando that he had a claim to the crown of England by right of his descent from Mary, Queen Dowager of France, the second surviving daughter of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and a younger sister of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The Heskeths had once been retainers of the Stanley family and were also family friends. This is why Richard Hesketh was chosen to approach Derby about the matter that has come to be known as \"the Hesketh Plot\". Ferdinando held two private meetings with Hesketh and then took him to London for further discussions with his mother, who had earlier been excluded from the Queen's court for allegedly plotting against Elizabeth. However, he finally dramatically rejected Hesketh's proposition with displays of scorn and indignation, even turning him over to Burghley.<ref name = \"man\"/>\n\nHesketh was interrogated and later executed. However, Stanley, who had hoped that his display of loyalty to Elizabeth would be rewarded, was shut out of the case and was marginalised. He was dismayed when the position of Lord Chamberlain of Chester was given to [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Thomas Egerton]] rather than himself, complaining that he was \"crossed in court and crossed in his country\".<ref name = \"man\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHis death was mysterious. A few months after the Hesketh affair, he was suddenly taken ill with a severe and violent sickness. Poisoning was suspected. It was claimed that Hesketh had threatened him that he would soon die if he did not accept his plans.<ref name = \"man\"/> He was said to have been poisoned by the [[Jesuits]], his [[gentleman of horse]] being suspected of administering the poison.

Henry VIII's will would  have made her queen in 1603 as heiress of Henry's younger sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]];  Elizabeth was actually  succeeded by [[James VI of Scotland]], the heir of Henry's older sister, [[Margaret Tudor]].\n\n[[Bernard Burke]] also mentioned two younger daughters of the Earl and Alice Spencer. Lady Frances Stanley (1583\u20131636) would become the wife of [[John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater]] and mother of [[John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater]].

But the Baronies of [[Baron_Strange#1299_creation|Strange (of Knokyn) [1299]]], Mohun (of Dunster) [1299], and Stanley [1456], fell into abeyance between his daughters and coheirs.
