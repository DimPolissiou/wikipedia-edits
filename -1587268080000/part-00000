A popular breakfast dish in [[Cambodia]], ''kuy teav'' can be found at marketplace (''phsar'') stalls, roadside vendors, restaurants and in [[shophouses]] across the country, and is distinguished by its clear broth and array of herbs, aromatics and other garnishes and condiments.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''kway teow'' derives from the [[Teochew dialect|Teochew Chinese]] word {{lang|zh|[[wikt:\u7cbf\u689d|\u7cbf\u689d]]}} ([[peng'im]]: ''gu\u00ea<sup>2</sup>diao<sup>5</sup>'') and refers to cut noodles made from long-grain rice flour (as opposed to glutinous rice flour).<ref name=\"Nath\">[[Chuon Nath|Nath, Chuon]]. Khmer-Khmer Dictionary. Buddhist Institute of Cambodia, 1967</ref> This term also refers to the [[Dish (food)|dish]]: a rice noodle soup with minced meat and various other toppings and seasonings.<ref name=\"Nath\" /> In Khmer, ''kuy teav'' is properly pronounced {{IPA-km|kuj t\u032aie\u028b|IPA}} but is often [[Elision|elided]] to {{IPA-km|k\u0259 t\u032aie\u028b|IPA}} (romanized as ''k'tieu'', ''katieu'', ''kateav'', etc.) due to the [[sesquisyllabic]] nature of the Khmer language. The term has cognates in [[Southeast Asia]] with ''[[h\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu]]'' in Vietnamese,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hai ti\u1ebfng \u201ch\u1ee7 t\u00edu\u201d c\u00f3 ph\u1ea3i do ti\u1ebfng Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u00f4ng m\u00e0 ra?|trans-title=Does the compound word \u201ch\u1ee7 t\u00edu\u201d come from Cantonese?|work=H\u1ed3n Vi\u1ec7t|location=Ho Chi Minh City|date=September 14, 2010|accessdate=July 16, 2018|url=http://honvietquochoc.com.vn/bai-viet/3138-hai-ting-h-tu-c-phi-do-ting-qung-ng-m-ra.aspx|language=vi}}</ref> ''[[kway teow]]'' in Malaysia and Singapore, and ''kuai tiao'' ({{lang|th|\u0e01\u0e4b\u0e27\u0e22\u0e40\u0e15\u0e35\u0e4b\u0e22\u0e27}}) in Thai being analogues.\n\n==Preparation==\n''Kuy teav'' is prepared with partially dry thin squarish rice noodles cooked by quickly immersing the noodles in boiling water. The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised [[garlic oil]]. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of [[oyster sauce]], [[soy sauce]] and a pinch of [[sugar]], the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid, and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as [[Gi\u00f2 l\u1ee5a|pork loaf]], minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in ''kuy teav''; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some [[dried shrimp]] for protein, while others can be more time-consuming and extravagant. Finally, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner may add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.\n\n==In Cambodia==\nIn Cambodia, ''kuy teav'' is still primarily a [[breakfast]] dish, and will typically be sold out by vendors before midday. As the pork broth is intended to be subtle rather than spicy, a plethora of optional herbs and other aromatics is always presented, allowing the diner to adjust the textures and flavours of the dish to his or her liking. In fact, in Cambodia it is precisely the use of garnishes and condiments that defines the main flavour profile of the dish (garlic, limes and pepper are a common flavour trio in Cambodian cuisine), rather than the broth. The dish is served with garnishes that can include [[lettuce]] leaves, [[sprouting|bean sprouts]], fresh herbs (such as [[spring onions]] (scallions), [[eryngium foetidum|sawtooth coriander]] and [[holy basil]]), crushed black [[Kampot (pepper)|kampot pepper]], lime juice, and caramelised garlic oil. Many types of chilli (fresh, dried, pickled) and chilli sauce are also normally present at the table, to either add into the broth or to be used as a dipping sauce for the meat toppings, as well as [[soy sauce]], [[fish sauce]] and sugar. ''Kuy teav'' is also sometimes eaten with [[Youtiao|deep fried breadsticks]], similar to how the Cambodians would eat [[congee]] (rice porridge).\n\nMoreover, ''kuy teav'' may be presented in one of two ways: with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions can have exactly the same ingredients but allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, spiciness and textures. When the dish is served this way (\u201cdry\u201d as opposed to \u201cwet\u201d) the dish takes on the appearance of a noodle salad. Finally, the Phnom Penh version of ''kuy teav'' is the most extravagant and features the most embellishments, owing to the city\u2019s historical wealth and importance. ''Kuy teav Phnom Penh'' may contain some or all of the following toppings: sliced [[pork belly]], ground pork, pig\u2019s blood jelly, chopped pork offal (such as intestine, heart, liver and lung), [[Peking duck|roast duck]], Mekong River prawns, sliced [[fish cake]] and [[squid]]. Modern-day versions of ''kuy teav'' featuring beef, chicken or seafood (rather than the original pork broth) have also evolved, but the plethora of garnishes that distinguish ''kuy teav'' remains the same.\n\n[[File:Kuyteavphnompenhkok.jpg|thumb|Kuy teav Phnom Penh kok]]\n\n==Vietnam==\n{{lang|vi|H\u1ee7 ti\u1ebfu}} or {{lang|vi|h\u1ee7 t\u00edu}} is eaten in Vietnam as a [[breakfast]] dish.

A popular breakfast dish in [[Cambodia]], ''kuy teav'' can be found at marketplace (''phsar'') stalls, roadside vendors, restaurants and in [[shophouses]] across the country, and is distinguished by its clear broth and array of herbs, aromatics and other garnishes and condiments.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''kway teow'' derives from the [[Teochew dialect|Teochew Chinese]] word {{lang|zh|[[wikt:\u7cbf\u689d|\u7cbf\u689d]]}} ([[peng'im]]: ''gu\u00ea<sup>2</sup>diao<sup>5</sup>'') and refers to cut noodles made from long-grain rice flour (as opposed to glutinous rice flour).<ref name=\"Nath\">[[Chuon Nath|Nath, Chuon]].

The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised [[garlic oil]]. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of [[oyster sauce]], [[soy sauce]] and a pinch of [[sugar]], the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid, and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as [[Gi\u00f2 l\u1ee5a|pork loaf]], minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in ''kuy teav''; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some [[dried shrimp]] for protein, while others can be more time-consuming and extravagant. Finally, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner may add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.\n\n==In Cambodia==\nIn Cambodia, ''kuy teav'' is still primarily a [[breakfast]] dish, and will typically be sold out by vendors before midday.

Seiko launched the [[Ruputer]] in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).\n\nIn 1999, [[Samsung]] launched the world's first watch phone, the SPH-WP10.

Functions may include training programs (such as intervals), lap times, speed display, [[GPS tracking unit]], Route tracking, [[dive computer]], [[heart rate monitor]] compatibility, [[Cadence (cycling)|Cadence]] sensor compatibility, and compatibility with sport transitions (as in [[triathlon]]s). Other watches can cooperate with an app in a [[smartphone]] to carry out their functions.  They are paired usually by [[Bluetooth]] with a smartphone.  Some of these only work with a phone that runs the same [[mobile operating system]]; others use a unique watch OS, or otherwise are able to work with most smartphones.  Paired, the watch may function as a remote to the phone.  This allows the watch to display data such as calls, SMS messages, emails, calendar invites, and any data that may be made available by relevant [[phone app]]s. Some fitness tracker watches give users reports on the number of kilometers they walked, hours they slept, and so on.\n\n===LTE===\n{{Main|LTE (telecommunication)}}\nStarting around 2014, several manufacturers started to release smartwatches with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] (''watch smartphones'' or autonomous vs. connected watches), allowing for direct [[3G]]/[[4G]] connection to the general [[cellular network|telephone network]]s just like any other [[smartphone]].\n\n===Long-lasting batteries ===\nLong battery life lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, plus 20 more with time and activity tracking only.\nSome watches use a button battery for time, with longer lasting periods.\n\n==Operating systems==\n{{see also|Mobile operating system}}\n\n===Wear OS===\n{{Main|Wear OS}}\n[[Wear OS]], previously known as Android Wear, is a smartwatch operating system developed by [[Google Inc.]]\n\n===watchOS===\n{{Main|watchOS}}\n[[watchOS]] is a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] mobile operating system developed by [[Apple Inc.]] to run on the [[Apple Watch]].\n\n===Tizen===\n[[File:Samsung Gear2.jpg|thumb|Tizen in a Samsung Gear2.]]\n{{Main|Tizen}}\n[[Tizen]] is a Linux-based [[operating system]] for various platforms including smartwatches.
