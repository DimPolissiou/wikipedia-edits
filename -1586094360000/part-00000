He remained Prime Minister for almost all of the 14 years of international isolation that followed, and oversaw Rhodesia's [[Rhodesian Security Forces|security forces]] during most of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]], which pitted the [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognised]] administration against communist-backed black nationalist guerrilla groups. Smith, who has been described as personifying white Rhodesia, remains a highly controversial figure\u2014supporters venerate him as a man of integrity and vision who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa,{{sfn|BBC|2007}}{{vague|date=December 2019}} while critics describe an unrepentant racist whose policies and actions caused the deaths of thousands and contributed to Zimbabwe's later crises.\n\nSmith was born to British immigrants in [[Selukwe]], a small town in the Southern Rhodesian [[Midlands Province|Midlands]], four years before the colony became [[responsible government|self-governing]] in 1923. During the [[Second World War]], he [[Military service of Ian Smith|served as]] a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter pilot. A crash in Egypt caused debilitating facial and bodily wounds that remained conspicuous for the rest of his life; following rehabilitation, he served in Europe, where he was shot down and fought alongside Italian partisans. He set up a farm in his home town in 1948, and the same year, [[1948 Southern Rhodesia general election|became Member of Parliament]] for Selukwe{{mdash}}at 29 years old, the country's youngest ever MP. Originally a [[Southern Rhodesia Liberal Party|Liberal]], he defected to the [[United Federal Party]] in 1953, and served as [[Chief Whip]] from 1958 onwards. He left that party in 1961 in protest at the territory's new constitution, and in the following year helped [[Winston Field]] to form the all-white, firmly conservative [[Rhodesian Front]], which called for independence without an immediate shift to majority rule.\n\nSmith became Deputy Prime Minister following the Rhodesian Front's December 1962 [[1962 Southern Rhodesian general election|election victory]], and stepped up to the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964. With the UK government refusing to grant independence while Rhodesia did not devise a set timetable for the introduction of majority rule, talks with the UK Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] repeatedly broke down, leading Smith and his [[Cabinet of Rhodesia|Cabinet]] to declare independence on 11 November 1965. His government endured in the face of [[United Nations]] economic sanctions with the assistance of South Africa and, [[Carnation Revolution|until 1974]], Portugal. Talks with the UK in 1966, 1968 and 1971 came to nothing. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 and led the RF to three more decisive election victories over the next seven years. After the Bush War began in earnest in 1972, he negotiated with the non-militant nationalist leader Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] and the rival guerrilla movements headed by [[Joshua Nkomo]] and [[Robert Mugabe]].\n\nIn 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalists including Muzorewa signed the [[Internal Settlement]], under which the country became [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in 1979. Mugabe and Nkomo continued fighting; no country recognised the settlement. Smith was part of Muzorewa's delegation that settled with the UK and the revolutionary guerrillas at [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House]], and, following Zimbabwe's recognised independence in 1980, he was [[Leader of the Opposition]] during Mugabe's first seven years in power. Smith was a stridently vocal critic of the Mugabe government both before and after his retirement from frontline politics in 1987; he dedicated much of his 1997 memoirs, ''[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|The Great Betrayal]]'', to condemning Mugabe and several UK politicians. As Mugabe's reputation thereafter plummeted amid Zimbabwe's economic ruin, reckoning of Smith and his legacy improved.{{sfn|Boynton|2007}} Zimbabwean opposition supporters lauded the elderly Smith as an immovable symbol of resistance. He remained in Zimbabwe until 2005, when he moved to [[Cape Town]], South Africa, for medical reasons. After his death two years later at the age of 88, his ashes were repatriated and scattered at his farm.\n\n==Early life and education==\n===Family, childhood and adolescence===\n[[File:Jock and Agnes Smith, 1935.jpg|thumb|Smith's parents, Jock and Agnes, in 1935. Jock emigrated to Rhodesia from Scotland in 1898; Agnes arrived from England in 1906.|alt=A photograph of a middle-aged man and woman]]\n\nIan Douglas Smith was born on 8 April 1919 in [[Selukwe]], a small mining and farming town about {{convert|310|km|abbr=on}} southwest of the [[Southern Rhodesia]]n capital [[Harare|Salisbury]]. He had two elder sisters, Phyllis and Joan.{{refn|A younger brother named Hilary, born in 1923, died of [[pneumonia]] in infancy.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=41}}|group=n|name=\"hilary\"}} His father, John Douglas \"Jock\" Smith, originally came from [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]], Scotland; the son of a cattle breeder and [[butcher]], he had emigrated to Rhodesia as an eighteen-year-old in 1898, and become a prominent rancher, butcher, miner and garage owner in Selukwe. Jock and his English wife, Agnes (''n\u00e9e'' Hodgson), had met in 1907, when she was sixteen, a year after her family's emigration to Selukwe from [[Frizington]], [[Cumberland]]. After Mr Hodgson sent his wife and children back to England in 1908, Jock Smith astonished them in 1911 by arriving unannounced in Cumberland to ask for Agnes' hand; they had not seen each other for three years. They married in Frizington and returned together to Rhodesia, where Jock, an accomplished horseman, won the 1911 Coronation Derby at Salisbury.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=36\u201338}}\n\nThe Smiths involved themselves heavily in local affairs. Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the [[Southern Rhodesia Volunteers]]; he also became a founding member of the Selukwe [[Freemasons]]' Lodge and president of the town's football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as \"Mrs Jock\", established and ran the Selukwe [[Women's Institute]]. Both were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (at different times) for their services to the community.<ref>{{harvnb|Berlyn|1978|pp=39\u201340}}.

After attending the Selukwe primary school, he boarded at [[Chaplin High School|Chaplin School]] in [[Gweru|Gwelo]], about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} away. In his final year at Chaplin, he was head [[prefect]] captain of the school teams in cricket, rugby and tennis, recipient of the [[Victor Ludorum]] in athletics, and the school's outstanding rifle marksman.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=42\u201343}} \"I was an absolute lunatic about sport,\" he later said; \"I concede, looking back, that I should have devoted much more time to my school work and less to sport.\"{{sfn|Van Rensburg|1975|p=314}} All the same, his grades were good enough to win a place at [[Rhodes University College]], in [[Grahamstown]] in South Africa, then often attended by Rhodesian students\u2014partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own, and partly because of the common eponymous association with [[Cecil Rhodes]]. Smith enrolled at the start of 1938, reading for a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=42\u201343}} After injuring his knee playing rugby, he took up rowing and became [[Boat positions (sport rowing)|stroke]] for the university crew.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=44}}\n\n===Second World War; Royal Air Force pilot===\n{{main|Military service of Ian Smith}}\n\nWhen the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939, Southern Rhodesia had had [[self-governing colony|self-government]] for 16 years, having gained [[responsible government]] from the UK in 1923. It was unique in the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking [[dominion]] status. As a British colony, Southern Rhodesia [[Southern Rhodesia in World War II|entered the conflict]] automatically when Britain declared war on 3 September 1939, but its government issued a symbolic declaration of war anyway.{{sfn|Wood|2005|p= 9}} Smith, who was about halfway through his university course, later described feeling patriotically compelled to put his studies aside to \"fight for Britain and all that it represented\".{{sfn|Smith|1997|p= 10}} Excited by the idea of flying a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]],{{sfn|Smith|1997|p= 10}} he wanted to join the air force, but was prevented from immediately doing so by a policy adopted in Rhodesia not to recruit university students until after they graduated.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp= 45\u201346}} Smith engineered his recruitment into the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in spite of this rule during 1940, suppressing mention of his studies,{{sfn|Smith|1997|p= 10}} and formally joined in September 1941.{{sfn|Cowderoy|Nesbit|1987|pp= 13\u201314}}\n\n[[File:Ian Smith RAF 3.jpg|thumb|left|Smith with [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]], {{circa}}&nbsp;1943, in the Second World War's [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle Eastern theatre]]|alt= A man in a Second World War-era Royal Air Force uniform]]\n\nAfter a year's training at Gwelo under the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]],{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp= 47\u201349}} Smith passed out with the rank of [[pilot officer]] in September 1942.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue= 35876 |supp=y|pages= 488\u2013489|date= 26 January 1943}}</ref> He hoped to be stationed in Britain,{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp= 11\u201312}} but was posted to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]] instead; there he joined [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]], flying [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]].{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp= 50\u201354}} In October 1943, in Egypt, Smith crashed his Hurricane after his throttle malfunctioned during a dawn takeoff.{{sfn|Van Rensburg|1975|p= 315}} Suffering serious facial disfigurements, he also broke his jaw, leg and shoulder.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp= 50\u201354}} Doctors and surgeons in [[Cairo]] rebuilt Smith's face through [[skin grafting|skin grafts]] and [[plastic surgery]],{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=55}} and he was passed fit to fly again in March 1944.{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp= 11\u201312}} Turning down an offer to return to Rhodesia as an instructor,{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p= 55}} he rejoined No. 237 Squadron, which had switched to flying Spitfire Mk IXs, in [[Corsica]] in May 1944.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=13}}\n\nDuring a [[strafing]] raid over northern Italy on 22 June 1944,{{sfn|Cowderoy|Nesbit|1987|pp= 13\u201314}} enemy flak hit Smith's craft and he had to bail out behind German lines.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp= 56\u201357}} A peasant family named Zunino hid him for a brief time;{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=58\u201359}} he then joined a group of pro-Allied [[Italian resistance movement|Italian partisans]] with whom he took part in sabotage operations against the German garrison for about three months. When the Germans pulled out of the area in October 1944, Smith left to try to link up with the Allied forces who had just [[Operation Dragoon|invaded]] southern France. Accompanied by three other servicemen, each from a different European country, and a local guide, Smith hiked across the [[Maritime Alps]], finishing the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. American troops recovered him in November 1944.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=66\u201373}} Smith again turned down the offer of a billet in Rhodesia{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp= 21\u201323}} and returned to active service in April 1945 with [[No. 130 Squadron RAF|No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron]], by then based in western Germany. He flew combat missions there, \"[having] a little bit of fun shooting up odd things\", he recalled, until the [[End of World War II in Europe|war in Europe ended]] on 7 May 1945 with [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's surrender]]. Smith remained with No. 130 Squadron for the rest of his service, flying with the unit to Denmark and Norway, and was discharged at the end of 1945 with the rank of [[flight lieutenant]].{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp= 74\u201376}} He retained reasonable proficiency in [[Italian language|Italian]] for the rest of his life, albeit reportedly with an \"atrocious\" accent.{{sfn|After the Battle|1975|p= 45}}\n\n===Graduation, marriage and entrance to politics===\n[[File:College House, Rhodes University.jpg|thumb|College House, the men's residence at [[Rhodes University]], Smith's ''alma mater''|alt=A white building with large windows]]\n\nWith Jock in increasingly poor health after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian to start a life in the United States with the help of Jock's brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however,{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=25}} and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodes University in early 1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself\u2014there were 400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and chairman of the students' representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the [[Vaal Dam]] south of [[Johannesburg]], upstaging the well-fancied [[University of the Witwatersrand|Wits]] crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity [[sporting colours|honours]] for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree (\"by some miracle\", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at [[Gwebi College of Agriculture|Gwebi Agricultural College]], near Salisbury.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nSmith attended dedicated courses for ex-servicemen at Gwebi during 1947 and 1948, learning skills such as ploughing, herding and milking; he gained practical experience at Taylor's dairy farm near Selukwe and on a tobacco ranch at [[Marondera|Marandellas]].{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=80\u201381}} In 1947, he met [[Janet Smith (Rhodesia)|Janet Duvenage]] (''n\u00e9e'' Watt),{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}} a schoolteacher from the [[Cape Province|Cape]] in South Africa who had come to Selukwe to stay with family after the death of her husband [[Piet Duvenage|Piet]] on the rugby field. What Janet had planned as a short holiday for herself and her two infant children, Jean and Robert, turned into a permanent move when she accepted a job offer from the Selukwe junior school.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=81}} Smith later wrote that the qualities that had attracted him most to Janet were her intelligence, courage and \"oppos[ition] on principle to side-stepping or evading an issue&nbsp;... her tendency was to opt for a decision requiring courage, as opposed to taking the easy way out\".{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}} They became engaged in 1948. Meanwhile, Smith negotiated the purchase of a piece of rough land near Selukwe, bounded by the [[Runde River|Lundi]] and Impali Rivers and bisected by a clear stream.{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}} He and Janet gave the previously nameless {{convert|3600|acre|km2|adj=on}} plot the name that the local [[Shona people|Karanga people]] used to refer to the stream, \"Gwenoro\",{{refn|Previously part of the vast Aberfoyle estate, the property was officially called \"Remainder of Subdivision 4 of Aberfoyle Ranch\" when Smith bought it from the Bechuanaland Exploration Company, which had owned it since the late-nineteenth century. \"Gwenoro\" means \"Place of the Kudu\" (''gwe'' meaning \"the place\" and ''noro'' [[kudu]]).{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}}|group=n|name=\"gwenoro\"}} and set up a ranch where they ran cattle and grew tobacco and maize.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=81\u201388}}\n\nA [[1948 Southern Rhodesian general election|general election]] was called in Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the [[United Federal Party|United Party]] government, headed by the Prime Minister [[Godfrey Huggins, 1st Viscount Malvern|Sir Godfrey Huggins]], unexpectedly lost a vote in the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. In August, about a month before election day, Smith was approached by members of the opposition [[Southern Rhodesia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] who asked him to stand for them in Selukwe.{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=29\u201330}} [[Jacob Smit]]'s Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests.{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=237}} Smith was initially reluctant, saying he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=105\u2013106}} With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Janet was astonished to learn of Smith's decision to run for parliament, having never before heard him discuss politics. \"I can't say that I am really interested in party politics,\" Smith explained to her, \"but I've always been most interested in sound government.\"{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=81\u201382}} Smith duly became a Liberal Party politician, finalised his purchase of Gwenoro, and married Janet, adopting her two children as his own, all in a few weeks in August 1948. They enjoyed a few days' honeymoon at [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]], then went straight into the election campaign.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly white.{{sfn|Gowlland-Debbas|1990|pp=48\u201353}} Smith canvassed around the geographically very large Selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity. Many white families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father, or because they had had children at school with him. His RAF service also helped, particularly as the local United Party candidate, Petrus Cilliers, had been interned during the hostilities for opposing the war effort.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=108}} On 15 September 1948, Smith defeated Cilliers and the [[Rhodesia Labour Party|Labour]] candidate Egon Klifborg with 361 votes out of 747, and thereby became Member of Parliament for Selukwe.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=167}} At 29 years old, he was the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=109}} The Liberals, however, were roundly defeated, going from 12 seats before the election to only five afterwards. Jacob Smit, who had lost his seat in Salisbury City,{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=167}} retired and was replaced as [[Leader of the Opposition]] by [[Raymond Stockil]], who renamed the Liberals the Rhodesia Party.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=109}} Having grown up in an area of [[Cape Town]] so pro-[[Jan Smuts|Smuts]] that she had never had to vote, Janet did not think her husband's entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. \"First of all I was marrying a farmer,\" she later said, \"now he was going to be a politician as well. So I said, 'Well, if you are really interested in it, carry on.'...&nbsp;It never dawned on me\u2014being so naive about politicians\u2014that our lives would be affected in the slightest degree.\"{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=82}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Backbencher===\n[[File:Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly, 1948.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The seventh [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly]], the first to feature Smith, in 1948.

His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second [[reading (legislature)|reading]].

Mugabe interpreted this as \"the racists of this country\" defying his government and rejecting reconciliation,<ref>{{Harvnb|Fisher|2010|pp=43\u201344}}; {{Harvnb|Meredith|2007|pp=55\u201356}}.</ref> and immediately pledged to abolish the white seats, which he said compromised \"the sovereignty of our people\".{{sfn|Sakaike|1985}} After Smith described Mugabe's government as \"illiterate\" on [[BBC television]] in November 1985, Mugabe told the House of Assembly Smith was \"an incorrigible racist\" who \"should long ago have been hanged and hanged publicly\".{{sfn|Associated Press|1985}} Later that month, Smith's close friend and long-standing political associate \"Boss\" Lilford, who had provided much of the finance to form the RF, was found beaten and shot to death on his ranch.{{refn|Gunmen reportedly tied the 77-year-old Lilford's hands behind his back with an electric cord and beat him before shooting him in the head. One of Lilford's friends told press that the attackers left his house entirely in order; the only thing missing was a small car that police found abandoned the next day in [[Chitungwiza]].{{sfn|Faul|1985}}|group=n|name=\"lilforddeath\"}} Smith described Lilford afterwards as a man \"who was prepared to die for [his] principles\", but refused to openly discuss any possible political motive, saying simply that \"it would be premature to come to conclusions\".{{sfn|Faul|1985}}\n\nSmith was by now in the twilight of his career, but his outspoken, confrontational stance continued to irritate the ZANU\u2013PF government. He was declared a \"fifth columnist\" by the Information Minister [[Nathan Shamuyarira]] in February 1987 after he advised a group of South African businessmen that they could survive economic sanctions if white South Africans stood together.{{sfn|Glasgow Herald|1987}} Three months later, after he was suspended from the Zimbabwean parliament for a year over his comments in South Africa and criticism of ZANU\u2013PF, he resigned as leader of the CAZ.{{sfn|Chikuhwa|2004|p=38}} His four decades as an MP formally ended in September 1987 when, as allowed under the Lancaster House terms, ZANU\u2013PF scrapped the white seats amid sweeping constitutional reforms. The office of Prime Minister was abolished in October; Mugabe became the country's first [[executive president|executive]] [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] two months later.{{sfn|Chikuhwa|2004|pp=38\u201339}} Mugabe and Nkomo signed a unity accord at the same time merging ZAPU into ZANU\u2013PF with the stated goal of a Marxist\u2013Leninist one-party state.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=73}}\n\nThis marked the end of Smith's front-line political career\u2014[[Gerald Smith (Zimbabwean politician)|Gerald Smith]] (no relation) replaced him as leader of the CAZ\u2014but he remained active in opposition at a reduced level. In July 1992 he chaired a meeting where the CAZ, Muzorewa's UANC, Sithole's [[Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Ndonga|ZANU\u2013Ndonga]] party and [[Edgar Tekere]]'s [[Zimbabwe Unity Movement]] formed a coalition to challenge Mugabe and ZANU\u2013PF in the next parliamentary election. The result was the short-lived United Front, which Smith agreed to chair, saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead.{{sfn|Southscan|1992|p=220}} The United Front quickly failed, largely due to the lack of common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election.{{sfn|Nkiwane|1998|pp=108\u2013109}} Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.{{sfn|The Times|2007}}\n\n==Retirement==\n[[File:IanSmith1990crop.png|thumb|upright|Smith in 1990, speaking at a dinner held in his honour by the [[Conservative Monday Club]] in England|alt=An elderly-looking Ian Smith]]\n\nThe elderly Ian Smith lived in an unassuming house in Harare where, according to [[David Blair (journalist)|David Blair]], \"the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked up the drive would be invited in for tea\".{{sfn|Blair|2007}} He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994.{{sfn|Thornycroft|2012}} He insisted that he would never leave Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}} \"Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid,\" a friend reported him saying. \"Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone.\"{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}} He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, ''[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|The Great Betrayal]]'',{{refn|Re-released as ''Bitter Harvest: The Great Betrayal'' in 2001{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=i}}|group=n|name=\"bitterharvest\"}} to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister,{{sfn|Schwarz|2011|pp=414\u2013415, 423}} and praised [[Nelson Mandela]], calling him Africa's \"first black statesman\".{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=412}} Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. \"They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news,\" Josephine Fisher records.{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}} Not all of the country's whites admired Smith; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}}\n\n===2000\u20132002: back in the public eye===\nAccording to Meredith, governmental mismanagement and widespread corruption within the ZANU\u2013PF order led to Mugabe and others enriching themselves considerably at the expense of the country as a whole.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} In Meredith's view, the average Zimbabwean was worse off in 2000 than he had been in 1980: \"average wages were lower, unemployment had trebled, public services were crumbling, and life expectancy was falling\".{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} Opposition to ZANU\u2013PF grew, particularly in the towns and cities.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} In 2000, hoping to win support from rural blacks, Mugabe introduced a fast-track land reform programme under which groups of ZANU\u2013PF activists, officially referred to as \"war veterans\", were sent to take over white-owned farms so the land could be split up, without compensation, and redistributed to black peasant farmers.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} White farmers and their black employees were violently forced out, food production plummeted, and the economy collapsed to half the size it had been in 1980.{{sfn|Smith|2013}}\n\nWhen a group of about 50 ZANU\u2013PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. \"There's no politics on the farm,\" he said.{{sfn|Meldrum|2000}} Five months later, in England to address the [[Oxford Union]], Smith described Mugabe as \"mentally deranged\".{{sfn|Majendie|2000}} The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. \"I would love that. Let him try it,\" he said\u2014\"It would give me the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster&nbsp;... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport.\"{{sfn|Majendie|2000}} A mass of reporters descended on [[Harare International Airport]] on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, but far from being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: \"We have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality\", and went home unmolested.{{sfn|Blair|2000}}\n\nIn early September 2001, ZANU\u2013PF militants again attempted to force Smith off his farm. The former Prime Minister telephoned the provincial Governor, who promptly sent police to remove the invaders. According to Smith, the trespassers were shocked to hear the authorities were taking his side, and left before the police even arrived.{{sfn|Meldrum|MacAskill|2001}} Half a year later, Smith lost his Zimbabwean passport as a result of further tightening of the law regarding multiple citizenship. New legislation passed in 2001 required Zimbabwean citizens to disavow any claim to other nationalities, even if they did not hold foreign passports.{{sfn|Los Angeles Times|2002}} Insisting that Mugabe's government had no right to strip him of Zimbabwean citizenship, Smith refused to renounce his right to British nationality, though he had not held a UK passport for years. Zimbabwean authorities duly refused to renew Smith's passport in March 2002.{{sfn|Blair|2002}} State press reported that he had \"automatically ceased to be a citizen of Zimbabwe\" on the passport's expiry, having failed to renounce British citizenship before a deadline on 8 January that year.{{sfn|Herald|2002}} Smith claimed that his Zimbabwean citizenship had been illegally revoked and that he was now [[statelessness|stateless]], an assertion disputed by the Minister of Home Affairs [[John Nkomo]], who said that Smith could stay in the country, but would not receive a new Zimbabwean passport until he renounced his right to British nationality.{{sfn|Los Angeles Times|2002}}\n\nBy 2002, the white community in Zimbabwe had shrunk to no more than 50,000 people, of whom many, like Smith, were elderly.{{sfn|Blair|2002}} Smith had by this time lost most of his former international prominence\u2014his visit to the UK in 2004 to meet Conservative politicians was largely ignored by the British press{{sfn|Cowell|2007 b}}\u2014but he achieved new domestic popularity and eminence among Zimbabwean opposition supporters, who came to see him as an unbreakable, defiant symbol of resistance to the Mugabe government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Ndlovu|2008}}; {{Harvnb|The Times|2007}}.</ref> According to [[R. W.

today [[Zimbabwe]]) from 1964 to 1979.{{refn||group=n|name=\"defacto\"}} He was the country's first premier not born abroad, and led the predominantly white government that [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, following prolonged dispute over the terms. He remained Prime Minister for almost all of the 14 years of international isolation that followed, and oversaw Rhodesia's [[Rhodesian Security Forces|security forces]] during most of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|Bush War]], which pitted the [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognised]] administration against communist-backed black nationalist guerrilla groups. Smith, who has been described as personifying white Rhodesia, remains a highly controversial figure\u2014supporters venerate him as a man of integrity and vision who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa,{{sfn|BBC|2007}}{{vague|date=December 2019}} while critics describe an unrepentant racist whose policies and actions caused the deaths of thousands and contributed to Zimbabwe's later crises.\n\nSmith was born to British immigrants in [[Selukwe]], a small town in the Southern Rhodesian [[Midlands Province|Midlands]], four years before the colony became [[responsible government|self-governing]] in 1923. During the [[Second World War]], he [[Military service of Ian Smith|served as]] a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter pilot. A crash in Egypt caused debilitating facial and bodily wounds that remained conspicuous for the rest of his life; following rehabilitation, he served in Europe, where he was shot down and fought alongside Italian partisans. He set up a farm in his home town in 1948, and the same year, [[1948 Southern Rhodesia general election|became Member of Parliament]] for Selukwe{{mdash}}at 29 years old, the country's youngest ever MP. Originally a [[Southern Rhodesia Liberal Party|Liberal]], he defected to the [[United Federal Party]] in 1953, and served as [[Chief Whip]] from 1958 onwards. He left that party in 1961 in protest at the territory's new constitution, and in the following year helped [[Winston Field]] to form the all-white, firmly conservative [[Rhodesian Front]], which called for independence without an immediate shift to majority rule.\n\nSmith became Deputy Prime Minister following the Rhodesian Front's December 1962 [[1962 Southern Rhodesian general election|election victory]], and stepped up to the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964. With the UK government refusing to grant independence while Rhodesia did not devise a set timetable for the introduction of majority rule, talks with the UK Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] repeatedly broke down, leading Smith and his [[Cabinet of Rhodesia|Cabinet]] to declare independence on 11 November 1965. His government endured in the face of [[United Nations]] economic sanctions with the assistance of South Africa and, [[Carnation Revolution|until 1974]], Portugal. Talks with the UK in 1966, 1968 and 1971 came to nothing. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970 and led the RF to three more decisive election victories over the next seven years. After the Bush War began in earnest in 1972, he negotiated with the non-militant nationalist leader Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] and the rival guerrilla movements headed by [[Joshua Nkomo]] and [[Robert Mugabe]].\n\nIn 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalists including Muzorewa signed the [[Internal Settlement]], under which the country became [[Zimbabwe Rhodesia]] in 1979. Mugabe and Nkomo continued fighting; no country recognised the settlement. Smith was part of Muzorewa's delegation that settled with the UK and the revolutionary guerrillas at [[Lancaster House Agreement|Lancaster House]], and, following Zimbabwe's recognised independence in 1980, he was [[Leader of the Opposition]] during Mugabe's first seven years in power. Smith was a stridently vocal critic of the Mugabe government both before and after his retirement from frontline politics in 1987; he dedicated much of his 1997 memoirs, ''[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|The Great Betrayal]]'', to condemning Mugabe and several UK politicians. As Mugabe's reputation thereafter plummeted amid Zimbabwe's economic ruin, reckoning of Smith and his legacy improved.{{sfn|Boynton|2007}} Zimbabwean opposition supporters lauded the elderly Smith as an immovable symbol of resistance. He remained in Zimbabwe until 2005, when he moved to [[Cape Town]], South Africa, for medical reasons.

Jock and his English wife, Agnes (''n\u00e9e'' Hodgson), had met in 1907, when she was sixteen, a year after her family's emigration to Selukwe from [[Frizington]], [[Cumberland]]. After Mr Hodgson sent his wife and children back to England in 1908, Jock Smith astonished them in 1911 by arriving unannounced in Cumberland to ask for Agnes' hand; they had not seen each other for three years. They married in Frizington and returned together to Rhodesia, where Jock, an accomplished horseman, won the 1911 Coronation Derby at Salisbury.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=36\u201338}}\n\nThe Smiths involved themselves heavily in local affairs. Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the [[Southern Rhodesia Volunteers]]; he also became a founding member of the Selukwe [[Freemasons]]' Lodge and president of the town's football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as \"Mrs Jock\", established and ran the Selukwe [[Women's Institute]].

Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however,{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=25}} and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodes University in early 1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself\u2014there were 400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university's ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and chairman of the students' representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the [[Vaal Dam]] south of [[Johannesburg]], upstaging the well-fancied [[University of the Witwatersrand|Wits]] crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity [[sporting colours|honours]] for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree (\"by some miracle\", he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at [[Gwebi College of Agriculture|Gwebi Agricultural College]], near Salisbury.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nSmith attended dedicated courses for ex-servicemen at Gwebi during 1947 and 1948, learning skills such as ploughing, herding and milking; he gained practical experience at Taylor's dairy farm near Selukwe and on a tobacco ranch at [[Marondera|Marandellas]].{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=80\u201381}} In 1947, he met [[Janet Smith (Rhodesia)|Janet Duvenage]] (''n\u00e9e'' Watt),{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}} a schoolteacher from the [[Cape Province|Cape]] in South Africa who had come to Selukwe to stay with family after the death of her husband [[Piet Duvenage|Piet]] on the rugby field. What Janet had planned as a short holiday for herself and her two infant children, Jean and Robert, turned into a permanent move when she accepted a job offer from the Selukwe junior school.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=81}} Smith later wrote that the qualities that had attracted him most to Janet were her intelligence, courage and \"oppos[ition] on principle to side-stepping or evading an issue&nbsp;... her tendency was to opt for a decision requiring courage, as opposed to taking the easy way out\".{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}} They became engaged in 1948. Meanwhile, Smith negotiated the purchase of a piece of rough land near Selukwe, bounded by the [[Runde River|Lundi]] and Impali Rivers and bisected by a clear stream.{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}} He and Janet gave the previously nameless {{convert|3600|acre|km2|adj=on}} plot the name that the local [[Shona people|Karanga people]] used to refer to the stream, \"Gwenoro\",{{refn|Previously part of the vast Aberfoyle estate, the property was officially called \"Remainder of Subdivision 4 of Aberfoyle Ranch\" when Smith bought it from the Bechuanaland Exploration Company, which had owned it since the late-nineteenth century. \"Gwenoro\" means \"Place of the Kudu\" (''gwe'' meaning \"the place\" and ''noro'' [[kudu]]).{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=28\u201329}}|group=n|name=\"gwenoro\"}} and set up a ranch where they ran cattle and grew tobacco and maize.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=81\u201388}}\n\nA [[1948 Southern Rhodesian general election|general election]] was called in Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the [[United Federal Party|United Party]] government, headed by the Prime Minister [[Godfrey Huggins, 1st Viscount Malvern|Sir Godfrey Huggins]], unexpectedly lost a vote in the [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]. In August, about a month before election day, Smith was approached by members of the opposition [[Southern Rhodesia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] who asked him to stand for them in Selukwe.{{sfn|Smith|1997|pp=29\u201330}} [[Jacob Smit]]'s Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests.{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=237}} Smith was initially reluctant, saying he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=105\u2013106}} With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Janet was astonished to learn of Smith's decision to run for parliament, having never before heard him discuss politics. \"I can't say that I am really interested in party politics,\" Smith explained to her, \"but I've always been most interested in sound government.\"{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=81\u201382}} Smith duly became a Liberal Party politician, finalised his purchase of Gwenoro, and married Janet, adopting her two children as his own, all in a few weeks in August 1948. They enjoyed a few days' honeymoon at [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]], then went straight into the election campaign.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly white.{{sfn|Gowlland-Debbas|1990|pp=48\u201353}} Smith canvassed around the geographically very large Selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity. Many white families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father, or because they had had children at school with him. His RAF service also helped, particularly as the local United Party candidate, Petrus Cilliers, had been interned during the hostilities for opposing the war effort.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=108}} On 15 September 1948, Smith defeated Cilliers and the [[Rhodesia Labour Party|Labour]] candidate Egon Klifborg with 361 votes out of 747, and thereby became Member of Parliament for Selukwe.{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=167}} At 29 years old, he was the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=109}} The Liberals, however, were roundly defeated, going from 12 seats before the election to only five afterwards. Jacob Smit, who had lost his seat in Salisbury City,{{sfn|Willson|1963|p=167}} retired and was replaced as [[Leader of the Opposition]] by [[Raymond Stockil]], who renamed the Liberals the Rhodesia Party.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=109}} Having grown up in an area of [[Cape Town]] so pro-[[Jan Smuts|Smuts]] that she had never had to vote, Janet did not think her husband's entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. \"First of all I was marrying a farmer,\" she later said, \"now he was going to be a politician as well. So I said, 'Well, if you are really interested in it, carry on.'...&nbsp;It never dawned on me\u2014being so naive about politicians\u2014that our lives would be affected in the slightest degree.\"{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=82}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Backbencher===\n[[File:Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly, 1948.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|The seventh [[Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly]], the first to feature Smith, in 1948.

His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second [[reading (legislature)|reading]]. He was slow to make an impact in parliament\u2014most of his early contributions related to farming and mining\u2014but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=109}} Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences,{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=83}} and gave birth to his only biological child, [[Alec Smith|Alec]], in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.{{sfn|Independent|2006}} Smith also served as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] [[Presbyterian polity#Elder|elder]].{{sfn|DeRoche|2003|p=100}}\n\nThe pursuit of full dominion status was then regarded as something of a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians.

The United Party rejected this on the grounds that the Federation had to be declared indissoluble so it could raise loans.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=32}} Smith was uncertain about the Federal project, but publicly supported it after the mostly white electorate approved it in a [[1953 Southern Rhodesian federation referendum|referendum]] in April 1953.

In the recollection of Welensky, who took over as Federal Prime Minister on Huggins's retirement in 1956, Smith \"didn't spend much time in Salisbury\" during the early Federal period, and had \"three major interests&nbsp;... one was daylight saving, one was European education and he always showed an interest in farming\".{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=111}}\n\nSmith received his first political office in November 1958, following that month's Federal election (in which he was returned as MP for [[Gwanda]]), after one of Welensky's Federal Cabinet ministers requested Smith's appointment as a [[Parliamentary Secretary]] in the new [[United Federal Party]] (UFP) government. Welensky turned this down, saying that while he appreciated Smith's relative seniority on the back benches after 10 years in parliament, he did not think he had \"shown the particular drive that I would have expected\" for such a role.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=111\u2013112}} He decided to instead give Smith \"a run as [[Chief Whip]], which is generally the step to a ministerial appointment, and&nbsp;... see how he works out\".{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nAccording to his biographer Phillippa Berlyn, Smith remained a somewhat pedestrian figure as Chief Whip, though he was acknowledged by his peers as someone who \"did his homework well\" whenever he contributed.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=114}} [[Clifford Dupont]], then Smith's counterpart as Chief Whip of the [[Dominion Party]], later commented that the UFP's huge majority in the Federal Assembly gave Smith little opportunity to distinguish himself as few votes were ever in serious doubt.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=114}}\n\n===Leaving the UFP===\nAmid [[decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]] and the [[Wind of Change (speech)|Wind of Change]], the idea of \"[[no independence before majority rule]]\" (\"NIBMAR\") gained considerable ground in British political circles during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

As Meredith records, the 100,000 or so who remained \"retreated into their own world of clubs, sporting activities, and comfortable living\".{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=55}} Mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to the white farming community, which accounted for at least 75% of Zimbabwe's agricultural output.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=111}} Amid booming Zimbabwean commodity prices in the years immediately following 1980, many white commercial farmers came to support Mugabe.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=45}} The new Prime Minister continued cordially meeting Smith until the RF leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a [[one-party state]]; Smith said this was putting off foreign investors.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=55}} Mugabe was not impressed and, according to Smith, refused to ever meet him again.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=372}}\n\nAs Mugabe's main opponent in Parliament at the head of the [[Republican Front (Zimbabwe)|Republican Front]] (as the RF renamed itself in 1981), Smith presented himself as the guardian of what he called Zimbabwe's \"white tribe\".

When Smith complained about whites being imprisoned without trial under emergency powers, a number of ZANU\u2013PF MPs pointed out that they themselves had been detained under that same legislation, and for far longer, by Smith's government. Mugabe openly admitted torturing suspected spies, had some who were found not guilty by the High Court immediately rearrested on the street outside, and accused Western critics of caring only because the people in question were white.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nSmith visited Britain and the United States in November 1982, and spoke scathingly about Zimbabwe to reporters, claiming that Mugabe was turning the country into a totalitarian Marxist\u2013Leninist dictatorship. Government retribution was immediate. On Smith's return home, police raided an art exhibition hosting him as guest of honour in Harare (as Salisbury had been [[place names in Zimbabwe|renamed]] in April 1982) and took all the attendees in for questioning, ostensibly because of suspicions it might be an illegal political meeting. A week later, police seized his passport, according to a government statement because his criticism of Zimbabwe while abroad constituted \"political bad manners and hooliganism\".{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=55\u201356}} Police meticulously searched his Harare house and Gwenoro over the next week, confiscating firearms, personal papers and a diary. Smith told reporters all this was \"part of the game to intimidate me and so demoralise the whites\".{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=55\u201356}} Some RF MPs left the party to sit with ZANU\u2013PF or as independents, feeling that constantly confronting Mugabe was ill-advised and unnecessary. Smith remained convinced that nobody would stand up for white Zimbabweans if they did not stick together and defend their interests in parliament.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n[[Smith Hempstone]] later wrote that the former Prime Minister had resolved to \"go down&nbsp;... with all rhetorical guns blazing\".{{sfn|Hempstone|1986}} This was in spite of increasingly unstable health; in June 1982 he collapsed in the House of Assembly, clutching at his side and shaking.{{sfn|Glasgow Herald|1982}} Half a year later he had to arrange treatment in South Africa for a condition stemming from [[Atherosclerosis|hardening of the arteries]]. The government's confiscation of his passport and two refusals of its return prevented him from going, so in April 1983 Smith successfully applied for a [[British passport]]. \"I'll still try to get my Zimbabwean passport back,\" he said. \"I was born here and that is the passport I should travel on.\"{{sfn|Glasgow Herald|1983}} Smith regained his Zimbabwean papers after about a year.{{sfn|Schuettler|2000}} In 1984 he declared his intention to renounce his British nationality to abide by a new Zimbabwean law outlawing [[multiple citizenship]].

The result was the short-lived United Front, which Smith agreed to chair, saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead.{{sfn|Southscan|1992|p=220}} The United Front quickly failed, largely due to the lack of common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election.{{sfn|Nkiwane|1998|pp=108\u2013109}} Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.{{sfn|The Times|2007}}\n\n==Retirement==\n[[File:IanSmith1990crop.png|thumb|upright|Smith in 1990, speaking at a dinner held in his honour by the [[Conservative Monday Club]] in England|alt=An elderly-looking Ian Smith]]\n\nThe elderly Ian Smith lived in an unassuming house in Harare where, according to [[David Blair (journalist)|David Blair]], \"the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked up the drive would be invited in for tea\".{{sfn|Blair|2007}} He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994.{{sfn|Thornycroft|2012}} He insisted that he would never leave Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}} \"Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid,\" a friend reported him saying. \"Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone.\"{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}} He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, ''[[The Great Betrayal: The Memoirs of Ian Douglas Smith|The Great Betrayal]]'',{{refn|Re-released as ''Bitter Harvest: The Great Betrayal'' in 2001{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=i}}|group=n|name=\"bitterharvest\"}} to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister,{{sfn|Schwarz|2011|pp=414\u2013415, 423}} and praised [[Nelson Mandela]], calling him Africa's \"first black statesman\".{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=412}} Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. \"They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news,\" Josephine Fisher records.{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}} Not all of the country's whites admired Smith; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.{{sfn|Fisher|2010|p=90}}\n\n===2000\u20132002: back in the public eye===\nAccording to Meredith, governmental mismanagement and widespread corruption within the ZANU\u2013PF order led to Mugabe and others enriching themselves considerably at the expense of the country as a whole.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} In Meredith's view, the average Zimbabwean was worse off in 2000 than he had been in 1980: \"average wages were lower, unemployment had trebled, public services were crumbling, and life expectancy was falling\".{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} Opposition to ZANU\u2013PF grew, particularly in the towns and cities.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} In 2000, hoping to win support from rural blacks, Mugabe introduced a fast-track land reform programme under which groups of ZANU\u2013PF activists, officially referred to as \"war veterans\", were sent to take over white-owned farms so the land could be split up, without compensation, and redistributed to black peasant farmers.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=17}} White farmers and their black employees were violently forced out, food production plummeted, and the economy collapsed to half the size it had been in 1980.{{sfn|Smith|2013}}\n\nWhen a group of about 50 ZANU\u2013PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. \"There's no politics on the farm,\" he said.{{sfn|Meldrum|2000}} Five months later, in England to address the [[Oxford Union]], Smith described Mugabe as \"mentally deranged\".{{sfn|Majendie|2000}} The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. \"I would love that.

According to Smith, the trespassers were shocked to hear the authorities were taking his side, and left before the police even arrived.{{sfn|Meldrum|MacAskill|2001}} Half a year later, Smith lost his Zimbabwean passport as a result of further tightening of the law regarding multiple citizenship. New legislation passed in 2001 required Zimbabwean citizens to disavow any claim to other nationalities, even if they did not hold foreign passports.{{sfn|Los Angeles Times|2002}} Insisting that Mugabe's government had no right to strip him of Zimbabwean citizenship, Smith refused to renounce his right to British nationality, though he had not held a UK passport for years.

The farm continued to operate under the ownership of Smith's stepchildren until December 2012, when it was expropriated by the Mugabe regime as part of the land reform programme and given to a technical college.{{sfn|Thornycroft|2012}}\n\nInvestigations into alleged [[electoral fraud]] during the 2008 [[2008 Zimbabwean presidential election|presidential]] and [[2008 Zimbabwean parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]] in Zimbabwe, when ZANU\u2013PF was accused of using dead \"ghost voters\" to counter [[Morgan Tsvangirai]] and the [[Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] (MDC), revealed that Smith and hundreds of thousands of other dead people were still on the electoral roll.{{sfn|Fields|2013}} According to the Zimbabwe Election Support Network's audit report, published in 2011, deceased \"voters\" made up 27% of the registered electorate.{{sfn|Smith|2011}} Mugabe had insisted during his ultimately victorious campaign in 2008 that he would not allow the MDC to take power even if it won, asserting that \"only God\" could remove him from office.{{sfn|Daily Telegraph|2008}} Smith was finally struck off the voters' roll in April 2013, along with 345,000 other dead people.{{sfn|Fields|2013}} Mugabe resigned the presidency four years later, after ZANU\u2013PF moved to [[impeachment|impeach]] him amid [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]].{{sfn|BBC|2017}}\n\n==Character, reputation and legacy==\n[[File:Ian Smith 1975.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith in 1975, as Prime Minister, wearing his [[Royal Air Force]] tie from the Second World War|alt=A photograph of Ian Smith.

It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right\u2014both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians\".{{sfn|Boynton|2007}} Smith's \"not in 1,000 years\" quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered \"unfair and inaccurate\": \"Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph&nbsp;... But there is more than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication.\"{{sfn|Godwin|2007}}\n\nMemories of his travails on the UK's behalf during the Second World War\u2014\"undoubtedly the central experience of his life\", according to Johnson{{sfn|Johnson|2007}}\u2014were fundamental to the sense of profound betrayal Smith felt when the UK government proved one of his main adversaries as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Daily Telegraph|2007}} The wartime plastic surgery that corrected the wounds to his face left its right side paralysed, giving him a crooked smile and a somewhat blank expression, while his bodily injuries gave him a stoop and a slight limp;{{sfn|Younghusband|1978}} he also could not sit for long periods without pain.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|pp=174\u2013176}} The post-colonial UK Smith encountered as Prime Minister seemed to him \"foreign and somewhat effete\", to quote Kenneth Young, while Smith was \"a foreigner in all but language to most British politicians\u2014a man of convictions so outdated, of tastes so naive, as to make mutual understanding almost impossible.\"{{sfn|Young|1969|p=128}} Smith held most of the British politicians he dealt with in extremely low esteem, considering them to have pushed him and his country into an impossible position where, he asserted in 1970, the decision to take unilateral action was \"forced upon us\".{{sfn|BBC|1970}}\n\nIn his prime, Smith was widely recognised by both contemporaries and rivals as a formidable negotiator.<ref>{{Harvnb|Berlyn|1978|p=239}}; {{Harvnb|Younghusband|1978}}.</ref> Hempstone considered him \"a man too principled (or short-sighted) to compromise with what he regards as wrong\",{{sfn|Hempstone|1986}} while Welensky compared dealing with him to \"trying to nail jelly to a wall\".{{sfn|Daily Telegraph|2007}} He had an \"iron nerve\", to quote his RF colleague [[P. K. van der Byl|P&nbsp;K van der Byl]],{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=24}} and a reputation for \"icy calm\";{{sfn|Younghusband|1978}} he almost never got angry or raised his voice.{{sfn|Younghusband|1978}} He spoke with \"a nasal monologue\" as Peter Younghusband described it\u2014\"uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards\".{{sfn|Younghusband|1978}} His open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their Prime Minister was still an \"ordinary, decent fellow\", which Berlyn cites as a major factor in his enduring popularity.{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=23}} Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an \"almost hypnotic influence\" over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win \"election after election&nbsp;... hands down\".{{sfn|Berlyn|1978|p=112}} He also had the grudging respect of at least some of his black nationalist opponents during the Bush War; one, quoted anonymously by ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine in 1976, asserted that \"If we had a leader like Mr Smith, we would have won long ago.\"{{sfn|Minetree|1976}} Sithole, the long-time ZANU leader, said: \"Smith is a fighter. He put up a great fight for his people. We were like two bulls in there, the way we fought. He is a man. I respect him.\"{{sfn|Younghusband|1978}}\n\n[[Patrick Kombayi]], an MDC politician and member of the [[Senate of Zimbabwe|Zimbabwean Senate]], said after Smith's death that Zimbabweans had much to thank him for. \"The roads that we are using today were all built by Smith,\" he said. \"All the infrastructure is Smith's. We never suffered the way we are suffering now because Smith took care of the economy that supported all people and they had enough to eat. When he left power the [British] [[pound sterling|pound]] was on a par with the [[Zimbabwean dollar]], but President Mugabe has killed all that.\"{{sfn|Bevan|2007}} [[David Coltart]], another MDC politician, issued a statement after Smith's death praising him as a man of modesty and integrity, but criticising what Coltart felt to be \"disastrous political decisions as Prime Minister\"; Coltart considered Smith's policies to have radicalised black nationalists, fomented Mugabe's rise to power and thereby \"directly contributed to the trauma that Zimbabwe is suffering from today\".{{sfn|Coltart|2007}} Godwin took a similar line, describing the emergency powers Smith used to combat black nationalists as \"draconian\";{{sfn|Godwin|2007}} he also pointed out that these \"levers of repression\" had formed the base for much of what Mugabe later did.{{sfn|Godwin|2007}} Lord Carrington spoke scathingly about Smith in a 2005 interview with [[Heidi Holland]], saying he disliked both Smith and Mugabe but would choose the latter if he \"absolutely had to choose\"; Smith was, in his opinion, \"a bigoted, stupid man\" responsible for all of Zimbabwe's problems.{{sfn|Holland|2009|p=64}}{{refn|Smith had a similarly low opinion of Carrington, condemning him in strong terms in ''The Great Betrayal'': \"During my time in the world of politics I have come into contact with my fair share of devious characters, but I regard Carrington as the most two-faced of them all.\"{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=365}}|group=n|name=\"carringtonsmith\"}}\n\nWhile acknowledging the privileged position whites had under Smith, several commentators have latterly agreed with his claims that many black Zimbabweans preferred him to Mugabe with hindsight, albeit a very low bar.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bevan|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Boynton|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Cowell|2007 b}}; {{Harvnb|Johnson|2007}}; {{Harvnb|Meredith|2007|p=17}}; {{Harvnb|The Times|2007}}; {{Harvnb|The Week|2007}}.</ref> \"Smith's image improved inversely as Mugabe's plummeted,\" Johnson wrote. \"When he walked the streets of Harare, Africans would almost queue up to grasp his hand and wish him well.\"{{sfn|Johnson|2007}} \"If you were to go to Harare today [in 2007] and ask ordinary black Zimbabweans who they would rather have as their leader\u2014Smith or Mugabe\u2014the answer would be almost unanimous\", Boynton asserted; \"And it would not be Mugabe.\"{{sfn|Boynton|2007}}\n\nSmith's death ignited condemnatory remarks in Zimbabwe's Mugabe-controlled state media. Deputy Minister of Information [[Bright Matonga]] accused Smith of having been a racist, blamed him for the deaths of thousands of people, and asserted that he would \"not be mourned or missed here by

Raju gives Rajesh seven days to break the news to his family and call Raju his son or he'll tell the family himself. After he leaves, Rajesh gets afraid and hires gangsters to attack him. On his way out, Raju gets beat up by the hired gangsters, though later rescued by Shera ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), also an Indian living in London. He saves Raju from getting beat up and helps him as well.\n\nHe advises Raju to go into Rajesh's house as a family friend, and that he should get to know the entire family. When Raju asks Rajesh to give him a good place to stay, Rajesh takes Raju to his friend Robin Singh's ([[Anupam Kher]]) mansion. There he meets Sonia again and learns that she is Robin's daughter. They gradually fall in love. On the eighth day, Raju goes to Rajesh's bungalow but realizes the family is on holiday. Therefore, Raju goes back to India, until he overhears Robin calling Rajesh and inviting him over to his house. Raju gets into the boot of Rajesh's car so he can also go with them.\n\nRajesh is horrified when he sees Raju come. Raju stays with the family at the resort. Rajesh finds out that Raju's visa has expired and he calls the police. They take Raju. Purshottam Mithal ([[Kader Khan]]) is at the airport as he has come back from Paris and Raju sees him. Raju tells him that he knows Rajesh. Purshottam renews Raju's visa and takes him back to the Mithal mansion.\n\nWhen Rajesh gets home he thinks that he will have no problems with Raju, but he is mistaken and he sees Raju at his mansion. A few days later, Rajesh has to go to a conference overseas and Raju accompanies him. The company that Rajesh is in a partnership with is blaming Rajesh for no sales lately. Raju then explains to the company that it's their fault because their products are crap. Rajesh tells Raju to be quiet but the company urges Raju to go on. The say to Raju to come and join their company but he says he can't leave Rajesh. Rajesh is very happy with Raju and he gets drunk and he calls Raju his son.\n\nWhen Rajesh gets up in the morning, Raju has bought in breakfast. Raju then goes to patch things up with Sonia, only to witness her trying to make him jealous by flirting with another boy. When he leaves to stop her, he realizes the boy she is flirting with is actually Shera, his good friend. He explains his problem, and that the two actually love each other, so Shera backs off and explains to Raju that if he needs any help, he would be there. He also tells Raju where Vicky always drug deals.\n\nRaju catches Vicky red-handed as he is talking to his partners about dealing drugs. Raju shows Rajesh and Rinkie the truth and Rinkie is devastated. Rajesh hits Vicky and Vicky shoots Rajesh.\n\nRajesh is taken to the hospital. Both of his kidneys have failed and he needs a kidney. Purshottam offers him but he is diabetic so he can't. Smitha does too but her blood group doesn't match Rajesh's. Smitha says that Bunty will but he denies as he wants to be a pop singer. She says Rinkie will but she denies to as she wants to have babies when she is older. The next morning Purshottam tells the doctor that he has called all his relatives and one of them at least will be able to give a kidney. The doctor tells him not to worry as someone has already given one. He asks who but the doctor says that the person has asked to keep him anonymous.\n\nIn the end, Rajesh confesses to the family that Raju is his son. Raju says he is lying and Rajesh is confused. He says to Raju, \"Didn't you want me to say this?,\" and Raju says, \"Why are you lying? You're not my father.\" But Raju does confess and everyone finds out that Raju was the one who gave a kidney to Rajesh. Purshottam and Smitha aren\u2019t mad at Rajesh but in fact happy that Raju is related to them.

Aras was elected to the parliament from [[Mu\u011fla]]. In his first period as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), he was appointed to the [[Independence Court]] of [[Kastamonu]]. In the autumn of 1920, he became one of the founders of the [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]]. Tevfik Rustu visited the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] with [[Ali Fuat Cebesoy]], when Mr. Cebesoy  was appointed as ambassador to [[Moscow]]. He served as MP for Izmir in the second, third, fourth and fifth periods of TGNA, between 1923 and 1939.\n\nWhen the Law on the Maintenance of Order was effected on March 4, 1925, he was the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] in the third [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] government. He stayed in office by keeping his position in all the cabinets until Atat\u00fcrk died. He implemented Atat\u00fcrk's foreign policy, held good relations with neighbouring countries and opposition to [[hegemonic]] powers. He visited Russia three times at the invitation of [[Maxim Litvinov]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union]]. These visits took place in 1926 ([[Odessa]]), and in 1936 and 1937 (Moscow).\n\nAras was elected as the president of [[League of Nations]] during the Special Session of the Assembly Convened for the Purpose of Considering the Request of the Kingdom of [[Egypt]] for Admission to the League of Nations in [[Geneva]], on May 26\u2013May 27, 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1937specialassemb.htm |title=His Presidency session |accessdate=2008-12-17 |publisher=Indiana University }}</ref> He was appointed as ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1939 and stayed in [[London]] for three and a half years.

He supported the establishment of the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]]. He took office as chairman of the board of [[Turkiye Is Bankasi]], a Turkish Bank.\n\nThe speeches he gave during his ministerial period were collected in a book called \"10 Years in Pursuit of Lausanne\" ({{lang-tr| Lozan'\u0131n izlerinde 10 y\u0131l}}) by Mr. Numan Menemencioglu in 1937.

Dobbs recorded how Aras said that the government was 'determined to clear the Kurds out of their valleys, the richest part of Turkey to-day, and to settle Turkish peasants there,' adding that the Kurds 'were to be treated as were the Armenians.' Aras apparently justified this argument: 'The Kurds would for many generations be incapable of self-government ... He always said long before the war that Turkey must get rid of the Albanians, Bulgarians and Arab, and must become more homogeneous.'<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ungor|first=Ugur Umit|title=The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia, 1913-1950|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-965522-9|location=Cambridge|pages=138}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box |\n   title=[[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Turkey|Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey]] |\n   before=[[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Kaya]] |\n   years=March 4, 1925&ndash;November 11, 1938|\n   after= [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]]\n}}\n{{s-hon}}\n{{succession box |\n   title=[[League of Nations#Presidents of General Assembly of League (1920\u20131946)|Presidents of General Assembly of League of Nations]] |\n   before={{flagicon|Argentina}} [[Carlos Saavedra Lamas]] |\n   years=1937&ndash;1937|\n   after= {{flagicon|India|British}} Sir [[Aga Khan III|Muhammad Shah Aga Khan]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Turkish Ambassadors to the United Kingdom}}\n{{Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Turkey}}\n{{LoNPresidents}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aras, Tevfik Rustu}}\n[[Category:1883 births]]\n[[Category:Turkish physicians]]\n[[Category:Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Turkish diplomats]]\n[[Category:Turkish chief executives]]\n[[Category:Turkish columnists]]\n[[Category:1972 deaths]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Turkey to the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Committee of Union and Progress politicians]]\n[[Category:Communist Party of Turkey (historical) politicians]]\n[[Category:Republican People's Party (Turkey) politicians]]\n[[Category:People from \u00c7anakkale]]\n[[Category:Burials at A\u015fiyan Asri Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Deputies of Izmir]]\n[[Category:Armenian Genocide perpetrators]]\n[[Category:Members of the 4th government of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Members of the 5th government of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Members of the 6th government of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Members of the 9th government of Turkey]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n{{Infobox Politician\n| honorific_prefix = [[Dr.]]\n| name = Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras\n| image = Ahmet Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras.jpg\n| image_size= 165px\n| caption = \n| order = Ambassador of Turkey to the United Kingdom\n| term_start = 1939\n| term_end = 1943\n| predecessor = [[Ali Fethi Okyar]]\n| successor = [[Rauf Orbay]]\n| president = [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]]\n| order1 = [[List of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Turkey|Minister of Foreign Affairs]]\n| primeminister1 = [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]], [[Celal Bayar]]\n| term_start1 = March 4, 1925\n| term_end1 = November 11, 1938\n| predecessor1 = [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Kaya]]\n| successor1 = [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu]]\n| birth_date = {{Birth-date|1883}}\n| birth_place = [[\u00c7anakkale]], [[Ottoman Empire]]\n| birth_name = Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc\n| death_date = {{death date and age|1972|01|05|1883|df=y}}\n| death_place = [[Istanbul]], Turkey\n| resting_place = [[A\u015fiyan Asri Cemetery]]\n| party=[[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP)\n| spouse =\n| profession = Physician, politician\n| alma_mater = Beirut School of Medicine\n| religion =\n}}\n\n'''Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras''' (1883, [[\u00c7anakkale]] &ndash; 5 January 1972, [[Istanbul]]) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] politician, serving as deputy and foreign minister of [[Turkey]] during the [[Atat\u00fcrk]] era (1923\u20131938).\n\n==Early years==\nHe graduated from the medical school of [[Beirut]].
