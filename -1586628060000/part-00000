It was organized in Rhode Island in April 1861 and moved to [[Washington, D. C.]]. It was attached to [[Ambrose Burnside]]'s Brigade in [[Irvin McDowell]]'s [[Army of Northeastern Virginia]] on July 16 after duty at Camp Sprague in the defense of Washington. The regiment advanced on [[Manassas, Virginia]] on July 16\u201321, seeing action at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] on July 21. It left Washington, D.C. for home on July 25 and mustered out on August 2, 1861. During its service, the regiment lost a total of 25 men.\n\n==1st Regiment, Rhode Island Volunteers==\nUnder proclamation signed April 23, 1898, President [[William McKinley]] ordered the call up of 125,000 troops. [[Rhode Island]] was directed by Secretary of War [[Russell A. Alger]] to raise a regiment of infantry from existing militia units in lieu of conscripting 720 individuals to augment the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] as [[United States Volunteers|U.S. Volunteers]] by letter dated April 25, 1898. On May 2 the state established a camp site at [[Quonset Point]] in Rhode Island, and formally named the site \"[[Camp Dyer]]\" in honor of Governor [[Elisha Dyer, Jr.]] on May 7, 1898. The regiment began to muster until fully assembled between May 10 and 17, with Colonel [[Charles Wheaton Abbot, Jr.]], commanding. Initially the unit consisted of forty-six officers and 958 enlisted men. This regiment, the only infantry regiment raised on Rhode Island during the war, was constituted of several militia infantry units in Rhode Island as well as individual volunteers.\n\n[[File:1st Rhode Island Volunteers at Camp Alger.jpg|300px|thumb|1st Rhode Island Volunteers at Camp Alger]]\nThe unit was assigned to the 3rd Division, [[Second Army Corps (Spanish\u2013American War)|Second Army Corps]] and reported for duty at [[Camp Alger]], [[Virginia]], from late May. However the regiment and the rest of Second Corps left Camp Alger in early August 1898, due to a [[typhoid fever]] epidemic. The regiment relocated to another part of Virginia at [[Thoroughfare Gap (Bull Run Mountain)|Thoroughfare Gap]] in an attempted run from the virus. However, conditions in Thoroughfare Gap resulted in [[dysentery]] and [[malaria]], and the unit eventually relocated to [[Camp Meade]], [[Pennsylvania]], with the rest of Second Corps in August 1898. The overcrowded conditions forced the relocation of the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of Second Corps to [[Camp Fornance]], [[South Carolina]].\n\nThe regiment was mustered out of federal service on March 30, 1899, at [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. The unit returned to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and handed over colors to Governor [[Elisha Dyer, Jr.|Elisha Dyer]] after a parade past city hall on April 1, 1899. At the time of muster-out, the regiment included forty-five officers and 1,039 enlisted men. During its term of service, the unit lost eleven enlisted men who died from disease and one enlisted man who died as the result of an accident. Thirty-five more enlisted men were discharged for disability. The unit also had thirteen enlisted men court-martialed and eighty-nine men deserted the regiment.\n\nThe regiment nicknamed itself the \"Rough Walkers\" which was inspired by Roosevelt's [[Rough Riders]].

These positive charges help the histone tails to interact with and bind to the negatively charged [[phosphate group]]s on the DNA backbone. [[Acetylation]], which occurs normally in a cell, neutralizes the positive charges on the histone by changing amines into [[amide]]s and decreases the ability of the histones to bind to DNA. This decreased binding allows [[chromatin]] expansion, permitting genetic [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] to take place. Histone deacetylases remove those acetyl groups, increasing the positive charge of histone tails and encouraging high-affinity binding between the histones and DNA backbone. The increased DNA binding condenses DNA structure, preventing transcription.\n\nHistone deacetylase is involved in a series of pathways within the living system.

These positive charges help the histone tails to interact with and bind to the negatively charged [[phosphate group]]s on the DNA backbone. [[Acetylation]], which occurs normally in a cell, neutralizes the positive charges on the histone by changing amines into [[amide]]s and decreases the ability of the histones to bind to DNA. This decreased binding allows [[chromatin]] expansion, permitting genetic [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] to take place. Histone deacetylases remove those acetyl groups, increasing the positive charge of histone tails and encouraging high-affinity binding between the histones and DNA backbone. The increased DNA binding condenses DNA structure, preventing transcription.\n\nHistone deacetylase is involved in a series of pathways within the living system.
