The highway enters town and meets [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]], near the western end of the cross-state [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. US-20 turns south along US-7, and the two routes form a concurrency into the town of [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. In Lenox, [[Massachusetts Route 7A|Route 7A]] splits off to serve the center of town, and US-20 splits from US-7 shortly thereafter to serve the town of [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to the southeast. The highway passes through town and interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 2 south of town, near the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]]. US-20 turns to the east at this point, and closely parallels the Mass Pike for several miles, before entering the town of [[Becket, Massachusetts|Becket]] and meeting [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]]. Route 8 northbound joins US-20 east to directly serve the town, while the Mass Pike passes south of Becket. Upon crossing through the town center, Route 8 splits from US-20, and the federal highway continues eastbound, passing into the town of [[Chester, Massachusetts|Chester]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]].\n\nUS-20 passes through the small town of Chester, and clips the southern portion of [[Huntington, Massachusetts|Huntington]] in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] before re-entering Hampden County and the town of [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]]. US-20 passes through Russell, passes under the Mass Pike and meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 23|Route 23]], and continues into [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]]. US-20 crosses the [[U.S. Route 202]]/[[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] concurrency in the center of the town, and intersects the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 187|Route 187]] just to the east. US-20 begins to enter urban landscape as it crosses into [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], making its way through the streets, intersecting [[U.S. Route 5 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 5]], and crossing the [[Connecticut River]] into the city of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. Immediately upon entering the city, US-20 interchanges with [[Interstate 91]] at Exit 8, where it leaves the surface street (which is picked up by Route 20A, to join [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]], which begins just to the south. ''(Note: Route 20A is NOT a former alignment of US-20. Before the construction of I-291, US-20 followed Main, State Streets, and Boston Road)''. US-20 is overlapped over most of I-291, running on the Interstate for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, and leaving via Exit 5,<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\"/> where it meets the eastern end of Route 20A and resumes its surface alignment on Page Boulevard in Springfield, rejoining its original alignment in Springfield on Boston Road. US-20, as Boston Road, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 21|Route 21]] and proceeds east into the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], where it goes back to paralleling the Mass Pike for several more miles, until entering [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]]. In Palmer, US-20 meets the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]] and then intersects [[Massachusetts Route 32|Route 32]], which provides close access to the Mass Pike at Exit 8. US-20 and Route 32 share a short concurrency in Palmer, before US-20 splits east. Before leaving Palmer, [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] meets its southern end at US-20.  [[Brimfield, Massachusetts|Brimfield]] is the last town US-20 passes through in Hampden County; it enters from the west, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 19|Route 19]] in the center of town, and proceeds out of town to the east.\n\n===Worcester and Middlesex counties===\nUS-20 crosses into [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and the town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], immediately meeting the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 148|Route 148]]. The route continues east where it meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 131|Route 131]] before interchanging with [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|Interstate 84]] at Exit 3. I-84 is another quick route to the Mass Pike, as it ends there less than a mile to the northeast.  [[Massachusetts Route 49|Route 49]], a short connector to Route 9 in [[Spencer, Massachusetts|Spencer]], has its southern terminus at US-20 east of the I-84 interchange. US-20 enters the town of [[Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton]] at this point, passing through Charlton City where it meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 169|Route 169]] and crosses over [[Massachusetts Route 31|Route 31]]. Continuing east, US-20 enters the city of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it briefly overlaps [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]]. Route 12 provides direct access to the Mass Pike at Exit 10, while US-20 directly interchanges with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]], which becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] north of the Mass Pike interchange. US-20 continues to the northeast, entering [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] after briefly crossing into [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 10A, as well as with [[Massachusetts Route 146|Route 146]] (which at this point is overlapped by [[Massachusetts Route 122A|Route 122A]]). The route re-enters Worcester, crossing over [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]], which provides access to the Mass Pike at Exit 11. Leaving Worcester, US-20 enters the town of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]] south of town. The highway continues to the northeast, passing southwest of Shrewsbury, and interchanging with Route 9. Heading almost due north at this point, US-20 crosses into [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]], and turns back eastward, intersecting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] in the town center. Two local roads, Church Street and Hudson Street, provide access to nearby I-290, which runs to the north. US-20 proceeds out of Northborough to the northeast, crossing into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].\n\nUS-20 enters Marlborough and interchanges with [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (also referred to as the Outer Circumferential Highway) at Exit 24 west of town, effectively crossing into Boston's western suburbs. The route directly serves the center of town, crossing [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]] in the process. It is in eastern Marlborough where US-20 begins to be famously referred to as [[Boston Post Road]], and the road continues eastward into the town of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]]. US-20 passes through the southern part of the town, crossing over the [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]/[[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]] concurrency in [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. US-20 does not intersect any major roads or numbered highways in Weston, but does follow an approximately mile-long bypass of the Boston Post Road (appropriately named Boston Post Road Bypass) between Highland Street and Wellesley Street, where US-20 rejoins the road and continues east into [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].  The entire length of US-20 in Weston is designated as the [[Boston Post Road Historic District (Weston, Massachusetts)|Boston Post Road Historic District]], since it retains much of its rural 18th-century character. Immediately upon crossing into Waltham, US-20 enters a rotary interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]) at Exit 26, marking the change from suburban landscape to the urban landscape of metro Boston and having access to the Mass Pike. US-20 meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and cuts through the center of Waltham, serving as Main Street east of Route 117. US-20 also meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 60|Route 60]], an urban highway serving Boston's northern suburbs, in Waltham. The highway continues into the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] serving as its Main Street to Watertown Square, where it has a major junction with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], which passes west and north of Boston via various parkways on the edges of the city, through [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]].

Birmingham Parkway upon crossing into the Boston neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], immediately intersecting the western end of [[Soldiers Field Road]] Extension, before it turns right and continues as North Beacon Street again, and crosses under the Mass Pike (no interchange). US-20 continues towards downtown, passing through the [[Allston]] neighborhood of Boston. Upon crossing Cambridge Street, US-20 becomes Brighton Ave for a short distance. US-20 soon reaches [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Ave]], and takes the eastbound routing over for [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]], which ends at the intersection. At this point, the [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]]/[[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] border lies just feet south of the road, and US-20 passes through [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/maps/|title=Boston University maps, retrieved August 5, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>  US-20 crosses [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] at the southern end of the [[Boston University Bridge]], crossing over the Mass Pike for the final time.

The highway enters town and meets [[U.S. Route 7 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 7]], near the western end of the cross-state [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]. US-20 turns south along US-7, and the two routes form a concurrency into the town of [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]]. In Lenox, [[Massachusetts Route 7A|Route 7A]] splits off to serve the center of town, and US-20 splits from US-7 shortly thereafter to serve the town of [[Lee, Massachusetts|Lee]] to the southeast. The highway passes through town and interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 2 south of town, near the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 102|Route 102]]. US-20 turns to the east at this point, and closely parallels the Mass Pike for several miles, before entering the town of [[Becket, Massachusetts|Becket]] and meeting [[Massachusetts Route 8|Route 8]]. Route 8 northbound joins US-20 east to directly serve the town, while the Mass Pike passes south of Becket. Upon crossing through the town center, Route 8 splits from US-20, and the federal highway continues eastbound, passing into the town of [[Chester, Massachusetts|Chester]] in [[Hampden County, Massachusetts|Hampden County]].\n\nUS-20 passes through the small town of Chester, and clips the southern portion of [[Huntington, Massachusetts|Huntington]] in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] before re-entering Hampden County and the town of [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]]. US-20 passes through Russell, passes under the Mass Pike and meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 23|Route 23]], and continues into [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]]. US-20 crosses the [[U.S. Route 202]]/[[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] concurrency in the center of the town, and intersects the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 187|Route 187]] just to the east. US-20 begins to enter urban landscape as it crosses into [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]], making its way through the streets, intersecting [[U.S. Route 5 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 5]], and crossing the [[Connecticut River]] into the city of [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]. Immediately upon entering the city, US-20 interchanges with [[Interstate 91]] at Exit 8, where it leaves the surface street (which is picked up by Route 20A, to join [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 291]], which begins just to the south. ''(Note: Route 20A is NOT a former alignment of US-20. Before the construction of I-291, US-20 followed Main, State Streets, and Boston Road)''. US-20 is overlapped over most of I-291, running on the Interstate for about {{convert|5|mi|km}}, and leaving via Exit 5,<ref name=\"homepage.mac.com\"/> where it meets the eastern end of Route 20A and resumes its surface alignment on Page Boulevard in Springfield, rejoining its original alignment in Springfield on Boston Road. US-20, as Boston Road, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 21|Route 21]] and proceeds east into the town of [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], where it goes back to paralleling the Mass Pike for several more miles, until entering [[Palmer, Massachusetts|Palmer]]. In Palmer, US-20 meets the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 181|Route 181]] and then intersects [[Massachusetts Route 32|Route 32]], which provides close access to the Mass Pike at Exit 8. US-20 and Route 32 share a short concurrency in Palmer, before US-20 splits east. Before leaving Palmer, [[Massachusetts Route 67|Route 67]] meets its southern end at US-20.  [[Brimfield, Massachusetts|Brimfield]] is the last town US-20 passes through in Hampden County; it enters from the west, crosses [[Massachusetts Route 19|Route 19]] in the center of town, and proceeds out of town to the east.\n\n===Worcester and Middlesex counties===\nUS-20 crosses into [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and the town of [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts|Sturbridge]], immediately meeting the southern end of [[Massachusetts Route 148|Route 148]]. The route continues east where it meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 131|Route 131]] before interchanging with [[Interstate 84 in Massachusetts|Interstate 84]] at Exit 3. I-84 is another quick route to the Mass Pike, as it ends there less than a mile to the northeast.  [[Massachusetts Route 49|Route 49]], a short connector to Route 9 in [[Spencer, Massachusetts|Spencer]], has its southern terminus at US-20 east of the I-84 interchange. US-20 enters the town of [[Charlton, Massachusetts|Charlton]] at this point, passing through Charlton City where it meets the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 169|Route 169]] and crosses over [[Massachusetts Route 31|Route 31]]. Continuing east, US-20 enters the city of [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]], south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it briefly overlaps [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]]. Route 12 provides direct access to the Mass Pike at Exit 10, while US-20 directly interchanges with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]], which becomes [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] north of the Mass Pike interchange. US-20 continues to the northeast, entering [[Millbury, Massachusetts|Millbury]] after briefly crossing into [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], where it interchanges with the Mass Pike at Exit 10A, as well as with [[Massachusetts Route 146|Route 146]] (which at this point is overlapped by [[Massachusetts Route 122A|Route 122A]]). The route re-enters Worcester, crossing over [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]], which provides access to the Mass Pike at Exit 11. Leaving Worcester, US-20 enters the town of [[Shrewsbury, Massachusetts|Shrewsbury]], interchanging with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]] south of town. The highway continues to the northeast, passing southwest of Shrewsbury, and interchanging with Route 9. Heading almost due north at this point, US-20 crosses into [[Northborough, Massachusetts|Northborough]], and turns back eastward, intersecting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] in the town center. Two local roads, Church Street and Hudson Street, provide access to nearby I-290, which runs to the north. US-20 proceeds out of Northborough to the northeast, crossing into [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] and [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]].\n\nUS-20 enters Marlborough and interchanges with [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (also referred to as the Outer Circumferential Highway) at Exit 24 west of town, effectively crossing into Boston's western suburbs. The route directly serves the center of town, crossing [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]] in the process. It is in eastern Marlborough where US-20 begins to be famously referred to as [[Boston Post Road]], and the road continues eastward into the town of [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]]. US-20 passes through the southern part of the town, crossing over the [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]]/[[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]] concurrency in [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], and continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]. US-20 does not intersect any major roads or numbered highways in Weston, but does follow an approximately mile-long bypass of the Boston Post Road (appropriately named Boston Post Road Bypass) between Highland Street and Wellesley Street, where US-20 rejoins the road and continues east into [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].  The entire length of US-20 in Weston is designated as the [[Boston Post Road Historic District (Weston, Massachusetts)|Boston Post Road Historic District]], since it retains much of its rural 18th-century character. Immediately upon crossing into Waltham, US-20 enters a rotary interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]) at Exit 26, marking the change from suburban landscape to the urban landscape of metro Boston and having access to the Mass Pike. US-20 meets the eastern end of [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and cuts through the center of Waltham, serving as Main Street east of Route 117. US-20 also meets the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 60|Route 60]], an urban highway serving Boston's northern suburbs, in Waltham. The highway continues into the city of [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] serving as its Main Street to Watertown Square, where it has a major junction with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]], which passes west and north of Boston via various parkways on the edges of the city, through [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] and [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]]. US-20 becomes North Beacon Street at this point and continues southeast as it crosses into the city of [[Boston]] over the [[North Beacon Street Bridge]].\n\n===Suffolk County===\n[[File:US20end.jpg|thumb|left|250px|US&nbsp;20 eastbound approaching Kenmore Square, Boston]]\n[[File:Rt 20 sign.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern terminus sign of U.S. Route 20 in Boston, MA]]\n\nUS-20 briefly continues as Leo F. Birmingham Parkway upon crossing into the Boston neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], immediately intersecting the western end of [[Soldiers Field Road]] Extension, before it turns right and continues as North Beacon Street again, and crosses under the Mass Pike (no interchange). US-20 continues towards downtown, passing through the [[Allston]] neighborhood of Boston. Upon crossing Cambridge Street, US-20 becomes Brighton Ave for a short distance. US-20 soon reaches [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Ave]], and takes the eastbound routing over for [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]], which ends at the intersection. At this point, the [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]]/[[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] border lies just feet south of the road, and US-20 passes through [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/maps/|title=Boston University maps, retrieved August 5, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>  US-20 crosses [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] at the southern end of the [[Boston University Bridge]], crossing over the Mass Pike for the final time. Route 2, via Mountfort Street, Park Drive, and Beacon Street, turns from south to east to meet US-20 at [[Kenmore Square]]. Upon meeting Route 2 again, US-20 meets its eastern terminus, with Route 2 taking Commonwealth Ave its final stretch to the [[Boston Public Garden]] and [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]], where Route 2 meets its own end.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=Boston&state=MA&address=Kenmore+Square|title=MapQuest Maps:|publisher=|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Route 20's official eastern terminus is in [[Kenmore Square]] at the intersection of [[Commonwealth Avenue (Boston)|Commonwealth Avenue]], [[Beacon Street]], and [[Brookline Avenue]].\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\">{{cite web|url=http://services.massdot.state.ma.us/mrla/RouteSelection.htm|title=Massachusetts Route Log Application|author=MassDOT Planning Division|date=|website=|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}</ref>|location_ref=<ref name=\"MA Route Log\" />}}\n{{MAint|exit\n|county=Berkshire\n|cspan=12\n|location=Hancock\n|mile=0.000\n|espan=20\n|road={{jct|state=NY|US|20|dir1=west}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Pittsfield\n|lspan=3\n|mile=3.336\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|41|dir1=south|city1=Richmond|city2=West Stockbridge}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;41\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=7.431\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|9|dir1=east|name1=Center Street|city1=Dalton}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route&nbsp;9}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=7.596\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=north|city1=Williamstown}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;7 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Lenox\n|lspan=3\n|mile=12.845\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|7A|dir1=south|city1=Lenox}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;7A\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=14.694\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|183|dir1=south|city1=Lenox|city2=Tanglewood}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;183\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=15.001\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|7|dir1=south|city1=Stockbridge|city2=Great Barrington}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;7 concurrency\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit\n|state=MA\n|location=Lee\n|lspan=3\n|mile=17.405\n|bridge=Bridge over the [[Housatonic River]]\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=toll\n|mile=18.766\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|90|MATP|city1=Springfield|city2=Boston|location3=[[Albany, New York|Albany, NY]]|location4=[[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo, NY]]}}\n|notes=Exit 2 on I-90 / Mass Pike\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=18.836\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|102|dir1=west|city1=Stockbridge|city2=Great Barrington}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;102\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Becket\n|lspan=2\n|type=concur\n|mile=25.719\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|dir1=south|city1=Otis|location2=[[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted, CT]]}}\n|notes=Western end of Route&nbsp;8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=30.895\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|8|dir1=north|city1=Becket|city2=Dalton}}\n|notes=Eastern end of Route&nbsp;8 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Hampshire\n|location=Huntington\n|mile=41.831\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|112|dir1=north|to2=to|MA|66|city1=Huntington}}\n|notes=Southern terminus of Route&nbsp;112\n}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Hampden\n|cspan=18\n|location=Russell\n|mile=48.016\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|23|dir1=west|city1=Blandford|city2=Otis}}\n|notes=Eastern terminus of Route&nbsp;23\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Westfield\n|lspan=3\n|type=concur\n|mile=53.752\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|202|MA|10|dir2=north|city1=Holyoke|city2=Athol}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;202 / Route&nbsp;10 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|type=concur\n|mile=54.004\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|202|MA|10|dir2=south|city1=Southwick|location2=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven, CT]]}}\n|notes=Eastern end of US&nbsp;202 / Route&nbsp;10 concurrency\n}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=55.770\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|187|dir1=south|city1=Feeding Hills}}\n|notes=Northern terminus of Route&nbsp;187\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=West Springfield\n|mile=61.577\n|road={{jct|state=MA|US|5|city1=Agawam|city2=Northampton}}\n|notes=Rotary interchange\n}}\n{{jctbridge\n|location_special=[[Connecticut River]]\n|mile=61.697\n|bridge=Bridge\n}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Springfield\n|lspan=7\n|mile=62.739\n|road={{jct|state=MA|I|91|MA|20A|dir2=east|location1=[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford, CT]]|city2=Greenfield}}\n|notes=Western terminus of Route 20A;

Interest in [[local currency]] moved on to other designs such as [[time-based currency]] and dollar-backed local voucher schemes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Internet networks===\nOn the whole, the movement was slow to adapt to the internet and to the possibility of networking together. Reluctance to engage with technology, a belief in decentralisation/localisation and lack of funds all contributed to this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nExamples of LETS networks based on free software are the [[Cape Town]]-based [[Community Exchange System]] (CES), which {{as of|lc=yes|March 2019}} links to the [[Geneva]]-based Community Forge<ref>[http://communityforge.net/ CommunityForge]</ref> and [[Spain|Spanish]]  IntegralCES.<ref>[http://integralces.net/]</ref><ref name=CESstats/>\n\n== Criteria ==\n\nLETS networks facilitate exchange between members by providing a directory of offers and needs and by allowing a line of [[interest]]-free credit to each. Members' [[IOU]]s are logged in a centralised accounting system which publishes a directory as well as balances visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss of value or units is absorbed equally by all members, which makes it a [[mutual credit]] exchange. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network, or they may spend first and earn later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn many countries, the distinction between LETS and [[timebanking]] is not clear, as many LETS use time as their unit of account.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAs per Linton's definition, LETS are generally considered to have the following five fundamental criteria:<ref name=\"LETS1\"/>\n* Cost of service: from the community for the community\n* Consent: there is no compulsion to trade\n* Disclosure: information about balances is available to all members\n* Equivalence to the national currency\n* No interest\n\nAccording to a 1996 survey by LetsLink UK, only 13% of LETS networks actually practise equivalence, with most groups establishing alternative systems of valuation \"in order to divorce [themselves] entirely from the mainstream economy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Croall | year=1997 | title=LETS Act Locally | publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation | isbn=0-903319-81-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Lang | year=1994 | title=LETS Work: Rebuilding the Local Economy | publisher=Grover Books | isbn=1-899233-00-8}}</ref> Michael Linton has stated that such systems are \"personal money\" networks rather than LETS.<ref name=\"LETS1\" />\n\n== Operation ==\nA list of services offered by network members is put together to create an LETS scheme, and trading takes place between members using a local currency. The LETS foundation is a virtual currency, a check book, a directory as well as a transparent accounting system built on trust and community regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=North |first1=Peter |title=Explorations in heterotopia: Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS) and the micropolitics of money and livelihood |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |date=1999 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201386 |doi=10.1068/d170069 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/d170069 |issn=0263-7758}}</ref>\nThe first LETS required nothing more than a telephone, an answering machine and a notebook.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/low/Ep45_final_lowbitrate.mp3 |title=Opening Money |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=2012-11-07}}</ref> Since then, there have been several attempts to improve the process with software, printed notes, and other familiar aspects of traditional currencies.\n# Local people set up an organization to trade between themselves, often paying a small membership fee to cover administration costs\n# Members maintain a directory of offers and wants to help facilitate trades\n# Upon trading, members may 'pay' each other with printed notes, log the transaction in log books or online, or  write cheques which are later cleared by the system accountant.\n# Members whose balances exceed specified limits (positive or negative) are obliged to move their balance back towards zero by spending or earning.\n\nLETS is a full-fledged monetary or exchange system, unlike direct [[barter (economics)|barter]]. LETS members are able to earn credits from any member and spend them with anyone else on the scheme. Since the details are worked out by the users, there is much variation between schemes.\n\nLETS is not a scheme for avoiding the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax.  In a number of countries, various government taxation authorities have examined LETS along with other forms of [[counter trade]], and made rulings concerning their use. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Generally for personal arrangements, social arrangements, hobbies or pastimes, there are no taxation implications.  This generally covers the vast majority of LETS transactions.{{Disputed inline|Tax|date=May 2010}}  Taxation liabilities accrue when a [[tradesperson]] or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units.  In such cases, the businesses are generally encouraged to sell the service or product partly for LETS units and partly in the national currency, to allow the payment of all required taxation. This does imply, however, that in situations where national-currency expenditures would be tax-deductible, LETS must be as well.\n\nIn a number of countries, LETSystems have been encouraged as a social security initiative.  For example, in Australia, [[Peter Baldwin (politician)|Peter Baldwin]], a former Minister of Social Security in the Keating government, encouraged LETSystems as a way of letting welfare recipients borrow against their welfare entitlement for urgent personal needs or to establish themselves in business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nSince its commencement over 30 years ago, LETSystems have been highly innovative in adapting to the needs of their local communities in all kinds of ways.  For example, in Australia, people have built houses using LETS in place of a bank [[mortgage loan|mortgage]], freeing the owner from onerous interest payments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n== Benefits ==\nLETS can help [[community building|revitalise and build community]] by allowing a wider cross-section of the [[community]]\u2014individuals, small businesses, local services and [[Non-profit organization|voluntary group]]s\u2014to save money and resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal of this approach is to stimulate the economies of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.\nThe environmental benefits of enhanced locals' self-reliance involve less-distance transport (as local goods are substituted for imports) and more evident environmental effects. Moreover, diverse local economies support sustainability by decreasing the need to use assets in an inefficient manner to satisfy external consumer demands. That also requires improving the local [[Quality_of_life]] without having to make wash expenditures.  There is no doubt that LETS allows much greater self-direction and flexibility in employment patterns than the [[Traditional_economy]] and, in particular, unable the skills of the unemployed to be valued and used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seyfang |first1=Gill J. |title=Local Exchange Trading Systems and Sustainable Development |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |date=1 March 1996 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201345 |doi=10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457?journalCode=venv20 |issn=0013-9157}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nEven though LETS are strongly oriented towards the formal market economy, they disengage from it by establishing small, cooperative exchange enclaves in which trust and intimacy relationships.

Interest in [[local currency]] moved on to other designs such as [[time-based currency]] and dollar-backed local voucher schemes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Internet networks===\nOn the whole, the movement was slow to adapt to the internet and to the possibility of networking together. Reluctance to engage with technology, a belief in decentralisation/localisation and lack of funds all contributed to this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nExamples of LETS networks based on free software are the [[Cape Town]]-based [[Community Exchange System]] (CES), which {{as of|lc=yes|March 2019}} links to the [[Geneva]]-based Community Forge<ref>[http://communityforge.net/ CommunityForge]</ref> and [[Spain|Spanish]]  IntegralCES.<ref>[http://integralces.net/]</ref><ref name=CESstats/>\n\n== Criteria ==\n\nLETS networks facilitate exchange between members by providing a directory of offers and needs and by allowing a line of [[interest]]-free credit to each. Members' [[IOU]]s are logged in a centralised accounting system which publishes a directory as well as balances visible to all members. In case of a default, the loss of value or units is absorbed equally by all members, which makes it a [[mutual credit]] exchange. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network, or they may spend first and earn later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn many countries, the distinction between LETS and [[timebanking]] is not clear, as many LETS use time as their unit of account.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAs per Linton's definition, LETS are generally considered to have the following five fundamental criteria:<ref name=\"LETS1\"/>\n* Cost of service: from the community for the community\n* Consent: there is no compulsion to trade\n* Disclosure: information about balances is available to all members\n* Equivalence to the national currency\n* No interest\n\nAccording to a 1996 survey by LetsLink UK, only 13% of LETS networks actually practise equivalence, with most groups establishing alternative systems of valuation \"in order to divorce [themselves] entirely from the mainstream economy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| first=Jonathan | last=Croall | year=1997 | title=LETS Act Locally | publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation | isbn=0-903319-81-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| first=Peter | last=Lang | year=1994 | title=LETS Work: Rebuilding the Local Economy | publisher=Grover Books | isbn=1-899233-00-8}}</ref> Michael Linton has stated that such systems are \"personal money\" networks rather than LETS.<ref name=\"LETS1\" />\n\n== Operation ==\nA list of services offered by network members is put together to create an LETS scheme, and trading takes place between members using a local currency. The LETS foundation is a virtual currency, a check book, a directory as well as a transparent accounting system built on trust and community regulation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=North |first1=Peter |title=Explorations in heterotopia: Local Exchange Trading Schemes (LETS) and the micropolitics of money and livelihood |journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space |date=1999 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=69\u201386 |doi=10.1068/d170069 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/d170069 |issn=0263-7758}}</ref>\nThe first LETS required nothing more than a telephone, an answering machine and a notebook.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=http://media.blubrry.com/extraenvironmentalist/p/extraenvironmentalist.com/audio/low/Ep45_final_lowbitrate.mp3 |title=Opening Money |host=The Extraenvironmentalist |date=2012-11-07}}</ref> Since then, there have been several attempts to improve the process with software, printed notes, and other familiar aspects of traditional currencies.\n# Local people set up an organization to trade between themselves, often paying a small membership fee to cover administration costs\n# Members maintain a directory of offers and wants to help facilitate trades\n# Upon trading, members may 'pay' each other with printed notes, log the transaction in log books or online, or  write cheques which are later cleared by the system accountant.\n# Members whose balances exceed specified limits (positive or negative) are obliged to move their balance back towards zero by spending or earning.\n\nLETS is a full-fledged monetary or exchange system, unlike direct [[barter (economics)|barter]]. LETS members are able to earn credits from any member and spend them with anyone else on the scheme. Since the details are worked out by the users, there is much variation between schemes.\n\nLETS is not a scheme for avoiding the payment of taxation, and generally groups encourage all members to personally undertake their liabilities to the state for all taxation, including income tax and goods and services tax.  In a number of countries, various government taxation authorities have examined LETS along with other forms of [[counter trade]], and made rulings concerning their use. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Generally for personal arrangements, social arrangements, hobbies or pastimes, there are no taxation implications.  This generally covers the vast majority of LETS transactions.{{Disputed inline|Tax|date=May 2010}}  Taxation liabilities accrue when a [[tradesperson]] or professional person provides his or her professional services in payment for LETS units, or a registered or incorporated business sells part of its product for LETS units.  In such cases, the businesses are generally encouraged to sell the service or product partly for LETS units and partly in the national currency, to allow the payment of all required taxation. This does imply, however, that in situations where national-currency expenditures would be tax-deductible, LETS must be as well.\n\nIn a number of countries, LETSystems have been encouraged as a social security initiative.  For example, in Australia, [[Peter Baldwin (politician)|Peter Baldwin]], a former Minister of Social Security in the Keating government, encouraged LETSystems as a way of letting welfare recipients borrow against their welfare entitlement for urgent personal needs or to establish themselves in business.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nSince its commencement over 30 years ago, LETSystems have been highly innovative in adapting to the needs of their local communities in all kinds of ways.  For example, in Australia, people have built houses using LETS in place of a bank [[mortgage loan|mortgage]], freeing the owner from onerous interest payments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n== Benefits ==\nLETS can help [[community building|revitalise and build community]] by allowing a wider cross-section of the [[community]]\u2014individuals, small businesses, local services and [[Non-profit organization|voluntary group]]s\u2014to save money and resources in cooperation with others and extend their purchasing power. Other benefits may include social contact, health care, tuition and training, support for local enterprise and new businesses. One goal of this approach is to stimulate the economies of economically depressed towns that have goods and services, but little official currency: the LETS scheme does not require outside sources of income as stimulus.\nThe environmental benefits of enhanced local's self-reliance involve less-distance transport (as local goods are substituted for imports) and more evident environmental effects. Moreover, diverse local economies support sustainability by decreasing the need to use assets in an inefficient manner to satisfy external consumer demands. That also requires improving the local [[Quality_of_life]] without having to make wash expenditures.  There is no doubt that LETS allows much greater self-direction and flexibility in employment patterns than the [[Traditional_economy]] and, in particular, unable the skills of the unemployed to be valued and used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Seyfang |first1=Gill J. |title=Local Exchange Trading Systems and Sustainable Development |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |date=1 March 1996 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201345 |doi=10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00139157.1996.9933457?journalCode=venv20 |issn=0013-9157}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nEven though LETS are strongly oriented towards the formal market economy, they disengage from it by establishing small, cooperative exchange enclaves in which trust and intimacy relationships. And it also means that there is a small range of services available. LETS members must be economically involved outside to meet their needs.

I-291 and U.S. 20 run eastbound concurrently until Exit 5A (U.S. 20 joins westbound at Exit 5), where U.S. 20 east leaves the highway for a junction with [[Massachusetts Route 20A|Route 20A]]. I-291 continues east into Chicopee, where it intersects the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 90]]).  I-291 ends at an odd intersection at a stoplight on Burnett Road, but I-291 east traffic can exit uninterrupted by way of a ramp to the Mass Pike. However, drivers coming from the Mass Pike must deal with this traffic light, as a left turn across the intersection is required to get on I-291 west.\n\nThe westbound interchange with I-91 is unusual in that the ramps for Exit 1A-B split before the ramps for Exits 2A-B do.

I-291 follows the original planned alignment of the expressway, except for the stretch between exit 4 (St. James Avenue) and exit 5 (US 20/MA 20A/Page Boulevard).

Nonetheless, which party would be included in the coalition took a long process of negotiations. Both a four-party coalition excluding the Communist Party and a three-party coalition excluding both the [[Japanese Communist Party|Communist Party]] and the Liberal Party were suggested within the socialists. The Liberal party, led by anticommunist [[Shigeru Yoshida]] ''(\u5409\u7530\u8302)'', showed great reluctance of joining the coalition.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite book|title=Japan's postwar party politics|last=1962-|first=Kohno, Masaru|date=1997|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691026299|location=|pages=50\u201353|oclc=441854586}}</ref> At a meeting between the Katayama and Yoshida in May 19, 1947, the Liberal Party asked Katayama to \u201cbreak off with the leftists\u201d in return of its participation in the coalition.

The Peace Treaty was signed without the communist bloc\u2019s presence, which was condemned by the Communist Party for its anti-communist stance. The Security Treaty was criticized by both the Communist Party and the Socialist Party for the risk of remilitarization, while also criticized by the conservatives for putting Japan in a subordinate position, since Japan was asked to provide military base for the U.S.\u2019s force.<ref name=\":82\">{{Cite book|title=\u6226\u5f8c\u6539\u9769\u3068\u9006\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9|last=\u5409\u7530|first=\u88d5|publisher=\u5409\u5ddd\u5f18\u6587\u9928|year=2004|isbn=|location=\u6771\u4eac|pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n# During the fifth Yoshida cabinet, several bills were passed with the strong opposition of the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan, including the Strike Control Act, the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement between Japan and the United States of America, two education acts which restrict the political participation of school teachers, amendment to the Police Act, Self-Defense Forces Act.

One is known as the Hozen Keizai Kai Incident ''(\u4fdd\u5168\u7d4c\u6e08\u4f1a\u4e8b\u4ef6)''. Masutomi Ito, the director of a financial institution Hozen Keizai Kai which, was accused of fraud and suspected of making political bribery, which resulted in the arrests of several conservative politicians.<ref name=\":22\" /> The other is known as the Shipbuilding Bribery ''(\u9020\u8239\u7591\u7344)'', in which the shipping business and shipbuilding business were proved to be making pay-off to conservative politicians.

On October 20, 1954, anti-Yoshida conservatives formed a coalition party: the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1954)|Japan Democratic Party]] ''(\u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a)''. The Japan Democratic Party along with the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan tabled a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] against the cabinet on December 6 and won the majority. As a result, Yoshida Cabinet resigned on December 7 after six years of rule.\n\n== Establishment of the 1955 System ==\n\n=== Merger of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) ===\nWithin the Socialist party, ideological conflicts had long been a problem. The leftists in the party adopted a Marx-Lenin ideology as China, while the rightists leaned towards a socialist welfare nation under a capitalist system. The San Francisco Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan signed in 1951 triggered the final split. The right socialists agreed on the San Francisco Peace Treaty but were against the Security Treaty, due to their constitutionalist stance, while the left socialists were against both treaties due to their exclusion of Soviet Union.<ref name=\":02\" /> On October 23, 1951, the old Socialist Party officially split into the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u5de6\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)'' and the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u53f3\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)''.\n\nAfter the split, however, the socialists soon realized the necessity of merging into one party to fight against the anti-communist approach taken by the GHQ and the conservatives, which is commonly referred to as the [[Reverse Course|reverse course]] ''(\u9006\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9)''. After the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, influential members from the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan came back from the purge and boosted the power of the rightists. The Leftist Socialist Party of Japan also expanded its power with the support of the [[General Council of Trade Unions of Japan]], also known as ''Sohyo(\u65e5\u672c\u52b4\u50cd\u7d44\u5408\u7dcf\u8a55\u8b70\u4f1a)''. Meanwhile, the conservatives were suffering criticisms from the public for the corruption scandals and Security Treaty. Sensing the possibility of success, despite their ideological differences, to take power from the political right and fight against the anti-communist movement, the socialists decided to reunite and formed the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) on October 13, 1955.<ref name=\":62\" />\n[[File:Japanese_General_election,_1955_en.svg|left|thumb|257x257px|Before the merger: House of Representative Seat Distribution in 1955]]\nOne crucial external factor that caused the merger of JSD is ''Sohyo''. ''Sohyo'', the abbreviation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, was a trade confederation in Japan which was established on July 11, 1950, soon after the start of the Korean War. It incorporated about 48% of organized workers in Japan. Initially, ''Sohyo''was the unified body of anti-communist unions, but it soon changed from a centralist stance to a left stance due to the remilitarization tendency of Japan shown in the Korean War.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Incorporating Japanese labor into the Free World: Cold War diplomacy and economic interdependence, 1949\u20131964|journal = Labor History|volume = 49|issue = 2|pages = 199\u2013222|last=Nakakita|first=Koji|date=2008|doi=10.1080/00236560801950972}}</ref> Due to the rationalization strategy taken by the conservative government, Japanese workers, particular those worked in small and median-sized factories were facing slow wage increase and even dismissals.

Meanwhile, the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan was able to win 17 more seats. The expansion of Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the soon formation of the leftists and rightists in the socialist camp into JSP became a more substantial threat for the conservatives. As a result, also in 1955, the Japan Democratic Party and the Japan Liberal Party merged as Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP).<ref name=\":82\" />\n\nThe expansion of the socialist power also worried the ''Zaikai''(business community). ''Zaikai'' had incentives to secure a conservative government since it would pump money into the big companies to keep their competitiveness, stay in a close relationship with the U.S. to maintain a liberal trade policy, and deal with the intensified anti-rationalization labor movement. Therefore, to counter the socialist power, the ''Zaikai'' pressured the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party to merge.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite journal|last=Masumi|first=Junnosuke|date=1988|title=The 1955 System in Japan and Its Subsequent Development|journal=Asian Survey|volume=28|issue=3|pages=286\u2013306|doi=10.1525/as.1988.28.3.01p0146p|issn=0004-4687|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/ucpas/28/3/286.full.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Outcome of the merger: 1955 System ===\nAfter the formation of the two major parties, JSP and LDP, a [[1958 Japanese general election|general election]] was held in 1958.

As a result, the LDP won almost as twice as many seats as JSP.

Unsatisfied with the draft, the draft was later then revised by the SCAP. Therefore, the 1946 constitution was more of American authorship and the banner for SCAP\u2019s goal of democratization of Japan. The conservative parties had the consideration of constitution revision since its enactment. Although varying in extent, the revision of [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]] to permit a rearmament program had been widely argued with the conservative parties since the Yoshida cabinet.

JSP strongly opposed the Security Treaty due to the underlying possibility of further rearmament and even revival militarism in Japan, while LDP argued that the presence of the U.S. army in Japan was merely for self-defense.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Protest in tokyo - the security treaty crisis of 1960.|last=R.|first=Packard, George|year=|isbn=9780691650746|location=|pages=3\u201322|oclc=1023228016}}</ref>\n\n== LDP dominance in the 1955 system ==\n\n=== Electoral system ===\nThe electoral system that was used under 1955 system is known as the [[Single non-transferable vote|Single Nontransferable Vote]] (SNTV). Under SNTV, each constituency has multiple seats to be filled. Voters instead of voting for parties, votes for individual candidates, and seats of the constituency go to whoever wins the most votes. One problem of such electoral system is that the fair allocation of seats to different parties are not taken into consideration: Since the winners of most votes eventually get the seats, candidates of one party can take all the seats of one constituency.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nUnder such electoral system, LDP with its massive political donation put other opposition parties into disadvantage. Due to LDP\u2019s ties with big companies, the party directed the financial resources to individual candidates and enabled them to promise patronage to their voters, with a focus on the agricultural population, while the reallocation of Diet seats did not keep up with the migration from rural to urban area due to industrialization. Aside from the pork-barrel spending, the LDP candidates also cultivated personalism through [[Koenkai]] ''(\u5f8c\u63f4\u4f1a)'' in their own constituency. Politicians went to the locals\u2019 wedding, funeral, birthday parties and so on. In such occasions, politicians often brought considerable amount of cash gift. Candidates would even organize activities such as hot springs for their supporters.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn the account of its self-assertiveness, LDP unilaterally altered the rules for campaigning. Profiting of its constituted koenkai canvas, the competition rules were toughened for the Opposition. The formal campaign periods were short (and shortened further over time), television and radio advertising being prohibited and low limits placed on posters and handbills. Through the campaign, however, each candidate was granted two five-minute slots on television when a stream of candidates would line up and take turns in front of a stationary microphone to run through their list of promises right after which the next candidate would take other. Such rules of play were discouraging and difficult for a would-be challenger while LDP benefitted from the unfair restraints of participation by the sheer amount of runners.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Japanese party system : from one-party rule to coalition government|last=1945-|first=Hrebenar, Ronald J.|date=1986|publisher=Westview Press|others=Berton, Peter, 1922-2014.|isbn=978-0813303468|location=Boulder, Colo.|oclc=13455801}}</ref>\n\nAnother neglected flaw of the electoral system which bolstered LDP's dominance was the urgent need for redistricting in the wake of the post-war rapid population shifts from the rural to urban areas. The swelling urban populations were much trickier for LDP politicians to fit within the distributed koenkai grassroot structure as they were more peripatetic and atomized than the traditional rural household. These voters had new policy demands (ex. issues related to [[Environmental issues in Japan#Environment deterioration in the 1960s|environmental deterioration in the 1960s]]) which conflicted with the ones practiced by LDP for their industry and big-business support. Under the obsolete district constituencies, the farmers retained disproportionate political influence which as a consequence of pork-barrel desires rather than by concern over issues of broad social policy, stagnated democratic alternation.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite book|title=Japan transformed : political change and economic restructuring|last=McCall.|first=Rosenbluth, Frances |author-link=Frances McCall Rosenbluth|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|others=Thies, Michael F.|isbn=9780691135915|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=428926469}}</ref>\n\nUnder the current electoral rules, LDP was motivated to develop loyal personal support for the farmer's voter group. Being a nationally organized group of voters and united around the single issue of agricultural protectionism, the party could tune higher import tariffs and subsidies to support the less productive small businesses which because of their large numbers, could turn out at elections and vote in predictable ways.\n\n=== Bureaucratization of policymaking ===\nSince the institution of the 1955 system, the legislative independence has been declining in the face of a growth in the combined legislative power of the bureaucracy and the ruling conservative party. Indicators that point to this are the success rates of governmental and individual member bills; the declining rate of amendments added; and the singular lack of success for opposition-sponsored bills. For example, the mere submission of nongovernmentally sponsored measures is extremely difficult. In the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|Lower House]], at least 20 representatives must support a \"member\" bill before it can be introduced, while in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|Upper House]] ten supporters are required. Moreover, should the bill require the expenditure of state funds, fifty and twenty supporters respectively are necessary.\n\nThe chance for success of bureaucratic bills that was only 1.3 times greater than that for individual Diet-generated bills under the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation]] and about twice as great from 1952 to 1955, it augmented to 7 times greater by 1974, when approximately 90% of all successful legislation has been cabinet-sponsored.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite journal|last=Pempel|first=T.

From 1955 to 1960 just over one-third of all successful government legislation went through one or another of these processes. In the 48th Diet (1964-1965) this rate was 17% and in the 63rd Diet (1970) it was 15%. Finally, opposition bills had no chance of success: of 317 opposition bills introduced from the 37th (1960) through the 46th (1963-1964) Diets, not one became law.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Misawa|first=Shigeo|date=1967-05-30|journal=The Annuals of Japanese Political Science Association|volume=18|pages=5\u201333, 2|doi=10.7218/nenpouseijigaku1953.18.0_5|issn=0549-4192|title=Outline of Policy-Decision Making Process Since 1955|doi-access=free}}</ref> These numbers attest that by the time bills materialize in the Diet a general agreement has already been reached, both within and between the bureaucracy and the LDP. In such an environment, opposition and the generation of successful alternatives from within the Diet itself has become extremely difficult.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nBesides, the bureaucracy wields considerable and increasing power through the use of nonlegislative devices such a subordinances and communications, and through its varying degrees of dominance over technical and nonpartisan advisory groups.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\n=== Policy decision-making ===\nThe [[Policy Affairs Research Council]] (\u653f\u52d9\u8abf\u67fb\u4f1a ''seimu ch\u014dsakai'') or \"PARC\" was the major policymaking body within the LDP. Its members were the LDP representatives in both legislative houses, and it was the basic forum in which the party discussed and negotiated government policy. The policymaking under this system did not comply with the usual model of a parliamentary cabinet government which involves strong cabinet leadership and coordination. Instead, representatives who were not in the cabinet were often the other pivot of policy through their formal roles PARC. In consultation with bureaucrats and interest groups, the council already had input into policy before the cabinet and prime minister or upper party executives could shape it further. At its height in the mid-1980s, PARC had as many as seventeen divisions.\n\n==== Industrial policy ====\nJapan's industrial policy under the 1955 system was undergirded by a political logic that supports firms and whole industries that would not have been sustainable in a less-regulated economy, imposed high prices and taxes, limited choice in the marketplace, and rigid career paths.<ref name=\":32\" /> In spite of the fact that Japan came out of war with a theoretical comparative advantage towards light manufacturing which would match its profile of low-capital, abundant-labor economy, the war skewed its economic profile toward heavy industries. The large war companies lobbied for a development strategy favoring heavy industry and received subsidies and regulatory favoritism. In exchange, LDP members were awarded with campaign contributions to be able to stay electorally competitive against each other in the multi-member districts.\n\nThe Heavy Industries Bureau of the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] assisted the heavy industries with policies such as:\n\n* Limiting entry and often regulating the market pricing to help stabilize profits.\n* Privileging access to cheap loans from the Japan Development Bank\n* Domestic government budget subsidies and tax breaks as well as favored access to foreign exchange and tariff protections.\n\nSuch strategy of developmental policy which has strong state involvement in developmental orientation is typical of late industrialing countries and in terms of [[international political economy]], follows the model of the [[developmental state]]. Explicit implication implies a degree of corruption, which during [[Kakuei Tanaka]]'s office in 1971-1972 resulted in media noticing corruption which, in one instance, resulted in the [[Kakuei Tanaka#Lockheed scandal and aftermath|Lockheed scandal]].\n\n== The fall of the system ==\n\n=== Global Pressure and the Collapse of Bubble Economy ===\nAs a corollary of the [[Plaza Accord|Plaza Accord of 1985]] when Japan agreed to allow substantial appreciation of the yen, the Japanese government reduced the interests marginally above the rate of inflation as a domestic relief strategy. This resulted in banks and corporations going on an enormous spending spree with nearly free money, bidding up the price of real estate and other assets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unwanted company : foreign investment in American industries|last=1965-|first=Crystal, Jonathan|isbn=9781501723612|location=Ithaca|oclc=1042219263}}</ref>\n\nAgainst the faith of many people that Japan would come to dominate the world economy, the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] led to a bubble crash after the raising of interest rates of the [[Bank of Japan]] in 1990 and firms together with their jobs were in mortal danger. In this context and on the background of LDP's short-term relieved pressure from the already shaky electoral coalition between exporters and the non-traded sectors, the voting public expressed disenchantment toward the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nThe new electoral system following the [[1994 Japanese electoral reform|1994 Electoral reform]] which was claimed to reduce corruption and high elections costs, promote more policy debates, and encourage a two-party system. As a consequence of this reform as well as the change of voter behavior and the change of the international environment, the system collapsed completely following the [[2005 Japanese general election|2005]] and [[2009 Japanese general election|2009]] general elections which demonstrated significant shifts in both the foundations of party support and the importance of national swings in support for one party or another. Since 2005, urban-rural differences in the foundations of the leading parties have changed dramatically, and Japan has moved from a system dominated by locally based, individual candidacies toward a two-party system in which both party popularity and personal characteristics influence electoral success or failure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thies|first=Michael F.|last2=Scheiner|first2=Ethan|last3=Reed|first3=Steven R.|date=2012-07-14|title=The End of LDP Dominance and the Rise of Party-Oriented Politics in Japan|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=38|issue=2|pages=353\u2013376|doi=10.1353/jjs.2012.0037|issn=1549-4721}}</ref>\n\nThe specialist on theoretical knowledge of legislative institutions and electoral systems, Michael Thies, argues that majoritarian institutions of the Anglo-American variety would have pushed politics toward broader coalitions, reducing the premiums captured by organized groups with extreme preferences, and appealing more to the interests of unorganized, diverse voters.

On October 20, 1954, anti-Yoshida conservatives formed a coalition party: the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1954)|Japan Democratic Party]] ''(\u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u4e3b\u515a)''. The Japan Democratic Party along with the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan tabled a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence motion]] against the cabinet on December 6 and won the majority. As a result, Yoshida Cabinet resigned on December 7 after six years of rule.\n\n== Establishment of the 1955 System ==\n\n=== Merger of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) ===\nWithin the Socialist party, ideological conflicts had long been a problem. The leftists in the party adopted a Marx-Lenin ideology as China, while the rightists leaned towards a socialist welfare nation under a capitalist system. The San Francisco Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan signed in 1951 triggered the final split. The right socialists agreed on the San Francisco Peace Treaty but were against the Security Treaty, due to their constitutionalist stance, while the left socialists were against both treaties due to their exclusion of Soviet Union.<ref name=\":02\" /> On October 23, 1951, the old Socialist Party officially split into the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u5de6\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)'' and the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan]] ''(\u53f3\u6d3e\u793e\u4f1a\u515a)''.\n\nAfter the split, however, the socialists soon realized the necessity of merging into one party to fight against the anti-communist approach taken by the GHQ and the conservatives, which is commonly referred to as the [[Reverse Course|reverse course]] ''(\u9006\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9)''. After the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, influential members from the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan came back from the purge and boosted the power of the rightists. The Leftist Socialist Party of Japan also expanded its power with the support of the [[General Council of Trade Unions of Japan]], also known as ''Sohyo(\u65e5\u672c\u52b4\u50cd\u7d44\u5408\u7dcf\u8a55\u8b70\u4f1a)''. Meanwhile, the conservatives were suffering criticisms from the public for the corruption scandals and Security Treaty. Sensing the possibility of success, despite their ideological differences, to take power from the political right and fight against the anti-communist movement, the socialists decided to reunite and formed the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) on October 13, 1955.<ref name=\":62\" />\n[[File:Japanese_General_election,_1955_en.svg|left|thumb|257x257px|Before the merger: House of Representative Seat Distribution in 1955]]\nOne crucial external factor that caused the merger of JSD is ''Sohyo''. ''Sohyo'', the abbreviation of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, was a trade confederation in Japan which was established on July 11, 1950, soon after the start of the Korean War. It incorporated about 48% of organized workers in Japan. Initially, ''Sohyo''was the unified body of anti-communist unions, but it soon changed from a centralist stance to a left stance due to the remilitarization tendency of Japan shown in the Korean War.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Incorporating Japanese labor into the Free World: Cold War diplomacy and economic interdependence, 1949\u20131964|journal = Labor History|volume = 49|issue = 2|pages = 199\u2013222|last=Nakakita|first=Koji|date=2008|doi=10.1080/00236560801950972}}</ref> Due to the rationalization strategy taken by the conservative government, Japanese workers, particular those worked in small and median-sized factories were facing slow wage increase and even dismissals.

Meanwhile, the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan was able to win 17 more seats. The expansion of Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the soon formation of the leftists and rightists in the socialist camp into JSP became a more substantial threat for the conservatives. As a result, also in 1955, the Japan Democratic Party and the Japan Liberal Party merged as Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP).<ref name=\":82\" />\n\nThe expansion of the socialist power also worried the ''Zaikai''(business community). ''Zaikai'' had incentives to secure a conservative government since it would pump money into the big companies to keep their competitiveness, stay in a close relationship with the U.S. to maintain a liberal trade policy, and deal with the intensified anti-rationalization labor movement. Therefore, to counter the socialist power, the ''Zaikai'' pressured the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party to merge.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite journal|last=Masumi|first=Junnosuke|date=1988|title=The 1955 System in Japan and Its Subsequent Development|journal=Asian Survey|volume=28|issue=3|pages=286\u2013306|doi=10.1525/as.1988.28.3.01p0146p|issn=0004-4687|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/ucpas/28/3/286.full.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Outcome of the merger: 1955 System ===\nAfter the formation of the two major parties, JSP and LDP, a [[1958 Japanese general election|general election]] was held in 1958. Although the Socialist Party was gaining more power at the time, the conservative Liberal Party and Democratic Party had more voters from the beginning, not to mention after the merge of the two. As a result, the LDP won almost as twice as many seats as JSP. The 1955 system, also known as \u201cone and a half system\u201d, was established, in which LDP always as the dominant party and JSP never able to be a strong enough alternative.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|title=The politics of electoral systems|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Gallagher, Michael, 1951-, Mitchell, Paul, 1964-|isbn=9780191531514|location=Oxford|oclc=68623713}}</ref>\n\n1955 system essentially was the symbol of the two parties\u2019 confrontation over two major issues: the [[Constitution of Japan|1946 constitution]] and the security treaty.<ref name=\":92\" /> During the occupation years, Minister Matsumoto Joji ''(\u677e\u672c\u70dd\u6cbb)'' drafted the 1946 constitution under the demand of General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. Unsatisfied with the draft, the draft was later then revised by the SCAP. Therefore, the 1946 constitution was more of American authorship and the banner for SCAP\u2019s goal of democratization of Japan. The conservative parties had the consideration of constitution revision since its enactment. Although varying in extent, the revision of [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|Article 9]] to permit a rearmament program had been widely argued with the conservative parties since the Yoshida cabinet. At the same time, the socialist parties opposed any revision of the constitution.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Robert E.|date=1956|title=The Constitution and Current Japanese Politics|journal=Far Eastern Survey|volume=25|issue=4|pages=49\u201358|doi=10.2307/3023907|issn=0362-8949|jstor=3023907}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue was the security Treaty signed in 1951, a product of the late occupation years. Different from the 1946 constitution which aims at wiping out the [[Japanese militarism|militarism in Japan]], the Security Treaty was the consequence of U.S. securing its military strength in Asia to counter the communist threat in the [[Cold War]]. JSP strongly opposed the Security Treaty due to the underlying possibility of further rearmament and even revival militarism in Japan, while LDP argued that the presence of the U.S. army in Japan was merely for self-defense.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Protest in tokyo - the security treaty crisis of 1960.|last=R.|first=Packard, George|year=|isbn=9780691650746|location=|pages=3\u201322|oclc=1023228016}}</ref>\n\n== LDP dominance in the 1955 system ==\n\n=== Electoral system ===\nThe electoral system that was used under 1955 system is known as the [[Single non-transferable vote|Single Nontransferable Vote]] (SNTV). Under SNTV, each constituency has multiple seats to be filled. Voters instead of voting for parties, votes for individual candidates, and seats of the constituency go to whoever wins the most votes. One problem of such electoral system is that the fair allocation of seats to different parties are not taken into consideration: Since the winners of most votes eventually get the seats, candidates of one party can take all the seats of one constituency.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nUnder such electoral system, LDP with its massive political donation put other opposition parties into disadvantage. Due to LDP\u2019s ties with big companies, the party directed the financial resources to individual candidates and enabled them to promise patronage to their voters, with a focus on the agricultural population, while the reallocation of Diet seats did not keep up with the migration from rural to urban area due to industrialization. Aside from the pork-barrel spending, the LDP candidates also cultivated personalism through [[Koenkai]] ''(\u5f8c\u63f4\u4f1a)'' in their own constituency. Politicians went to the locals\u2019 wedding, funeral, birthday parties and so on. In such occasions, politicians often brought considerable amount of cash gift. Candidates would even organize activities such as hot springs for their supporters.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nOn the account of its self-assertiveness, LDP unilaterally altered the rules for campaigning. Profiting of its constituted koenkai canvas, the competition rules were toughened for the Opposition. The formal campaign periods were short (and shortened further over time), television and radio advertising being prohibited and low limits placed on posters and handbills. Through the campaign, however, each candidate was granted two five-minute slots on television when a stream of candidates would line up and take turns in front of a stationary microphone to run through their list of promises right after which the next candidate would take other. Such rules of play were discouraging and difficult for a would-be challenger while LDP benefitted from the unfair restraints of participation by the sheer amount of runners.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Japanese party system : from one-party rule to coalition government|last=1945-|first=Hrebenar, Ronald J.|date=1986|publisher=Westview Press|others=Berton, Peter, 1922-2014.|isbn=978-0813303468|location=Boulder, Colo.|oclc=13455801}}</ref>\n\nAnother neglected flaw of the electoral system which bolstered LDP's dominance was the urgent need for redistricting in the wake of the post-war rapid population shifts from the rural to urban areas. The swelling urban populations were much trickier for LDP politicians to fit within the distributed koenkai grassroot structure as they were more peripatetic and atomized than the traditional rural household. These voters had new policy demands (ex. issues related to [[Environmental issues in Japan#Environment deterioration in the 1960s|environmental deterioration in the 1960s]]) which conflicted with the ones practiced by LDP for their industry and big-business support. Under the obsolete district constituencies, the farmers retained disproportionate political influence which as a consequence of pork-barrel desires rather than by concern over issues of broad social policy, stagnated democratic alternation.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite book|title=Japan transformed : political change and economic restructuring|last=McCall.|first=Rosenbluth, Frances |author-link=Frances McCall Rosenbluth|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|others=Thies, Michael F.|isbn=9780691135915|location=Princeton, N.J.|oclc=428926469}}</ref>\n\nUnder the current electoral rules, LDP was motivated to develop loyal personal support for the farmer's voter group. Being a nationally organized group of voters and united around the single issue of agricultural protectionism, the party could tune higher import tariffs and subsidies to support the less productive small businesses which because of their large numbers, could turn out at elections and vote in predictable ways.\n\n=== Bureaucratization of policymaking ===\nSince the institution of the 1955 system, the legislative independence has been declining in the face of a growth in the combined legislative power of the bureaucracy and the ruling conservative party. Indicators that point to this are the success rates of governmental and individual member bills; the declining rate of amendments added; and the singular lack of success for opposition-sponsored bills. For example, the mere submission of nongovernmentally sponsored measures is extremely difficult. In the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|Lower House]], at least 20 representatives must support a \"member\" bill before it can be introduced, while in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|Upper House]] ten supporters are required. Moreover, should the bill require the expenditure of state funds, fifty and twenty supporters respectively are necessary.\n\nThe chance for success of bureaucratic bills that was only 1.3 times greater than that for individual Diet-generated bills under the [[Occupation of Japan|Occupation]] and about twice as great from 1952 to 1955, it augmented to 7 times greater by 1974, when approximately 90% of all successful legislation has been cabinet-sponsored.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite journal|last=Pempel|first=T. J.|date=November 1974|title=The Bureaucratization of Policymaking in Postwar Japan|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=18|issue=4|pages=647\u2013664|doi=10.2307/2110551|issn=0092-5853|jstor=2110551}}</ref> In addition, the Diet has not been notably active as a potential amender for which there are two devices open: it can either \"amend\" (''shusei''), or it can \"add supplementary resolution of clarification\" (''futai ketsugi''). From 1955 to 1960 just over one-third of all successful government legislation went through one or another of these processes. In the 48th Diet (1964-1965) this rate was 17% and in the 63rd Diet (1970) it was 15%. Finally, opposition bills had no chance of success: of 317 opposition bills introduced from the 37th (1960) through the 46th (1963-1964) Diets, not one became law.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Misawa|first=Shigeo|date=1967-05-30|journal=The Annuals of Japanese Political Science Association|volume=18|pages=5\u201333, 2|doi=10.7218/nenpouseijigaku1953.18.0_5|issn=0549-4192|title=Outline of Policy-Decision Making Process Since 1955|doi-access=free}}</ref> These numbers attest that by the time bills materialize in the Diet a general agreement has already been reached, both within and between the bureaucracy and the LDP. In such an environment, opposition and the generation of successful alternatives from within the Diet itself has become extremely difficult.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\nBesides, the bureaucracy wields considerable and increasing power through the use of nonlegislative devices such a subordinances and communications, and through its varying degrees of dominance over technical and nonpartisan advisory groups.<ref name=\":102\" />\n\n=== Policy decision-making ===\nThe [[Policy Affairs Research Council]] (\u653f\u52d9\u8abf\u67fb\u4f1a ''seimu ch\u014dsakai'') or \"PARC\" was the major policymaking body within the LDP. Its members were the LDP representatives in both legislative houses, and it was the basic forum in which the party discussed and negotiated government policy. The policymaking under this system did not comply with the usual model of a parliamentary cabinet government which involves strong cabinet leadership and coordination. Instead, representatives who were not in the cabinet were often the other pivot of policy through their formal roles PARC. In consultation with bureaucrats and interest groups, the council already had input into policy before the cabinet and prime minister or upper party executives could shape it further. At its height in the mid-1980s, PARC had as many as seventeen divisions.\n\n==== Industrial policy ====\nJapan's industrial policy under the 1955 system was undergirded by a political logic that supports firms and whole industries that would not have been sustainable in a less-regulated economy, imposed high prices and taxes, limited choice in the marketplace, and rigid career paths.<ref name=\":32\" /> In spite of the fact that Japan came out of war with a theoretical comparative advantage towards light manufacturing which would match its profile of low-capital, abundant-labor economy, the war skewed its economic profile toward heavy industries. The large war companies lobbied for a development strategy favoring heavy industry and received subsidies and regulatory favoritism. In exchange, LDP members were awarded with campaign contributions to be able to stay electorally competitive against each other in the multi-member districts.\n\nThe Heavy Industries Bureau of the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] assisted the heavy industries with policies such as:\n\n* Limiting entry and often regulating the market pricing to help stabilize profits.\n* Privileging access to cheap loans from the Japan Development Bank\n* Domestic government budget subsidies and tax breaks as well as favored access to foreign exchange and tariff protections.\n\nSuch strategy of developmental policy which has strong state involvement in developmental orientation is typical of late industrialing countries and in terms of [[international political economy]], follows the model of the [[developmental state]]. Explicit implication implies a degree of corruption, which during [[Kakuei Tanaka]]'s office in 1971-1972 resulted in media noticing corruption which, in one instance, resulted in the [[Kakuei Tanaka#Lockheed scandal and aftermath|Lockheed scandal]].\n\n== The fall of the system ==\n\n=== Global Pressure and the Collapse of Bubble Economy ===\nAs a corollary of the [[Plaza Accord|Plaza Accord of 1985]] when Japan agreed to allow substantial appreciation of the yen, the Japanese government reduced the interests marginally above the rate of inflation as a domestic relief strategy. This resulted in banks and corporations going on an enormous spending spree with nearly free money, bidding up the price of real estate and other assets.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Unwanted company : foreign investment in American industries|last=1965-|first=Crystal, Jonathan|isbn=9781501723612|location=Ithaca|oclc=1042219263}}</ref>\n\nAgainst the faith of many people that Japan would come to dominate the world economy, the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] led to a bubble crash after the raising of interest rates of the [[Bank of Japan]] in 1990 and firms together with their jobs were in mortal danger. In this context and on the background of LDP's short-term relieved pressure from the already shaky electoral coalition between exporters and the non-traded sectors, the voting public expressed disenchantment toward the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.\n\nThe new electoral system following the [[1994 Japanese electoral reform|1994 Electoral reform]] which was claimed to reduce corruption and high elections costs, promote more policy debates, and encourage a two-party system. As a consequence of this reform as well as the change of voter behavior and the change of the international environment, the system collapsed completely following the [[2005 Japanese general election|2005]] and [[2009 Japanese general election|2009]] general elections which demonstrated significant shifts in both the foundations of party support and the importance of national swings in support for one party or another. Since 2005, urban-rural differences in the foundations of the leading parties have changed dramatically, and Japan has moved from a system dominated by locally based, individual candidacies toward a two-party system in which both party popularity and personal characteristics influence electoral success or failure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thies|first=Michael F.|last2=Scheiner|first2=Ethan|last3=Reed|first3=Steven R.|date=2012-07-14|title=The End of LDP Dominance and the Rise of Party-Oriented Politics in Japan|journal=The Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=38|issue=2|pages=353\u2013376|doi=10.1353/jjs.2012.0037|issn=1549-4721}}</ref>\n\nThe specialist on theoretical knowledge of legislative institutions and electoral systems, Michael Thies, argues that majoritarian institutions of the Anglo-American variety would have pushed politics toward broader coalitions, reducing the premiums captured by organized groups with extreme preferences, and appealing more to the interests of unorganized, diverse voters.

When the western section of the bypass was built to the Delaware River, the whole former segment was renamed Route&nbsp;179. The section of the new US&nbsp;202 freeway section ends once it begins to run concurrently with [[New Jersey Route 31|Route&nbsp;31]] in [[East Amwell Township, New Jersey|East Amwell Township]]. The concurrency runs for five miles (8&nbsp;km), to [[Flemington, New Jersey|Flemington]].  This stretch, and the 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) between Flemington and [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], is a four-lane divided roadway.\n\n[[Image:US202NYNJborder.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;202 just inside New Jersey at the NY/NJ state line]]\nAt Somerville, the road merges with [[U.S. Route 206|US&nbsp;206]] at a now-reconfigured [[Somerville Circle]].  Parts of the old [[traffic circle]], which also carries [[New Jersey Route 28|Route&nbsp;28]], remain below the US&nbsp;202 [[Overpass|flyover]].  US&nbsp;202 splits northeastward from US&nbsp;206 at [[Bedminster Township, New Jersey|Bedminster Township]] and again becomes a two-lane road.\n\nFrom here to the state line, US&nbsp;202 parallels, and has largely been supplanted by, [[Interstate 287|I-287]], which during its construction dumped traffic onto US&nbsp;202. US&nbsp;202 continues through [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] to [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]] with an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 53|Route&nbsp;53]]. With a few exceptions, US&nbsp;202 is maintained by counties rather than the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] north of Route&nbsp;53.\n\nThe following sections are state-maintained:\n*At the [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] interchange\n*At the [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]] intersection\n*Along the [[New Jersey Route 23|Route&nbsp;23]] concurrency\n*At the [[Interstate 287|I-287]] interchange in [[Oakland, New Jersey|Oakland]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues past [[Boonton, New Jersey|Boonton]] along the [[Boonton Turnpike]] to historic Mountain View in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], where it then picks up Route&nbsp;23 for about two miles (3&nbsp;km) and then exits on Black Oak Ridge Road.  It then follows the [[Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike]], Terhune Drive on the east side of Pompton Lake (past the former homes of Cecille B. DeMille and Albert Payson Terhune), and Ramapo Valley Road (more or less paralleling the Ramapo River through Oakland) to [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] before crossing the New York state line on the [[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]].\n\n[[Image:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|250px|thumb|View of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]]]\n\n===New York===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Putnam County, New York]] -->\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in New York}}\nUS&nbsp;202 is mostly designated east\u2013west in New York, owing to its greater coverage in those directions.\n\n[[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]] becomes Orange Avenue in [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], and US&nbsp;202 continues to a block-long [[wrong-way concurrency]] with [[New York State Route 59|NY 59]] before tailing off on Wayne Avenue and heading east toward [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]].  Most of this stretch is two-lane road.\n\nAt Haverstraw, US&nbsp;202 turns north along [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] to [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]] and then crosses the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]], running concurrently with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]], the Grand Army Of The Republic Highway. The two wind around [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]], briefly forming New York's only three-way concurrency of U.S. highways with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] at [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]]. Afterwards, the two separate for several miles, with US&nbsp;202 taking the more southerly route through [[Somers, New York|Somers]]. The highways reunite at [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]] and become a four-lane road for their last few miles before the state line, taking in [[New York State Route 121|NY 121]] in the process.<ref>{{cite book| title=New York State Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1993 |isbn=0-89933-230-7 |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Connecticut===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in Connecticut}}\nAt [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], US&nbsp;6 and 202 climb up onto [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]], which had just been joined by the north\u2013south [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;7]], making a four-way concurrency.  US 7 and 202 split from I-84 and US&nbsp;6 at Exit 7. It is a two-lane road in southern [[Brookfield, Connecticut|Brookfield]] as it follows Federal Road. US 202 diverts from U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;7 at the next exit to a parallel surface route. The US&nbsp;7 freeway continues for another {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} before it rejoins US&nbsp;202 at the Brookfield/New Milford town line. The now rejoined US&nbsp;7 and 202 approach [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]] in bucolic [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]], where they once again split.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues through [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]] and on to [[Cherry Brook, Connecticut|Cherry Brook]], where it then runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 44 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;44]] for several miles before turning northward at [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]].  For the run to the state line, US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]].\n\n===Massachusetts===\nUnlike elsewhere in New England, US&nbsp;202 is posted as a north\u2013south highway in Massachusetts, as the highway runs mostly in those directions for its length through the state.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 and [[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] enter the Bay State at the \"[[Congamond, Massachusetts|Congamond]] Notch\" in [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick]], a southward jog in the state line that includes [[Congamond Lake]]. North of [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]], US&nbsp;202 turns eastward toward [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], crosses the [[Joseph E. Muller Bridge]] and South Hadley Falls Interchange, traversing [[Massachusetts Route 116|MA 116]] and [[Massachusetts Route 33|MA 33]] toward [[Belchertown, Massachusetts|Belchertown]].  After crossing [[Massachusetts Route 9|MA 9]], it then heads north along the west side of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] through [[New Salem, Massachusetts|New Salem]] toward [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]].  This section of US&nbsp;202 has been dubbed the [[Daniel Shays]] Highway, named for a Revolutionary War veteran who [[Shays' Rebellion|led an insurrection]] against the state government of Massachusetts. US&nbsp;202 meets [[Massachusetts Route 2]] at [[Orange, Massachusetts|Orange]], and runs along the [[two-lane freeway]] to [[Phillipston, Massachusetts|Phillipston]].  There, it diverges to the north again as a two-lane road.\n\nIn Massachusetts, US&nbsp;202 passes through the municipalities of [[Southwick, MA|Southwick]], [[Westfield, MA|Westfield]], [[Holyoke, MA|Holyoke]], [[South Hadley, MA|South Hadley]], [[Granby, MA|Granby]], [[Belchertown, MA|Belchertown]], [[Pelham, MA|Pelham]], [[Shutesbury, MA|Shutesbury]], [[New Salem, MA|New Salem]], [[Orange, MA|Orange]], [[Athol, MA|Athol]], [[Phillipston, MA|Phillipston]], [[Templeton, MA|Templeton]], and [[Winchendon, MA|Winchendon]].\n\nThe stretch of highway through Belchertown, Pelham, Shutesbury, and New Salem opened in 1935 to coincide with the completion and opening of the Quabbin Reservoir. The roadway reaches its closest point to the reservoir itself at the crossing of the Swift River, at the Shutesbury/New Salem town line. Access to the west side of the Quabbin Reservation is made through multiple gates in the three towns. There is no public access, however, to the Prescott Peninsula.\n\n===New Hampshire=== \n[[File:Centerline Rumble Strip.jpg|thumb|Section of US 202 in Henniker, NH]]\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in New Hampshire. It remains a two-lane highway for most of its length in the Granite State.\n\nIt heads north, through [[Rindge, New Hampshire|Rindge]], [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire|Jaffrey]], and [[Peterborough, New Hampshire|Peterborough]], to [[Hillsborough, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]], where it turns eastward along a concurrency with [[New Hampshire Route 9]]. The span of the road between Hillsborough and [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire|Hopkinton]], which passes through [[Henniker, New Hampshire|Henniker]], is among the most deadly sections of roadway in the state.<ref>[http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050605/REPOSITORY/506050432/1031 \"Crash takes two lives\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214230/http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050605%2FREPOSITORY%2F506050432%2F1031 |date=September 27, 2007 }}. ''[[Concord Monitor]]''. June 2005. Accessed July 10, 2008.</ref> At [[Concord, New Hampshire]], the state capital, US&nbsp;202 heads north and picks up a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 3|US&nbsp;3]] for a short time, and then turns eastward again along [[Interstate 393]], a freeway spur that also carries [[U.S. Route 4|US&nbsp;4]].  The freeway ends short of [[Chichester, New Hampshire|Chichester]], and NH 9 rejoins the two-lane concurrency along with US&nbsp;4 and 202.\n\nAt [[Northwood, New Hampshire|Northwood]], US&nbsp;202 and NH 9 leave US&nbsp;4.  NH 9 splits off a few miles later, leaving US&nbsp;202 to continue alone toward [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]], where the road jumps up onto the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] ([[New Hampshire Route 16|NH 16]]) for a short, non-tolled distance.  US&nbsp;202 leaves the turnpike two miles (3&nbsp;km) before the state line at [[East Rochester, New Hampshire|East Rochester]].\n\n===Maine===\n[[Image:NewEnglandConnectingFarm.png|thumb|[[Connected farm]] in [[Windham, Maine]], typical of older residences adjacent to Route 202 through rural [[New England]].]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in Maine.\n\nThe highway enters the state by crossing the [[Salmon Falls River]] at [[Lebanon, Maine|South Lebanon]] and bridges the [[Mousam River]] in [[Sanford, Maine|Sanford]]. The highway then passes through [[Alfred, Maine|Alfred]], [[Waterboro, Maine|Waterboro]] and [[Hollis, Maine|Hollis]] before crossing the [[Saco River]] at [[Buxton, Maine|Salmon Falls]]. The highway passes through [[Gorham, Maine|Gorham]] and crosses the [[Presumpscot River]] into [[South Windham, Maine|South Windham]]. There is a rotary with [[U.S. Route 302]] at [[Windham, Maine|Foster's Corner]] and an interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Maine|I-95]] at [[Gray, Maine|Gray]]. The highway parallels I-95 through [[New Gloucester, Maine|New Gloucester]] to [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]] and crosses the [[Androscoggin River]] into [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], passing near the campus of [[Bates College]].<ref name=\"maine\">{{cite book| title=The Maine Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1988 |isbn=0-89933-035-5 |pages=}}</ref> A very short stretch through the latter two cities is four-lane highway, but most of its length in the Pine Tree State consists of two-lane road. Its final miles west of [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], including the short overlay on I-395, and concurrency with US&nbsp;1A also include four-laned segments.\n\nThe highway passes through [[Greene, Maine|Greene]], [[Monmouth, Maine|Monmouth]], and [[Winthrop, Maine|Winthrop]] concurrently with [[State Route 11 (Maine)|Maine Route 11]] and [[State Route 100 (Maine)|Maine Route 100]], and becomes concurrent with [[State Route 17 (Maine)|State Route 17]] at [[Manchester, Maine|Manchester]]. US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 201]] as it crosses the [[Kennebec River]] at [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]], and shortly thereafter it picks up [[State Route 3 (Maine)|State Route 3]] and [[State Route 9 (Maine)|State Route 9]].  Maine 3 splits off at [[South China, Maine|South China]], but Maine 9 stays with US&nbsp;202 through [[Albion, Maine|Albion]], [[Unity, Maine|Unity]], [[Troy, Maine|Troy]], [[Dixmont, Maine|Dixmont]], [[Newburgh, Maine|Newburgh]], and [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]] almost all the way to its terminus in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]].<ref name=\"maine\"/> When Maine 9 turns right onto Summer Street in Bangor with US&nbsp;1A, US&nbsp;202 runs four more blocks to its eastern (or northern) terminus at the US&nbsp;2 intersection at the corner of Hammond, Main, Central and State Streets.\n\n==History==\n{{infobox road small\n|country=USA\n|type=US 1926\n|route=122\n|location=[[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington, DE]]\u2013[[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw, NY]]\n|length_mi=\n|length_ref=\n|length_round=\n|formed=1926\n|deleted=1934\n}}\n'''U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;122''' was created in 1926, connecting [[US 22 (NJ)|US&nbsp;22]] at [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey]], with [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

In 1964, AASHO approved a request by Delaware to eliminate the portion of US 202 between its intersection with I-295 in [[Farnhurst, Delaware|Farnhurst]] and State Road; that stretch was carrying US 13/40/301. US 202 was later shortened so that it ended at I-95 just north of Wilmington.  Then in 1984, the route numbering committee approved extending US 202 from there to its intersection with US 13/US 40 in [[Basin Corner, Delaware|Basin Corner]], near [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]].

North of West Chester, US&nbsp;322 exits, and US&nbsp;202 continues north as a freeway towards [[Frazer, Pennsylvania|Frazer]], where it interchanges with [[U.S. Route 30]] and bends east to head towards [[Malvern, Pennsylvania|Malvern]] and [[King of Prussia, Pennsylvania|King of Prussia]]. The stretch between Mill Lane in Malvern to King of Prussia was recently widened to three lanes in each direction.  In King of Prussia, the highway forms a large, complicated interchange with the [[Schuylkill Expressway]], the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], and [[U.S. Route 422]].\n\nThe freeway then transitions into a [[divided highway]], passing the [[King of Prussia (mall)|King of Prussia]] mall and heading northeast through commercial areas before splitting into a [[one-way pair]] through the streets of [[Bridgeport, Pennsylvania|Bridgeport]] and [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], crossing the [[Schuylkill River]] in the process.\n\nNorth of Norristown, US&nbsp;202 continues as a two-lane road heading northeast through the Philadelphia suburbs, passing through [[Blue Bell, Pennsylvania|Blue Bell]] and [[Lower Gwynedd Township, Pennsylvania|Lower Gwynedd]], where it becomes a four-lane full-access highway for about two miles (3&nbsp;km).

It continues a northeasterly course for about {{convert|5.7|mi|km}} as a [[freeway]]. This segment of US&nbsp;202 was earlier called the US&nbsp;202 bypass (as it bypassed the [[New Hope, Pennsylvania|New Hope]]-[[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]] area) from its original route. The old section of US&nbsp;202 between New Hope and [[Ringoes, New Jersey]] is now [[New Jersey Route 179|Route&nbsp;179]] which is also [[Old York Road]], the first roadway to connect [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].  In 1953, this section of Old York Road was renumbered US&nbsp;202.  A small section of the US&nbsp;202 bypass was built in 1965 and the old route was renamed Route&nbsp;179.  When the western section of the bypass was built to the Delaware River, the whole former segment was renamed Route&nbsp;179. The section of the new US&nbsp;202 freeway section ends once it begins to run concurrently with [[New Jersey Route 31|Route&nbsp;31]] in [[East Amwell Township, New Jersey|East Amwell Township]]. The concurrency runs for five miles (8&nbsp;km), to [[Flemington, New Jersey|Flemington]].  This stretch, and the 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) between Flemington and [[Somerville, New Jersey|Somerville]], is a four-lane divided roadway.\n\n[[Image:US202NYNJborder.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;202 just inside New Jersey at the NY/NJ state line]]\nAt Somerville, the road merges with [[U.S. Route 206|US&nbsp;206]] at a now-reconfigured [[Somerville Circle]].  Parts of the old [[traffic circle]], which also carries [[New Jersey Route 28|Route&nbsp;28]], remain below the US&nbsp;202 [[Overpass|flyover]].  US&nbsp;202 splits northeastward from US&nbsp;206 at [[Bedminster Township, New Jersey|Bedminster Township]] and again becomes a two-lane road.\n\nFrom here to the state line, US&nbsp;202 parallels, and has largely been supplanted by, [[Interstate 287|I-287]], which during its construction dumped traffic onto US&nbsp;202. US&nbsp;202 continues through [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] to [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]] with an intersection with [[New Jersey Route 53|Route&nbsp;53]]. With a few exceptions, US&nbsp;202 is maintained by counties rather than the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] north of Route&nbsp;53.\n\nThe following sections are state-maintained:\n*At the [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|I-80]] interchange\n*At the [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]] intersection\n*Along the [[New Jersey Route 23|Route&nbsp;23]] concurrency\n*At the [[Interstate 287|I-287]] interchange in [[Oakland, New Jersey|Oakland]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues past [[Boonton, New Jersey|Boonton]] along the [[Boonton Turnpike]] to historic Mountain View in [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]], where it then picks up Route&nbsp;23 for about two miles (3&nbsp;km) and then exits on Black Oak Ridge Road.  It then follows the [[Paterson-Hamburg Turnpike]], Terhune Drive on the east side of Pompton Lake (past the former homes of Cecille B. DeMille and Albert Payson Terhune), and Ramapo Valley Road (more or less paralleling the Ramapo River through Oakland) to [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] before crossing the New York state line on the [[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]].\n\n[[Image:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|250px|thumb|View of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]]]\n\n===New York===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Putnam County, New York]] -->\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in New York}}\nUS&nbsp;202 is mostly designated east\u2013west in New York, owing to its greater coverage in those directions.\n\n[[Franklin Turnpike (New Jersey)|Franklin Turnpike]] becomes Orange Avenue in [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], and US&nbsp;202 continues to a block-long [[wrong-way concurrency]] with [[New York State Route 59|NY 59]] before tailing off on Wayne Avenue and heading east toward [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]].  Most of this stretch is two-lane road.\n\nAt Haverstraw, US&nbsp;202 turns north along [[U.S. Route 9W|US&nbsp;9W]] to [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]] and then crosses the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]], running concurrently with [[U.S. Route 6 in New York|US&nbsp;6]], the Grand Army Of The Republic Highway. The two wind around [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]], briefly forming New York's only three-way concurrency of U.S. highways with [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] at [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]]. Afterwards, the two separate for several miles, with US&nbsp;202 taking the more southerly route through [[Somers, New York|Somers]]. The highways reunite at [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]] and become a four-lane road for their last few miles before the state line, taking in [[New York State Route 121|NY 121]] in the process.<ref>{{cite book| title=New York State Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1993 |isbn=0-89933-230-7 |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Connecticut===\n{{main|U.S. Route 202 in Connecticut}}\nAt [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], US&nbsp;6 and 202 climb up onto [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]], which had just been joined by the north\u2013south [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;7]], making a four-way concurrency.  US 7 and 202 split from I-84 and US&nbsp;6 at Exit 7. It is a two-lane road in southern [[Brookfield, Connecticut|Brookfield]] as it follows Federal Road. US 202 diverts from U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;7 at the next exit to a parallel surface route. The US&nbsp;7 freeway continues for another {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} before it rejoins US&nbsp;202 at the Brookfield/New Milford town line. The now rejoined US&nbsp;7 and 202 approach [[New Milford, Connecticut|New Milford]] in bucolic [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]], where they once again split.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 continues through [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]] and on to [[Cherry Brook, Connecticut|Cherry Brook]], where it then runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 44 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;44]] for several miles before turning northward at [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]].  For the run to the state line, US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]].\n\n===Massachusetts===\nUnlike elsewhere in New England, US&nbsp;202 is posted as a north\u2013south highway in Massachusetts, as the highway runs mostly in those directions for its length through the state.\n\nUS&nbsp;202 and [[Massachusetts Route 10|Route 10]] enter the Bay State at the \"[[Congamond, Massachusetts|Congamond]] Notch\" in [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick]], a southward jog in the state line that includes [[Congamond Lake]]. North of [[Westfield, Massachusetts|Westfield]], US&nbsp;202 turns eastward toward [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], crosses the [[Joseph E. Muller Bridge]] and South Hadley Falls Interchange, traversing [[Massachusetts Route 116|MA 116]] and [[Massachusetts Route 33|MA 33]] toward [[Belchertown, Massachusetts|Belchertown]].  After crossing [[Massachusetts Route 9|MA 9]], it then heads north along the west side of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] through [[New Salem, Massachusetts|New Salem]] toward [[Athol, Massachusetts|Athol]].  This section of US&nbsp;202 has been dubbed the [[Daniel Shays]] Highway, named for a Revolutionary War veteran who [[Shays' Rebellion|led an insurrection]] against the state government of Massachusetts. US&nbsp;202 meets [[Massachusetts Route 2]] at [[Orange, Massachusetts|Orange]], and runs along the [[two-lane freeway]] to [[Phillipston, Massachusetts|Phillipston]].  There, it diverges to the north again as a two-lane road.\n\nIn Massachusetts, US&nbsp;202 passes through the municipalities of [[Southwick, MA|Southwick]], [[Westfield, MA|Westfield]], [[Holyoke, MA|Holyoke]], [[South Hadley, MA|South Hadley]], [[Granby, MA|Granby]], [[Belchertown, MA|Belchertown]], [[Pelham, MA|Pelham]], [[Shutesbury, MA|Shutesbury]], [[New Salem, MA|New Salem]], [[Orange, MA|Orange]], [[Athol, MA|Athol]], [[Phillipston, MA|Phillipston]], [[Templeton, MA|Templeton]], and [[Winchendon, MA|Winchendon]].\n\nThe stretch of highway through Belchertown, Pelham, Shutesbury, and New Salem opened in 1935 to coincide with the completion and opening of the Quabbin Reservoir. The roadway reaches its closest point to the reservoir itself at the crossing of the Swift River, at the Shutesbury/New Salem town line. Access to the west side of the Quabbin Reservation is made through multiple gates in the three towns. There is no public access, however, to the Prescott Peninsula.\n\n===New Hampshire=== \n[[File:Centerline Rumble Strip.jpg|thumb|Section of US 202 in Henniker, NH]]\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in New Hampshire. It remains a two-lane highway for most of its length in the Granite State.\n\nIt heads north, through [[Rindge, New Hampshire|Rindge]], [[Jaffrey, New Hampshire|Jaffrey]], and [[Peterborough, New Hampshire|Peterborough]], to [[Hillsborough, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]], where it turns eastward along a concurrency with [[New Hampshire Route 9]]. The span of the road between Hillsborough and [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire|Hopkinton]], which passes through [[Henniker, New Hampshire|Henniker]], is among the most deadly sections of roadway in the state.<ref>[http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050605/REPOSITORY/506050432/1031 \"Crash takes two lives\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214230/http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050605%2FREPOSITORY%2F506050432%2F1031 |date=September 27, 2007 }}. ''[[Concord Monitor]]''. June 2005. Accessed July 10, 2008.</ref> At [[Concord, New Hampshire]], the state capital, US&nbsp;202 heads north and picks up a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 3|US&nbsp;3]] for a short time, and then turns eastward again along [[Interstate 393]], a freeway spur that also carries [[U.S. Route 4|US&nbsp;4]].  The freeway ends short of [[Chichester, New Hampshire|Chichester]], and NH 9 rejoins the two-lane concurrency along with US&nbsp;4 and 202.\n\nAt [[Northwood, New Hampshire|Northwood]], US&nbsp;202 and NH 9 leave US&nbsp;4.  NH 9 splits off a few miles later, leaving US&nbsp;202 to continue alone toward [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]], where the road jumps up onto the [[Spaulding Turnpike]] ([[New Hampshire Route 16|NH 16]]) for a short, non-tolled distance.  US&nbsp;202 leaves the turnpike two miles (3&nbsp;km) before the state line at [[East Rochester, New Hampshire|East Rochester]].\n\n===Maine===\n[[Image:NewEnglandConnectingFarm.png|thumb|[[Connected farm]] in [[Windham, Maine]], typical of older residences adjacent to Route 202 through rural [[New England]].]]\n\nUS&nbsp;202 is posted as an east\u2013west highway in Maine.\n\nThe highway enters the state by crossing the [[Salmon Falls River]] at [[Lebanon, Maine|South Lebanon]] and bridges the [[Mousam River]] in [[Sanford, Maine|Sanford]]. The highway then passes through [[Alfred, Maine|Alfred]], [[Waterboro, Maine|Waterboro]] and [[Hollis, Maine|Hollis]] before crossing the [[Saco River]] at [[Buxton, Maine|Salmon Falls]]. The highway passes through [[Gorham, Maine|Gorham]] and crosses the [[Presumpscot River]] into [[South Windham, Maine|South Windham]]. There is a rotary with [[U.S. Route 302]] at [[Windham, Maine|Foster's Corner]] and an interchange with [[Interstate 95 in Maine|I-95]] at [[Gray, Maine|Gray]]. The highway parallels I-95 through [[New Gloucester, Maine|New Gloucester]] to [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]] and crosses the [[Androscoggin River]] into [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]], passing near the campus of [[Bates College]].<ref name=\"maine\">{{cite book| title=The Maine Atlas and Gazetteer |author=DeLorme Mapping Company |publisher=DeLorme Mapping Company |year=1988 |isbn=0-89933-035-5 |pages=}}</ref> A very short stretch through the latter two cities is four-lane highway, but most of its length in the Pine Tree State consists of two-lane road. Its final miles west of [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], including the short overlay on I-395, and concurrency with US&nbsp;1A also include four-laned segments.\n\nThe highway passes through [[Greene, Maine|Greene]], [[Monmouth, Maine|Monmouth]], and [[Winthrop, Maine|Winthrop]] concurrently with [[State Route 11 (Maine)|Maine Route 11]] and [[State Route 100 (Maine)|Maine Route 100]], and becomes concurrent with [[State Route 17 (Maine)|State Route 17]] at [[Manchester, Maine|Manchester]]. US&nbsp;202 runs concurrently with [[U.S. Route 201]] as it crosses the [[Kennebec River]] at [[Augusta, Maine|Augusta]], and shortly thereafter it picks up [[State Route 3 (Maine)|State Route 3]] and [[State Route 9 (Maine)|State Route 9]].  Maine 3 splits off at [[South China, Maine|South China]], but Maine 9 stays with US&nbsp;202 through [[Albion, Maine|Albion]], [[Unity, Maine|Unity]], [[Troy, Maine|Troy]], [[Dixmont, Maine|Dixmont]], [[Newburgh, Maine|Newburgh]], and [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]] almost all the way to its terminus in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]].<ref name=\"maine\"/> When Maine 9 turns right onto Summer Street in Bangor with US&nbsp;1A, US&nbsp;202 runs four more blocks to its eastern (or northern) terminus at the US&nbsp;2 intersection at the corner of Hammond, Main, Central and State Streets.\n\n==History==\n{{infobox road small\n|country=USA\n|type=US 1926\n|route=122\n|location=[[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington, DE]]\u2013[[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw, NY]]\n|length_mi=\n|length_ref=\n|length_round=\n|formed=1926\n|deleted=1934\n}}\n'''U.S.&nbsp;Route&nbsp;122''' was created in 1926, connecting [[US 22 (NJ)|US&nbsp;22]] at [[Whitehouse Station, New Jersey]], with [[Wilmington, Delaware]].

In 1964, AASHO approved a request by Delaware to eliminate the portion of US 202 between its intersection with I-295 in [[Farnhurst, Delaware|Farnhurst]] and State Road; that stretch was carrying US 13/40/301. US 202 was later shortened so that it ended at I-95 just north of Wilmington.  Then in 1984, the route numbering committee approved extending US 202 from there to its intersection with US 13/US 40 in [[Basin Corner, Delaware|Basin Corner]], near [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]].

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n==='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)===\n\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nFairbairn thought about, and wrote about the issue of the child's dependency on his mother in each of his four early papers as he was expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper (which will be described in the next section) on the issue of frustration of legitimate dependency needs as one of the causal factors leading to the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n==='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'===\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n==='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ===\n\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.         \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway for dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to become the foundation of the human unconscious and the seeds of adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. Their unmet dependency needs have prevented them from passing through the normal developmental steps, and they are completely unprepared to work for others, tolerate demands placed on them, interact with new people, and participate cooperatively. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                          \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the '''positive impact of a''' '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend.  Fairbairn  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\n==== Resistance to Treatment Based on the Toxicity of the Internalized Bad Objects ====\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' The prior quote on the effects of a good object as a catalyst to de-repression of the internalized toxic memories did not take resistance into account. Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child demands that he/she will have to revisit and re-experience many of the rejecting experiences he/she lived through. This will, in turn,  destroy the illusions that he/she constructed about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his/her  childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70)<ref name=\":2\" />. Thus he equates bad internalized objects with devils, who tempt the individual to follow self-destructive paths. Specifically, trying to force love out of an unloving parent, or conversely, demanding that a rejecting parent learns to appreciate and value them,  are two typical examples of self- destructive attachments.  \n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain '''multiplicity of egos''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily  \"known\" material that the central ego sees and accepts, has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.'''The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates,''' thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. These developmental traumas can go \"unnoticed\" as they need not be dramatic. These traumas (called \"cumulative trauma\") are the daily rebuffs of the child's needs, including is need to be noticed, spoken to, listened to and respected. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world <ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense attachment between the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire. The prior quote by Odgen, has already described the attachment between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object. The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>As already described, '''the attachment between the two split off sub-egos and their respective objects defines the attachment to the bad object'''. Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the inexperienced  therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref>\n\n==== A Structural Analysis of the Effects of Treatment ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper also gave a brief description the impact  of psychotherapy or psychoanalysis on  the patient's interior world. In the following quote, Fairbairn speaks of \"territories\", which is his physical metaphor for the size of the internal structures. He sees the effects of psychotherapy as decreasing the two sub-egos because the central ego develops strength due to its  acceptance of the therapist as a good and reliable object, and it can now tolerate some or most of the painful realities of his/her childhood.<blockquote>I conceive it as one of the chief aims of psychoanalytical therapy to introduce some change into its topography by way of territorial adjustment. Thus I conceive it as among the most important functions of psychoanalytical therapy (a) to reduce the split of the original ego by restoring to the central ego a maximum of the territories ceded to the libidinal ego and the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego), and (b) to bring the exciting object and the rejecting object so far as possible together within the sphere and influence of the central ego (Fairbairn, 1952,p.129-130)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn was pessimistic regarding the extent that psychotherapy could modify the patient's unconscious in this (1944 paper), however his later papers were far more optimistic. Fairbairn viewed psychopathology as the splitting off of parts of the central ego that were intolerable to accept  and were dissociated and held in the unconscious. In the process, the central ego loses parts of itself, as well as memories  off the reality of his childhood. In addition, the diminished central ego is easily influenced by the unconscious split off beliefs and assumptions of the sub egos, which  can suddenly repress the central ego and become the conscious executive ego for a period of time. This makes  the individual appear erratic (which indeed they are) and causes others with whom they relate to abandon them as they are so changeable and unreliable. Fairbairn saw treatment as gradually allowing the central ego to grow as it learns of, and accepts the truth of what happened to him/her  as a child. The pain and anger of the antilibidinal ego will now make sense to the central ego given that the patient can now access more memories of the rejecting parents. Secondly, his libidinal ego will lose some of its territory, to use Fairbairn's metaphor, as the patient's illusions about his parents are scrutinized. His/her fantasy based illusions are based on his libidinal ego not-knowing just how bad the rejecting object once was (the libidinal ego does not know that the rejecting object even exists). All the information has to come through the central ego, and once it \"knows\" and accepts what happened to him/her in childhood, the sub-egos lose all their power. Given that the central ego now knows about the rejecting object, there is no place for an illusory fantasy about the parents assumed  goodness.    \n\n<br />\n\n=== On The Nature and Aims Of Psycho-analytical Treatment 1958<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=Ronald|date=1958|title=On The Nature and Aims of Psycho-Analytical Treatment|url=|journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=39|pages=374-385|via=}}</ref> ===\nFairbairn focused on treatment in this 1958 paper that was published six year after his 1952 book of collected papers. Fairbairn was extremely courageous intellectually as he had directly challenged the highly regarded originator of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. In this first quote, which completely sealed his theory's fate as an outlier in relation to \"classical\" psychoanalysis, Fairbairn cites the differences between his model and Freud's.<blockquote>In brief, my theoretical position may be said to be characterized by four main conceptual formulations-viz.(a) a theory of dynamic psychical structure, (b) a theory to the effect that libidinal activity is inherently and primarily object seeking, (c) a resulting theory of libidinal development couched, not in terms of presumptive zonal dominance, but in terms of the quality of dependence, and (d) a theory  of the personality couched exclusively in terms of internal object relationships. The first two of these formulations taken in combination may be said to represent a substitute for two of Freud's basic theories- his classic libido theory and his final theory of instincts. The third formulation is offered as a revision of Abraham's version of Freud's theory of libidinal development. And, finally, my object relations theory of the personality  is intended to replace Freud's description of the mental constitution in terms of the id, the ego and the superego.<ref name=\":8\" /> </blockquote>This summary quote consigned Fairbairn's work to those few scholars who were interested in the development of analytic concepts, but it was completely ignored my mainstream practitioners of the craft. He had taken on the entire world of psychoanalysis and presented an alternative reality, one that was simply too different to be accepted. Later in the article Fairbairn described his belief that the relationship between the patient and analyst was the most important factor in provoking change, in contrast to Freud,  who thought that interpretation, specifically, interpretation of the transference, was the key to change. Fairbairn cites his position that  people-specifically the parents of the patient- caused their child to experience frustrations that were dissociated into the child's inner world (the unconscious), and that the relationship with the analyst could help correct the distortions that the patient brings into the consulting room.  <blockquote>In terms of the object relations theory of the personality , the disabilities from which the patient suffers represent the effects  of unsatisfactory and unsatisfying object-relationships experienced in early life and perpetuated in an exaggerated form in inner reality; and if this view is correct, the actual relationship existing between the patient and the analyst as persons must be regarded as in itself contributing a therapeutic factor of prime importance. The existence of such a personal relationship in outer reality not only serves the function of providing  a means of correcting the distorted relationships which prevail in inner reality and influence the reactions of the patient to outer objects, but provides the patient with an opportunity, denied to him in childhood,  to undergo a process of emotional development in the setting of an actual relationship  with a reliable and beneficent parental figure (Fairbairn, 1958, p.24). <ref name=\":8\" />   </blockquote>This description of psychoanalysis was totally unacceptable to his colleagues because it eliminated the complexity of understanding transference, and projections and removed the art of constructing an interpretation that could impact the patient. Fairbairn simplified the process and removed all the mystery and craft from psychoanalysis. This was in line with his model in that it emphasized where psychopathology originated, how internalized bad objects could be loosened up by the relationship with a good object, and how emotional support could restart the developmental process that was stunted in childhood. What this quote does not take into consideration are the many factors that create resistance,  which he had cited in his prior papers.       \n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n==='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)===\n\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nFairbairn thought about, and wrote about the issue of the child's dependency on his mother in each of his four early papers as he was expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper (which will be described in the next section) on the issue of frustration of legitimate dependency needs as one of the causal factors leading to the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n==='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'===\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n==='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ===\n\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.           \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                 \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. Their unmet dependency needs have prevented them from passing through the normal developmental steps, and they are completely unprepared to work for others, tolerate demands placed on them, interact with new people, and participate cooperatively. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                             \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the '''positive impact of a''' '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend.  Fairbairn  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\n==== Resistance to Treatment Based on the Toxicity of the Internalized Bad Objects ====\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' The prior quote on the effects of a good object as a catalyst to de-repression of the internalized toxic memories did not take resistance into account. Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child demands that he/she will have to revisit and re-experience many of the rejecting experiences he/she lived through. This will, in turn,  destroy the illusions that he/she constructed about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his/her  childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70)<ref name=\":2\" />. Thus he equates bad internalized objects with devils, who tempt the individual to follow self-destructive paths. Specifically, trying to force love out of an unloving parent, or conversely, demanding that a rejecting parent learns to appreciate and value them,  are two typical examples of self- destructive attachments.  \n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain '''multiplicity of egos''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily  \"known\" material that the central ego sees and accepts, has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.'''The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates,''' thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. These developmental traumas can go \"unnoticed\" as they need not be dramatic. These traumas (called \"cumulative trauma\") are the daily rebuffs of the child's needs, including is need to be noticed, spoken to, listened to and respected. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense attachment between the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire. The prior quote by Odgen, has already described the attachment between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object. The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>As already described, '''the attachment between the two split off sub-egos and their respective objects defines the attachment to the bad object'''. Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the inexperienced  therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref>\n\n==== A Structural Analysis of the Effects of Treatment ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper also gave a brief description the impact  of psychotherapy or psychoanalysis on  the patient's interior world. In the following quote, Fairbairn speaks of \"territories\", which is his physical metaphor for the size of the internal structures. He sees the effects of psychotherapy as decreasing the two sub-egos because the central ego develops strength due to its  acceptance of the therapist as a good and reliable object, and it can now tolerate some or most of the painful realities of his/her childhood.<blockquote>I conceive it as one of the chief aims of psychoanalytical therapy to introduce some change into its topography by way of territorial adjustment. Thus I conceive it as among the most important functions of psychoanalytical therapy (a) to reduce the split of the original ego by restoring to the central ego a maximum of the territories ceded to the libidinal ego and the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego), and (b) to bring the exciting object and the rejecting object so far as possible together within the sphere and influence of the central ego (Fairbairn, 1952,p.129-130)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn was pessimistic regarding the extent that psychotherapy could modify the patient's unconscious in this (1944 paper), however his later papers were far more optimistic. Fairbairn viewed psychopathology as the splitting off of parts of the central ego that were intolerable to accept  and were dissociated and held in the unconscious. In the process, the central ego loses parts of itself, as well as memories  off the reality of his childhood. In addition, the diminished central ego is easily influenced by the unconscious split off beliefs and assumptions of the sub egos, which  can suddenly repress the central ego and become the conscious executive ego for a period of time. This makes  the individual appear erratic (which indeed they are) and causes others with whom they relate to abandon them as they are so changeable and unreliable. Fairbairn saw treatment as gradually allowing the central ego to grow as it learns of, and accepts the truth of what happened to him/her  as a child. The pain and anger of the antilibidinal ego will now make sense to the central ego given that the patient can now access more memories of the rejecting parents. Secondly, his libidinal ego will lose some of its territory, to use Fairbairn's metaphor, as the patient's illusions about his parents are scrutinized. His/her fantasy based illusions are based on his libidinal ego not-knowing just how bad the rejecting object once was (the libidinal ego does not know that the rejecting object even exists). All the information has to come through the central ego, and once it \"knows\" and accepts what happened to him/her in childhood, the sub-egos lose all their power. Given that the central ego now knows about the rejecting object, there is no place for an illusory fantasy about the parents assumed  goodness.    \n\n<br />\n\n=== On The Nature and Aims Of Psycho-analytical Treatment 1958<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=Ronald|date=1958|title=On The Nature and Aims of Psycho-Analytical Treatment|url=|journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|volume=39|pages=374-385|via=}}</ref> ===\nFairbairn focused on treatment in this 1958 paper that was published six year after his 1952 book of collected papers. Fairbairn was extremely courageous intellectually as he had directly challenged the highly regarded originator of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. In this first quote, which completely sealed his theory's fate as an outlier in relation to \"classical\" psychoanalysis, Fairbairn cites the differences between his model and Freud's.<blockquote>In brief, my theoretical position may be said to be characterized by four main conceptual formulations-viz.(a) a theory of dynamic psychical structure, (b) a theory to the effect that libidinal activity is inherently and primarily object seeking, (c) a resulting theory of libidinal development couched, not in terms of presumptive zonal dominance, but in terms of the quality of dependence, and (d) a theory  of the personality couched exclusively in terms of internal object relationships. The first two of these formulations taken in combination may be said to represent a substitute for two of Freud's basic theories- his classic libido theory and his final theory of instincts. The third formulation is offered as a revision of Abraham's version of Freud's theory of libidinal development. And, finally, my object relations theory of the personality  is intended to replace Freud's description of the mental constitution in terms of the id, the ego and the superego.<ref name=\":8\" /> </blockquote>This summary quote consigned Fairbairn's work to scholars interested in the development of analytic concepts, but it was completely ignored my mainstream practitioners of the craft. He had taken on the entire world of psychoanalysis and presented an alternative reality, one that was simply too different to be accepted. This paper continued this trean as he recommended changes to treatment that were equally unpalatable.  \n\n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.
