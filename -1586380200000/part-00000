{"title_page": "Hara Hara Tokei", "text_new": "{{Nihongo|'''Hara Hara Tokei'''|\u8179\u8179\u6642\u8a08|Hara Hara Tokei}} is a manual released in March 1974 describing tactics for guerrillas and methods of bomb-making which was an underground publication of the \u201cwolf cell\u201d of the [[East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front]], a far-left terrorist organization responsible for serial bombings of Japanese corporations in the 1970s including the offices of [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] [[1974 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bombing|in 1974]].\n\n== History ==\nThe East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front was planning the publication of a book to make their ideas widely known in Japanese society. In the autumn of 1973 they bought a [[Japanese typewriter]] and made use of it heavily in implementing this plan. The leader of their \u201cwolf cell\u201d Masashi Daidoji wrote the text and collaborators who were not members typed it with the typewriter.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition. One of the collaborators was a nursing student. The other was her elder sister who committed suicide after her younger sister was arrested.</ref> It was printed at a printing company in [[Kushiro, Hokkaido]] where Daidoji\u2019s high school [[senpai]] was working.\n\nAt first members of the EAAJAF were about to settle on the title of \u201cGuidebook for the Urban Guerrilla Soldier Volume 1\u201d, but some suggested that a different name that left more to the imagination would be better, just like [[Mountain Village Operation Unit#How to Raise Flower Bulbs|How to Raise Flower Bulbs]], the publication used by the old [[Mountain Village Operation Unit]]. Because of this \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Handbook Volume 1\u201d was relegated to the subtitle and they decided to go with a different motif. Because there was a description of timing devices in the book, they went with a name related to clocks, or tokei in Japanese. In the end, they decided on \u201cHara Hara Tokei\u201d. \u201cHara Hara\u201d carries a double meaning of heart-pounding suspense (''hara hara'') from an explosive device, and the ''hara'' command form used in the [[Korean language]] for written instructions.\n\nThe suggested retail price of the manual was said to be 100 yen,<ref>Asahi Shimbun 24 May 1975 morning edition.</ref> and on the back cover of the original print edition they put as an inset image the cover of a South Korean magazine which was banned by the regime of [[Park Chung-hee]] because the printing company published the anti-war poems of [[Kim Chi-ha]].<ref>Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition</ref> Thanks to this book, the EAAJAP\u2019s \u201cwolf cell\u201d, led by Daidoji, attained members for the \u201cscorpion cell\u201d and \u201cfangs of the Earth cell\u201d.\n\nBecause restrictions on publishing itself were impossible due to [[constitution of Japan|constitutional]] guarantees on freedom of speech, the investigating authorities issued arrests for instigating and abetting the creation of explosive devices under Section 4 of the Explosives Control Act.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 16 October 1974 morning edition</ref> It became clear to the police that the text and contents of their statements at the start of the book were tantamount to written confessions of the crimes and thus, through use of them to deduce the identities of the members, the organization was annihilated.\n\n== Contents of the book ==\nWithin Hara Hara Tokei is an overview of the anti-Japanese ideology in which the EAAJAP believed and also detailed explanations of methods of waging guerrilla war and of making and setting up bombs.\n\nConcerning bomb-making, the manual explains with illustrations that \u201cAnyone with a middle-school level knowledge of chemistry can do it\u201d. As ingredients, the manual recommends a mixed explosive making use of [[sodium chlorite]]-based herbicides which, if one goes to rural communities where weeds are a problem in summer, can be bought in great quantity without being noted as anything suspicious.<ref>Specific brand names were also written down, but as a result of their terrorist attacks, manufacture of sodium chlorite-based herbicides has fallen into disuse.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Hara Hara Tokei also includes guidelines for blending in with ordinary citizens and not arousing suspicion which were published as a way to circumvent \u201cHow to Spot an Extremist\u201d, which was Chapter 5 of an appeal for cooperation made around the year 1971 by the investigating authorities to the Japanese people to expose members of extremist groups like the [[Japanese Red Army]]. Media reports describe the following guidelines that members of the EAAJAP put into practice.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 28 October 1974 evening edition</ref>\n\n* Extreme obsession with secrecy at your home and not associating with others are, on the contrary, just digging your own grave. Exchange a minimal number of greetings and show that you have regular daily habits.\n* There is no particular need to cut ties with family members.\n* Don\u2019t at all flaunt your left-wing political views.\n* Don\u2019t associate with the \u201clegal left\u201d. Because they are fickle and can\u2019t keep secrets they cannot be trusted.\n\nIncidentally, the investigative authorities thought that Hara Hara Tokei\u2019s sole flaw was that it didn\u2019t give lessons on destruction of evidence.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition</ref> The [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Public Security Bureau|Public Security Bureau]] were keeping their suspects under surveillance and they said that what led to the mass arrest of the entire group was the discovery of envelopes with rough drafts of their claims to responsibility in the trash outside their hideout immediately after the simultaneous bombing of Oriental Metal and the Korean Industry Economic Research Institute on 19 April 1975.\n\n== Influence of the book ==\nThere were also many among other factions of the Japanese New Left who were critical of the anti-Japanese ideology of the EAAJAF itself, but even their militant members made the parts of Hara Hara Tokei dealing with techniques of bomb construction into their textbook. Hara Hara Tokei even transcended ideology and spread among the far-right and ultranationalist militants.\n\nThere was an incident in May 1985 where letter bombs were sent to the headquarters of the left-wing [[Japan Teachers Union]] and its affiliate in [[Mie Prefecture]] and at the latter a female staff member\u2019s hair was burned.

In the autumn of 1973 they bought a [[Japanese typewriter]] and made use of it heavily in implementing this plan. The leader of their \u201cwolf cell\u201d Masashi Daidoji wrote the text and collaborators who were not members typed it with the typewriter.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition. One of the collaborators was a nursing student. The other was her elder sister who committed suicide after her younger sister was arrested.</ref> It was printed at a printing company in [[Kushiro, Hokkaido]] where Daidoji\u2019s high school [[senpai]] was working.\n\nAt first members of the EAAJAF were about to settle on the title of \u201cGuidebook for the Urban Guerrilla Soldier Volume 1\u201d, but some suggested that a different name that left more to the imagination would be better, just like [[Mountain Village Operation Unit#How to Raise Flower Bulbs|How to Raise Flower Bulbs]], the publication used by the old [[Mountain Village Operation Unit]]. Because of this \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Handbook Volume 1\u201d was relegated to the subtitle and they decided to go with a different motif. Because there was a description of timing devices in the book, they went with a name related to clocks, or tokei in Japanese. In the end, they decided on \u201cHara Hara Tokei\u201d. \u201cHara Hara\u201d carries a double meaning of heart-pounding suspense (''hara hara'') from an explosive device, and the ''hara'' command form used in the [[Korean language]] for written instructions.\n\nThe suggested retail price of the manual was said to be 100 yen,<ref>Asahi Shimbun 24 May 1975 morning edition.</ref> and on the back cover of the original print edition they put as an inset image the cover of a South Korean magazine which was banned by the regime of [[Park Chung-hee]] because the printing company published the anti-war poems of [[Kim Chi-ha]].<ref>Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition</ref> Thanks to this book, the EAAJAP\u2019s \u201cwolf cell\u201d, led by Daidoji, attained members for the \u201cscorpion cell\u201d and \u201cfangs of the Earth cell\u201d.\n\nBecause restrictions on publishing itself were impossible due to [[constitution of Japan|constitutional]] guarantees on freedom of speech, the investigating authorities issued arrests for instigating and abetting the creation of explosive devices under Section 4 of the Explosives Control Act.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 16 October 1974 morning edition</ref> It became clear to the police that the text and contents of their statements at the start of the book were tantamount to written confessions of the crimes and thus, through use of them to deduce the identities of the members, the organization was annihilated.\n\n== Contents of the book ==\nWithin Hara Hara Tokei is an overview of the anti-Japanese ideology in which the EAAJAP believed and also detailed explanations of methods of waging guerrilla war and of making and setting up bombs.\n\nConcerning bomb-making, the manual explains with illustrations that \u201cAnyone with a middle-school level knowledge of chemistry can do it\u201d. As ingredients, the manual recommends a mixed explosive making use of [[sodium chlorite]]-based herbicides which, if one goes to rural communities where weeds are a problem in summer, can be bought in great quantity without being noted as anything suspicious.<ref>Specific brand names were also written down, but as a result of their terrorist attacks, manufacture of sodium chlorite-based herbicides has fallen into disuse.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Hara Hara Tokei also includes guidelines for blending in with ordinary citizens and not arousing suspicion which were published as a way to circumvent \u201cHow to Spot an Extremist\u201d, which was Chapter 5 of an appeal for cooperation made around the year 1971 by the investigating authorities to the Japanese people to expose members of extremist groups like the [[Japanese Red Army]]. Media reports describe the following guidelines that members of the EAAJAP put into practice.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 28 October 1974 evening edition</ref>\n\n* Extreme obsession with secrecy at your home and not associating with others are, on the contrary, just digging your own grave. Exchange a minimal number of greetings and show that you have regular daily habits.\n* There is no particular need to cut ties with family members.\n* Don\u2019t at all flaunt your left-wing political views.\n* Don\u2019t associate with the \u201clegal left\u201d. Because they are fickle and can\u2019t keep secrets they cannot be trusted.\n\nIncidentally, the investigative authorities thought that Hara Hara Tokei\u2019s sole flaw was that it didn\u2019t give lessons on destruction of evidence.<ref>Asahi Shimbun 31 May 1975 evening edition</ref> The [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department Public Security Bureau|Public Security Bureau]] were keeping their suspects under surveillance and they said that what led to the mass arrest of the entire group was the discovery of envelopes with rough drafts of their claims to responsibility in the trash outside their hideout immediately after the simultaneous bombing of Oriental Metal and the Korean Industry Economic Research Institute on 19 April 1975.\n\n== Influence of the book ==\nThere were also many among other factions of the Japanese New Left who were critical of the anti-Japanese ideology of the EAAJAF itself, but even their militant members made the parts of Hara Hara Tokei dealing with techniques of bomb construction into their textbook. Hara Hara Tokei even transcended ideology and spread among the far-right and ultranationalist militants.\n\nThere was an incident in May 1985 where letter bombs were sent to the headquarters of the left-wing [[Japan Teachers Union]] and its affiliate in [[Mie Prefecture]] and at the latter a female staff member\u2019s hair was burned. A copy of Hara Hara Tokei was confiscated from the arrested perpetrator who belonged to an [[uyoku dantai|ultranationalist group]] in [[Shimane Prefecture]].<ref>Asahi Shimbun 13 July 1985 evening edition.

The fact that Aristotle was divorced and his former wife [[Tina Onassis Niarchos|Athina Livanos]] was still living led to speculation that Jacqueline might be [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the Roman Catholic church, though that concern was explicitly dismissed by [[Archbishop of Boston|Boston's Archbishop]], Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]] as \"nonsense\".<ref>{{cite book|title=In Talk on Jackie Kennedy|date=October 23, 1968|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat=19681023&id=MM5QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TMcMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4712,2143422}}</ref> She was condemned by some as a \"public sinner,\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Roman Catholics: The Cardinal and Jackie| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839610,00.html| work=Time|accessdate=May 12, 2014|date=November 1, 1968}}</ref> and became the target of [[paparazzi]] who followed her everywhere and nicknamed her \"Jackie O\".<ref>Tracy, p. 211</ref>\n\nDuring their marriage, the couple inhabited six different residences: her 15-room [[1040 Fifth Avenue|Fifth Avenue apartment]] in Manhattan, her horse farm in New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island Skorpios, his house in Athens, and his yacht ''[[Christina O]]''.

In 1975, she became a consulting editor at [[Viking Press]], a position that she held for two years.{{efn|Prior to her publishing employment, she had gained experience by being involved with several posthumous biographies of President Kennedy. The first of these was ''John F. Kennedy, President,'' by [[Hugh Sidey]], which was published the year after his death in 1964. Simon Michael Bessie, Sidey's editor at Atheneum, recalled her as having read galleys and submitted detailed notes on them. Despite this recollection, Sidey did not acknowledge her contribution in the book. The following year, she helped [[Ted Sorensen]] with his book ''Kennedy''. Sorensen told Greg Lawrence that after finishing the \"first draft\" of his \"first big book\", he gave Onassis the manuscript since he thought she would be helpful, and Onassis provided him with several comments on the book. Sorensen lauded her assistance in his memoir ''Counselor'', as he wrote that she had \"proved to be a superb editor, correcting typographical errors, challenging mistaken assumptions, defending some of her husband's personnel decisions, suggesting useful clarifications, and repeatedly setting the record straight on matters not known to me\".<ref>Lawrence, pp. 13\u201314</ref>}}\n\nAfter almost a decade of avoiding participation in political events, Onassis attended the [[1976 Democratic National Convention]] and stunned the assembled delegates when she appeared in the visitors' gallery.<ref>Sabato, p. 324</ref><ref>Reeves, pp. 124\u2013127</ref> She resigned from Viking Press in 1977 after [[John Leonard (critic)|John Leonard]] of ''The New York Times'' stated that Onassis held some responsibility for Viking's publication of the [[Jeffrey Archer]] novel ''[[Shall We Tell the President?]]'', set in a fictional future presidency of Ted Kennedy and describing an assassination plot against him.<ref name=\"carmody19771015\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/15/archives/mrs-onassis-resigns-editing-post-mrs-onassis-resigns-editing-post.html |title=Mrs. Onassis Resigns Editing Post |last=Carmody |first=Deirdre |date=1977-10-15 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-11-28 |page=1 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>Silverman, pp. 71\u201372</ref> Two years later, she appeared alongside her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy at [[Faneuil Hall]] in Boston when Ted Kennedy announced that he was going to challenge incumbent president [[Jimmy Carter]] for the Democratic nomination for president.<ref>Leaming (2014), p. 292</ref> She participated in the subsequent presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful.<ref>Lawrence, p. 95</ref>\n\nFollowing her resignation from Viking Press, Kennedy was hired by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], where she worked as an associate editor under an old friend, [[John Turner Sargent, Sr.]] Among the books she edited for the company are [[Larry Gonick]]'s ''[[The Cartoon History of the Universe]]'',<ref>Spoto, p. 319</ref> the English translation of the three volumes of [[Naghib Mahfuz]]'s ''[[Cairo Trilogy]]'' (with Martha Levin),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/lilly/mss/index.php?p=hutchinsinv|title=Hutchins mss.|work=indiana.edu}}</ref> and autobiographies of ballerina [[Gelsey Kirkland]],<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/fashion/02JACKIE.html|title=Once an Editor, Now the Subject|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> singer-songwriter [[Carly Simon]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Jackie O.: A Life in Books|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Jacqueline-Kennedys-Literary-Life|publisher=oprah.com|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref> and fashion icon [[Diana Vreeland]].<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She also encouraged [[Dorothy West]], her neighbor on Martha's Vineyard and the last surviving member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], to complete the novel ''The Wedding'' (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S.\n\n[[File:Reagans with Jackie Kennedy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Onassis in 1985 with the President and First Lady, [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald]] and [[Nancy Reagan]]]]\n\nIn addition to her work as an editor, Onassis participated in cultural and architectural preservation.

He described the album as a \"cohesive and consistent album\" and the \"best she made since \"''[[Mistaken Identity (Kim Carnes album)|Mistaken Identity]]''\", but states that it is more akin to the standard of Carnes' 1982 album, ''[[Voyeur (Kim Carnes album)|Voyeur]]''.

The 2001 reissue includes the Horn/Downes-penned track \"I Am a Camera\", which was previously recorded by [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their 1980 ''[[Drama (Yes album)|Drama]]'' album (as \"[[Into the Lens]]\") and by Downes and Horn themselves on the final [[Buggles]] album, ''[[Adventures in Modern Recording]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Barking at Airplanes'' received a fairly positive retrospective review from Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[AllMusic]]. He described the album as a \"cohesive and consistent album\" and the \"best she made since \"''[[Mistaken Identity (Kim Carnes album)|Mistaken Identity]]''\", but states that it is more akin to the standard of Carnes' 1982 album, ''[[Voyeur (Kim Carnes album)|Voyeur]]''. Although he said the album meets a mainstream 1980s adult audience, he justified the quality of the album by arguing that \"it fits Carnes very well, not just because her great voice sounds ideal in this setting, but because she does this music very well.\"<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/barking-at-airplanes-mw0000012648 Album review], AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine.
