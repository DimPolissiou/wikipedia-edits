Australia and Canada's federal governments are represented by [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissions]], as are all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] national governments today.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, a growing number of British colonies appointed agents in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] (and occasionally elsewhere in Europe) to promote immigration to the colonies. Eventually, agents-general were appointed by some colonies to represent their commercial, legal, and diplomatic interests in Britain and to the British government and [[Whitehall]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5T5waG0z7VIC&lpg=PT35&dq=%22edward%20jenkins%22%20agent-general&pg=PT21#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=Commissions High: Canada in London, 1870\u20131971 |first=Roy |last=MacLaren |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |accessdate=26 September 2016 |via=Google Books|isbn=9780773560123 }}</ref> They were appointed, and their expenses and salaries provided, by the governments of the colonies they represented.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agent-General|volume=1|page=374}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1886, Quebec and the federal Canadian government also appointed agents-general to Paris. The first, [[Hector Fabre]], was dispatched by the province of [[Quebec]] but was asked by the federal government to represent all of Canada. He and his successor, [[Philippe Roy]], continued to represent both Quebec City and Ottawa in France until 1912 when the federal government asked Roy to resign his Quebec position to avoid conflicts of interest. Canadian provinces have also appointed agent-generals (called delegates-general in Quebec beginning in the 1970s) to other countries and major cities.\n\nFollowing a military coup in Nigeria in 1966, the federal system was abolished, and the posts of the agents-general of Nigerian regions in [[London]] were subsumed in the [[High Commission of Nigeria, London|Nigerian High Commission]].\n\nBy the 1990s, some Australian state governments regarded the office of their agent-general in London as a costly anachronism, even for promoting tourism and investment, and have since been closed and subsumed into the Australian High Commission. The majority of Australian states continue to have agents-general in London, but operate from [[Australia House]] rather than maintain separate premises.\n\nMany Canadian provinces similarly are no longer represented by an agent-general, although Quebec continues to have a [[Quebec Government Offices|Government Office]] in London (''{{lang|fr|D\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Londres}}'') and in several other cities around the world. [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]] have representatives who work out of the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2013/08/ontario-appoints-new-representative-in-washington.html |title=Ontario Appoints New Representative in Washington |website=[[Premier of Ontario|Office of the Premier]] |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n===Agents-general for New South Wales===\nThe [[New South Wales]] Office in London was one of several overseas offices established by the colonies of Australia to represent their interests. The London Office was established after the appointment of the first Agent-General on 1 May 1864. In June 1932, the Agent-General's Office was abolished as a cost-cutting measure and was replaced by the New South Wales Government Offices, London, to be headed by an \"Official Representative\".<ref name=ab/> The title was renamed Agent-General in 1937, but was left vacant from 1939 to 1946 due to the war. From 1972 to 1993, the Agent-General's Office was located in separate premises from [[Australia House]], at the nearby address of 66 The Strand, which was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in May 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51941575 |title=People and Fashion |work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |location=Australia, Australia |date=14 June 1972 |accessdate=16 February 2018 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author1=New South Wales | title=A House in the Strand : a history of the site of New South Wales House | date=1972 | publisher=New South Wales Govt | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11472728 | accessdate=16 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1992, the position of NSW Agent-General in London was abolished by the [[John Fahey (politician)|Fahey]] government.

Australia and Canada's federal governments are represented by [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissions]], as are all [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] national governments today.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, a growing number of British colonies appointed agents in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] (and occasionally elsewhere in Europe) to promote immigration to the colonies. Eventually, agents-general were appointed by some colonies to represent their commercial, legal, and diplomatic interests in Britain and to the British government and [[Whitehall]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5T5waG0z7VIC&lpg=PT35&dq=%22edward%20jenkins%22%20agent-general&pg=PT21#v=onepage&q&f=true |title=Commissions High: Canada in London, 1870\u20131971 |first=Roy |last=MacLaren |date=1 January 2006 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press |accessdate=26 September 2016 |via=Google Books|isbn=9780773560123 }}</ref> They were appointed, and their expenses and salaries provided, by the governments of the colonies they represented.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agent-General|volume=1|page=374}}</ref>\n\nStarting in 1886, Quebec and the federal Canadian government also appointed agents-general to Paris. The first, [[Hector Fabre]], was dispatched by the province of [[Quebec]] but was asked by the federal government to represent all of Canada. He and his successor, [[Philippe Roy]], continued to represent both Quebec City and Ottawa in France until 1912 when the federal government asked Roy to resign his Quebec position to avoid conflicts of interest. Canadian provinces have also appointed agent-generals (called delegates-general in Quebec beginning in the 1970s) to other countries and major cities.\n\nFollowing a military coup in Nigeria in 1966, the federal system was abolished, and the posts of the agents-general of Nigerian regions in [[London]] were subsumed in the [[High Commission of Nigeria, London|Nigerian High Commission]].\n\nBy the 1990s, some Australian state governments regarded the office of their agent-general in London as a costly anachronism, even for promoting tourism and investment, and have since been closed and subsumed into the Australian High Commission. The majority of Australian states continue to have agents-general in London, but operate from [[Australia House]] rather than maintain separate premises.\n\nMany Canadian provinces similarly are no longer represented by an agent-general, although Quebec continues to have a [[Quebec Government Offices|Government Office]] in London (''{{lang|fr|D\u00e9l\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Londres}}'') and in several other cities around the world. [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]] have representatives who work out of the [[Embassy of Canada, Washington, D.C.|Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2013/08/ontario-appoints-new-representative-in-washington.html |title=Ontario Appoints New Representative in Washington |website=[[Premier of Ontario|Office of the Premier]] |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n===Agents-general for New South Wales===\nThe [[New South Wales]] Office in London was one of several overseas offices established by the colonies of Australia to represent their interests. The London Office was established after the appointment of the first Agent-General on 1 May 1864. In June 1932, the Agent-General's Office was abolished as a cost-cutting measure and was replaced by the New South Wales Government Offices, London, to be headed by an \"Official Representative\".<ref name=ab/> The title was renamed Agent-General in 1937, but was left vacant from 1939 to 1946 due to the war. From 1972 to 1993, the Agent-General's Office was located in separate premises from [[Australia House]], at the nearby address of 66 The Strand, which was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in May 1972.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51941575 |title=People and Fashion |work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |location=Australia, Australia |date=14 June 1972 |accessdate=16 February 2018 |page=13 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author1=New South Wales | title=A House in the Strand : a history of the site of New South Wales House | date=1972 | publisher=New South Wales Govt | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/11472728 | accessdate=16 February 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 1992, the position of NSW Agent-General in London was abolished by the [[John Fahey (politician)|Fahey]] government.

Keller Library and Community Center''' is located in the [[Broadmoor, New Orleans|Broadmoor]] neighborhood of\n[[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. It stands on the corner of Napoleon Avenue and South Broad Street\nwhich serve as the north/south, east/west markers in the neighborhood. The library is a branch of\nthe greater [[New Orleans Public Library System]]. The Broadmoor branch serves as one of the only\ncenters for community engagement in the neighborhood and hosts adult education classes, art\nworkshops, after-school activities for children, and community events throughout the year. It\nopened its doors on March 17, 2012.\n\n==Early history==\nThe original building housing the Rosa F. Keller Library served as a private family residence for many years before being sold to the city in 1990. One of the first homes in the area, Mrs. Ethel Aubert Hardie purchased the eight-room stucco home after its completion in 1918 at a cost of $9500. It was one of the most recognizable landmarks in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter the Hardie family enlarged the property and sold it in 1924, ownership transferred once more before the home's final resident, Dr. Ida Finkelstein Fattel, sold it to the city of New Orleans for $215,000 in 1990. Due to its architectural significance, the New Orleans Historic Districts/Landmarks Commission designated the home a historic landmark under the name of Hardie-Fattel House in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterresearch.org/pre-katrina/orleans/3/63/snapshot.html|title=Broadmoor Neighborhood Snapshot|website=www.datacenterresearch.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\nThe home opened as the Broad Branch of the New Orleans Public Library in November 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/qbranch.htm|title=NOPL Centennial Exhibit: Extension|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Rosa Keller Dedication ==\nThe branch was named in honour of civil rights advocate and New Orleans Public Library pioneer, Rosa Freeman Keller in October of 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/keller/rosa.htm|title=Rosa Keller Branch Dedication New Orleans Public Library|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>. \n\nRosa Freeman Keller was born in New Orleans in 1911. A white heiress to a Coca-Cola bottling fortune, Keller could easily have chosen to live out her days quietly and comfortably in her Uptown home, with little social reflection. Instead, she used her finances and influence to launch a lifelong fight for racial equality in the city of New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/post/2017/01/23/nola4women-rosa-freeman-keller-a-white-ally-that-fought-racism|title=NOLA4Women: Rosa Freeman Keller: A White Ally That Fought Racism|last=Flora|first=Brenda|date=2017-01-23|website=amistadresearchctr|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> She became the first woman to serve on a citywide board in New Orleans as a member of the board of the New Orleans Public Library, and used that position to push for the integration of the library system.\n\nKeller received numerous honors for her work on racial issues in New Orleans, including the Times-Picayune Loving Cup Award, which honors New Orleans residents who have worked unselfishly for the community without expectation of public acclaim or material reward. She also received an honorary alumnus degree from Newcomb College and an honorary doctorate from [http://www.dillard.edu/ Dillard University]. She died in '''April 15, 1998''', in New Orleans.

In 2006, the neighborhood was deemed a drainage point in the city's\nreconstruction plan under the [[Bring New Orleans Back Commission]] that was led by former\nmayor [[Ray Nagin]]. The proposal was met with strong opposition as residents rallied to save their\nneighborhood from disinvestment and destruction.

As much a social hub as it is an academic\ncenter, the library was rebuilt within the framework of a 21st-century model to allow\ntechnological access for community members that may not have it at home. The floor of the new\naddition is aligned with the renovated home, both built on raised footings above the Base Flood\nElevation line. At its center, the new building contains a small courtyard surrounded by glass\nwalls that is visible from within the main library. The buildings largest and most expansive space\nholds the computer and reading tables, main desk and library office, which functions as an\nenclosed light in green glass, illuminating the space.\n\nThe design takes a more sustainable approach to wood paneling which uses recycled\nwooden slats around the parameter of the reading space. Shaded skylights filter harsh sunlight\nallowing the space to be naturally cooled during hot weather. The tinted glass light well also\nhelps to vary the natural light across the space and throughout the day. Other areas are clad in\nperforated metal panels meant to mimic the textured stucco of the original home. Though the\nuses are separate, both the library and the community center complement each other in design by\nincluding a semi-raised horizontal axis that reaches its lowest point at the entrance.\n\n==Cultural significance==\nThe library stands as a model for Post-Katrina development and symbolizes the triumph that\nBroadmoor has achieved after the storm.

Keller Library and Community Center]]\nThe '''Rosa F. Keller Library and Community Center''' is located in the [[Broadmoor, New Orleans|Broadmoor]] neighborhood of\n[[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. It stands on the corner of Napoleon Avenue and South Broad Street\nwhich serve as the north/south, east/west markers in the neighborhood. The library is a branch of\nthe greater [[New Orleans Public Library System]]. The Broadmoor branch serves as one of the only\ncenters for community engagement in the neighborhood and hosts adult education classes, art\nworkshops, after-school activities for children, and community events throughout the year. It\nopened its doors on March 17, 2012.\n\n==Early history==\nThe original building housing the Rosa F. Keller Library served as a private family residence for many years before being sold to the city in 1990. One of the first homes in the area, Mrs. Ethel Aubert Hardie purchased the eight-room stucco home after its completion in 1918 at a cost of $9500. It was one of the most recognizable landmarks in the neighborhood.\n\nAfter the Hardie family enlarged the property and sold it in 1924, ownership transferred once more before the home's final resident, Dr. Ida Finkelstein Fattel, sold it to the city of New Orleans for $215,000 in 1990. Due to its architectural significance, the New Orleans Historic Districts/Landmarks Commission designated the home a historic landmark under the name of Hardie-Fattel House in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.datacenterresearch.org/pre-katrina/orleans/3/63/snapshot.html|title=Broadmoor Neighborhood Snapshot|website=www.datacenterresearch.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\nThe home opened as the Broad Branch of the New Orleans Public Library in November 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/qbranch.htm|title=NOPL Centennial Exhibit: Extension|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n== Rosa Keller Dedication ==\nThe branch was named in honour of civil rights advocate and New Orleans Public Library pioneer, Rosa Freeman Keller in October of 1999<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nutrias.org/~nopl/exhibits/keller/rosa.htm|title=Rosa Keller Branch Dedication New Orleans Public Library|website=nutrias.org|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>. \n\nRosa Freeman Keller was born in New Orleans in 1911. A white heiress to a Coca-Cola bottling fortune, Keller could easily have chosen to live out her days quietly and comfortably in her Uptown home, with little social reflection. Instead, she used her finances and influence to launch a lifelong fight for racial equality in the city of New Orleans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/post/2017/01/23/nola4women-rosa-freeman-keller-a-white-ally-that-fought-racism|title=NOLA4Women: Rosa Freeman Keller: A White Ally That Fought Racism|last=Flora|first=Brenda|date=2017-01-23|website=amistadresearchctr|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> She became the first woman to serve on a citywide board in New Orleans as a member of the board of the New Orleans Public Library, and used that position to push for the integration of the library system.\n\nKeller received numerous honors for her work on racial issues in New Orleans, including the Times-Picayune Loving Cup Award, which honors New Orleans residents who have worked unselfishly for the community without expectation of public acclaim or material reward. She also received an honorary alumnus degree from Newcomb College and an honorary doctorate from [http://www.dillard.edu/ Dillard University]. She died in '''April 15, 1998''', in New Orleans.

In 2006, the neighborhood was deemed a drainage point in the city's\nreconstruction plan under the [[Bring New Orleans Back Commission]] that was led by former\nmayor [[Ray Nagin]]. The proposal was met with strong opposition as residents rallied to save their\nneighborhood from disinvestment and destruction.

The features and amenities present in the new facility that were not in the previous facility were financed by other sources, including New Orleans municipal bond sales and funds from the Louisiana Recovery Authority.

As much a social hub as it is an academic\ncenter, the library was rebuilt within the framework of a 21st-century model to allow\ntechnological access for community members that may not have it at home. The floor of the new\naddition is aligned with the renovated home, both built on raised footings above the Base Flood\nElevation line. At its center, the new building contains a small courtyard surrounded by glass\nwalls that is visible from within the main library. The buildings largest and most expansive space\nholds the computer and reading tables, main desk and library office, which functions as an\nenclosed light in green glass, illuminating the space.\n\nThe design takes a more sustainable approach to wood paneling which uses recycled\nwooden slats around the parameter of the reading space. Shaded skylights filter harsh sunlight\nallowing the space to be naturally cooled during hot weather. The tinted glass light well also\nhelps to vary the natural light across the space and throughout the day. Other areas are clad in\nperforated metal panels meant to mimic the textured stucco of the original home. Though the\nuses are separate, both the library and the community center complement each other in design by\nincluding a semi-raised horizontal axis that reaches its lowest point at the entrance.\n\n==Cultural significance==\nThe library stands as a model for Post-Katrina development and symbolizes the triumph that\nBroadmoor has achieved after the storm. Visually different from the residential buildings\nsurrounding the structure, the Rosa F. Keller Library and Community Center highlights the\narchitectural innovation that certain communities have embraced with rebuilding.

Nevertheless, phobophobia is not necessarily developed as part of other phobias, but can be an important factor for maintaining them.<ref name=Griez/>\n\nPhobophobia differentiates itself from other kind of phobias by the fact that there is no environmental [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] per se, but rather internal dreadful sensations similar to psychological symptoms of panic attacks.<ref name=Griez/> The psychological state of the mind creates an anxious response that has itself a conditioned stimuli leading to further anxiety,<ref name=Griez/> resulting in a [[vicious cycle]]. Phobophobia is a fear experienced before actually experiencing the fear of the feared phobias its somatic sensations that precede it, which is preceded by generalized anxiety disorders and can generate panic attacks. Like all the phobias, the patients avoids the feared phobia in order to avoid the fear of it.\n\n==Cause and symptoms==\nPhobophobia is mainly linked with internal predispositions. It is developed by the [[unconscious mind]] which is linked to an event in which phobia was experienced with [[Psychological trauma|emotional trauma]] and stress, which are closely linked to anxiety disorders and by forgetting and recalling the initiating trauma.<ref name=MarkFearandPhobias>Mark, Isaac M. Fear and Phobias. Great Britain: Academic Press, 1969, LCCN 75084222.</ref> Phobophobia might develop from other phobias, in which the intense anxiety and panic caused by the phobia might lead to fearing the phobia itself, which triggers phobophobia before actually experiencing the other phobia. The extreme fear towards the other phobia can lead the patient to believe that their condition may develop into something worse, intensifying the effects of the other phobia by fearing it. Also, phobophobia can be developed when anxiety disorders are not treated, creating an extreme predisposition to other phobias. The development of phobophobia can also be attributed to characteristics of the patient itself, such as phylogenetic influence, the prepotency of certain stimuli, individual genetic inheritance, age incidence, sex incidence, personality background, cultural influence inside and outside the family, physiological variables and biochemical factors.<ref name=MarkFearandPhobias/> \nPhobophobia shares the symptoms of many other anxiety disorders, more specifically panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder:\n# [[Dizziness]]\n# Heart pounding\n# An excess of [[perspiration]]\n# Slight [[paresthesia]]\n# Tension\n# [[Hyperventilation]]\n# [[Angst]]\n# [[Faintness]]\n# Avoidance\n\n==Association with generalized anxiety disorder==\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is when our minds are troubled about some uncertain event,<ref name=MarkLivingWithFear>Mark, Isaac M. Living with fear: understanding and coping with anxiety. USA: McGraw Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-040395-3}}.</ref> or in other words, when we feel threatened, although the source of the threat might not be obvious to us.<ref name=MarkLivingWithFear/> It is a disorder when it happens frequently, and disables people from accomplishing some of their daily activities. Generalized anxiety disorder always comes before phobophobia, and of its symptoms are listed below:\n# [[Pallor|Paleness of skin]]\n# Sweating\n# [[Pupillary response|Dilation of pupils]]\n# Rapid pounding of heart\n# Rise in [[blood pressure]]\n# Tension in the muscles\n# Trembling\n# Readiness to be startled\n# Dryness and tightness of the throat and mouth\n# Rapid breathing\n# Desperation\n# A sinking feeling in the stomach\n# A strong desire to cry, run or hide\n\nThe main problem with this disorder is that we do not know what we are troubled about, which may lead to our desire to escape. Anxiety becomes a disorder only when we experience psychological trauma, in which our knowledge of past events trigger a fear of uncertain danger in the future. In other words, the primarily event is anxiety which arises for no accountable reason, panic might develop from anxiety<ref name=MarkLivingWithFear/> and the phobophobia is developed in the very end as a consequence of both of them,<ref name=MarkFearandPhobias/> sharing some of the symptoms. If either of these initiating disorders are not treated, phobophobia can be developed because an extended susceptibility and experience of this feelings can create an extreme predisposition to other phobias. Anxiety is mainly fixed to a certain specific event or specific events, a strong learned drive which is situationally evoked which is stressful to one person but not to another, and this makes it much easier for phobophobia to develop, as well as other phobias.<ref>Levitt, Eugene E. The psychology of Anxiety. USA: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1967, LCCN 67-19654.</ref>\n\n==Association with panic attacks==\nWhen people experience panic attacks, they are convinced that they are about to die or suffer some extreme calamity<ref name=Baker>Baker, Roger. Panic Disorder: Theory, Research and Therapy. Ed. Roger Baker. Great Britain: John Wiley and Son Ltd., 1989, {{ISBN|0-471-92319-2}}.</ref> in which some kind of action is done by the individual (such as fleeing or screaming). In case of phobophobia, a panic attack might be encountered as the fear that they will in fact experience the calamities of the feared phobia and see it as something inevitable. Also, the nature of the panic is of profound personal significance to the individual, on a similar way phobophobia is related to the individual.<ref name=Baker/> This is why panic attacks are closely related to phobophobia. \nNevertheless, they can differentiate themselves by the fact that phobophobia is a psychological fear of the phobia itself that intensifies it, while panic attacks are extreme fear of encountering the calamities of an imminent disaster, and in this particular case, of encountering other phobias, which can be often accompanied by the at least four of the following common symptoms of panic attacks: \n# [[Dyspnea]]\n# [[Palpitations]]\n# [[Chest pain]] or discomfort\n# Choking or smothering sensations\n# [[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]] or unsteady feelings\n# Feelings of unreality (depersonalization or derealization)\n# [[Paresthesias]] (tingling in hands or feet)\n# Hot and cold [[flushes]]\n# Faintness\n# Trembling or shaking\n# Difficult breathing\n# Sweating\n# Feeling of chills\nPanic attacks can also be accompanied by disturbance in heart action and feelings of desperation and angst.<ref name=Baker/> Being closely related, phobophobia and panic attacks, the first one can be treated like a panic attack with psychological [[Psychotherapy|therapy]]. Moreover, in combination with phobophobia, a patient might be more susceptible to believe that their continuing anxiety symptoms will eventually culminate in a much more severe mental disorder, such as [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=Baker/>\n\n==Treatment==\nThere are many ways to treat phobophobia, and the methods used to treat [[panic disorders]] have been shown to be effective to treat phobophobia, because panic disorder patients will present in a similar fashion to conventional phobics and perceive their fear as totally [[Irrationality|irrational]].<ref name=Baker/> Also, exposure based techniques have formed the basis of the armamentarium of [[Behaviour therapy|behaviour therapists]] in the treatment of phobic disorders for many years, they are the most effective forms of treatment for phobic avoidance behavior.<ref name=Wolfe>Wolfe, Barry E., et al. Treatment of panic disorder: A Consensus Development Disorder. Ed. Barry E. Wolfe and Jack D. Maser. USA: American Psychiatric Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-88048-685-6}}.</ref> Phobics are treated by exposing them to the stimuli which they specially fear,<ref name=Baker/> and in case of phobophobia, it is both the phobia they fear and their own sensations. There are two ways to approach [[interoceptive exposure]] on patients:\n\n* [[Paradoxical intention]]: This method is especially useful to treat the fear towards the phobophobia and the phobia they fear, as well as some of the sensations the patient fears. This method exposes the patient to the stimuli that causes the fear,<ref name=Wolfe/> which they avoid. The patient is directly exposed to it bringing them to experience the sensations that they fear, as well as the phobia. This exposure based technique helps the doctor by guiding the patient to encounter their fears and overcome them by feeling no danger around them.\n* Symptoms artificially produced: This method is very useful to treat the fear towards the sensations encountered when experiencing phobophobia, the main feared stimuli of this anxiety disorder. By ingestion of different chemical agents, such as [[caffeine]], [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]]-[[Oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] or [[adrenaline]], some of the symptoms the patient feels when encountering phobophobia and other anxiety disorders are triggered, such as hyperventilation, heart pounding, blurring of vision and paresthesia,<ref name=Griez/> which can lead to the controlling of the sensations by the patients. At first, panic attacks will be encountered, but eventually, as the study made by Doctor Griez and Van den Hout shows, the patient shows no fear to somatic sensations and panic attacks and eventually of the phobia feared.<ref name=Griez/>\n\nCognitive modification is another method that helps considerably to treat phobophobics. When treating the patients with the method, doctors correct some wrong information the patient might have about his disease, such as their catastrophic beliefs or imminent disaster by the feared phobia. Some doctors have even agreed that this is the most helpful component, since it has shown to be very effective especially if combined with other methods, like interoceptive exposure. The doctor seeks to convince patients that their symptoms do not signify danger or loss of control,<ref name=Wolfe/> for example, if combined with the interoceptive exposure, the doctor can show them that there is no unavoidable calamity and if the patient can keep themselves under control, they learn by themselves that there is no real threat and that it is just in their mind. Cognitive modification also seeks to correct other minor misconceptions, such as the belief that the individual will go crazy and may need to be \"locked away forever\" or that they will totally lose control and perhaps \"[[run amok]]\".<ref name=Baker/> Probably, the most difficult aspect of cognitive restructuring for the majority of the patients will simply be to identify their aberrant beliefs and approach them realistically.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nRelaxation and breathing control techniques are used to produce the symptoms naturally. The somatic sensations, the feared stimuli of phobophobia, are sought to be controlled by the patient to reduce the effects of phobophobia.<ref name=Baker/> One of the major symptoms encountered is that of hyperventilation, which produce dizziness, faintness, etc. So, hyperventilation is induced in the patients in order to increase their CO<sub>2</sub> levels that produce some of this symptoms. By teaching the patients to control this sensations by relaxing and controlling the way they breathe, this symptoms can be avoided and reduce phobophobia. This method is useful if combined with other methods, because alone it doesn't treat other main problems of phobophobia.\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''phobophobia'' is an English adaptation of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, ''phobos'', \"fear\".

This method is useful if combined with other methods, because alone it doesn't treat other main problems of phobophobia.\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''phobophobia'' is an English adaptation of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]  \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, ''phobos'', \"fear\".

B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Stockwell ward of Lambeth Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]\nThe name Stockwell is likely to have originated from a local well, with \"stoc\" being Old English for a tree trunk or post. From the thirteenth to the start of the nineteenth century, Stockwell was a rural manor at the edge of London. It included market gardens and [[John Tradescant the elder|John Tradescant's]] botanical garden &ndash; commemorated in Tradescant Road, which was built over it in 1880, and in a memorial outside St Stephen's church. In the nineteenth century it developed as an elegant middle-class suburb.  Residents included the artist [[Arthur Rackham]], who was born on South Lambeth Road in 1867, moving with his family to Albert Square when he was 15 years old. Another famed cultural figure who was born in Stockwell in October 1914, was theatre director [[Joan Littlewood]], who has been called the mother of modern theatre.\n\nIts social and architectural fortunes in the twentieth century were more mixed. The area immediately around Stockwell tube station was extensively rebuilt following the Second World War, and the original domed tube station was replaced first in the 1920s, then again with the opening of the [[Victoria line]] in 1971.\n\nThe area also has much [[social housing]]; the main estates are Lansdowne Green, Stockwell Park, Studley, Spurgeon, Mursell and Stockwell Gardens. However, many remnants of the area's nineteenth-century grandeur can be found in the side and back streets of Stockwell, notably in the Stockwell Park Conservation Area,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockwellpark.com/ |title=Welcome to the Stockwell Park Residents' Association (SPRA) website. |website=stockwellpark.com |publisher=Stockwell Park Residents' Association |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> mostly built between 1825 and 1840 and centred on Stockwell Park Road,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stockwellpark.com/stockwell-park-road/ |title=Stockwell Park Road |publisher=Stockwell Park Residents' Association |access-date=15 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427221731/http://stockwellpark.com/stockwell-park-road/ |archive-date=27 April 2016 }}</ref> Stockwell Park Crescent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockwellpark.com/stockwell-park-crescent/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007183551/http://stockwellpark.com/stockwell-park-crescent/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 October 2007 |title=Stockwell Park Crescent |publisher=Stockwell Park Residents' Association |access-date=15 July 2017}}</ref> Durand Gardens, and Albert Square.
