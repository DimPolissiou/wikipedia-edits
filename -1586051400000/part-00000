There are {{convert|11438|sqmi|km2}} within the diocese. The diocese's eastern border is at the Mississippi River; the northern border comprises the counties of [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper]], [[Poweshiek County, Iowa|Poweshiek]], [[Iowa County, Iowa|Iowa]], [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]], [[Cedar County, Iowa|Cedar]], and [[Clinton County, Iowa|Clinton]]; the western border is made up of the counties of [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper]], [[Marion County, Iowa|Marion]], [[Monroe County, Iowa|Monroe]], and [[Appanoose County, Iowa|Appanoose]]; and the southern border is the Iowa\u2013[[Missouri]] border.\n\nThe current bishop of the diocese is Bishop [[Thomas Zinkula]]. It is a suffragan see of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. The [[Episcopal see|See city]] for the diocese is [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]]. [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Davenport, Iowa)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] is the [[cathedral]] church.\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Vincent Center Davenport Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|225px|St. Vincent Center, the Diocesan Pastoral Center]]\nBefore 1881, the Diocese of Dubuque's territory comprised the entire state of Iowa. Previous divisions had taken territory outside the state of Iowa from the Diocese to give to other newly created Dioceses. Eventually, Bishop John Hennessy became convinced that the [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] Diocese should be further divided, with the Dubuque Diocese covering the northern half of the state, and the southern half covered by a new diocese. Hennessy felt that the [[Episcopal see|See]] of this new Diocese should have been located at [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. However the [[Holy See]] chose [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] as the See city of this Diocese.\n\nOn June 14, 1881, the southern territory of the Dubuque Diocese was taken to form the Diocese of Davenport.<ref name=hierarchy>{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|ddave|Diocese of Davenport|21 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=giga>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/dave0.htm|title=Diocese of Davenport|publisher=GCatholic.org|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> Fr. John McMullen, a priest in the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] was chosen to be the first Bishop. Bishop McMullen was consecrated by Archbishop [[Patrick Feehan]] of Chicago, Bishop John Hennessy of Dubuque, and Bishop John Lancaster Spalding of [[Diocese of Peoria|Peoria]].\n\nThe Diocese of Davenport was split in two on August 12, 1911, which reduced it to its current size. The [[Diocese of Des Moines]] became the See city of this new diocese, which covered the southwestern quarter of the state of Iowa.\n\n==Sexual Abuse Scandal==\nIn recent years, the diocese of Davenport has been affected by the [[Sexual abuse scandal in Davenport diocese|abuse scandal]] involving members of the clergy and focused on [[Lawrence Donald Soens|Bishop Lawrence Soens]].

It was founded by the diocese\u2019s first bishop, Rt. Rev. John McMullen, in the school building of St. Margaret\u2019s Cathedral. The school moved to its current location in 1885. Its name was changed to St. Ambrose College in 1908 to better reflect its identity. The school grew steadily over the years and in 1987 it became St. Ambrose University.<ref name=SAU>{{cite web|url=http://www.sau.edu/About_SAU/History.html|title=History|publisher=[[St. Ambrose University]]|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congregation of the Humility of Mary]] founded two schools in the diocese. The first school was established at their motherhouse when it was in [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]]. Founded as Visitation Academy in 1864, it had several name changes until 1930 when it was named [[Ottumwa Heights College]]. Ottumwa Heights merged with [[Indian Hills Community College]], a part of the state of Iowa\u2019s community college system, in 1979 and has been officially inactive since 1980.

By the 1950s it had become a separate institution, and it started admitting men in 1969. The school, however, started to decline in enrollment as well as financially. In 1990, Marycrest became affiliated with the Teikyo Yamanashi Education and Welfare Foundation of [[Japan]] and was renamed Teikyo Marycrest University. In 1996, the institution's name was changed to Marycrest International University in an attempt to reflect its global mission.

There are {{convert|11438|sqmi|km2}} within the diocese. The diocese's eastern border is at the Mississippi River; the northern border comprises the counties of [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper]], [[Poweshiek County, Iowa|Poweshiek]], [[Iowa County, Iowa|Iowa]], [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson]], [[Cedar County, Iowa|Cedar]], and [[Clinton County, Iowa|Clinton]]; the western border is made up of the counties of [[Jasper County, Iowa|Jasper]], [[Marion County, Iowa|Marion]], [[Monroe County, Iowa|Monroe]], and [[Appanoose County, Iowa|Appanoose]]; and the southern border is the Iowa\u2013[[Missouri]] border.\n\nThe current bishop of the diocese is Bishop [[Thomas Zinkula]]. It is a suffragan see of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. The [[Episcopal see|See city]] for the diocese is [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]]. [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Davenport, Iowa)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]] is the [[cathedral]] church.\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Vincent Center Davenport Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|225px|St. Vincent Center, the Diocesan Pastoral Center]]\nBefore 1881, the Diocese of Dubuque's territory comprised the entire state of Iowa. Previous divisions had taken territory outside the state of Iowa from the Diocese to give to other newly created Dioceses. Eventually, Bishop John Hennessy became convinced that the [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] Diocese should be further divided, with the Dubuque Diocese covering the northern half of the state, and the southern half covered by a new diocese. Hennessy felt that the [[Episcopal see|See]] of this new Diocese should have been located at [[Des Moines, Iowa]]. However the [[Holy See]] chose [[Davenport, Iowa|Davenport]] as the See city of this Diocese.\n\nOn June 14, 1881, the southern territory of the Dubuque Diocese was taken to form the Diocese of Davenport.<ref name=hierarchy>{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|ddave|Diocese of Davenport|21 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=giga>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/dave0.htm|title=Diocese of Davenport|publisher=GCatholic.org|accessdate=2007-02-04}}</ref> Fr. John McMullen, a priest in the [[Archdiocese of Chicago]] was chosen to be the first Bishop. Bishop McMullen was consecrated by Archbishop [[Patrick Feehan]] of Chicago, Bishop John Hennessy of Dubuque, and Bishop John Lancaster Spalding of [[Diocese of Peoria|Peoria]].\n\nThe Diocese of Davenport was split in two on August 12, 1911, which reduced it to its current size. The [[Diocese of Des Moines]] became the See city of this new diocese, which covered the southwestern quarter of the state of Iowa.\n\n==Sexual Abuse Scandal==\nIn recent years, the diocese of Davenport has been affected by the [[Sexual abuse scandal in Davenport diocese|abuse scandal]] involving members of the clergy and focused on [[Lawrence Donald Soens|Bishop Lawrence Soens]].

At one time there were four Catholic colleges within the boundaries of the Diocese of Davenport. Today there is only one, [[Saint Ambrose University]].\n\n[[File:Christ the King Chapel Davenport Iowa.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Christ the King Chapel at St. Ambrose.]]\nSt. Ambrose began as a [[seminary]] and school of commerce for young men in September 1882. It was founded by the diocese\u2019s first bishop, Rt. Rev. John McMullen, in the school building of St. Margaret\u2019s Cathedral. The school moved to its current location in 1885. Its name was changed to St. Ambrose College in 1908 to better reflect its identity. The school grew steadily over the years and in 1987 it became St. Ambrose University.<ref name=SAU>{{cite web|url=http://www.sau.edu/About_SAU/History.html|title=History|publisher=[[St. Ambrose University]]|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congregation of the Humility of Mary]] founded two schools in the diocese. The first school was established at their motherhouse when it was in [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]]. Founded as Visitation Academy in 1864, it had several name changes until 1930 when it was named [[Ottumwa Heights College]]. Ottumwa Heights merged with [[Indian Hills Community College]], a part of the state of Iowa\u2019s community college system, in 1979 and has been officially inactive since 1980.

By the 1950s it had become a separate institution, and it started admitting men in 1969. The school, however, started to decline in enrollment as well as financially. In 1990, Marycrest became affiliated with the Teikyo Yamanashi Education and Welfare Foundation of [[Japan]] and was renamed Teikyo Marycrest University. In 1996, the institution's name was changed to Marycrest International University in an attempt to reflect its global mission.

Conte's skill for composing music and original arrangements was noted by music producer Lilli Greco, who paired Conte with lyricist Vito Pallavicini.

Following a series of well-received shows at Club Tenco in Sanremo in 1976 and the commercial success of his third album, 'Un gelato al limon', Conte concentrated almost exclusively on his solo career.\n\nSome of Conte's most popular songs have been used as film soundtracks, including \"Come Di\" in ''[[I Am David]]'' (2003) and ''[[Mickey Blue Eyes]]'' (1999), \"Via con me\" in ''[[French Kiss (1995 film)|French Kiss]]'' (1995), ''[[Mostly Martha (film)|Mostly Martha]]'' (2001) and ''[[Welcome to Collinwood]]'' (2002).

The 84 pledged delegates to the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]] will be allocated proportionally on the basis of the results of the primary. Of the 77 pledged delegates, between 5 and 11 are allocated to each of the [[Wisconsin's congressional districts|state's 8 congressional districts]] and another 10 are allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates), in addition to 29 at-large pledged delegates.

IPv6 was developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of [[IPv4 address exhaustion]]. IPv6 is intended to replace [[IPv4]].<ref name=\"ipv6nz\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipv6.org.nz/ipv6-faqs/|title=FAQs|author=New Zealand IPv6 Task Force|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF,<ref name=\"rfc2460\" /> who subsequently ratified it as an [[Internet Standard]] on 14 July 2017.<ref name=\"rfc8200\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/07/rfc-8200-ipv6-has-been-standardized/ | title=RFC 8200 \u2013 IPv6 has been standardized | first=Aftab |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Internet Society | date=17 July 2017 |access-date=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDevices on the Internet are assigned a unique [[IP address]] for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a [[128-bit]] address, theoretically allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use.  The two protocols are not designed to be [[interoperable]], and thus direct communication between them is impossible, complicating the move to IPv6. However, several [[IPv6 transition mechanisms|transition mechanisms]] have been devised to rectify this.\n\nIPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate [[route aggregation]] across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of [[routing table]]s. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups, separated by colons, of four [[hexadecimal]] digits. The full representation may be simplified by several methods of notation; for example, ''2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'' becomes ''2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334''.\n\n{{toc level|3}}\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Ipv6 address leading zeros.svg|thumb|300px|Decomposition of the [[IPv6 address]] representation into its binary form]]\nIPv6 is an [[Internet Layer]] protocol for [[Packet switching|packet-switched]] [[internetworking]] and provides end-to-end [[datagram]] transmission across multiple IP networks, closely adhering to the design principles developed in the previous version of the protocol, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nIn addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address configuration, network renumbering, and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets in routers by placing the responsibility for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 [[subnetwork|subnet]] size is standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits.\n\nThe addressing architecture of IPv6 is defined in {{IETF RFC|4291}} and allows three different types of transmission: [[unicast]], [[anycast]] and [[multicast]].<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\">{{Cite book|title=Linux Kernel Networking: Implementation and Theory| author=Rami Rosen | publisher=Apress | year=2014|isbn=9781430261971|location = New York|oclc=869747983}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\n==Motivation and origin==\n\n===IPv4 address exhaustion===\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted [[IPv4 address]] representation to its binary value]]\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) was the first publicly used version of the [[Internet Protocol]]. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a [[United States Department of Defense]] [[government agency|agency]], before becoming the foundation for the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. IPv4 includes an addressing system that uses numerical identifiers consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in [[quad-dotted notation]] as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 2<sup>32</sup> or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts.<ref>{{cite video|title=Google IPv6 Conference 2008: What will the IPv6 Internet look like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZo69JQoLb8|time=13:35}}</ref> During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless network]] model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.<ref name=rfc1752>{{cite IETF |title= The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol|rfc=1752 |first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|date=January 1995|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe last unassigned top-level address blocks of 16 million IPv4 addresses were allocated in February 2011 by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) to the five [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). However, each RIR still has available address pools and is expected to continue with standard address allocation policies until one /8 [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) block remains. After that, only blocks of 1024 addresses (/22) will be provided from the RIRs to a [[local Internet registry]] (LIR).

However, most transport and application-layer protocols need little or no change to operate over IPv6; exceptions are application protocols that embed Internet-layer addresses, such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), where the new address format may cause conflicts with existing protocol syntax.\n\n===Larger address space===\nThe main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4.<ref name=rfc2460/> The address space therefore has 2<sup>128</sup> or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456, which is approximately 340 [[undecillion]], or 340 billion billion billion billion, addresses). As with IPv4, some of these addresses are [[Reserved IP addresses|reserved for special uses]].\n\nIn addition, the IPv4 address space is poorly allocated; in 2011, approximately 14% of all available addresses were utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|title=Moving to IPv6: Now for the hard part (FAQ)|publisher=CNET News|work=Deep Tech|accessdate=3 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209082433/http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|archive-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> While these numbers are large, it was not the intent of the designers of the IPv6 address space to assure geographical saturation{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with usable addresses. Rather, the longer addresses simplify allocation of addresses, enable efficient [[route aggregation]], and allow implementation of special addressing features. In IPv4, complex [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods were developed to make the best use of the small address space. The standard size of a subnet in IPv6 is 2<sup>64</sup> addresses, more than 4 billion times the size of the entire IPv4 address space. Thus, actual address space utilization rates will be small in IPv6, but network management and routing efficiency are improved by the large subnet space and hierarchical route aggregation.\n\n===Multicasting===\n[[Multicast]]ing, the transmission of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, is part of the base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional (although commonly implemented) feature.<ref name=rfc1112>{{IETF RFC|1112}}, ''Host extensions for IP multicasting'', S. Deering (August 1989)</ref> IPv6 multicast addressing has features and protocols in common with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional [[Broadcast IP address|IP broadcast]], i.e. the transmission of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special ''broadcast address'', and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result is achieved by sending a packet to the link-local ''all nodes'' multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast group address, which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.<ref name=rfc3956>{{IETF RFC|3956}}, ''Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address'', P. Savola, B. Haberman (November 2004)</ref>\n\nIn IPv4 it is very difficult for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2908}}, ''The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture'', D. Thaler, M. Handley, D. Estrin (September 2000)</ref> Unicast address assignments by a [[local Internet registry]] for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3306}}, ''Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses'', B. Haberman, D. Thaler (August 2002)</ref>\n\n===Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)===\n{{See also|IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|l1=IPv6 address \u00a7 Stateless address autoconfiguration}}\n\nIPv6 hosts configure themselves automatically. Every interface has a self-generated link-local address and, when connected to a network, conflict resolution is performed and routers provide network prefixes via router advertisements.<ref name=rfc4862/> Stateless configuration of routers can be achieved with a special router renumbering protocol.<ref name=rfc2894>{{IETF RFC|2894}}, ''Router Renumbering for IPv6'', M. Crawford, August 2000.</ref> When necessary, hosts may configure additional stateful addresses via [[DHCPv6|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6]] (DHCPv6) or static addresses manually.\n\nLike IPv4, IPv6 supports globally unique [[IP address]]es. The design of IPv6 intended to re-emphasize the end-to-end principle of network design that was originally conceived during the establishment of the early Internet by rendering [[network address translation]] obsolete. Therefore, every device on the network is globally addressable directly from any other device.\n\nA stable, unique, globally addressable IP address would facilitate tracking a device across networks. Therefore, such addresses are a particular privacy concern for mobile devices, such as laptops and cell phones.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/privacy-extensions-for-ipv6-slaac/ |title= Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 |author=T.

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations,<ref name=rfc2460/> and [[Internet Key Exchange]] (IKE) was recommended, but with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6. However, as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of [[Cryptography|cryptographic algorithms]]. This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating Security Payload header (ESP) are implemented as IPv6 extension headers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network |author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4493-3526-7 |page=196 |edition=3rd |location=Sebastopol, CA |oclc=881832733}}</ref>\n\n===Simplified processing by routers===\nThe packet header in IPv6 is simpler than the IPv4 header. Many rarely used fields have been moved to optional header extensions.<ref name=\"History of Domain Names\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|title=The History of Domain Names {{!}} IPv6|website=www.historyofdomainnames.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612211153/http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|archive-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> With the simplified IPv6 packet header the process of packet forwarding by [[Router (computing)|routers]] has been simplified. Although IPv6 packet headers are at least twice the size of IPv4 packet headers, processing of packets that only contain the base IPv6 header by routers may, in some case, be more efficient, because less processing is required in routers due to the headers being aligned to match common [[Word (computer architecture)|word sizes]].<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726/> However, many devices implement IPv6 support in software (as opposed to hardware), thus resulting in very bad packet processing performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPv6 Security Assessment and Benchmarking|first=E.|last=Zack|date=July 2013|url=http://www.ipv6hackers.org/meetings/ipv6-hackers-1}}</ref> Additionally, for many implementations, the use of Extension Headers causes packets to be processed by a router's CPU, leading to poor performance or even security issues.<ref name=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03>{{cite web|work=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03|title=Operational Implications of IPv6 Packets with Extension Headers|first=F.|last=Gont|date=March 2016|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, an IPv6 header does not include a checksum. The [[IPv4 header checksum]] is calculated for the IPv4 header, and has to be recalculated by routers every time the [[time to live]] (called [[hop limit]] in the IPv6 protocol) is reduced by one. The absence of a checksum in the IPv6 header furthers the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet design, which envisioned that most processing in the network occurs in the leaf nodes. Integrity protection for the data that is encapsulated in the IPv6 packet is assumed to be assured by both the [[link layer]] or error detection in higher-layer protocols, namely the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on the [[transport layer]]. Thus, while IPv4 allowed UDP datagram headers to have no checksum (indicated by 0 in the header field), IPv6 requires a checksum in UDP headers.\n\nIPv6 routers do not perform [[IP fragmentation]]. IPv6 hosts are required to either perform [[path MTU discovery]], perform end-to-end fragmentation, or to send packets no larger than the default [[Maximum transmission unit]] (MTU), which is 1280 [[octet (computing)|octets]].\n\n===Mobility===\nUnlike mobile IPv4, [[mobile IPv6]] avoids [[triangular routing]] and is therefore as efficient as native IPv6. IPv6 routers may also allow entire subnets to move to a new router connection point without renumbering.<ref name=rfc3963>{{IETF RFC|3963}}, ''Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Protocol Support'', V. Devarapalli, R. Wakikawa, A. Petrescu, P. Thubert (January 2005)</ref>\n\n===Extension headers===\nThe IPv6 packet header has a minimum size of 40 octets (320 bits). Options are implemented as extensions. This provides the opportunity to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the core packet structure.<ref name=rfc2460/> However, RFC 7872 notes that some network operators drop IPv6 packets with extension headers when they traverse transit [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]].\n\n====Jumbograms====\nIPv4 limits packets to 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22121) octets of payload. An IPv6 node can optionally handle packets over this limit, referred to as [[jumbogram]]s, which can be as large as 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup>\u22121) octets. The use of jumbograms may improve performance over high-[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] links. The use of jumbograms is indicated by the Jumbo Payload Option extension header.<ref name=rfc2675>{{IETF RFC|2675}}, ''IPv6 Jumbograms'', D. Borman, [[Steve Deering|S. Deering]], R. Hinden (August 1999)</ref>\n\n==IPv6 packets==\n{{Main|IPv6 packet}}\n[[File:Ipv6 header.svg|thumb|IPv6 packet header]]\n\nAn IPv6 packet has two parts: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and [[Payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nThe header consists of a fixed portion with minimal functionality required for all packets and may be followed by optional extensions to implement special features.\n\nThe fixed header occupies the first 40&nbsp;[[octet (computing)|octets]] (320 bits) of the IPv6 packet. It contains the source and destination addresses, traffic classification options, a hop counter, and the type of the optional extension or payload which follows the header. This ''Next Header'' field tells the receiver how to interpret the data which follows the header. If the packet contains options, this field contains the option type of the next option. The \"Next Header\" field of the last option, points to the upper-layer protocol that is carried in the packet's [[payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nExtension headers carry options that are used for special treatment of a packet in the network, e.g., for routing, fragmentation, and for security using the [[IPsec]] framework.\n\nWithout special options, a payload must be less than {{gaps|64|kB}}. With a Jumbo Payload option (in a ''Hop-By-Hop Options'' extension header), the payload must be less than 4&nbsp;GB.\n\nUnlike with IPv4, routers never fragment a packet. Hosts are expected to use [[Path MTU Discovery]] to make their packets small enough to reach the destination without needing to be fragmented. See [[IPv6 packet#Fragmentation|IPv6 packet fragmentation]].\n\n==Addressing==\n[[IPv6 address]]es have 128 bits. The design of the IPv6 address space implements a different design philosophy than in IPv4, in which subnetting was used to improve the efficiency of utilization of the small address space. In IPv6, the address space is deemed large enough for the foreseeable future, and a local area subnet always uses 64 bits for the host portion of the address, designated as the interface identifier, while the most-significant 64 bits are used as the routing prefix.<ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}, p. 9</ref> While the myth has existed regarding IPv6 subnets being impossible to scan, RFC 7707 notes that patterns resulting from some IPv6 address configuration techniques and algorithms allow for address scanning in many real-world scenarios.\n\n===Address representation===\nThe 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.

For example, the group {{IPaddr|0042}} is converted to {{IPaddr|42}}.\n* Consecutive sections of zeros are replaced with a double colon (::). The double colon may only be used once in an address, as multiple use would render the address indeterminate. {{IETF RFC|5952}} requires that a double colon not be used to denote an omitted single section of zeros.<ref name=rfc5952sec422>{{cite web|rfc=5952|title=A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation|author=S.

Kawamura| url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952| date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Link-local address===\nAll interfaces of IPv6 hosts require a [[link-local address]]. IPv6 link-local addresses have the prefix {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}. This prefix is combined with a 64 bit suffix, which the host can compute and/or assign by itself\u2014without configuration and without the presence or cooperation of an external network component like a DHCP server.\n\nThe lower 64 bits of the link local address (the suffix) were originally derived from the MAC address of the underlying network interface card. As this method of assigning addresses would cause undesirable address changes when faulty network cards were replaced, and as it also suffered from a number of security and privacy issues, RFC 8064 has replaced the original MAC-based method with the hash-based method specified in RFC 7217.\n\n===Address uniqueness and router solicitation===\nIPv6 uses a new mechanism for mapping IP addresses to link layer addresses ([[MAC address]]es), because it does not support the [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] addressing method, on which the functionality of the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) in IPv4 is based. IPv6 implements the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP, ND) in the [[link layer]], which relies on [[ICMPv6]] and [[multicast]] transmission.<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\"/>{{rp|210}} IPv6 hosts verify the uniqueness of their IPv6 addresses in a [[local area network]] (LAN) by sending a neighbor solicitation message asking for the link layer address of the IP address.

This permits dual-stack hosts to participate in IPv6 and IPv4 networks simultaneously. The method is defined in {{IETF RFC|4213}}.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=4213|title=Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers|publisher=IETF| url =https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4213 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>\n\nA device with dual-stack implementation in the operating system has an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and can communicate with other nodes in the LAN or the Internet using either IPv4 or IPv6. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol is used by both IP protocols to resolve [[fully qualified domain name]]s (FQDN) and IP addresses, but dual stack requires that the resolving DNS server can resolve both types of addresses. Such a dual stack DNS server would hold IPv4 addresses in the A records, and IPv6 addresses in the AAAA records. Depending on the destination that is to be resolved, a DNS name server may return an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address, or both. A default address selection mechanism, or preferred protocol, needs to be configured either on hosts or the DNS server. The [[IETF]] has published [[Happy Eyeballs]] to assist dual stack applications, so that they can connect using both IPv4 and IPv6, but prefer an IPv6 connection if it is available. However, dual-stack also needs to be implemented on all [[Router (computing)|routers]] between the host and the service for which the DNS server has returned an IPv6 address. Dual-stack clients should only be configured to prefer IPv6, if the network is able to forward IPv6 packets using the IPv6 versions of [[routing protocols]]. When dual stack networks protocols are in place the [[application layer]] can be migrated to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222}}</ref>\n\nWhile dual-stack is supported by major [[operating system]] and [[network device]] vendors, legacy networking hardware and servers don't support IPv6.\n\n=== ISP customers with public-facing IPv6 ===\n[[File:IPv6 Prefix Assignment Example-en.svg|thumb|500px|IPv6 Prefix Assignment mechanism with IANA, RIRs, and ISPs.]]\n[[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) are increasingly providing their business and private customers with public-facing IPv6 global unicast addresses. However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using [[NAT64]], a [[network address translation]] (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with public-facing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, thus supporting dual stack networking, because some ISPs have exhausted their globally routable IPv4 address pool. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach IPv4 [[web servers]] and other destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/ipv6-dual-stack-understanding.html |title= Understanding Dual Stacking of IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast Addresses | author=Juniper TechLibrary |date= 31 August 2017 |website= www.juniper.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA significant percentage of ISPs in all [[regional Internet registry]] (RIR) zones have obtained IPv6 address space.

ISPs report the share of IPv6 traffic from customers over their network to be anything between 20% and 40%, but by mid-2017 IPv6 traffic still only accounted for a fraction of total traffic at several large [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs). [[AMS-IX]] reported it to be 2% and [[SeattleIX]] reported 7%. A 2017 survey found that many DSL customers that were served by a dual stack ISP did not request DNS servers to resolve fully qualified domain names into IPv6 addresses. The survey also found that the majority of traffic from IPv6-ready webserver resources were still requested and served over IPv4, mostly due to ISP customers that did not use the dual stack facility provided by their ISP and to a lesser extent due to customers of IPv4-only ISPs.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://blog.apnic.net/2017/06/13/stops-ipv6-traffic-dual-stack-isp/ |title= What stops IPv6 traffic in a dual-stack ISP? | author=  Enric Pujol |date=  2017-06-12|website= www.apnic.net |access-date= 13 Jun 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tunneling===\nThe technical basis for tunneling, or encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets, is outlined in RFC 4213.

Teredo is outlined in RFC 4380 and allows IPv6 [[local area networks]] to tunnel over IPv4 networks, by encapsulating IPv6 packets within UDP. The Teredo relay is an IPv6 router that mediates between a Teredo server and the native IPv6 network. It was expected that 6to4 and Teredo would be widely deployed until ISP networks would switch to native IPv6, but by 2014 Google Statistics showed that the use of both mechanisms had dropped to almost 0.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n===IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses===\nHybrid dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 implementations recognize a special class of addresses, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. These addresses are typically written with a 96-bit prefix in the standard IPv6 format, and the remaining 32 bits written in the customary [[dot-decimal notation]] of IPv4.\n\nAddresses in this group consist of an 80-bit prefix of zeros, the next 16 bits are ones, and the remaining, least-significant 32 bits contain the IPv4 address. For example, ::ffff:192.0.2.128 represents the IPv4 address 192.0.2.128.

IPv6 is intended to replace [[IPv4]].<ref name=\"ipv6nz\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipv6.org.nz/ipv6-faqs/|title=FAQs|author=New Zealand IPv6 Task Force|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF,<ref name=\"rfc2460\" /> who subsequently ratified it as an [[Internet Standard]] on 14 July 2017.<ref name=\"rfc8200\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/07/rfc-8200-ipv6-has-been-standardized/ | title=RFC 8200 \u2013 IPv6 has been standardized | first=Aftab |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Internet Society | date=17 July 2017 |access-date=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDevices on the Internet are assigned a unique [[IP address]] for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a [[128-bit]] address, theoretically allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use.  The two protocols are not designed to be [[interoperable]], and thus direct communication between them is impossible, complicating the move to IPv6. However, several [[IPv6 transition mechanisms|transition mechanisms]] have been devised to rectify this.\n\nIPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate [[route aggregation]] across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of [[routing table]]s. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups, separated by colons, of four [[hexadecimal]] digits. The full representation may be simplified by several methods of notation; for example, ''2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'' becomes ''2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334''.\n\n{{toc level|3}}\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Ipv6 address leading zeros.svg|thumb|300px|Decomposition of the [[IPv6 address]] representation into its binary form]]\nIPv6 is an [[Internet Layer]] protocol for [[Packet switching|packet-switched]] [[internetworking]] and provides end-to-end [[datagram]] transmission across multiple IP networks, closely adhering to the design principles developed in the previous version of the protocol, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nIn addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address configuration, network renumbering, and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets in routers by placing the responsibility for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 [[subnetwork|subnet]] size is standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits.\n\nThe addressing architecture of IPv6 is defined in {{IETF RFC|4291}} and allows three different types of transmission: [[unicast]], [[anycast]] and [[multicast]].<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\">{{Cite book|title=Linux Kernel Networking: Implementation and Theory| author=Rami Rosen | publisher=Apress | year=2014|isbn=9781430261971|location = New York|oclc=869747983}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\n==Motivation and origin==\n\n===IPv4 address exhaustion===\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted [[IPv4 address]] representation to its binary value]]\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) was the first publicly used version of the [[Internet Protocol]]. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a [[United States Department of Defense]] [[government agency|agency]], before becoming the foundation for the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. IPv4 includes an addressing system that uses numerical identifiers consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in [[quad-dotted notation]] as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 2<sup>32</sup> or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts.<ref>{{cite video|title=Google IPv6 Conference 2008: What will the IPv6 Internet look like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZo69JQoLb8|time=13:35}}</ref> During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless network]] model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.<ref name=rfc1752>{{cite IETF |title= The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol|rfc=1752 |first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|date=January 1995|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe last unassigned top-level address blocks of 16 million IPv4 addresses were allocated in February 2011 by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) to the five [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). However, each RIR still has available address pools and is expected to continue with standard address allocation policies until one /8 [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) block remains. After that, only blocks of 1024 addresses (/22) will be provided from the RIRs to a [[local Internet registry]] (LIR).

However, most transport and application-layer protocols need little or no change to operate over IPv6; exceptions are application protocols that embed Internet-layer addresses, such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), where the new address format may cause conflicts with existing protocol syntax.\n\n===Larger address space===\nThe main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4.<ref name=rfc2460/> The address space therefore has 2<sup>128</sup> or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456, which is approximately 340 [[undecillion]], or 340 billion billion billion billion, addresses). As with IPv4, some of these addresses are [[Reserved IP addresses|reserved for special uses]].\n\nIn addition, the IPv4 address space is poorly allocated; in 2011, approximately 14% of all available addresses were utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|title=Moving to IPv6: Now for the hard part (FAQ)|publisher=CNET News|work=Deep Tech|accessdate=3 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209082433/http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|archive-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> While these numbers are large, it was not the intent of the designers of the IPv6 address space to assure geographical saturation{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with usable addresses. Rather, the longer addresses simplify allocation of addresses, enable efficient [[route aggregation]], and allow implementation of special addressing features. In IPv4, complex [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods were developed to make the best use of the small address space. The standard size of a subnet in IPv6 is 2<sup>64</sup> addresses, more than 4 billion times the size of the entire IPv4 address space. Thus, actual address space utilization rates will be small in IPv6, but network management and routing efficiency are improved by the large subnet space and hierarchical route aggregation.\n\n===Multicasting===\n[[Multicast]]ing, the transmission of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, is part of the base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional (although commonly implemented) feature.<ref name=rfc1112>{{IETF RFC|1112}}, ''Host extensions for IP multicasting'', S. Deering (August 1989)</ref> IPv6 multicast addressing has features and protocols in common with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional [[Broadcast IP address|IP broadcast]], i.e. the transmission of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special ''broadcast address'', and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result is achieved by sending a packet to the link-local ''all nodes'' multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast group address, which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.<ref name=rfc3956>{{IETF RFC|3956}}, ''Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address'', P. Savola, B. Haberman (November 2004)</ref>\n\nIn IPv4 it is very difficult for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2908}}, ''The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture'', D. Thaler, M. Handley, D. Estrin (September 2000)</ref> Unicast address assignments by a [[local Internet registry]] for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3306}}, ''Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses'', B. Haberman, D. Thaler (August 2002)</ref>\n\n===Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)===\n{{See also|IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|l1=IPv6 address \u00a7 Stateless address autoconfiguration}}\n\nIPv6 hosts configure themselves automatically. Every interface has a self-generated link-local address and, when connected to a network, conflict resolution is performed and routers provide network prefixes via router advertisements.<ref name=rfc4862/> Stateless configuration of routers can be achieved with a special router renumbering protocol.<ref name=rfc2894>{{IETF RFC|2894}}, ''Router Renumbering for IPv6'', M. Crawford, August 2000.</ref> When necessary, hosts may configure additional stateful addresses via [[DHCPv6|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6]] (DHCPv6) or static addresses manually.\n\nLike IPv4, IPv6 supports globally unique [[IP address]]es. The design of IPv6 intended to re-emphasize the end-to-end principle of network design that was originally conceived during the establishment of the early Internet by rendering [[network address translation]] obsolete. Therefore, every device on the network is globally addressable directly from any other device.\n\nA stable, unique, globally addressable IP address would facilitate tracking a device across networks. Therefore, such addresses are a particular privacy concern for mobile devices, such as laptops and cell phones.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/privacy-extensions-for-ipv6-slaac/ |title= Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 |author=T.

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations,<ref name=rfc2460/> and [[Internet Key Exchange]] (IKE) was recommended, but with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6. However, as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of [[Cryptography|cryptographic algorithms]]. This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating Security Payload header (ESP) are implemented as IPv6 extension headers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network |author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4493-3526-7 |page=196 |edition=3rd |location=Sebastopol, CA |oclc=881832733}}</ref>\n\n===Simplified processing by routers===\nThe packet header in IPv6 is simpler than the IPv4 header. Many rarely used fields have been moved to optional header extensions.<ref name=\"History of Domain Names\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|title=The History of Domain Names {{!}} IPv6|website=www.historyofdomainnames.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612211153/http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|archive-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> With the simplified IPv6 packet header the process of packet forwarding by [[Router (computing)|routers]] has been simplified. Although IPv6 packet headers are at least twice the size of IPv4 packet headers, processing of packets that only contain the base IPv6 header by routers may, in some case, be more efficient, because less processing is required in routers due to the headers being aligned to match common [[Word (computer architecture)|word sizes]].<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726/> However, many devices implement IPv6 support in software (as opposed to hardware), thus resulting in very bad packet processing performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPv6 Security Assessment and Benchmarking|first=E.|last=Zack|date=July 2013|url=http://www.ipv6hackers.org/meetings/ipv6-hackers-1}}</ref> Additionally, for many implementations, the use of Extension Headers causes packets to be processed by a router's CPU, leading to poor performance or even security issues.<ref name=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03>{{cite web|work=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03|title=Operational Implications of IPv6 Packets with Extension Headers|first=F.|last=Gont|date=March 2016|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, an IPv6 header does not include a checksum. The [[IPv4 header checksum]] is calculated for the IPv4 header, and has to be recalculated by routers every time the [[time to live]] (called [[hop limit]] in the IPv6 protocol) is reduced by one. The absence of a checksum in the IPv6 header furthers the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet design, which envisioned that most processing in the network occurs in the leaf nodes. Integrity protection for the data that is encapsulated in the IPv6 packet is assumed to be assured by both the [[link layer]] or error detection in higher-layer protocols, namely the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on the [[transport layer]]. Thus, while IPv4 allowed UDP datagram headers to have no checksum (indicated by 0 in the header field), IPv6 requires a checksum in UDP headers.\n\nIPv6 routers do not perform [[IP fragmentation]]. IPv6 hosts are required to either perform [[path MTU discovery]], perform end-to-end fragmentation, or to send packets no larger than the default [[Maximum transmission unit]] (MTU), which is 1280 [[octet (computing)|octets]].\n\n===Mobility===\nUnlike mobile IPv4, [[mobile IPv6]] avoids [[triangular routing]] and is therefore as efficient as native IPv6. IPv6 routers may also allow entire subnets to move to a new router connection point without renumbering.<ref name=rfc3963>{{IETF RFC|3963}}, ''Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Protocol Support'', V. Devarapalli, R. Wakikawa, A. Petrescu, P. Thubert (January 2005)</ref>\n\n===Extension headers===\nThe IPv6 packet header has a minimum size of 40 octets (320 bits). Options are implemented as extensions. This provides the opportunity to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the core packet structure.<ref name=rfc2460/> However, RFC 7872 notes that some network operators drop IPv6 packets with extension headers when they traverse transit [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]].\n\n====Jumbograms====\nIPv4 limits packets to 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22121) octets of payload. An IPv6 node can optionally handle packets over this limit, referred to as [[jumbogram]]s, which can be as large as 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup>\u22121) octets. The use of jumbograms may improve performance over high-[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] links. The use of jumbograms is indicated by the Jumbo Payload Option extension header.<ref name=rfc2675>{{IETF RFC|2675}}, ''IPv6 Jumbograms'', D. Borman, [[Steve Deering|S. Deering]], R. Hinden (August 1999)</ref>\n\n==IPv6 packets==\n{{Main|IPv6 packet}}\n[[File:Ipv6 header.svg|thumb|IPv6 packet header]]\n\nAn IPv6 packet has two parts: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and [[Payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nThe header consists of a fixed portion with minimal functionality required for all packets and may be followed by optional extensions to implement special features.\n\nThe fixed header occupies the first 40&nbsp;[[octet (computing)|octets]] (320 bits) of the IPv6 packet. It contains the source and destination addresses, traffic classification options, a hop counter, and the type of the optional extension or payload which follows the header. This ''Next Header'' field tells the receiver how to interpret the data which follows the header. If the packet contains options, this field contains the option type of the next option. The \"Next Header\" field of the last option, points to the upper-layer protocol that is carried in the packet's [[payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nExtension headers carry options that are used for special treatment of a packet in the network, e.g., for routing, fragmentation, and for security using the [[IPsec]] framework.\n\nWithout special options, a payload must be less than {{gaps|64|kB}}. With a Jumbo Payload option (in a ''Hop-By-Hop Options'' extension header), the payload must be less than 4&nbsp;GB.\n\nUnlike with IPv4, routers never fragment a packet. Hosts are expected to use [[Path MTU Discovery]] to make their packets small enough to reach the destination without needing to be fragmented. See [[IPv6 packet#Fragmentation|IPv6 packet fragmentation]].\n\n==Addressing==\n[[IPv6 address]]es have 128 bits. The design of the IPv6 address space implements a different design philosophy than in IPv4, in which subnetting was used to improve the efficiency of utilization of the small address space. In IPv6, the address space is deemed large enough for the foreseeable future, and a local area subnet always uses 64 bits for the host portion of the address, designated as the interface identifier, while the most-significant 64 bits are used as the routing prefix.<ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}, p. 9</ref> While the myth has existed regarding IPv6 subnets being impossible to scan, RFC 7707 notes that patterns resulting from some IPv6 address configuration techniques and algorithms allow for address scanning in many real-world scenarios.\n\n===Address representation===\nThe 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.

IPv6 link-local addresses have the prefix {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}. This prefix is combined with a 64 bit suffix, which the host can compute and/or assign by itself\u2014without configuration and without the presence or cooperation of an external network component like a DHCP server.\n\nThe lower 64 bits of the link local address (the suffix) were originally derived from the MAC address of the underlying network interface card. As this method of assigning addresses would cause undesirable address changes when faulty network cards were replaced, and as it also suffered from a number of security and privacy issues, RFC 8064 has replaced the original MAC-based method with the hash-based method specified in RFC 7217.\n\n===Address uniqueness and router solicitation===\nIPv6 uses a new mechanism for mapping IP addresses to link layer addresses ([[MAC address]]es), because it does not support the [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] addressing method, on which the functionality of the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) in IPv4 is based. IPv6 implements the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP, ND) in the [[link layer]], which relies on [[ICMPv6]] and [[multicast]] transmission.<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\"/>{{rp|210}} IPv6 hosts verify the uniqueness of their IPv6 addresses in a [[local area network]] (LAN) by sending a neighbor solicitation message asking for the link layer address of the IP address.

The other information consists of one or more prefix information options for the subnets that the host is attached to, a lifetime for the prefix, and two flags:<ref name=\"T. Narten pp. 54\"/>\n** On-link: If this flag is set, the host will treat all addresses on the specific subnet as being on-link, and send packets directly to them instead of sending them to a router for the duration of the given lifetime.\n** Address: This is the flag that tells the host to actually create a global address.\n\n===Global addressing===\nThe assignment procedure for global addresses is similar to local address construction. The prefix is supplied from router advertisements on the network. Multiple prefix announcements cause multiple addresses to be configured.<ref name=\"T.

This permits dual-stack hosts to participate in IPv6 and IPv4 networks simultaneously. The method is defined in {{IETF RFC|4213}}.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=4213|title=Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers|publisher=IETF| url =https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4213 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>\n\nA device with dual-stack implementation in the operating system has an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and can communicate with other nodes in the LAN or the Internet using either IPv4 or IPv6. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol is used by both IP protocols to resolve [[fully qualified domain name]]s (FQDN) and IP addresses, but dual stack requires that the resolving DNS server can resolve both types of addresses. Such a dual stack DNS server would hold IPv4 addresses in the A records, and IPv6 addresses in the AAAA records. Depending on the destination that is to be resolved, a DNS name server may return an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address, or both. A default address selection mechanism, or preferred protocol, needs to be configured either on hosts or the DNS server. The [[IETF]] has published [[Happy Eyeballs]] to assist dual stack applications, so that they can connect using both IPv4 and IPv6, but prefer an IPv6 connection if it is available. However, dual-stack also needs to be implemented on all [[Router (computing)|routers]] between the host and the service for which the DNS server has returned an IPv6 address. Dual-stack clients should only be configured to prefer IPv6, if the network is able to forward IPv6 packets using the IPv6 versions of [[routing protocols]]. When dual stack networks protocols are in place the [[application layer]] can be migrated to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222}}</ref>\n\nWhile dual-stack is supported by major [[operating system]] and [[network device]] vendors, legacy networking hardware and servers don't support IPv6.\n\n=== ISP customers with public-facing IPv6 ===\n[[File:IPv6 Prefix Assignment Example-en.svg|thumb|500px|IPv6 Prefix Assignment mechanism with IANA, RIRs, and ISPs.]]\n[[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) are increasingly providing their business and private customers with public-facing IPv6 global unicast addresses. However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using [[NAT64]], a [[network address translation]] (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with public-facing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, thus supporting dual stack networking, because some ISPs have exhausted their globally routable IPv4 address pool. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach IPv4 [[web servers]] and other destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/ipv6-dual-stack-understanding.html |title= Understanding Dual Stacking of IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast Addresses | author=Juniper TechLibrary |date= 31 August 2017 |website= www.juniper.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA significant percentage of ISPs in all [[regional Internet registry]] (RIR) zones have obtained IPv6 address space.

ISPs report the share of IPv6 traffic from customers over their network to be anything between 20% and 40%, but by mid-2017 IPv6 traffic still only accounted for a fraction of total traffic at several large [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs). [[AMS-IX]] reported it to be 2% and [[SeattleIX]] reported 7%. A 2017 survey found that many DSL customers that were served by a dual stack ISP did not request DNS servers to resolve fully qualified domain names into IPv6 addresses. The survey also found that the majority of traffic from IPv6-ready webserver resources were still requested and served over IPv4, mostly due to ISP customers that did not use the dual stack facility provided by their ISP and to a lesser extent due to customers of IPv4-only ISPs.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://blog.apnic.net/2017/06/13/stops-ipv6-traffic-dual-stack-isp/ |title= What stops IPv6 traffic in a dual-stack ISP? | author=  Enric Pujol |date=  2017-06-12|website= www.apnic.net |access-date= 13 Jun 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tunneling===\nThe technical basis for tunneling, or encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets, is outlined in RFC 4213.

Teredo is outlined in RFC 4380 and allows IPv6 [[local area networks]] to tunnel over IPv4 networks, by encapsulating IPv6 packets within UDP. The Teredo relay is an IPv6 router that mediates between a Teredo server and the native IPv6 network. It was expected that 6to4 and Teredo would be widely deployed until ISP networks would switch to native IPv6, but by 2014 Google Statistics showed that the use of both mechanisms had dropped to almost 0.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n===IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses===\nHybrid dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 implementations recognize a special class of addresses, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

A significant portion of this IPv6 traffic was generated through their [[high energy physics]] collaboration with [[CERN]], which relies entirely on IPv6.<ref>{{Citation|title=State of IPv6 Deployment 2018|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/|page=3|year=2018|publisher=[[Internet Society]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) has supported IPv6 since 2008. In the same year, IPv6 was first used in a major world event during the Beijing [[2008 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=\"beijing2008-pressrelease\">{{cite press release|title=Beijing2008.cn leaps to next-generation Net|publisher=The Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad|date=30 May 2008|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/preparation/n214384681.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204051327/http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/official/preparation/n214384681.shtml|archive-date=4 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipv6.com/articles/general/IPv6-Olympics-2008.htm|title=IPv6 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics|last=Das|first=Kaushik|year=2008|work=IPv6.com|accessdate=15 August 2008}}</ref> \n\nBy 2011, all major operating systems in use on personal computers and server systems had production-quality IPv6 implementations. Cellular telephone systems presented a large deployment field for Internet Protocol devices as mobile telephone service made the transition from [[3G]] to [[4G]] technologies, in which voice is provisioned as a [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) service that would leverage IPv6 enhancements. In 2009, the US cellular operator [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] released technical specifications for devices to operate on its \"next-generation\" networks.<ref name=\"verizon\">{{cite web|author=Derek Morr|title=Verizon Mandates IPv6 Support for Next-Gen Cell Phones|url=http://www.circleid.com/posts/20090609_verizon_mandates_ipv6_support_for_next_gen_cell_phones/|publisher=CircleID|date=2009-06-09}}</ref> The specification mandated IPv6 operation according to the ''3GPP Release 8 Specifications (March 2009)'', and deprecated IPv4 as an optional capability.<ref name=\"verizon\" />\n\nThe deployment of IPv6 in the [[Internet backbone]] continued. In 2018 only 25.3% of the about 54,000 autonomous systems advertised both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes in the global [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) routing database. A further 243 networks advertised only an IPv6 prefix. Internet backbone transit networks offering IPv6 support existed in every country globally, except in parts of [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and China.<ref>{{Citation | title = State of IPv6 Deployment 2018 | publisher = [[Internet Society]]| year = 2018\n | url = https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/ | page =6 }}</ref> By mid-2018 some major European [[broadband]] ISPs had deployed IPv6 for the majority of their customers. [[British Sky Broadcasting]] provided over 86% of its customers with IPv6, [[Deutsche Telekom]] had 56% deployment of IPv6, [[XS4ALL]] in the Netherlands had 73% deployment and in Belgium the broadband ISPs [[VOO]] and [[Telenet]] had 73% and 63% IPv6 deployment respectively.<ref>{{Citation | title = State of IPv6 Deployment 2018 | publisher = [[Internet Society]]| year = 2018\n | url = https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/2018/state-of-ipv6-deployment-2018/ | page =7 }}</ref> In the United States the broadband ISP [[Comcast]] had an IPv6 deployment of about 66%.
