{"title_page": "Tiger ATV LTD", "text_new": "Tiger ATV, LTD was an independently owned ATV manufacturer founded in 1984, specializing in racing machines produced in low numbers. Estimates vary in the collector community, with production numbers ranging from as little as 300, to as many a 1000 units leaving the factory. An interview with R&D Manager Mickey Dunlap suggested that no more than 20 machines were produced in the winter of 1985/86, suggesting that the lower number is more accurate. Chassises were built in house, or in the case of the [[Tiger ATV LTD#Tiger KTM Powered 80cc ATC|Tiger 80]], heavily modified, and all bodywork were produced in-house, at their Burnsville, Minnesota facility, while drivetrains were provided By [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]] and [[KTM]]. Tiger produced ATC's for three years, but continued to support machines for several years after.\n\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Tiger ATV, LTD.\n| logo = \n| type = [[Private company limited by shares|Privately owned limited Company]]\n| traded_as =\n| founder = Peter Wood\n| foundation = {{start date and age|1984}}<br>Folded 1991\n| insolvency  =\n| location_city = [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| key_people =\n| industry = [[Motorsport]]\n| products = [[Three-wheeler#All-terrain vehicles|All Terrain Vehicles]]\n| homepage = Defunct\n}}\n\nTiger began producing prototype machines as early as 1983, establishing a national dealer network and advertising campaign in 1984. Unlike major manufacturers of ATC's and ATV's, who would focus on annual changes of individual models, Tiger would see incremental changes reflect simultaneously across the entire line. This led to a common dating of machines by \u201cGeneration\u201d opposed to year. Collectors correlate Gen One models as 1984's, Gen Two as 1985's and Gen Three as the 1986 model-year.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url= https://sites.google.com/site/tigerrotax/home |title=Tiger ATCs |website=Tigerrotax|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Generational Differences==\n\nThese differences can be used to identify Tiger ATC's, regardless of engine size. It is worth noting that due to the hand construction of each machine, and consistent incremental changes, Minor variations plague the entire production run.\n\nThe first generation of Tiger ATC's are recognizable for their noticeably wider front ends, comparative to other companies. This included the triple trees, number plate, fender and wheel assembly. Other features identifying Gen One models include a \u201chump\u201d on the gas tank, brass radiators, unique frame design and a diamond shape to the swing arm sidewalls. Rear fenders were unique as well, and were offered in blue.\n\nSecond Generation Tigers provides a more contemporary look, narrowing the front end, and visually aligning with other Sport ATC's of the mid-eighties. The radiator was now located on the left side of the machine and made of aluminum. The shroud is mounted below the gas tank. This iteration, manufactured in 1985, make up the bulk of Tigers production.\n\nThird Generation Tiger ATC's most striking feature is dual radiators, mounted on both sides of the machine, with higher shrouds that, when attached, aligned to the gas tank. The rear Monoshock has also been relocated, now centered to the swing arm and frame. Otherwise, Gen Three machines are similar overall to Gen Two models.\n\n==Tiger KTM Powered 80cc ATC==\n\nThe '''Tiger 80''' was based on the KTM 80cc Minicycle, designed for youth racing, and utilized the KTM engine, Forks and Frame.

Estimates vary in the collector community, with production numbers ranging from as little as 300, to as many a 1000 units leaving the factory. An interview with R&D Manager Mickey Dunlap suggested that no more than 20 machines were produced in the winter of 1985/86, suggesting that the lower number is more accurate. Chassises were built in house, or in the case of the [[Tiger ATV LTD#Tiger KTM Powered 80cc ATC|Tiger 80]], heavily modified, and all bodywork were produced in-house, at their Burnsville, Minnesota facility, while drivetrains were provided By [[Bombardier Inc.|Rotax]] and [[KTM]]. Tiger produced ATC's for three years, but continued to support machines for several years after.\n\n{{Infobox company\n| name = Tiger ATV, LTD.\n| logo = \n| type = [[Private company limited by shares|Privately owned limited Company]]\n| traded_as =\n| founder = Peter Wood\n| foundation = {{start date and age|1984}}<br>Folded 1991\n| insolvency  =\n| location_city = [[Eagan, Minnesota|Eagan]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States|U.S.]]\n| key_people =\n| industry = [[Motorsport]]\n| products = [[Three-wheeler#All-terrain vehicles|All Terrain Vehicles]]\n| homepage = Defunct\n}}\n\nTiger began producing prototype machines as early as 1983, establishing a national dealer network and advertising campaign in 1984. Unlike major manufacturers of ATC's and ATV's, who would focus on annual changes of individual models, Tiger would see incremental changes reflect simultaneously across the entire line. This led to a common dating of machines by \u201cGeneration\u201d opposed to year. Collectors correlate Gen One models as 1984's, Gen Two as 1985's and Gen Three as the 1986 model-year.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url= https://sites.google.com/site/tigerrotax/home |title=Tiger ATCs |website=Tigerrotax|date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2020-04-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Generational Differences==\n\nThese differences can be used to identify Tiger ATC's, regardless of engine size. It is worth noting that due to the hand construction of each machine, and consistent incremental changes, Minor variations plague the entire production run.\n\nThe first generation of Tiger ATC's are recognizable for their noticeably wider front ends, comparative to other companies. This included the triple trees, number plate, fender and wheel assembly. Other features identifying Gen One models include a \u201chump\u201d on the gas tank, brass radiators, unique frame design and a diamond shape to the swing arm sidewalls. Rear fenders were unique as well, and were offered in blue.\n\nSecond Generation Tigers provides a more contemporary look, narrowing the front end, and visually aligning with other Sport ATC's of the mid-eighties. The radiator was now located on the left side of the machine and made of aluminum. The shroud is mounted below the gas tank. This iteration, manufactured in 1985, make up the bulk of Tigers production.\n\nThird Generation Tiger ATC's most striking feature is dual radiators, mounted on both sides of the machine, with higher shrouds that, when attached, aligned to the gas tank. The rear Monoshock has also been relocated, now centered to the swing arm and frame. Otherwise, Gen Three machines are similar overall to Gen Two models.\n\n==Tiger KTM Powered 80cc ATC==\n\nThe '''Tiger 80''' was based on the KTM 80cc Minicycle, designed for youth racing, and utilized the KTM engine, Forks and Frame. The engines were modified to produce significant increases in horsepower, and the frames modified both to accept the three wheeled configuration and handle the added horsepower. In ATC form, it produced an incredible 23hp factory delivered. The machines featured blue bodywork, seat and frame, and a KTM engine.

The primary focus is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park]] (a.k.a. G.&nbsp;W. Zoo) in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his years-long bitter feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin claims to be an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic (whose real name starts as Joseph Schreibvogel and changes several times to eventually become Joseph Maldonado-Passage) says that she is simply a rival zookeeper who wants her competition shut down. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harrassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to suggest that Baskin was involved in the [[disappearance of Don Lewis]], her second husband, possibly in a homicidal capacity.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, especially his unofficial three-way [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] marriage with Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and his legal marriages to Maldonado and a third man, Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman in an attempt to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal park operator and alleged personality cult leader; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic.

Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n===Special===\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]] \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

such as Exotic, whom Baskin accuses of abusing and exploiting wild animals.\n\nThe series received acclaim from critics, and according to [[Nielsen ratings]], was watched by 34.3 million people over its first ten days of release, ranking as one of Netflix's most successful releases to date.\n\n==Summary==\n{{more sources|section|date=April 2020}}\nThe series focuses on the little-known, deeply interconnected society of [[big cat]] conservationists and collectors in America, exploring the private [[zoo]]s and sanctuaries they have set up for these unusual and deadly animals. The primary focus is [[Joe Exotic]], the eccentric owner of the [[Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park]] (a.k.a. G.&nbsp;W. Zoo) in [[Wynnewood, Oklahoma]], and his years-long bitter feud with [[Carole Baskin]], CEO of [[Big Cat Rescue]] in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Baskin claims to be an [[animal rights]] activist whose mission is to provide a [[Animal sanctuary|sanctuary]] for big cats raised in captivity, but Joe Exotic (whose real name starts as Joseph Schreibvogel and changes several times to eventually become Joseph Maldonado-Passage) says that she is simply a rival zookeeper who wants her competition shut down. The two exchange threatening videos, legal allegations, protests, and targeted harrassment campaigns, in which [[PETA]] and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] become involved. Joe Exotic goes so far as to suggest that Baskin was involved in the [[disappearance of Don Lewis]], her second husband, possibly in a homicidal capacity.\n\nJoe Exotic's personal life becomes a subject of interest, especially his unofficial three-way [[same-sex marriage|same-sex]] marriage with Travis Maldonado and John Finlay and his subsequent relationships with them and his legal marriages to Maldonado and a third man, Dillon Passage. His 2016 run for [[President of the United States]] and [[2018 Oklahoma gubernatorial election|2018 run for Governor of Oklahoma]] are documented with the assistance of his campaign manager, Joshua Dial. Producer [[TV_Junkie#Rick_Kirkham|Rick Kirkham]] recounts the rise and fall of \"Joe Exotic TV\", a sort of [[podcast]] that Kirkham was hoping to develop into a TV series until his footage is mysteriously destroyed. The series then records the events leading up to Joe Exotic's conviction under federal [[Contract killing|murder-for-hire]] statutes when it comes to light that he paid a hitman in an attempt to murder Baskin; his conviction also includes violations of the [[Lacey Act]] and [[Endangered Species Act]], and results in a 22-year federal prison sentence.\n\nOther characters from the exotic animal community are introduced, including [[Bhagavan Antle]], an animal park operator and alleged personality cult leader; Mario Tabraue, a former drug lord who is involved in animal trafficking; Jeff Lowe, a [[Las Vegas]] playboy to whom Joe Exotic turns over his zoo for legal reasons; and James Garretson, who became a confidential [[informant]] for the federal government and a key figure in making the case against Joe Exotic. Former G.&nbsp;W. Zoo employees such as manager John Reinke and animal wrangler Saff Saffery conclude the series by commenting that the animals themselves were forgotten amongst all the interpersonal fighting, and that no party has truly come out victorious.<ref name=\"NYPN\">{{cite news |last1=Kaplan |first1=Michael |title=Everything you need to know about Netflix's new Joe Exotic doc, 'Tiger King' |url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=[[New York Post]] |issue=March 19, 2020 |publisher=NYP Holdings, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320183106/https://nypost.com/2020/03/19/everything-you-need-to-know-about-netflixs-new-joe-exotic-doc-tiger-king/ |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |director= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Not Your Average Joe\n |DirectedBy = [[Eric Goode]] & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = Cult of Personality\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = The Secret\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = Playing with Fire\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = Make America Exotic Again\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = The Noble Thing to Do\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Dethroned\n |DirectedBy = Eric Goode & Rebecca Chaiklin\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n===Special===\n{{Episode table |background=#B60006 |overall= |title= |airdate= |country=U.S. |released=y |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8\n |Title = The Tiger King and I\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Special after-show hosted by [[Joel McHale]] \n |LineColor = B60006\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the series holds an approval rating of 89% based on 75 reviews, with an average rating of 7.88/10.

In 2018, at the request of Mary Jane\u2019s family, a [[missing person|missing person\u2019s]] investigation was finally opened after 72 years by Officer Adam J. Turner of the Shelby Police Department.\n\n== Background ==\nMary Jane was born in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]] on November 11, 1911 to John & Anna Croft. She was the 4th of 8 children born to the couple. Mary Jane lived in Fairmont her whole life up until 1943 or 1944, when Mary Jane suddenly moved to Ohio to work at the Shelby Air Force Depot during [[World War II]]. She married James Wesley Vangilder, a farm laborer, on January 26, 1929 in Fairmont and had 7 children with him. Mary Jane's daughter, Anna, claimed that the home was full of abuse, and that her father, James, was an alcoholic whom was quite abusive to Mary Jane. On November 23, 1945, James filed for divorce against Mary Jane and three days later he was granted the divorce.\n\n== Life in Ohio ==\n[[File:Mary_Jane_Vangilder_Air_Force_Photo.png|thumb|left|250px|Military issued photo of Mary Jane]]\n\nMary Jane moved to [[Plymouth, Ohio]] around late 1943 for unknown reasons. Her first known address in Plymouth was a rooming house at 19 Sandusky Street. Sometime before Mary Jane began working at the depot, she began living at 2 Trux Street in Plymouth, which was accross the main road from the rooming house. Mary commenced work at the Shelby Air Force Depot on March 7, 1944 as a forklift operator.\n\nAccording to the son of one of her fellow workers, William King, his father, John, would drive Mary Jane and his brothers to the depot where they worked in a [[Ford Model A (1927-31)|1928 Ford Model A]].\n\nWilliam described Mary Jane as a cheerful person whom had long dark hair that went down to her shoulders. He also recalled once when a bad snowstorm occurred and all of the workers had to walk home, including Mary Jane. Mary Jane was only wearing dress shoes and wanted to sit down and get warm, but the workers instead helped her walk.\n\n== Disappearance ==\nLittle is known about Mary Jane's disappearance, although it is known she went to dismiss her wish to divorce her husband, James Wesley Vangilder. Some sources list her date of disappearance as February 14, 1945 due to this being her last contact with family by cashing a $25.00 [[War bond|war bond]] to her daughter, Anna.\n\nAnyone with information is asked to contact Officer Adam J. Turner at 419-347-2242 or Adam.turner@shelbypd.org.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
