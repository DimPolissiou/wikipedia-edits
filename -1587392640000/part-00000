Seleznev's employee later created a scanner which allowed a user to scan the internet for [[Remote Desktop Protocol|MSRDP]] open ports (3389 by default). Default configurations provided poor protection at the time, and many administrator accounts were not secured by passwords. Exploiting this vulnerability, Seleznev and his partner accessed many remote computers, including those with financial and credit-card data).\n\nHe contacted [[Vladislav Horohorin|BadB]], another hacker, to gain more experience in exploiting financial systems. BadB, a cybercriminal identified in 2009 as Vladislav Horohorin, provided Seleznev with an automated script to look for credit card traces in systems and networks. With this script, Seleznev obtained his first credit-card dumps, which he resold to Horohorin. He became dissatisfied with Horohorin, and decided to begin his own credit-card-dump operation using the nickname ''nCuX'' (from {{lang-ru|\u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445}}, \"psycho\").\n\nSeleznev expanded his operations in 2008 from scanning [[MSRDP]] with default (or no) passwords to developing sophisticated malware which could intercept network traffic and search network shares, distributing it through flaws in Internet browsers by injecting malicious code into advertising traffic. He infected many computers, primarily in the United States.\n\nBy May 2009, [[United States Secret Service|USSS]] believed they had collected enough information to come to the conclusion that nCuX was probably the identity of Roman Seleznev.

Seleznev's employee later created a scanner which allowed a user to scan the internet for [[Remote Desktop Protocol|MSRDP]] open ports (3389 by default). Default configurations provided poor protection at the time, and many administrator accounts were not secured by passwords. Exploiting this vulnerability, Seleznev and his partner accessed many remote computers, including those with financial and credit-card data).\n\nHe contacted [[Vladislav Horohorin|BadB]], another hacker, to gain more experience in exploiting financial systems. BadB, a cybercriminal identified in 2009 as Vladislav Horohorin, provided Seleznev with an automated script to look for credit card traces in systems and networks. With this script, Seleznev obtained his first credit-card dumps, which he resold to Horohorin. He became dissatisfied with Horohorin, and decided to begin his own credit-card-dump operation using the nickname ''nCuX'' (from {{lang-ru|\u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445}}, \"psycho\").\n\nSeleznev expanded his operations in 2008 from scanning [[MSRDP]] with default (or no) passwords to developing sophisticated malware which could intercept network traffic and search network shares, distributing it through flaws in Internet browsers by injecting malicious code into advertising traffic. He infected many computers, primarily in the United States.\n\nBy May 2009, [[United States Secret Service|USSS]] believed they had collected enough information to come to the conclusion that nCuX was probably the identity of Roman Seleznev. They had a meeting with the Russian intelligence agency [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] in which they shared information from their investigation and their belief that nCuX was Seleznev.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Chp12sEnWk&t=356|title=Ochko123 \u2013 How the Feds Caught Russian Mega-Carder Roman Seleznev|last=Barbosa|first=Norman|last2=Chun|first2=Harold|date=July 2017|publisher=[[Black Hat Briefings]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618050248/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Chp12sEnWk|archive-date=June 18, 2018|access-date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> Shortly after this meeting, in June 2009, nCuX closed all of his accounts and disappeared from the Internet; USSS suspected FSB had tipped Seleznev off.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter shutting down nCuX, Seleznev created two other names (Track2 and Bulba)<ref name=\":0\" /> and used them to operate his own automated stolen-credit-card shops.
