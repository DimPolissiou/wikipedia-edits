As one author explains, \"[f]or the studios, a home-run is a film from which a multimedia 'franchise' can be generated; the colossally expensive creation of cross-media conglomerates predicated on synergistic rewards provides an obvious imperative to develop such products.\"<ref>Barry Langford, ''Post-classical Hollywood: Film Industry, Style and Ideology Since 1945'', p. 207, {{ISBN|074863858X}}.</ref> The trend later developed wherein franchises would be launched in multiple forms of media simultaneously:\n\n{{quote|In one of the most celebrated ventures in media convergence, [[The Wachowskis|Larry and Andy Wachowski]], creators of ''[[The Matrix trilogy]]'', produced the game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]'' (2003) simultaneously with the last two films of the trilogy, shooting scenes for the game on the movie's sets with the movie's actors, and releasing the game on the same day as ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Likewise, on September 21, 2004, [[Lucasfilm]] jointly released a new DVD box set of the original ''[[Star Wars trilogy]]'' with ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', a [[combat game]] in which players can reenact battles from all six ''Star Wars'' films. In 2005, Peter Jackson likewise produced his blockbuster film ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' (2005) in tandem with a successful ''King Kong'' game designed by [[Michel Ancel]] and published by Ubisoft. In the last several years, numerous licensed videogame adaptations of major summer and holiday blockbusters were released a few days before or a few days after their respective films, including: all three ''Star Wars films'' (1999\u20132005); all five ''[[Harry Potter films]]'' (2001\u20132008); all three ''[[Spider-Man films]]'' (2002\u20132007); ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002); ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003); ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe]]'' (2005); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006); ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007); and ''[[Transformers]]'' (2007). These multimedia franchises have made it more difficult to distinguish the production of films and videogames as separate enterprises.|source=Harry Brown, ''Videogames and Education''<ref name=\"Brown\">Harry J. Brown, ''Videogames and Education'' (2008), p. 41, {{ISBN|0765629496}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Development to other forms==\n===Fiction===\nLong-running film franchises were common in the early studio era, when Hollywood studios had actors and directors under long-term contract. Examples include [[Andy Hardy]], [[Ma and Pa Kettle]], [[Bulldog Drummond]], [[Superman]], [[Tarzan]], and [[Batman]]. The longest-running modern film franchises include ''[[James Bond]]'', ''[[Godzilla]]'' and ''[[King Kong]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', and ''[[Star Trek]]''. In such cases, even lead actors are often replaced as they age, lose interest, or their characters are killed.\n\nMedia franchises tend to cross over from their original media to other forms. Literary franchises are often transported to film, such as [[Nancy Drew]], [[Miss Marple]], and other popular [[detective]]s, as well as popular [[comic book]] [[superhero]]es. Television and film franchises are often expanded upon in [[novel]]s, particularly those in the [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] genres, such as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Similarly, fantasy, science fiction films and television shows are frequently adapted into [[animated television series]], video games, or both.\n\nA media franchise does not have to include the same characters or theme, as the brand identity can be the franchise, like [[Square Enix]]'s ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' or the [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|''National Lampoon'' series]], and can suffer from critical failures even if the media fictional material is unrelated.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/how-to-kill-a-major-media-franchise-in-a-decade | title=How To Kill A Major Media Franchise In A Decade | publisher=Buzzfeed | date=12 August 2013 | accessdate=16 September 2013 | author=Bernstein, Joseph}}</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n[[Non-fiction]] literary franchises include the ''[[...For Dummies]]'' and ''[[The Complete Idiot's Guide to...]]'' [[reference book]]s. An enduring and comprehensive example of a media franchise is [[Playboy Enterprises]], which began expanding well beyond its successful magazine, ''[[Playboy]]'', within a few years after its first publication, into such enterprises as a modeling agency, several television shows (''Playboy's Penthouse'', in 1959), and even its own [[Playboy TV|television channel]].

Likewise, on September 21, 2004, [[Lucasfilm]] jointly released a new DVD box set of the original ''[[Star Wars trilogy]]'' with ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront]]'', a [[combat game]] in which players can reenact battles from all six ''Star Wars'' films.
