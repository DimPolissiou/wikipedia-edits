Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received largely positive reviews and praise for its animation, humor and musical score. The film made $182.7&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, setting the record for [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|best debut for an animated film]], and has grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|fourth-highest-grossing animated film]] (behind the 2019 version of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Frozen II]]'', and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'') and the [[List of highest-grossing films|18th-highest-grossing film]] of all time, along with being the third Pixar film to gross $1 billion after ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. ''Incredibles 2'' was named by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]] of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[91st Academy Awards]], losing both to ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nFollowing immediately after the events of the [[The Incredibles|first film]], the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Incredibles]] and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Frozone]] battle the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|Underminer]] who has just appeared to terrorize Municiberg. Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs and other superheroes without financial assistance. [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s love interest [[List of The Incredibles characters#Tony Rydinger|Tony Rydinger]] also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]] to erase his memory of her. Frozone informs [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Elastigirl]] of an offer from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]], a wealthy businessman. He and his sister [[List of The Incredibles characters#Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]] propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.\n\nDue to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: [[Dash Parr|Dash]] has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony fails to show up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. He takes Jack-Jack to [[Edna Mode]], who develops a suit that helps control his abilities. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious [[supervillain]] called the Screenslaver, who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images via TV screens. After preventing him from destroying a crowded runaway [[commuter rail|commuter train]], and thwarting his attempt to assassinate a diplomat, she tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and following a brief struggle, unmasks him as a pizza deliveryman who claims to have no recollection of his actions.\n\nAt a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the ''Everjust''. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was being controlled by a pair of [[Mind control|mind-control]] goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since [[List of The Incredibles characters#List of known superheroes|Gazerbeam and Fironic]] failed to save her father when he was murdered by burglars. The event led her to conclude that superheroes have taken independence from society, who in turn had become dangerously over-reliant on superheroes. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Elastigirl, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotized superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by their father, and reach Winston's hydrofoil yacht. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air designed to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship's crew, aim the hydrofoil at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Parr children reach them, and Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles. She in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Incredibles and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the ''Everjust'' from crashing into the city by turning the ship. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.\n\nLater, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit of gunmen by the [[police]], Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time, and the Incredibles give chase in a remodeled Incredimobile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n* [[Craig T.

Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and [[Ralph Eggleston]], the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004.

Written and directed by [[Brad Bird]], it is the sequel to ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and the second full-length installment of [[The Incredibles (franchise)|the franchise]]. The story follows the Parr family as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new foe who seeks to turn the populace against all superheroes. [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Catherine Keener]] and [[Jonathan Banks]]. [[Michael Giacchino]] returned to compose the score.\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Incredibles,'' Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n''Incredibles 2'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018 in [[Disney Digital 3-D]], [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received largely positive reviews and praise for its animation, humor and musical score. The film made $182.7&nbsp;million in its opening weekend, setting the record for [[List of highest-grossing openings for animated films|best debut for an animated film]], and has grossed over $1.2&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018]], the [[List of highest-grossing animated films|fourth-highest-grossing animated film]] (behind the 2019 version of ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', ''[[Frozen II]]'', and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'') and the [[List of highest-grossing films|18th-highest-grossing film]] of all time, along with being the third Pixar film to gross $1 billion after ''[[Finding Dory]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]''. ''Incredibles 2'' was named by the [[National Board of Review]] as the [[National Board of Review Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]] of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] and [[91st Academy Awards]], losing both to ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nFollowing immediately after the events of the [[The Incredibles|first film]], the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Parr Family|Incredibles]] and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Frozone|Frozone]] battle the [[List of The Incredibles characters#The Underminer|Underminer]] who has just appeared to terrorize Municiberg. Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs and other superheroes without financial assistance. [[Violet Parr|Violet]]'s love interest [[List of The Incredibles characters#Tony Rydinger|Tony Rydinger]] also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent [[List of The Incredibles characters#Rick Dicker|Rick Dicker]] to erase his memory of her. Frozone informs [[List of The Incredibles characters#Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible)|Mr. Incredible]] and [[Helen Parr (Pixar character)|Elastigirl]] of an offer from [[List of The Incredibles characters#Winston Deavor|Winston Deavor]], a wealthy businessman. He and his sister [[List of The Incredibles characters#Evelyn Deavor|Evelyn]] propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.\n\nDue to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: [[Dash Parr|Dash]] has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony fails to show up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and [[List of The Incredibles characters#Jack-Jack Parr|Jack-Jack]] wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. He takes Jack-Jack to [[Edna Mode]], who develops a suit that helps control his abilities. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious [[supervillain]] called the Screenslaver, who projects [[Hypnosis|hypnotic]] images via TV screens. After preventing him from destroying a crowded runaway [[commuter rail|commuter train]], and thwarting his attempt to assassinate a diplomat, she tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and following a brief struggle, unmasks him as a pizza deliveryman who claims to have no recollection of his actions.\n\nAt a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the ''Everjust''. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was being controlled by a pair of [[Mind control|mind-control]] goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since [[List of The Incredibles characters#List of known superheroes|Gazerbeam and Fironic]] failed to save her father when he was murdered by burglars. The event led her to conclude that superheroes have taken independence from society, who in turn had become dangerously over-reliant on superheroes. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Elastigirl, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotized superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\n\nViolet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by their father, and reach Winston's hydrofoil yacht. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air designed to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship's crew, aim the hydrofoil at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Parr children reach them, and Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles. She in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Incredibles and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the ''Everjust'' from crashing into the city by turning the ship. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.\n\nLater, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit of gunmen by the [[police]], Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time, and the Incredibles give chase in a remodeled Incredimobile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Incredibles characters}}\n* [[Craig T.

This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones, nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults. This also allowed him to keep Jack-Jack as an infant with an array of powers, which Bird likened to how [[Language acquisition|infants are able to understand numerous languages]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-incredibles-2-starts-exactly-where-the-origina/1100-6458277/ |title=Why Incredibles 2 Starts Exactly Where The Original Ended |first=Michael |last=Rougeau |date=April 16, 2018 |accessdate=April 16, 2018 |work=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> While the plot of the 2005 follow-up [[video game]] to ''The Incredibles'', ''[[The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer]]'', begins at that same point of time,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/7/14/15973580/the-incredibles-2-opening-pixar-d23 |title=The Incredibles 2 picks up right where the original left off |last=Sarkar |first=Samit |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | date=July 14, 2017 |accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> the film discards the game's continuity.

Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and [[Ralph Eggleston]], the production designer, was the fact that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004. There were no notions of, 'Well, we don't know how to do long hair, we don't know how to do humans, we don't know how to do muscles.' Everybody knows how to do it.

He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else.\" Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles.

It appears on [[Roman currency]], at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public works.\n\nThe full phrase appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature, such as the speeches of [[Cicero]] and ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' (\"Books from the Founding of the City\") of [[Livy]].\n\n==Translation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nSPQR: '''''S'''en\u0101tus '''P'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''\u014dm\u0101nus''.\nIn [[Latin]], ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]]'' is a [[nominative]] singular noun meaning \"[[Roman Senate|Senate]]\". ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]][[wikt:-que|que]]'' is compounded from the nominative noun ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]]'', \"the People\", and ''[[wikt:-que|-que]]'', an [[enclitic|enclitic particle]] meaning \"and\" which [[Conjunction (grammar)|connects]] the two nominative nouns. The last word, ''[[wikt:romanus|R\u014dm\u0101nus]]'' (\"[[wikt:Rome|Roman]]\") is an [[adjective]] modifying the whole of ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]] [[wikt:populus|Populus]]que'': the \"Roman Senate and People\", taken as a whole. Thus, the phrase is translated literally as \"The Roman Senate and People\", or more freely as \"The Senate and People of Rome\".\n\n==Historical context==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\nThe title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from c. 80 BC onwards. Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on coins, was simply ''ROMA''. The abbreviation last appears on coins of [[Constantine the Great]] (ruled 312\u2013337 AD), the first Roman emperor to support [[Christianity]].\n\nThe two legal entities mentioned, ''Sen\u0101tus'' and the ''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'', are sovereign when combined. However, where ''populus'' is sovereign alone, ''Sen\u0101tus'' is not. Under the [[Roman Kingdom]], neither entity was sovereign. The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than the foundation of the Republic.\n\nThis signature continued in use under the [[Roman Empire]]. The emperors were considered the ''[[de jure]]'' representatives of the people even though the ''[[Senatus consultum|sen\u0101t\u016bs consulta]]'', or decrees of the Senate, were made at the ''[[de facto]]'' pleasure of the emperor.\n\n''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'' in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government of the People. When the Romans named governments of other countries, they used populus in the singular or plural, such as ''popul\u012b Pr\u012bsc\u014drum Lat\u012bn\u014drum'', \"the governments of the Old Latins\". ''R\u014dm\u0101nus'' is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in ''c\u012bvis R\u014dm\u0101nus'', \"[[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]\".\n\nThe Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases as ''dignit\u0101s'', ''maiest\u0101s'', ''auctorit\u0101s'', ''l\u012bbert\u0101s popul\u012b R\u014dm\u0101n\u012b'', the \"dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people\". They were a ''populus l\u012bber'', \"a free people\". There was an ''exercitus, imperium, iudicia, honor\u0113s, consul\u0113s, volunt\u0101s'' of this same ''populus'': \"the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people\". They appear in early Latin as ''Popolus'' and ''Poplus'', so the habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.\n\nThe Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the [[Roman consul|consul]]s and [[praetor]]s, and the ''comitia centuri\u0101ta'', \"committee of the centuries\", whose will came to be safeguarded by the [[Tribune]]s.\n\nOne of the ways the emperor [[Commodus]] (180\u2013192) paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').\n\nBeginning in 1184, the [[Commune of Rome]] struck coins in the name of the SENATVS P Q R.  From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.<ref>Monete e Zecche Medievalli Italiane, Elio Biaggi, coins 2081 and 2141</ref>\n\nDuring [[Fascist Italy (1922\u201343)|the regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]], SPQR was emblazoned on a number of public buildings and [[manhole cover]]s in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Modern use==\nEven in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used in the municipal coat of arm of Rome and as abbreviation for the [[comune]] of Rome in official documents.<ref name=\"romeHome\">{{cite web|url=https://www.comune.roma.it/web/it/home.page |title=Roma Capitale - Sito Istituzionale - Home |accessdate=2019-10-29 |language=Italian}}</ref><ref name=\"revocaDeleghe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comune.roma.it/PCR/resources/cms/documents/Ord.1Revoca_deleghe_Naim.pdf |publisher=S.P.Q.R. - ROMA CAPITALE - MUNICIPIO ROMA CENTRO STORICO |title=OGGETTO: Revoca deleghe Consigliera Nathalie Naim |language=Italian |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===Civic references===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Insigne_Romanum_coronatum.svg|thumb|upright|Modern coat of arms of Rome municipality.]]\n[[File:Romeinse vlag.jpg|thumb|upright|A modern recreation of a [[aquila (Roman)|Roman standard]].]]\n[[File:2011-06-22-hh-buergerschaft-by-RalfR-04.jpg|thumb|right|SPQH - [[Hamburg Rathaus]]]]\n''SPQx'' is sometimes used as an assertion of municipal pride and civic rights.

It appears on [[Roman currency]], at the end of documents made public by an inscription in stone or metal, and in dedications of monuments and public works.\n\nThe full phrase appears in Roman political, legal, and historical literature, such as the speeches of [[Cicero]] and ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' (\"Books from the Founding of the City\") of [[Livy]].\n\n==Translation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nSPQR: '''''S'''en\u0101tus '''P'''opulus'''q'''ue '''R'''\u014dm\u0101nus''.\nIn [[Latin]], ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]]'' is a [[nominative]] singular noun meaning \"[[Roman Senate|Senate]]\". ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]][[wikt:-que|que]]'' is compounded from the nominative noun ''[[wikt:populus|Populus]]'', \"the People\", and ''[[wikt:-que|-que]]'', an [[enclitic|enclitic particle]] meaning \"and\" which [[Conjunction (grammar)|connects]] the two nominative nouns. The last word, ''[[wikt:romanus|R\u014dm\u0101nus]]'' (\"[[wikt:Rome|Roman]]\") is an [[adjective]] modifying the whole of ''[[wikt:senatus|Sen\u0101tus]] [[wikt:populus|Populus]]que'': the \"Roman Senate and People\", taken as a whole. Thus, the phrase is translated literally as \"The Roman Senate and People\", or more freely as \"The Senate and People of Rome\".\n\n==Historical context==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\nThe title's date of establishment is unknown, but it first appears in inscriptions of the Late Republic, from c. 80 BC onwards. Previously, the official name of the Roman state, as evidenced on coins, was simply ''ROMA''. The abbreviation last appears on coins of [[Constantine the Great]] (ruled 312\u2013337 AD), the first Roman emperor to support [[Christianity]].\n\nThe two legal entities mentioned, ''Sen\u0101tus'' and the ''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'', are sovereign when combined. However, where ''populus'' is sovereign alone, ''Sen\u0101tus'' is not. Under the [[Roman Kingdom]], neither entity was sovereign. The phrase, therefore, can be dated to no earlier than the foundation of the Republic.\n\nThis signature continued in use under the [[Roman Empire]]. The emperors were considered the ''[[de jure]]'' representatives of the people even though the ''[[Senatus consultum|sen\u0101t\u016bs consulta]]'', or decrees of the Senate, were made at the ''[[de facto]]'' pleasure of the emperor.\n\n''Populus R\u014dm\u0101nus'' in Roman literature is a phrase meaning the government of the People. When the Romans named governments of other countries, they used populus in the singular or plural, such as ''popul\u012b Pr\u012bsc\u014drum Lat\u012bn\u014drum'', \"the governments of the Old Latins\". ''R\u014dm\u0101nus'' is the established adjective used to distinguish the Romans, as in ''c\u012bvis R\u014dm\u0101nus'', \"[[Roman citizenship|Roman citizen]]\".\n\nThe Roman people appear very often in law and history in such phrases as ''dignit\u0101s'', ''maiest\u0101s'', ''auctorit\u0101s'', ''l\u012bbert\u0101s popul\u012b R\u014dm\u0101n\u012b'', the \"dignity, majesty, authority, freedom of the Roman people\". They were a ''populus l\u012bber'', \"a free people\". There was an ''exercitus, imperium, iudicia, honor\u0113s, consul\u0113s, volunt\u0101s'' of this same ''populus'': \"the army, rule, judgments, offices, consuls and will of the Roman people\". They appear in early Latin as ''Popolus'' and ''Poplus'', so the habit of thinking of themselves as free and sovereign was quite ingrained.\n\nThe Romans believed that all authority came from the people. It could be said that similar language seen in more modern political and social revolutions directly comes from this usage. People in this sense meant the whole government. The latter, however, was essentially divided into the aristocratic Senate, whose will was executed by the [[Roman consul|consul]]s and [[praetor]]s, and the ''comitia centuri\u0101ta'', \"committee of the centuries\", whose will came to be safeguarded by the [[Tribune]]s.\n\nOne of the ways the emperor [[Commodus]] (180\u2013192) paid for his donatives and mass entertainments was to tax the senatorial order, and on many inscriptions, the traditional order is provocatively reversed (''Populus Senatusque...'').\n\nBeginning in 1184, the [[Commune of Rome]] struck coins in the name of the SENATVS P Q R.  From 1414 until 1517, the Roman Senate struck coins with a shield inscribed SPQR.<ref>Monete e Zecche Medievalli Italiane, Elio Biaggi, coins 2081 and 2141</ref>\n\nDuring [[Fascist Italy (1922\u201343)|the regime]] of [[Benito Mussolini]], SPQR was emblazoned on a number of public buildings and [[manhole cover]]s in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a \"[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]\".{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Modern use==\nEven in contemporary usage, SPQR is still used in the municipal coat of arm of Rome and as abbreviation for the [[comune]] of Rome in official documents.<ref name=\"romeHome\">{{cite web|url=https://www.comune.roma.it/web/it/home.page |title=Roma Capitale - Sito Istituzionale - Home |accessdate=2019-10-29 |language=Italian}}</ref><ref name=\"revocaDeleghe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.comune.roma.it/PCR/resources/cms/documents/Ord.1Revoca_deleghe_Naim.pdf |publisher=S.P.Q.R. - ROMA CAPITALE - MUNICIPIO ROMA CENTRO STORICO |title=OGGETTO: Revoca deleghe Consigliera Nathalie Naim |language=Italian |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2019-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===Civic references===\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Insigne_Romanum_coronatum.svg|thumb|upright|Modern coat of arms of Rome municipality.]]\n[[File:Romeinse vlag.jpg|thumb|upright|A modern recreation of a [[aquila (Roman)|Roman standard]].]]\n[[File:2011-06-22-hh-buergerschaft-by-RalfR-04.jpg|thumb|right|SPQH - [[Hamburg Rathaus]]]]\n''SPQx'' is sometimes used as an assertion of municipal pride and civic rights.

It forms part of the barony of [[Tullyhunco]].<ref>[https://goo.gl/maps/PKnJitgsxi72CPCQ6]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nCormeen is bounded by the following townlands, on the north by [[Lecharrownahone]], on the east by [[Agharaskilly]], on the south by [[Killarah]] and on the west by [[Crossmakelagher]]. One would expect Cormeen to belong to [[Templeport]] parish and [[Tullyhaw]] barony as do the other surrounding townlands which lie on the west bank of the [[Shannon-Erne Waterway]]. However in medieval times when the parish and barony boundaries were fixed, the river was at a much higher level than now and ran north between the two hills in the townland as far as the present day [[R205 road (Ireland)]]. It then diverted back around the eastern hill in a southerly direction towards the present day course. Traces of the old river bed can be seen in the low-lying boggy ground along the road. Cormeen in medieval times was divided into two separate townlands. The part on the west bank of the river was called Ardagh (Irish ''Ard Ath'' meaning the ''High Ford'' or ''Ard Achadh'' meaning ''The High Field'') and the part to the east of the river was named Cormeen. The river level fell in modern times due to drainage and canalisation which caused it to divert along its current course, thus placing part of Cormeen on the west bank. Cormeen was thus too small to exist as a townland and was merged with Ardagh to form the present townland. However as it had always belonged to Kildallan parish it remained part of same thus giving rise to the anomaly. The [[Plantation of Ulster]] 1609 Baronial Maps of Tullyhaw and Tullyhunco show the river dividing Cormeen and Ardagh.<ref>National Archives Dublin: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf]</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html|title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cavantownlands.com/dronge-1609-bodley-map/|title=Dronge 1609 Bodley Map - Cavan Townlands|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref> Until the canalisation of the Woodford River in the 1850s, there was a ford across the river linking Cormeen and Killarah which was used by the inhabitants of Cormeen for passing to the large bog on the south side of the Woodford.<ref name=osi>{{cite web|url=http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V2,625733,816276,10,8|title=Shop.osi.ie Mapviewer|accessdate=19 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829114800/http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V2,625733,816276,10,8|archive-date=29 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIts chief geographical features are the [[Shannon-Erne Waterway]] which flows north along its southern and eastern boundaries, and several small drumlin hills reaching to an altitude of 265 feet above sea-level.

It forms part of the barony of [[Tullyhunco]].<ref>[https://goo.gl/maps/PKnJitgsxi72CPCQ6]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nCormeen is bounded by the following townlands, on the north by [[Lecharrownahone]], on the east by [[Agharaskilly]], on the south by [[Killarah]] and on the west by [[Crossmakelagher]]. One would expect Cormeen to belong to [[Templeport]] parish and [[Tullyhaw]] barony as do the other surrounding townlands which lie on the west bank of the [[Shannon-Erne Waterway]]. However in medieval times when the parish and barony boundaries were fixed, the river was at a much higher level than now and ran north between the two hills in the townland as far as the present day [[R205 road (Ireland)]]. It then diverted back around the eastern hill in a southerly direction towards the present day course. Traces of the old river bed can be seen in the low-lying boggy ground along the road. Cormeen in medieval times was divided into two separate townlands. The part on the west bank of the river was called Ardagh (Irish ''Ard Ath'' meaning the ''High Ford'' or ''Ard Achadh'' meaning ''The High Field'') and the part to the east of the river was named Cormeen. The river level fell in modern times due to drainage and canalisation which caused it to divert along its current course, thus placing part of Cormeen on the west bank. Cormeen was thus too small to exist as a townland and was merged with Ardagh to form the present townland. However as it had always belonged to Kildallan parish it remained part of same thus giving rise to the anomaly. The [[Plantation of Ulster]] 1609 Baronial Maps of Tullyhaw and Tullyhunco show the river dividing Cormeen and Ardagh.<ref>National Archives Dublin: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf]</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html|title=Templeport Development Association - 1609 Baronial-Map|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://cavantownlands.com/dronge-1609-bodley-map/|title=Dronge 1609 Bodley Map - Cavan Townlands|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref> Until the canalisation of the Woodford River in the 1850s, there was a ford across the river linking Cormeen and Killarah which was used by the inhabitants of Cormeen for passing to the large bog on the south side of the Woodford.<ref name=osi>{{cite web|url=http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V2,625733,816276,10,8|title=Shop.osi.ie Mapviewer|accessdate=19 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829114800/http://maps.osi.ie/publicviewer/#V2,625733,816276,10,8|archive-date=29 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIts chief geographical features are the [[Shannon-Erne Waterway]] which flows north along its southern and eastern boundaries, and several small drumlin hills reaching to an altitude of 265 feet above sea-level.

Its premise originated with [[Ryan Seacrest]], who also serves as an [[executive producer]].

Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roberts |first1=Will |title=7 TV Shows That May Be Lowering Your IQ |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/tv-shows-may-lowering-iq.html/?a=viewall |website=Cheatsheet.com |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=20 July 2016}}</ref> However, some critics recognized the reality series as a \"[[guilty pleasure]]\" and acknowledged the family's success.
