Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]].\n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]].

He was [[United States Senate elections, 1972|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972, when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]].

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

The number of seats in the State Senate was increased from 60 to 61.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/nyregion/districting-plan-drawn-in-albany-some-incumbents-may-lose-seats.html ''DISTRICTING PLAN DRAWN IN ALBANY; SOME INCUMBENTS MAY LOSE SEATS''] by E.

Patterson Jr. to revise the new apportionment proposed by the Legislature.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/nyregion/court-appointees-to-modify-redistricting-plan-for-state.html ''COURT APPOINTEES TO MODIFY REDISTRICTING PLAN FOR STATE''] by Arnold H.

Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], a \"Statewide Independent Party\", a \"Unity Party\", the [[New Alliance Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1982|New York state election, 1982]], was held on November 2. Lieutenant Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] was elected Governor, and Westchester County Executive [[Alfred DelBello]] was elected Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The elections to the other three statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the three incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, a Democratic Attorney General and a Democratic U.S. Senator. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,560,000; Republicans 2,249,000; Conservatives 230,000; Liberals 116,000; Right to Life 52,000; Libertarians 17,000; Statewide Independents 16,000; Unity 6,000; New Alliance 5,000; and Socialist Workers 4,000.\n\nSixteen of the nineteen women members of the previous legislature\u2014State Senators [[Carol Berman]] (Dem.), of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]]; [[Mary B.

Shaffer did not take her seat in the Assembly, and was appointed as [[Secretary of State of New York]] instead.\n\nOn May 24, 1983, [[Julia Harrison]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. Thus the 185th Legislature finished having 23 women members, surpassing the previous record of 19 in the [[184th New York State Legislature]] (in 1982).\n\nThe New York state election, 1983, was held on November 8.

The number of seats in the State Senate was increased from 60 to 61.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/09/nyregion/districting-plan-drawn-in-albany-some-incumbents-may-lose-seats.html ''DISTRICTING PLAN DRAWN IN ALBANY; SOME INCUMBENTS MAY LOSE SEATS''] by E. J. Dionne Jr, in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on May 9, 1982</ref> The new district lines were [[gerrymander]]ed by the Republican Senate majority to increase Republican strength, and by the Democratic Assembly majority to increase Democratic strength.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/16/nyregion/how-new-lines-will-affect-political-races.html ''HOW NEW LINES WILL AFFECT POLITICAL RACES''] by James Feron, in ''The New York Times'' on May 16, 1982</ref>\n\nOn June 23, 1982, a special panel of three federal judges ordered Special Master Robert P. Patterson Jr. to revise the new apportionment proposed by the Legislature.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/24/nyregion/court-appointees-to-modify-redistricting-plan-for-state.html ''COURT APPOINTEES TO MODIFY REDISTRICTING PLAN FOR STATE''] by Arnold H. Lubasch, in ''The New York Times'' on June 24, 1982</ref>\n\nOn July 3, 1982, the revised re-apportionment was approved by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/07/04/nyregion/new-redistricting-by-new-york-state-is-approved-by-us.html ''NEW REDISTRICTING BY NEW YORK STATE IS APPROVED BY U.S.''] by Jane Perlez, in ''The New York Times'' on July 4, 1982</ref>\n\nThus, under the provisions of the [[New York Constitution]] of 1938 and the U.S. Supreme Court decision to follow the [[One man, one vote]] rule, re-apportioned in 1982 by the Legislature, 61 Senators and 150 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts for two-year terms. Senate and Assembly districts consisted of approximately the same number of inhabitants, the area being apportioned contiguously without restrictions regarding county boundaries.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]], the [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal Party]], the [[New York State Right to Life Party|Right to Life Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], a \"Statewide Independent Party\", a \"Unity Party\", the [[New Alliance Party]], and the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] also nominated tickets.\n\n==Elections==\nThe [[New York gubernatorial election, 1982|New York state election, 1982]], was held on November 2. Lieutenant Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] was elected Governor, and Westchester County Executive [[Alfred DelBello]] was elected Lieutenant Governor, both Democrats. The elections to the other three statewide elective offices resulted in the re-election of the three incumbent officeholders: a Republican Comptroller, a Democratic Attorney General and a Democratic U.S. Senator. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Democrats 2,560,000; Republicans 2,249,000; Conservatives 230,000; Liberals 116,000; Right to Life 52,000; Libertarians 17,000; Statewide Independents 16,000; Unity 6,000; New Alliance 5,000; and Socialist Workers 4,000.\n\nSixteen of the nineteen women members of the previous legislature\u2014State Senators [[Carol Berman]] (Dem.), of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]]; [[Mary B. Goodhue]] (Rep.), a lawyer of [[Mount Kisco, New York|Mount Kisco]]; [[Olga A.

Shaffer]] (Dem.), of [[North Blenheim, New York|North Blenheim]]; and [[Helene Weinstein]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Brooklyn]]\u2014were re-elected. [[Anna V. Jefferson]] (Dem.), an accountant of [[Brooklyn]], was also elected to the State Senate. [[Cynthia Jenkins]] (Dem.), a librarian of [[Queens]]; [[Helen M. Marshall]] (Dem.), a teacher and librarian of [[Queens]]; [[Nettie Mayersohn]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]]; [[Mary M. McPhillips]] (Dem.), of [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]]; [[Barbara Patton]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Hempstead, New York|Hempstead]]; and [[Louise M. Slaughter]] (Dem.), of [[Fairport, New York|Fairport]]; were also elected to the Assembly. Gail S. Shaffer did not take her seat in the Assembly, and was appointed as [[Secretary of State of New York]] instead.\n\nOn May 24, 1983, [[Julia Harrison]] (Dem.), of [[Queens]], was elected to fill a vacancy in the Assembly. Thus the 185th Legislature finished having 23 women members, surpassing the previous record of 19 in the [[184th New York State Legislature]] (in 1982).\n\nThe New York state election, 1983, was held on November 8.

It was released on 7 April 1997 in the United Kingdom by Freestyle Dust and [[Virgin Records]] and in the United States by [[Astralwerks]]. The album was recorded between 1995 and 1997, and features [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Beth Orton]] as guest vocalists.\n\nThe album became the duo's first to peak at number one in the UK, achieving this peak in April 1997. Five singles were released from the album, two of which reached number one in the UK: \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\", \"[[Where Do I Begin (song)|Where Do I Begin]]\", \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\", \"[[Elektrobank]]\", and \"[[The Private Psychedelic Reel]]\". The album has been included in several British magazines' lists of the best albums ever. The success of the album led The Chemical Brothers to be much sought-after remixers, and the duo released a mix album in 1998 titled ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out (album)|Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]''.\n\n== Content ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2016}}\nThe album stands as the duo's longest studio album, exactly fourteen minutes longer than the band's debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]''.\n\n=== Artwork ===\nThe booklet for the album contains various pictures. The single covers of \"Setting Sun\", \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\" and \"[[Elektrobank]]\" are all featured, in addition to a picture of an orange, a photo showing the scene used for the cover of ''Exit Planet Dust'' except from behind, and various other images. This album was also the last album to use the original Freestyle Dust logo.\n\n== Background ==\nAfter The Chemical Brothers' successful debut album, ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'', released in June 1995, the duo continued to tour but quickly sought to record new material. Following the release of \"[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]\", the final single from that album, the duo had changed labels from [[Junior Boy's Own]] to [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], with Virgin getting credit on their album ''Exit Planet Dust'' as well under the liner notes. The duo released an EP, ''[[Loops of Fury]]'' in January 1996, consisting of new material and a remix of one of the band's earliest and signature tracks, \"Chemical Beats\".\n\nThe songs \"It Doesn't Matter\" and \"Don't Stop the Rock\" were released in June 1996 on vinyl as \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon 1]]\" and \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon 2]]\" respectively as promos for DJs to test in clubs. The duo met up with [[Noel Gallagher]]. They were interested in collaborating for a track. The Chemical Brothers had reportedly given him an instrumental track and he then wrote lyrics for the track.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The song was released as the single \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\" in October 1996. The song entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number one.

It was released on 7 April 1997 in the United Kingdom by Freestyle Dust and [[Virgin Records]] and in the United States by [[Astralwerks]]. The album was recorded between 1995 and 1997, and features [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and [[Beth Orton]] as guest vocalists.\n\nThe album became the duo's first to peak at number one in the UK, achieving this peak in April 1997. Five singles were released from the album, two of which reached number one in the UK: \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\", \"[[Where Do I Begin (song)|Where Do I Begin]]\", \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\", \"[[Elektrobank]]\", and \"[[The Private Psychedelic Reel]]\". The album has been included in several British magazines' lists of the best albums ever. The success of the album led The Chemical Brothers to be much sought-after remixers, and the duo released a mix album in 1998 titled ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out (album)|Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]''.\n\n== Content ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2016}}\nThe album stands as the duo's longest studio album, exactly fourteen minutes longer than the band's debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]''.\n\n=== Artwork ===\nThe booklet for the album contains various pictures. The single covers of \"Setting Sun\", \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\" and \"[[Elektrobank]]\" are all featured, in addition to a picture of an orange, a photo showing the scene used for the cover of ''Exit Planet Dust'' except from behind, and various other images. This album was also the last album to use the original Freestyle Dust logo.\n\n== Background ==\nAfter The Chemical Brothers' successful debut album, ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'', released in June 1995, the duo continued to tour but quickly sought to record new material. Following the release of \"[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]\", the final single from that album, the duo had changed labels from [[Junior Boy's Own]] to [[Virgin Records|Virgin]], with Virgin getting credit on their album ''Exit Planet Dust'' as well under the liner notes. The duo released an EP, ''[[Loops of Fury]]'' in January 1996, consisting of new material and a remix of one of the band's earliest and signature tracks, \"Chemical Beats\".\n\nThe songs \"It Doesn't Matter\" and \"Don't Stop the Rock\" were released in June 1996 on vinyl as \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon 1]]\" and \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon 2]]\" respectively as promos for DJs to test in clubs. The duo met up with [[Noel Gallagher]]. They were interested in collaborating for a track. The Chemical Brothers had reportedly given him an instrumental track and he then wrote lyrics for the track.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The song was released as the single \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\" in October 1996. The song entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number one.

In 1993 she released an album (as lead singer) with her band [[Subject to Change (band)|Subject to Change]]. [[Capitol Records]] did not officially release the album because of creative differences; the records that were produced were distributed as promotions and are considered a rarity. The band, with an aggressive political message and rock-soul fusion sound, remained popular as a co-headlining act with other performers. In 1999, Summer released her solo album ''[[Street Fa\u00ebrie]]'' produced by and featuring guest artist (and friend) [[Lenny Kravitz]], with the album a moderate success. Although Summer toured as Kravitz's opening act, her label dropped her and a planned spot with [[Lilith Fair]] was canceled. The label continued to promote the album, however, sending out a four-track sampler to radio and issuing remix singles of the track \"Revelation Sunshine\" in [[Europe]], with a special single specifically for [[Austria]].\n\nSummer recorded a song titled \"Savior Self\" for which she directed a music video co-starring [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], daughter of actor [[Lisa Bonet]] and rocker [[Lenny Kravitz]]. The video was screened online, but the track was never made available commercially, nor was it distributed to the radio.\n\nA number of Summer's portrayed characters (animated or otherwise) are singers or sing songs within the soundtrack of a show.

In 1985, she recorded the theme song for [[OWL/TV]]. In 1990, she sang background vocals on two tracks for fellow ''A Different World'' cast member [[Jasmine Guy]]'s self-titled LP. In 1993 she released an album (as lead singer) with her band [[Subject to Change (band)|Subject to Change]]. [[Capitol Records]] did not officially release the album because of creative differences; the records that were produced were distributed as promotions and are considered a rarity. The band, with an aggressive political message and rock-soul fusion sound, remained popular as a co-headlining act with other performers. In 1999, Summer released her solo album ''[[Street Fa\u00ebrie]]'' produced by and featuring guest artist (and friend) [[Lenny Kravitz]], with the album a moderate success. Although Summer toured as Kravitz's opening act, her label dropped her and a planned spot with [[Lilith Fair]] was canceled. The label continued to promote the album, however, sending out a four-track sampler to radio and issuing remix singles of the track \"Revelation Sunshine\" in [[Europe]], with a special single specifically for [[Austria]].\n\nSummer recorded a song titled \"Savior Self\" for which she directed a music video co-starring [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], daughter of actor [[Lisa Bonet]] and rocker [[Lenny Kravitz]]. The video was screened online, but the track was never made available commercially, nor was it distributed to the radio.\n\nA number of Summer's portrayed characters (animated or otherwise) are singers or sing songs within the soundtrack of a show. The character of Susie in ''All Grown Up!'' was portrayed as a singer with real talent, allowing Summer to sing in the role.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rugratonline.com/tweens2.htm |title=Inside The \"All Grown Up\" Series |publisher=Rugratonline.com |date=2002-09-26 |accessdate=2011-12-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217223036/http://www.rugratonline.com/tweens2.htm |archivedate=2012-02-17 }}</ref> Summer also sings the opening theme song for ''[[All Grown Up!]]''. The character of Foxxy Love in ''[[Drawn Together]]'' was a singer, with songs like \"La-La-La-La-Labia\" and \"Crashy Smashy\", [[Numbuh 5]] from ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' sang a lullaby to lull babies to sleep. [[List of Tiny Toon Adventures characters#Elmyra Duff|Elmyra Duff]] sang many times on ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''. She co-performed lead vocals in the song \"Cool Kitty\" with [[Tara Strong]], which accompanied a cartoon called ''[[Class of 3000]]'', directed and written for [[Cartoon Network]] by [[Andr\u00e9 3000]]. She provided the voice of a recurring [[pomegranate]] singer in ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', who usually sung during montage sequences. Her character Priscilla on ''[[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]]'' sings many times, as well.\n\nIn 2008, Summer appeared on ''[[The Frank Zappa AAAFNRAAA Birthday Bundle]]'', performing a cover of Zappa's song \"[[Over-Nite Sensation|Dirty Love]]\" with [[Dweezil Zappa]] on guitar and backup vocals by [[Ahmet Zappa]], produced by [[Linda Perry]].\n\n====Musical influences====\nSummer's musical influences include [[Frank Zappa]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-03-03/features/9101200190_1_range-rover-tofu-favorite-childhood-memory|title=Cree Summer|website=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043201/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-03-03/features/9101200190_1_range-rover-tofu-favorite-childhood-memory|archivedate=13 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=MTV/> [[Al Green]]<ref name=MTV/> and [[Dinah Washington]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/515722/cree-summer/|title=Cree Summer|website=mtv.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043520/http://www.mtv.com/news/515722/cree-summer/|archivedate=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Personal Life ==\nSummer is married to Angelo Pullen.
