It is 120 kilometres northeast of [[Mombasa]]. The population of Malindi was 119,859 as of the 2019 census.<ref name =Census2019/> It is the largest urban centre in [[Kilifi County]].\n\n==Overview==\nTourism is the major industry in Malindi. The city is popular among Italian tourists. Malindi is served with a domestic airport and a highway between [[Mombasa]] and [[Lamu]]. The nearby [[Watamu]] resort and [[Gedi Ruins]] (also known as Gede) are south of Malindi. The mouth of the [[Athi-Galana-Sabaki River|Sabaki River]] lies in northern Malindi. The [[Watamu Marine National Park|Watamu]] and [[Malindi Marine National Park]]s form a continuous protected coastal area south of Malindi. The area shows classic examples of [[Swahili architecture]]. The majority of Malindi's population is [[Islam in Kenya|Muslim]].<ref>[[Arye Oded|Oded, Arye]] (2000). ''Islam and Politics in Kenya''. [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], p. 11</ref>\n\nMalindi is home to the [[Malindi Airport]] and [[Broglio Space Centre]] (the previous ''San Marco Equatorial Range'').\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Vasco da Gama e o Rei de Melinde (Centro Cultural Portugu\u00eas de Santos).png|thumb|left|Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] meeting with the King of Malindi in 1498. The [[Portuguese Empire]] ruled Malindi from 1500 to 1630.]]\nMalindi developed as part of the emerging Swahili Civilization in the 5th\u201310th centuries. Bantu-speaking farmers moved into the area, where they smelted iron, built timber and wattle houses thatched with palm leaves, spoke a local dialect of kiSwahili, and engaged in regional and sometimes long-distance trade. The resurgence of the Indian Ocean trade networks at the end of the first millennium led to larger settlements, increased long-distance trade, and greater social complexity. Beginning in the 11th century, the Swahili along the coast were acting as middlemen for Somali, Egyptian, Nubian, Arab, Persian, and Indian traders. They began building walled towns, coral houses, and elites converted to Islam, often speaking Arabic as well as their native Swahili.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton |first1=John |title=The World of the Swahili |date=1994 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |pages=1\u201345}}</ref> \n\nThe first written reference to the present day Malindi likely comes from [[Abu al-Fida]] (1273\u20131331), a Kurdish geographer and historian. He wrote that Malindi is situated to the south of the mouth of the river, which begins in the [[Mountain of Comr]] hundreds of kilometres away. This mountain may be [[Mount Kenya]], where [[Galana River]] originates. Therefore, Malindi has existed as a [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlement since at least the 13th century.<ref name=Martin1970>{{cite book|first=Esmond Bradley|last=Martin|title=Malindi. Past and Present|year=2009|publisher=The National Museum of Kenya|edition=New|orig-year=originally published in 1970}}</ref>\n\nOnce rivalled only by [[Mombasa]] for dominance in this part of East Africa, Malindi has traditionally been a port city. In 1414, the town was [[Ming treasure voyages#Fifth voyage|visited by the fleet]] of the Chinese explorer [[Zheng He]]. Malindi's ruler sent a personal envoy with a giraffe as a present to China on that fleet.<ref name=Martin1970/>\n\nThe Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] met Malindi authorities in 1498 to sign a trade agreement and hire a guide for the voyage to [[India]], when he erected a [[coral]] [[column|pillar]]. Vasco da Gama was given a warm reception from the Shiek of Malindi, which contrasted with the hostile reception he encountered in [[Mombasa]].<ref name=Martin1970/> The pillar stands to this day, though there have been calls by conservationists to take care of it, since soil erosion might make the pillar fall into the ocean. It is a fairly popular tourist attraction for both local and international tourists.\n\nIn 1498 Malindi was a prosperous town with a population between 5,000 and 10,000. The majority of the population was Muslim by this period, having converted largely between the 13th and 14th centuries. Like other Medieval Swahili towns, the ruling class or ''wazee'' was made up of the heads of the wealthiest patrician families. Similar to other Bantu-speaking peoples, these clan leaders elected a ''mwenye mui'' or chief who spoke on behalf of the patricians. The Portuguese mistakenly titled these individuals \"Kings,\" misunderstanding the nature of Swahili political organization. The ''wazee'' spoke both Swahili and Arabic, and claimed mythological origins from the East, most often Persia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vernet |first1=Thomas |title=Les Cites-Etats Swahili de L'Archipel de Lamu, 1585\u20131810 |date=2005 |publisher=Universite Paris I |location=Paris |pages=103\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMalindi's main source of prosperity was the export of ivory and rhino horns as well as exporting agricultural products such as coconuts, oranges, millet and rice.<ref name=Martin1970/> In the years before the arrival of the Portuguese, Malindi was a regional power but lagged significantly behind the two greatest states, Mombasa and Kilwa. When, in 1499, the Portuguese established a trading post in Malindi that served as a rest stop on the way to and from [[India]], they were eagerly welcomed by the ''wazee'' who sought to use the Portuguese military might to establish themselves over their rivals in Mombasa. In 1500, King Dom Manuel I offered vassal status to Malindi. Malindi supported Portugal's successful efforts to conquer Kilwa and Mombasa in 1505. In 1509 the Portuguese established a factory (custom house) in Malindi, which they abandoned in 1512. The decline of Kilwa and Mombasa led to Malindi's flourishing. Malindi grew as other Swahili, as well as Arab, Persian, and Indian, merchants, craftsmen, sailors, and laborers flocked to newly powerful city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vernet |first1=Thomas |title=Les Cites-Etats Swahili de L'Archipel de Lamu, 1585\u20131810 |date=2005 |publisher=Universite Paris I |location=Paris |pages=65\u201397}}</ref>\n\nMalindi remained the centre of Portuguese activity in eastern Africa until 1593 when the Portuguese moved their main base to Mombasa. After that the town gradually declined until it almost disappeared by the end of 17th century. In 1845 [[Ludwig Krapf]] visited the town and found it overgrown by vegetation and uninhabited.<ref name=Martin1970/>\nA Portuguese chapel with a graveyard was built before 1542 when [[Francis Xavier]] visited the town.<ref name=Martin1970/> Many buildings of [[Swahili architecture]] survive, including the [[Juma Mosque]] and [[palace]] on the beach.\n\nMalindi was conquered by [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Sultan Majid]] of [[Zanzibar]] in 1861 and until the end of 19th century served as a center of the slave trade. In 1890 Malindi came under British administration. The British abolished both the slave trade and slavery. This act led to a significant decline in agricultural production. Outside agriculture there were few industries in Malindi at the beginning of the 20th century; among them were making mats and bags, crushing [[sesame]] seeds for oil and producing a Swahili drink called [[tembo (drink)|tembo]]. Malindi was officially made a town in 1903. Ten years later its population stood at around 1148 and included eight Europeans, 67 Asians, 230 Arabs and 843 Africans.<ref name=Martin1970/>\n\n[[Image:Malindi town view.jpg|thumb|200px|A view of the old town of Malindi]]\nMalindi experienced a trade boom between the end of the World War I and 1925, when a famine occurred. Exports to foreign ports grew to \u00a326,000 by 1924. Europeans started to return to Malindi in the 1930s, buying land from Arabs. Some of them like [[Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford|Commander Lawford]] opened the first hotels, which became the foundation of the future tourist industry. During [[World War II]] Malindi was one of only two towns in East Africa bombed by the Italians. This happened on 24 October 1940, and after this event allied troops were stationed in the town until the end of the war. After the World War II Malindi began developing into a resort.<ref name=Martin1970/>\n\n==Climate==\nMalindi has a [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical dry savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''As'').\n{{Weather box\n|location = Malindi (extremes 1892\u2013present)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 34.0\n|Feb record high C = 34.0\n|Mar record high C = 34.5\n|Apr record high C = 39.0\n|May record high C = 32.2\n|Jun record high C = 30.5\n|Jul record high C = 30.8\n|Aug record high C = 29.8\n|Sep record high C = 32.0\n|Oct record high C = 32.0\n|Nov record high C = 34.1\n|Dec record high C = 33.0\n|year record high C = 39.0\n|Jan high C = 30.8\n|Feb high C = 30.9\n|Mar high C = 31.8\n|Apr high C = 31.1\n|May high C = 28.8\n|Jun high C = 27.9\n|Jul high C = 27.3\n|Aug high C = 27.4\n|Sep high C = 28.3\n|Oct high C = 29.6\n|Nov high C = 30.5\n|Dec high C = 30.8\n|year high C = 29.6\n|Jan low C = 23.3\n|Feb low C = 23.5\n|Mar low C = 23.9\n|Apr low C = 24.2\n|May low C = 23.4\n|Jun low C = 22.6\n|Jul low C = 22.0\n|Aug low C = 21.6\n|Sep low C = 21.7\n|Oct low C = 22.2\n|Nov low C = 22.8\n|Dec low C = 23.4\n|year low C = 22.9\n|Jan record low C = 20.0\n|Feb record low C = 19.6\n|Mar record low C = 21.0\n|Apr record low C = 20.8\n|May record low C = 21.0\n|Jun record low C = 19.5\n|Jul record low C = 18.6\n|Aug record low C = 17.0\n|Sep record low C = 17.2\n|Oct record low C = 19.0\n|Nov record low C = 19.0\n|Dec record low C = 21.0\n|year record low C = 17.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 11\n|Feb precipitation mm = 17\n|Mar precipitation mm = 36\n|Apr precipitation mm = 163\n|May precipitation mm = 298\n|Jun precipitation mm = 154\n|Jul precipitation mm = 91\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64\n|Sep precipitation mm = 47\n|Oct precipitation mm = 68\n|Nov precipitation mm = 75\n|Dec precipitation mm = 35\n|year precipitation mm = 1059\n|Jan precipitation days = 2\n|Feb precipitation days = 2\n|Mar precipitation days = 3\n|Apr precipitation days = 11\n|May precipitation days = 17\n|Jun precipitation days = 12\n|Jul precipitation days = 12\n|Aug precipitation days = 9\n|Sep precipitation days = 7\n|Oct precipitation days = 6\n|Nov precipitation days = 6\n|Dec precipitation days = 3\n|year precipitation days = 90\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name = WMO >\n{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=1798\n| title = World Weather Information Service \u2013 Malindi\n| publisher= World Meteorological Organization\n| accessdate = 31 August 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=1766\n| title = Station Malindi \n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n|language = French \n| accessdate = 31 August 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Local governance ==\nMalindi now falls under [[Kilifi County]] as per the administrative changes in the new constitution passed in August 2010.\nMalindi forms a municipal council with the following thirteen wards: Barani, Ganda/Mkaumoto, [[Gede, Kenya|Gede]], Gede North, Gede South, Kijiwetanga, Madunguni, Malimo, Malindi Central, Malindi North, Maweni, Shella, [[Watamu|Watamu Town]].

the mouth of the [[Galana River]], lying on the [[Indian Ocean]] coast of [[Kenya]].  It is 120 kilometres northeast of [[Mombasa]]. The population of Malindi was 119,859 as of the 2019 census.<ref name =Census2019/> It is the largest urban centre in [[Kilifi County]].\n\n==Overview==\nTourism is the major industry in Malindi. The city is popular among Italian tourists. Malindi is served with a domestic airport and a highway between [[Mombasa]] and [[Lamu]]. The nearby [[Watamu]] resort and [[Gedi Ruins]] (also known as Gede) are south of Malindi. The mouth of the [[Athi-Galana-Sabaki River|Sabaki River]] lies in northern Malindi. The [[Watamu Marine National Park|Watamu]] and [[Malindi Marine National Park]]s form a continuous protected coastal area south of Malindi. The area shows classic examples of [[Swahili architecture]]. The majority of Malindi's population is [[Islam in Kenya|Muslim]].<ref>[[Arye Oded|Oded, Arye]] (2000). ''Islam and Politics in Kenya''. [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], p. 11</ref>\n\nMalindi is home to the [[Malindi Airport]] and [[Broglio Space Centre]] (the previous ''San Marco Equatorial Range'').\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Vasco da Gama e o Rei de Melinde (Centro Cultural Portugu\u00eas de Santos).png|thumb|left|Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] meeting with the King of Malindi in 1498. The [[Portuguese Empire]] ruled Malindi from 1500 to 1630.]]\nMalindi developed as part of the emerging Swahili Civilization in the 5th\u201310th centuries. Bantu-speaking farmers moved into the area, where they smelted iron, built timber and wattle houses thatched with palm leaves, spoke a local dialect of kiSwahili, and engaged in regional and sometimes long-distance trade. The resurgence of the Indian Ocean trade networks at the end of the first millennium led to larger settlements, increased long-distance trade, and greater social complexity. Beginning in the 11th century, the Swahili along the coast were acting as middlemen for Somali, Egyptian, Nubian, Arab, Persian, and Indian traders. They began building walled towns, coral houses, and elites converted to Islam, often speaking Arabic as well as their native Swahili.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Middleton |first1=John |title=The World of the Swahili |date=1994 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |pages=1\u201345}}</ref> \n\nThe first written reference to the present day Malindi likely comes from [[Abu al-Fida]] (1273\u20131331), a Kurdish geographer and historian. He wrote that Malindi is situated to the south of the mouth of the river, which begins in the [[Mountain of Comr]] hundreds of kilometres away. This mountain may be [[Mount Kenya]], where [[Galana River]] originates. Therefore, Malindi has existed as a [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlement since at least the 13th century.<ref name=Martin1970>{{cite book|first=Esmond Bradley|last=Martin|title=Malindi. Past and Present|year=2009|publisher=The National Museum of Kenya|edition=New|orig-year=originally published in 1970}}</ref>\n\nOnce rivalled only by [[Mombasa]] for dominance in this part of East Africa, Malindi has traditionally been a port city. In 1414, the town was [[Ming treasure voyages#Fifth voyage|visited by the fleet]] of the Chinese explorer [[Zheng He]]. Malindi's ruler sent a personal envoy with a giraffe as a present to China on that fleet.<ref name=Martin1970/>\n\nThe Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] met Malindi authorities in 1498 to sign a trade agreement and hire a guide for the voyage to [[India]], when he erected a [[coral]] [[column|pillar]]. Vasco da Gama was given a warm reception from the Shiek of Malindi, which contrasted with the hostile reception he encountered in [[Mombasa]].<ref name=Martin1970/> The pillar stands to this day, though there have been calls by conservationists to take care of it, since soil erosion might make the pillar fall into the ocean. It is a fairly popular tourist attraction for both local and international tourists.\n\nIn 1498 Malindi was a prosperous town with a population between 5,000 and 10,000. The majority of the population was Muslim by this period, having converted largely between the 13th and 14th centuries. Like other Medieval Swahili towns, the ruling class or ''wazee'' was made up of the heads of the wealthiest patrician families. Similar to other Bantu-speaking peoples, these clan leaders elected a ''mwenye mui'' or chief who spoke on behalf of the patricians. The Portuguese mistakenly titled these individuals \"Kings,\" misunderstanding the nature of Swahili political organization. The ''wazee'' spoke both Swahili and Arabic, and claimed mythological origins from the East, most often Persia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vernet |first1=Thomas |title=Les Cites-Etats Swahili de L'Archipel de Lamu, 1585\u20131810 |date=2005 |publisher=Universite Paris I |location=Paris |pages=103\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMalindi's main source of prosperity was the export of ivory and rhino horns as well as exporting agricultural products such as coconuts, oranges, millet and rice.<ref name=Martin1970/> In the years before the arrival of the Portuguese, Malindi was a regional power but lagged significantly behind the two greatest states, Mombasa and Kilwa. When, in 1499, the Portuguese established a trading post in Malindi that served as a rest stop on the way to and from [[India]], they were eagerly welcomed by the ''wazee'' who sought to use the Portuguese military might to establish themselves over their rivals in Mombasa. In 1500, King Dom Manuel I offered vassal status to Malindi. Malindi supported Portugal's successful efforts to conquer Kilwa and Mombasa in 1505. In 1509 the Portuguese established a factory (custom house) in Malindi, which they abandoned in 1512. The decline of Kilwa and Mombasa led to Malindi's flourishing. Malindi grew as other Swahili, as well as Arab, Persian, and Indian, merchants, craftsmen, sailors, and laborers flocked to newly powerful city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vernet |first1=Thomas |title=Les Cites-Etats Swahili de L'Archipel de Lamu, 1585\u20131810 |date=2005 |publisher=Universite Paris I |location=Paris |pages=65\u201397}}</ref>\n\nMalindi remained the centre of Portuguese activity in eastern Africa until 1593 when the Portuguese moved their main base to Mombasa. After that the town gradually declined until it almost disappeared by the end of 17th century. In 1845 [[Ludwig Krapf]] visited the town and found it overgrown by vegetation and uninhabited.<ref name=Martin1970/>\nA Portuguese chapel with a graveyard was built before 1542 when [[Francis Xavier]] visited the town.<ref name=Martin1970/> Many buildings of [[Swahili architecture]] survive, including the [[Juma Mosque]] and [[palace]] on the beach.\n\nMalindi was conquered by [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Sultan Majid]] of [[Zanzibar]] in 1861 and until the end of 19th century served as a center of the slave trade. In 1890 Malindi came under British administration. The British abolished both the slave trade and slavery. This act led to a significant decline in agricultural production. Outside agriculture there were few industries in Malindi at the beginning of the 20th century; among them were making mats and bags, crushing [[sesame]] seeds for oil and producing a Swahili drink called [[tembo (drink)|tembo]]. Malindi was officially made a town in 1903. Ten years later its population stood at around 1148 and included eight Europeans, 67 Asians, 230 Arabs and 843 Africans.<ref name=Martin1970/>\n\n[[Image:Malindi town view.jpg|thumb|200px|A view of the old town of Malindi]]\nMalindi experienced a trade boom between the end of the World War I and 1925, when a famine occurred. Exports to foreign ports grew to \u00a326,000 by 1924. Europeans started to return to Malindi in the 1930s, buying land from Arabs. Some of them like [[Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford|Commander Lawford]] opened the first hotels, which became the foundation of the future tourist industry. During [[World War II]] Malindi was one of only two towns in East Africa bombed by the Italians. This happened on 24 October 1940, and after this event allied troops were stationed in the town until the end of the war. After the World War II Malindi began developing into a resort.<ref name=Martin1970/>\n\n==Climate==\nMalindi has a [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical dry savanna climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''As'').\n{{Weather box\n|location = Malindi (extremes 1892\u2013present)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 34.0\n|Feb record high C = 34.0\n|Mar record high C = 34.5\n|Apr record high C = 39.0\n|May record high C = 32.2\n|Jun record high C = 30.5\n|Jul record high C = 30.8\n|Aug record high C = 29.8\n|Sep record high C = 32.0\n|Oct record high C = 32.0\n|Nov record high C = 34.1\n|Dec record high C = 33.0\n|year record high C = 39.0\n|Jan high C = 30.8\n|Feb high C = 30.9\n|Mar high C = 31.8\n|Apr high C = 31.1\n|May high C = 28.8\n|Jun high C = 27.9\n|Jul high C = 27.3\n|Aug high C = 27.4\n|Sep high C = 28.3\n|Oct high C = 29.6\n|Nov high C = 30.5\n|Dec high C = 30.8\n|year high C = 29.6\n|Jan low C = 23.3\n|Feb low C = 23.5\n|Mar low C = 23.9\n|Apr low C = 24.2\n|May low C = 23.4\n|Jun low C = 22.6\n|Jul low C = 22.0\n|Aug low C = 21.6\n|Sep low C = 21.7\n|Oct low C = 22.2\n|Nov low C = 22.8\n|Dec low C = 23.4\n|year low C = 22.9\n|Jan record low C = 20.0\n|Feb record low C = 19.6\n|Mar record low C = 21.0\n|Apr record low C = 20.8\n|May record low C = 21.0\n|Jun record low C = 19.5\n|Jul record low C = 18.6\n|Aug record low C = 17.0\n|Sep record low C = 17.2\n|Oct record low C = 19.0\n|Nov record low C = 19.0\n|Dec record low C = 21.0\n|year record low C = 17.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 11\n|Feb precipitation mm = 17\n|Mar precipitation mm = 36\n|Apr precipitation mm = 163\n|May precipitation mm = 298\n|Jun precipitation mm = 154\n|Jul precipitation mm = 91\n|Aug precipitation mm = 64\n|Sep precipitation mm = 47\n|Oct precipitation mm = 68\n|Nov precipitation mm = 75\n|Dec precipitation mm = 35\n|year precipitation mm = 1059\n|Jan precipitation days = 2\n|Feb precipitation days = 2\n|Mar precipitation days = 3\n|Apr precipitation days = 11\n|May precipitation days = 17\n|Jun precipitation days = 12\n|Jul precipitation days = 12\n|Aug precipitation days = 9\n|Sep precipitation days = 7\n|Oct precipitation days = 6\n|Nov precipitation days = 6\n|Dec precipitation days = 3\n|year precipitation days = 90\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name = WMO >\n{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=1798\n| title = World Weather Information Service \u2013 Malindi\n| publisher= World Meteorological Organization\n| accessdate = 31 August 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=1766\n| title = Station Malindi \n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n|language = French \n| accessdate = 31 August 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Local governance ==\nMalindi now falls under [[Kilifi County]] as per the administrative changes in the new constitution passed in August 2010.\nMalindi forms a municipal council with the following thirteen wards: Barani, Ganda/Mkaumoto, [[Gede, Kenya|Gede]], Gede North, Gede South, Kijiwetanga, Madunguni, Malimo, Malindi Central, Malindi North, Maweni, Shella, [[Watamu|Watamu Town]].
