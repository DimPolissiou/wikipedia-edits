{"title_page": "Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales''' involved the shipping of coal\u2014mainly for local consumption but also for export or coal bunkering\u2014by sea to Sydney from the northern and southern coal fields of [[New South Wales]]. It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found \u2018fine burning coal\u2019 near a \u2018little creek\u2019 with [[Livistona australis|cabbage tree palms]] \u2018about 2 degrees\u2019 north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'.

William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but [[William Bligh]]\u2014later a governor of New South Wales\u2014saw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal\u2014seeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England\u2014took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1558725/1/Memorandoms-by-James-Martin.pdf|title=Memorandoms by James Martin - An astonishing escape from early New South Wales|last=Causer|first=Tim|publisher=UCL Press|year=2017|isbn=9781911576815|location=|pages=24, 25, 82, 83, 130, 131}}</ref>  It is likely that the location was near the entrance to [[Glenrock Lagoon#History|Glenrock Lagoon]], where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geomaps.com.au/scripts/glenrockstate.php|title=Glenrock State Recreation Area - Mining heritage and Dudley Beach fossilised forest|website=www.geomaps.com.au|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSurvivors of the wreck of the [[Sydney Cove (1796 ship)|''Sydney Cove'']] reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700&nbsp;km trek along the coast in May 1797.

That proved true; an immense coal resource existed in New South Wales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d28rz98at9flks.cloudfront.net/9178/Rec1953_111.pdf|title=The Coal Resources of New South Wales (Draft)|last=Burton|first=G.M.|date=1953|publisher=Department of National Development, Bureau of Mineral Resources Geology and Geophysics.}}</ref>  Coal is still being mined within the [[Sydney Basin]] more than two centuries later. Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed. The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons. Large letters on the side of the wagon identified the owner, and small letters its capacity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coals to Hexham : the continuing story|last=Kenn.|first=Pearce|date=1994|publisher=Railmac Publication|others=McNicol, Steve.|isbn=0949817961|edition=[Rev. ed.]|location=Elizabeth, S.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

Hulks could be loaded at an on-shore loader or from 'sixty-milers', including those with a self-discharging capability such as the ''Stockrington''. Without propulsion of their own, the hulks were towed into position by tugboats. Once alongside the vessel receiving the coal, the mechanised coal hoists aboard the hulk were used to discharge the coal directly to the bunker chutes or bulk cargo holds of the vessel. It seems that it was common practice to coal a ship moored at a wharf, using a mechanised coal hulk with a 'sixty-miler' standing alongside (see photograph).\n[[File:Mechanised Coal Hulk FORTUNA (Sydney Mail Wed 28 Nov 1923, Page 41).jpg|thumb|251x251px|''Fortuna''\u2014still with the stern of a former sailing ship\u2014coaling a liner at [[Circular Quay]] in 1923.

It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791.

Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed.

Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

The lugs at the top were used to lift the removable hopper out of the frame by crane.|alt=|260x260px]]\n\nMany collieries on the northern coalfield of NSW were named after collieries in the United Kingdom. Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons.

Initially mines were located in what is now the inner-city of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and coal was loaded from wharves on the southern bank of the Hunter River. Newcastle was the main port, during the time of [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|the Australian Agricultural Company's monopoly on the mining of coal (1828\u20131847)]].

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

Generally more than one monk stayed in each house with each monk in his own cell, called a ''parivena''.\n#'''\u0101r\u0101ma''': a more permanent and more comfortable arrangement than the avasa. This property was generally donated and maintained by a wealthy citizen. This was more lavish (as suggested by the name \u2013 ''Araama'' means both ''pleasant'' and ''park'').

First and foremost, they are expected to preserve the doctrine and discipline now known as [[Buddhism]]. They are also expected to provide a living example for the laity, and to serve as a \"field of merit\" for lay followers, providing laymen and women with the opportunity to earn merit by giving gifts and support to the monks. In return for the support of the laity, monks and nuns are expected to live an austere life focused on the study of Buddhist doctrine, the practice of meditation, and the observance of good moral character. The relative degree of emphasis on meditation or study has often been debated in the Buddhist community. Many continued to keep a relationship with their original families.<ref>[http://chan.bailinsi.net/2009/0905/0107.htm \u6211\u7684\u6bcd\u4eb2\u3000\u6211\u7684\u4f5b] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n===Bhikkhu & Bhikkhuni Assemblies===\nAccording to the sutras, although his followers initially consisted only of men, the Buddha recognized women as followers after his stepmother, [[Mahaprajapati]], asked for and received permission to live as an ordained practitioner.

Ordination in the bhikkhuni lineage continues to exist among East Asian communities, and attempts have been made at a revival in Southeast Asia and [[Sri Lanka]].<ref name=eob/>\n\nSupport for bhikkhunis varies substantially between traditions, with [[mae ji]] and other Theravada female monastics not receiving the same institutional recognition and support as their fully-ordained male counterparts.<ref name=eob/> Women in Theravada countries have also faced official and popular resistance to the re-establishment of fully ordained bhikkhuni lineages.<ref name=eob/>\n\n[[Image:Young monks of Drepung.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Young Buddhist monks in Tibet practising formal debating]]\n\n===Stages of Monastic Ordination===\nOrdination traditionally is a two-stage process.<ref name=eob/><ref name=eob2/> A Bhikkhu or Bhikkhuni first ordains as a ''[[Samanera]]'' or ''Samanerika''' (novice), residing in the monastery and learning about monastic life<ref name=eob/><ref name=eob2/>.

While most career monastics in the [[Theravada]] tradition undertake formal ''upasampada'' ordination as soon as they are eligible, monks in East Asia often remain novices.<ref name=eob/> This may be due to a historical shortage of fully qualified temples able to provide ''upasampada'' ordination in East Asian communities.<ref name=eob/> East Asian monastics also typically undertake [[Bodhisattva Precepts]], a set of additional guidelines based on the [[Bodhisattva path]].<ref name=eob/>\n\nEarly differences in the interpretation or ordination practices and monastic rules, combined with geographical differences, may have resulted in the development of the various [[early Buddhist schools]] out of ordination lineages known as [[Nikaya]]s.<ref name=eob2/>\n\n===Rules and Precepts===\nThe disciplinary regulations for monks and nuns are intended to create a life that is simple and focused, rather than one of deprivation or severe asceticism. Celibacy is of primary importance in monastic discipline, seen as being the preeminent factor in separating the life of a monastic from that of a [[householder (Buddhism)|householder]]. Depending on the tradition and the strictness of observation, monastics may eat only one meal a day, provided either by direct donations of food from lay supporters, or from a monastery kitchen that is stocked (and possibly staffed) by lay supporters.\n\nUnlike [[Christian monasticism|Christian monastics]], some schools of Buddhist monastics are not required to live a life of obedience to a superior.  However, it is expected that monastics will offer respect to senior members of the Sangha (in Thai tradition, seniority is based on the number of rains retreats, [[vassa]]s, that one has been ordained). The Buddha did not appoint a successor, nor did he specify rules mandating obedience in the monastic code.  Individual groups of monastics are expected to make decisions collectively through regular gatherings of the community, at which decisions regarding violations of monastic rules and the dispositions of communal property are to be made.  Individual relationships of teacher/student, senior/junior, and preceptor/trainee may be observed among groups of monastics, but there are no formal positions, nor is there any authority to give orders or commands invested in senior monks.  An [[abbess (Buddhism)|abbess]] or [[abbot (Buddhism)|abbot]], typically a senior monastic still young enough to be active, is usually responsible for the day-to-day administration of the monastery, and may appoint others to assist with the work.  In some traditions, the abbess/abbot is chosen by a vote of the monastics in a monastery.  In other traditions ([[Thailand]], for example), the abbot is chosen by the lay community.\n\n== Local variations ==\n\nMonastic practices vary significantly according to location.  In part, this can be attributed to differences in the scriptural and doctrinal traditions that were received in different parts of the Buddhist world.  Additionally, local concessions to social, geographical, and climatic conditions have been adopted by most monastic orders in order to smooth the integration of monks into local communities, and to ensure that monks live in a safe and reasonable manner.  In cold climates, for instance, monks are permitted to own and wear additional clothing not specified in the scriptures.  In areas where begging rounds are impossible (due to traffic, geography, or disfavor by the lay community), monks more commonly employ a kitchen staff of monks or lay followers who are responsible for providing meals for the community. For instance, in the Theravada tradition monks continue to follow the traditional practice of asking for alms where possible.<ref name=eob/> In East Asia, Confucian views discouraged begging and lead to many monasteries growing their own food and employing monks as cooks.<ref name=eob/>\n\nAlthough there were a number of distinct [[vinaya]] traditions or ordination lineages, only three have survived to the present day: the [[Therav\u0101da]], [[Dharmaguptaka]], and [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]].<ref name=eob2/>\n\n[[Japanese Buddhism]] is particularly distinguished by its rejection of celibate monasticism.<ref name=eob/> Following [[Meiji (era)|Meiji]]-era changes to national laws, monks and nuns could no longer be forbidden from marrying, and as a result a distinct class of married clergy and temple administrators emerged.<ref name=eob/><ref name=eob2/>\n\n=== Tibet ===\nIn [[Tibet]], before the Chinese invasion in the late 1940s and early 1950s, more than half of the country's male population was ordained. Today, this is no longer the case. While generally adhering to a Mahayana tradition that advocates the virtues of vegetarianism, Tibetan monks generally eat meat as a concession to climatic conditions that make a plant-based diet largely unfeasible. Tibetan monks follow the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] vinaya lineage.\n\n[[Lama]]s who take bhik\u1e63u vows are not allowed to marry.<ref>[http://www.chinapress.com.my/topic/focus/default.asp?sec=buddha&art=0707buddha.txt \u4f5b\u7684\u7591\u60d1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827105514/http://www.chinapress.com.my/topic/focus/default.asp?sec=buddha&art=0707buddha.txt |date=August 27, 2006 }}</ref> The [[Nyingma]] school includes a mixture of bhik\u1e63us and non-celibate [[ngakpa]]s, and it is not unusual for lamas to wear robes closely resembling monastic garb despite them not being bhik\u1e63us.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xz.people.com.cn/GB/139193/10628117.html |title=\u5b81\u739b\u6d3e\u5bfa\u9662\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd |work=People's Daily |accessdate=2011-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916193443/http://xz.people.com.cn/GB/139193/10628117.html |archivedate=September 16, 2011 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tibet.cn/info/religion/200907/t20090716_488735.html \u654f\u73e0\u6797\u5bfa\uff1a\u5728\u5bc6\u5b97\u4fee\u884c\u573a\u4e2d\u5bfb\u83b7\u4e16\u4fd7\u7684\u5706\u6ee1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717000006/http://www.tibet.cn/info/religion/200907/t20090716_488735.html |date=July 17, 2012 }}</ref> [[Sakya]] school does not allow monks to get close to women after they have sons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myfo.org/sf_9D8FE02887704A828DF12FDFD7653F72_101_pcx.html |title=\u85cf\u4f20\u4f5b\u6559\u6d41\u6d3e |publisher=Myfo.org |date=2005-12-07 |accessdate=2011-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727104328/http://www.myfo.org/sf_9D8FE02887704A828DF12FDFD7653F72_101_pcx.html |archivedate=July 27, 2011 }}</ref> [[Gelug]] school emphasized Vinaya ethics and monastic discipline; [[Choekyi Gyaltsen]] refused to wear monk clothing after he married.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.66wz.com/system/2006/05/26/100123565.shtml |title=\u7b2c\u5341\u4e16\u73ed\u7985\u5973\u513f\u516c\u4e3b\u4ec1\u5409\uff1a\u6211\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u8d1f\u4f17\u671b |publisher=News.66wz.com |accessdate=2011-11-29}}</ref> [[Kagyu]] monks are also required to return to non-monastic life to marry.<ref>[http://www.jampa-gyatso.org/index.php?page=rinpoche.htm \u85cf\u50b3\u4f5b\u6559\u7af9\u5df4\u5676\u8209\u50b3\u627f] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024757/http://www.jampa-gyatso.org/index.php?page=rinpoche.htm |date=December 27, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.singaclub.tw/about202b.aspx |title=\u53f0\u7063\u76f4\u8ca2\u5676\u8209\u5409\u7965\u4f5b\u5b78\u6703 |publisher=Singaclub.tw |accessdate=2011-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304080908/http://www.singaclub.tw/about202b.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n[[File:\u5fc3\u57f9\u548c\u5c1a.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A Buddhist monk in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, wearing the robes of an abbot in a monastery]]\n[[Image:Japanese buddhist monk by Arashiyama cut.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A mendicant monk in Kyoto, Japan]]\n\n=== East Asia ===\n{{See also|Shaolin Monastery}}\nIn East Asia, monastics live in greater isolation from the lay population than is observed in most [[Theravada]] countries.

During a school break, many young men usually ordain for a week or two to earn merit for loved ones and to gain knowledge of Buddhist teachings. In most countries, this temporary ordination occurs during the vassa retreat, which is regarded as a period of intensified spiritual effort by local Buddhists.  Men in Thailand typically ordain only before being married; men in Laos and Myanmar could traditionally return to the monastery from time to time after being married, provided that they secured their wives' permission.  Theravada monks are also most likely to engage in traditional practices of collecting alms, although the urbanization of parts of Southeast Asian (particularly Thailand) has presented a challenge to this practice.\n\nIn Thailand, where the Buddhist institution has traditionally been closely associated with the government and the institution of kingship, a more hierarchical structure has evolved to deal with the administration and regulation of monasteries.  This system initially stemmed from a system of royal patronage, in which monks who were appointed the abbots of 'royal monasteries' (those endowed and supported by members of the royal family) were accorded greater respect than those who headed more conventional monasteries.  This system remained fairly unstructured until the modernization efforts of the 19th century, during which a more formal system of governance was created by the central government.  Modern Thai monks are ranked according to their ability to pass examinations in Buddhist doctrine and the [[P\u0101li|Pali]] language, and are appointed to successively higher positions in the ecclesiastic hierarchy on the basis of these exams, as well as their support among influential members of the royal family and government.  Local affairs continue to be handled primarily by the local monastic and lay community, but nationwide efforts (such as curriculum decisions for monastic schools, and the authoritative form of scriptures and rituals) are typically made by the central hierarchy.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Abbot (Buddhism)]]\n*[[Buddhist ethics]]\n*[[Greco-Buddhist monasticism]]\n*[[Monastery]]\n*[[Monasticism]]\n*[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/layguide.htm Layman's Guide to Monk's Rules] at Buddhanet\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n\n[[Category:Buddhist sangha|*]]\n[[Category:Buddhist monasticism| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:RatoMonks.jpg|thumb|270px|Monks outside the temple at the  [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery, [[Rato Dratsang]], in India, January 2015]]\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2011}}\n{{Buddhism}} \n'''Buddhist monasticism''' is one of the earliest surviving forms of organized [[monasticism]] and one of the fundamental institutions of [[Buddhism]].

First and foremost, they are expected to preserve the doctrine and discipline now known as [[Buddhism]]. They are also expected to provide a living example for the laity, and to serve as a \"field of merit\" for lay followers, providing laymen and women with the opportunity to earn merit by giving gifts and support to the monks. In return for the support of the laity, monks and nuns are expected to live an austere life focused on the study of Buddhist doctrine, the practice of meditation, and the observance of good moral character. The relative degree of emphasis on meditation or study has often been debated in the Buddhist community. Many continued to keep a relationship with their original families.<ref>[http://chan.bailinsi.net/2009/0905/0107.htm \u6211\u7684\u6bcd\u4eb2\u3000\u6211\u7684\u4f5b] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n===Bhikkhu & Bhikkhuni Assemblies===\nAccording to the sutras, although his followers initially consisted only of men, the Buddha recognized women as followers after his stepmother, [[Mahaprajapati]], asked for and received permission to live as an ordained practitioner.

While most career monastics in the [[Theravada]] tradition undertake formal ''upasampada'' ordination as soon as they are eligible, monks in East Asia often remain novices.<ref name=eob/> This may be due to a historical shortage of fully qualified temples able to provide ''upasampada'' ordination in East Asian communities.<ref name=eob/> East Asian monastics also typically undertake [[Bodhisattva Precepts]], a set of additional guidelines based on the [[Bodhisattva path]].<ref name=eob/>\n\nEarly differences in the interpretation or ordination practices and monastic rules, combined with geographical differences, may have resulted in the development of the various [[early Buddhist schools]] out of ordination lineages known as [[Nikaya]]s.<ref name=eob2/>\n\n===Rules and Precepts===\nThe disciplinary regulations for monks and nuns are intended to create a life that is simple and focused, rather than one of deprivation or severe asceticism. Celibacy is of primary importance in monastic discipline, seen as being the preeminent factor in separating the life of a monastic from that of a [[householder (Buddhism)|householder]]. Depending on the tradition and the strictness of observation, monastics may eat only one meal a day, provided either by direct donations of food from lay supporters, or from a monastery kitchen that is stocked (and possibly staffed) by lay supporters.\n\nUnlike [[Christian monasticism|Christian monastics]], some schools of Buddhist monastics are not required to live a life of obedience to a superior.  However, it is expected that monastics will offer respect to senior members of the Sangha (in Thai tradition, seniority is based on the number of rains retreats, [[vassa]]s, that one has been ordained). The Buddha did not appoint a successor, nor did he specify rules mandating obedience in the monastic code.  Individual groups of monastics are expected to make decisions collectively through regular gatherings of the community, at which decisions regarding violations of monastic rules and the dispositions of communal property are to be made.  Individual relationships of teacher/student, senior/junior, and preceptor/trainee may be observed among groups of monastics, but there are no formal positions, nor is there any authority to give orders or commands invested in senior monks.  An [[abbess (Buddhism)|abbess]] or [[abbot (Buddhism)|abbot]], typically a senior monastic still young enough to be active, is usually responsible for the day-to-day administration of the monastery, and may appoint others to assist with the work.  In some traditions, the abbess/abbot is chosen by a vote of the monastics in a monastery.  In other traditions ([[Thailand]], for example), the abbot is chosen by the lay community.\n\n== Local variations ==\n\nMonastic practices vary significantly according to location.  In part, this can be attributed to differences in the scriptural and doctrinal traditions that were received in different parts of the Buddhist world.  Additionally, local concessions to social, geographical, and climatic conditions have been adopted by most monastic orders in order to smooth the integration of monks into local communities, and to ensure that monks live in a safe and reasonable manner.  In cold climates, for instance, monks are permitted to own and wear additional clothing not specified in the scriptures.  In areas where begging rounds are impossible (due to traffic, geography, or disfavor by the lay community), monks more commonly employ a kitchen staff of monks or lay followers who are responsible for providing meals for the community. For instance, in the Theravada tradition monks continue to follow the traditional practice of asking for alms where possible.<ref name=eob/> In East Asia, Confucian views discouraged begging and lead to many monasteries growing their own food and employing monks as cooks.<ref name=eob/>\n\nAlthough there were a number of distinct [[vinaya]] traditions or ordination lineages, only three have survived to the present day: the [[Therav\u0101da]], [[Dharmaguptaka]], and [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]].<ref name=eob2/>\n\n[[Japanese Buddhism]] is particularly distinguished by its rejection of celibate monasticism.<ref name=eob/> Following [[Meiji (era)|Meiji]]-era changes to national laws, monks and nuns could no longer be forbidden from marrying, and as a result a distinct class of married clergy and temple administrators emerged.<ref name=eob/><ref name=eob2/>\n\n=== Tibet ===\nIn [[Tibet]], before the Chinese invasion in the late 1940s and early 1950s, more than half of the country's male population was ordained. Today, this is no longer the case. While generally adhering to a Mahayana tradition that advocates the virtues of vegetarianism, Tibetan monks generally eat meat as a concession to climatic conditions that make a plant-based diet largely unfeasible.

There had long been many instances of [[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]] priests and priestesses marrying, influenced by the sect's founder [[Shinran]], but it was not predominant until a government Nikujiku Saitai Law (\u8089\u98df\u59bb\u5e2f) was passed during the [[Meiji Restoration]] that monks or priests of any Buddhist sect are free to seek wives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.kcn.ne.jp/~hata6144/HUKOKU5.htm |title=\u660e\u6cbb5\u5e74\u7b2c33\u865f |publisher=.kcn.ne.jp |accessdate=2011-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.co.jp/CollegeLife-Circle/2248/jinpaga161.html |title=\u8f38\u5165\u7d71\u8a08\u306b\u73fe\u308c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u7f8a\u305f\u3061 |publisher=Geocities.co.jp |accessdate=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606051258/http://www.geocities.co.jp/CollegeLife-Circle/2248/jinpaga161.html |archive-date=June 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houonsha.co.jp/jiyu/04/144.html |title=\u5730\u6d8c144 |publisher=Houonsha.co.jp |accessdate=2011-11-29}}</ref> This practice influenced Korea and Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.wenxuecity.com/comment.php?date=200906&postID=22364&&c_lang=big5 |title=\u53c3\u5b78\u7463\u8ac7-\u542c\u771f\u83ef\u9577\u8001\u8b1b\u6545\u4e8b(2\u201317) |publisher=Blog.wenxuecity.com |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001111/http://blog.wenxuecity.com/comment.php?date=200906&postID=22364&&c_lang=big5 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref> A nun in Taiwan gave birth.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u0161\u0139\u00b8q\u013d\u0164\u0154s\u013e\u0158\u02c7\u00b4\u017c\u013d\u0102\u015a\u00a8\u013d\u00e7\u015f\u016e\u0104G\u0104u |url=http://homepage19.seed.net.tw/web@1/singhong/TaiwanConfucianism3.htm |title=\u300a\u9cf4\u9f13\u96c6\u300b\u53cd\u4f5b\u6559\u7834\u6212\u6587\u5b78\u7684\u5275\u4f5c\u8207\u5112\u91cb\u77e5\u8b58\u793e\u7fa4\u7684\u885d\u7a81 |publisher=Homepage19.seed.net.tw |accessdate=2011-11-29 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Some Korean monks live with wives in their monasteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/graphicversion/dbase/forum/text/fn146.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040621040539/http://www.nichibun.ac.jp/graphicversion/dbase/forum/text/fn146.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-21 |title=\u89aa\u65e5\u4ecf\u6559\u3068\u97d3\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a \uff08Pro-Japanese Buddhism and Korea Society\uff09 |publisher=Nichibun.ac.jp |accessdate=2011-11-29 }}</ref>\n\nMonks of certain Chinese Buddhist sects are allowed to marry,<ref>[http://www.gaya.org.tw/magazine/2005/84/84s2.htm \u6230\u5f8c\u53f0\u7063\u5c3c\u50e7\u4e4b\u767c\u5c55] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107191234/http://www.gaya.org.tw/magazine/2005/84/84s2.htm |date=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nccuir.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/37255/6/600406.pdf |title=\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ae0\u3001\u53f0\u7063\u4f5b\u6559\u7684\u50e7\u4fd7\u5206\u5225\u8207\u653f\u7b56\u8b8a\u66f4 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-11-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-NX012/nx96108.htm |title=\u51fa\u5bb6\u5165\u4e16 \u2013 \u6230\u5f8c\u53f0\u7063\u4f5b\u6559\u5973\u6027\u50e7\u4fb6\u751f\u6daf\u4e4b\u8b8a\u9077 |publisher=Ccbs.ntu.edu.tw |accessdate=2011-11-29}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ttnews.zjol.com.cn/ttxw/system/2008/06/03/010487532.shtml |title=\u767d\u83b2\u6559\u548c\u767d\u4e91\u5b97 |publisher=Ttnews.zjol.com.cn |accessdate=2011-11-29}}</ref> such as in historical [[Yunnan]],<ref>[http://www.dali.gov.cn/DefaultStyle/DefaultStyle_NewPage.aspx?PageId=36673&LibInfoID=136327 \u963f\u592e\u767d \u2013 \u5927\u7406\u5dde\u4eba\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u516c\u4f17\u4fe1\u606f\u7f51]{{Dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> [[Lingnan]] and Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web |author=(2009-03-09 22:08:27) |url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_50de0d5c0100cfoc.html |title=\u5b8b\u4ee3\u548c\u5c1a\u4e3a\u4f55\u80fd\u5a36\u59bb\u751f\u5b50? |publisher=Blog.sina.com.cn |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-11-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103170809/http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_50de0d5c0100cfoc.html |archive-date=January 3, 2017 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://dspace.xmu.edu.cn/dspace/bitstream/2288/12724/1/\u6148\u822a\u6cd5\u5e08\u4e0e\u53f0\u6e7e\u4f5b\u6559.doc]</ref> Buddhism in China was historically viewed to be the lowest of the three major religions in China because buddhist monks came from the lower classes and were both poor and uneducated.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uaxvDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT70]</ref>\n\n[[Image:LaoWalkingMonk.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Young Buddhist monk in the streets of Luang Prabang, Laos]]\n\n=== Southeast Asia ===\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], Thailand, [[Cambodia]], Laos, and [[Myanmar]], where the [[Theravada]] school is dominant, there is a long tradition of temporary ordination. During a school break, many young men usually ordain for a week or two to earn merit for loved ones and to gain knowledge of Buddhist teachings. In most countries, this temporary ordination occurs during the vassa retreat, which is regarded as a period of intensified spiritual effort by local Buddhists.  Men in Thailand typically ordain only before being married; men in Laos and Myanmar could traditionally return to the monastery from time to time after being married, provided that they secured their wives' permission.  Theravada monks are also most likely to engage in traditional practices of collecting alms, although the urbanization of parts of Southeast Asian (particularly Thailand) has presented a challenge to this practice.\n\nIn Thailand, where the Buddhist institution has traditionally been closely associated with the government and the institution of kingship, a more hierarchical structure has evolved to deal with the administration and regulation of monasteries.  This system initially stemmed from a system of royal patronage, in which monks who were appointed the abbots of 'royal monasteries' (those endowed and supported by members of the royal family) were accorded greater respect than those who headed more conventional monasteries.  This system remained fairly unstructured until the modernization efforts of the 19th century, during which a more formal system of governance was created by the central government.  Modern Thai monks are ranked according to their ability to pass examinations in Buddhist doctrine and the [[P\u0101li|Pali]] language, and are appointed to successively higher positions in the ecclesiastic hierarchy on the basis of these exams, as well as their support among influential members of the royal family and government.  Local affairs continue to be handled primarily by the local monastic and lay community, but nationwide efforts (such as curriculum decisions for monastic schools, and the authoritative form of scriptures and rituals) are typically made by the central hierarchy.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Abbot (Buddhism)]]\n*[[Buddhist ethics]]\n*[[Greco-Buddhist monasticism]]\n*[[Monastery]]\n*[[Monasticism]]\n*[[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External Links==\n* [http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/layguide.htm Layman's Guide to Monk's Rules] at Buddhanet\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n\n[[Category:Buddhist sangha|*]]\n[[Category:Buddhist monasticism| ]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_monasticism"}
