At its height, the city had a population of 5,000, and attracted larger-than-life [[Old West]] figures including [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Calamity Jane]], and [[Wild Bill Hickok]] (who was killed there). \n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 1,270. The entire city has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark District]], for its well-preserved Gold Rush-era architecture. Deadwood's proximity to [[Lead, South Dakota]] often leads to the two cities' being collectively named \"Lead-Deadwood\".\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nThe settlement of Deadwood began illegally in the 1870s, on land which had been granted to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Lakota people]] in the 1868 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]]. The treaty had guaranteed ownership of the [[Black Hills]] to the [[Lakota people]], who considered this area to be sacred. The settlers' [[squatting]] led to numerous land disputes, several of which reached the [[United States Supreme Court]]. \n\nEverything changed after Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]] led an expedition into the Black Hills and announced the discovery of gold in 1874, on French Creek near present-day [[Custer, South Dakota]]. This announcement was a catalyst for the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]], and miners and entrepreneurs swept into the area. They created the new and lawless town of Deadwood, which quickly reached a population of approximately 5,000. By 1876, over 25,000 people settled in Deadwood.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Deadshot in Deadwood: Pettigrew Visits the Black Hills|last=|first=|publisher=Siouxland Heritage Museums|others=Reprint of: The Sunshine State Magazie|year=2002|isbn=|location=Sioux Falls, SD|pages=7|orig-year=March, 1926}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1876, frontiersman [[Charlie Utter]] and his brother Steve led to Deadwood a [[wagon train]] containing what they believed were needed commodities, to bolster business. The town's numerous gamblers and prostitutes staffed several profitable ventures. [[Eleanor Dumont|Madame Mustache]] and Dirty Em were on the wagon train, and set up shop in what was referred to as Deadwood Gulch.<ref name=\"South Dakota Legends\">{{cite web | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/sd-deadwoodpaintedladies.html | title=The Painted Ladies of Deadwood Gulch | website=Legends of America | date=2003 | accessdate=October 18, 2015}}</ref> Women were in high demand by the miners, and the business of prostitution proved to have a good market. Madam [[Dora DuFran]] eventually became the most profitable [[brothel]] owner in Deadwood, closely followed by Madam [[Mollie Johnson]].\n\n[[File:Cyark Deadwood Bullock Clark.jpg|thumb|Photo-textured [[3D scanner|3D laser scan]] image of the Bullock-Clark Building, 616\u2013618 Main Street (1894)]]\nDeadwood became known for its lawlessness; murders were common, and justice for murders not always fair and impartial.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  The town attained further notoriety when gunman [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was killed on August 2, 1876. Both he and [[Calamity Jane]] were buried at [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (South Dakota)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]], as well as other notable figures such as [[Seth Bullock]]. \n\nHickok's murderer, [[Jack McCall]], was prosecuted twice, despite the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against [[double jeopardy]]. Because Deadwood was an illegal town in [[Indian Territory]], non-native civil authorities lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute  McCall. McCall's trial was moved to a [[Dakota Territory]] court, where he was found guilty of murder and hanged.\n\nBeginning August 12, 1876, a [[smallpox]] epidemic swept through. So many people fell ill that tents were erected to [[quarantine]] the stricken.\n\nIn 1876, [[George Crook|General George Crook]] pursued the [[Sioux Indians]] from the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]], on an expedition that ended in Deadwood in early September, known as the [[Horsemeat March]]. The same month, businessman Tom Miller opened the [[Bella Union Saloon]].\n\nOn April 7, 1877, [[Al Swearengen]], who controlled Deadwood's [[opium]] trade, also opened a saloon; his was called the [[Gem Theater|Gem Variety Theater]]. The saloon burned down and was rebuilt in 1879. When it burned down again in 1899, Swearengen left town.\n\nAs the economy changed from gold panning to deep mining, the individual miners went elsewhere or began to work in other fields; thusly, Deadwood lost some of its rough and rowdy character, and began to develop into a prosperous town. \n\nThe [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] in nearby [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] was established in October 1877. It operated for more than a century, becoming the longest continuously operating gold mine in the United States. Gold mining operations did not cease until 2002. The mine has been open for visiting by tourists. \n\nOn September 26, 1879, a fire devastated Deadwood, destroying more than 300 buildings and consuming the belongings of many inhabitants. Many of the newly impoverished left town to start again elsewhere.\n\nIn 1879, [[Thomas Edison]] demonstrated the incandescent lamp in [[New Jersey]], and on September 17, 1883, Judge Squire P. Romans took a gamble and founded the \"Pilcher Electric Light Company of Deadwood\". He ordered an Edison dynamo, wiring, and 15 [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent lights]] with globes. After delays, the equipment arrived without the globes. Romans had been advertising an event to show off the new lights and decided to continue with the lighting, which was a success. His company grew. Deadwood had electricity service fewer than four years after Edison invented it, less than a year after commercial service was started in [[Roselle, New Jersey]], and around the same time that many larger cities around the country established the service.<ref name=\"Electricity in Deadwood\">{{cite web | url=https://www.blackhillscorp.com/sites/default/files/bhc-ilwe-ch1.pdf | title=Illuminating The Frontier | website=blackhillscorp | accessdate=October 11, 2015 | pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, J.K.P. Miller and his associates founded a [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge railroad]], the [[Deadwood Central Railroad]], to serve their mining interests.  In 1893, [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] purchased the railroad. In 1902, a portion of the railroad between Deadwood and [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] was [[railway electrification|electrified]] for operation as an [[interurban]] passenger system, which operated until 1924. In 1930, the railroad was abandoned, apart from a portion from [[Kirk, South Dakota|Kirk]] to [[Fantail Junction, South Dakota|Fantail Junction]], which was converted to [[standard gauge]]. In 1984, [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] abandoned the remaining section.<ref>{{Hilton Narrow Gauge}}</ref>\n\nSome of the other early town residents and frequent visitors included [[Martha Bullock]], [[Aaron Dunn]], [[E. B. Farnum]], [[Samuel Fields]], [[A. W. Merrick]], [[Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy]], [[Reverend]] [[Henry Weston Smith]], [[Sol Star]], and [[Charlie Utter|Charlie and Steve Utter]].\n\n===Chinatown===\nThe gold rush attracted Chinese immigrants to the area; their population peaked at 250.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese|website=City of Deadwood|url=http://deadwood.govoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7BCDB0704A-757E-47EE-8ADB-7345C637CE19%7D|accessdate=November 15, 2010}}</ref> A few engaged in mining; most worked in service enterprises. A Chinese quarter arose on Main Street, as there were no restrictions on foreign property ownership in Dakota Territory, and a relatively high level of tolerance of different peoples existed in the frontier town.

Despite the fact that warm afternoons begin occasionally so early, 191.1 mornings each year fall to or below freezing, and even in May 6.8 mornings reach this temperature. Over the year, {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} is reached on 17.8 mornings per year, and 47.9 afternoons do not top freezing. The spring season sees heavy snow and rainfall, with {{convert|34|in|m|1}} of snow having fallen in April 1986 and as much as {{convert|15.99|in}} of precipitation in the record wet May 1982.\n\nThe summer season is very warm, although with cool nights: only one afternoon in five years will top {{convert|100|F|0}}, and only 10.7 afternoons equal or exceed {{convert|90|F|0}}. Rainfall tapers off during the summer: August 2000 was one of only two months in the 30-year 1971 to 2000 period to see not even a trace of precipitation. The fall is usually sunny and dry, with increasingly variable temperatures. The last afternoon of over {{convert|80|F}} can be expected on October 5, but the first morning freeze can be expected as early as September 23, and the first snowfall also around October 5.\n\nSince records began in 1948, the hottest temperature has been {{convert|103|F|C|1}} most recently on July 10, 1954, and the coldest {{convert|&minus;30|F|C|1}} during the great freeze of December 1989.\n{{Weather box |width=auto\n|location = Deadwood, South Dakota\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 65\n|Feb record high F = 67\n|Mar record high F = 74\n|Apr record high F = 91\n|May record high F = 94\n|Jun record high F = 101\n|Jul record high F = 103\n|Aug record high F = 103\n|Sep record high F = 101\n|Oct record high F = 86\n|Nov record high F = 75\n|Dec record high F = 64\n|Jan high F = 33\n|Feb high F = 37\n|Mar high F = 44\n|Apr high F = 53\n|May high F = 64\n|Jun high F = 74\n|Jul high F = 81\n|Aug high F = 80\n|Sep high F = 70\n|Oct high F = 57\n|Nov high F = 42\n|Dec high F = 35\n|Jan low F = 11\n|Feb low F = 15\n|Mar low F = 21\n|Apr low F = 29\n|May low F = 39\n|Jun low F = 48\n|Jul low F = 54\n|Aug low F = 52\n|Sep low F = 42\n|Oct low F = 32\n|Nov low F = 21\n|Dec low F = 13\n|Jan record low F = &minus;28\n|Feb record low F = &minus;29\n|Mar record low F = &minus;18\n|Apr record low F = &minus;4\n|May record low F = 4\n|Jun record low F = 23\n|Jul record low F = 32\n|Aug record low F = 34\n|Sep record low F = 17\n|Oct record low F = &minus;7\n|Nov record low F = &minus;19\n|Dec record low F = &minus;30\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.30\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.19\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.36\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.62\n|May precipitation inch = 4.51\n|Jun precipitation inch = 3.95\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.69\n|Aug precipitation inch = 2.03\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.79\n|Oct precipitation inch = 2.18\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.42\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1.39\n|Jan precipitation days = 8.7\n|Feb precipitation days = 7.4\n|Mar precipitation days = 8.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 10.2\n|May precipitation days = 12.0\n|Jun precipitation days = 12.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 9.7\n|Aug precipitation days = 7.5\n|Sep precipitation days = 6.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 6.7\n|Nov precipitation days = 7.0\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.7\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 inch\n|Jan snow inch = 13.8\n|Feb snow inch = 16.3\n|Mar snow inch = 20.5\n|Apr snow inch = 13.2\n|May snow inch = 2.0\n|Jun snow inch = 0.0\n|Jul snow inch = 0.0\n|Aug snow inch = 0.0\n|Sep snow inch = 0.6\n|Oct snow inch = 7.0\n|Nov snow inch = 13.2\n|Dec snow inch = 16.3\n|Jan snow days = 6.9\n|Feb snow days = 5.8\n|Mar snow days = 6.2\n|Apr snow days = 3.6\n|May snow days = 0.5\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.2\n|Oct snow days = 1.8\n|Nov snow days = 4.5\n|Dec snow days = 6.1\n|unit snow days = 0.1 inch\n|source 1 = [[South Dakota State University]]<ref name=USWC>{{cite web\n |url=http://climate.sdstate.edu/archives/data/pptnormals.shtm \n |title=Precipitation Normals 1971\u20132000 \n|website=climate.sdstate.edu\n |accessdate=April 13, 2012 \n |date=April 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417160056/http://climate.sdstate.edu/archives/data/pptnormals.shtm \n |archivedate=April 17, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]<ref name=NOAA>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/sd/392207.pdf | title = Climatography of the U.S. Deadwood 1971\u20132000 |website=noaa.gov| accessdate =April 13, 2012 |date=April 2012}}</ref>\n|date=April 2012\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1880= 3777\n|1890= 2366\n|1900= 3408\n|1910= 3653\n|1920= 2403\n|1930= 2559\n|1940= 4100\n|1950= 3288\n|1960= 3045\n|1970= 2409\n|1980= 2035\n|1990= 1830\n|2000= 1380\n|2010= 1270\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1306\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|date=June 27, 2019|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|author=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref><br/>2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2000 census===\nAs of the 2000 census,<ref name=\"GR2\" /> 1,380 people, 669 households, and 341 families resided in the city.

At its height, the city had a population of 5,000, and attracted larger-than-life [[Old West]] figures including [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Calamity Jane]], and [[Wild Bill Hickok]] (who was killed there). \n\nAccording to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 1,270. The entire city has been designated as a [[National Historic Landmark District]], for its well-preserved Gold Rush-era architecture. Deadwood's proximity to [[Lead, South Dakota]] often leads to the two cities' being collectively named \"Lead-Deadwood\".\n\n==History==\n\n===19th century===\nThe settlement of Deadwood began illegally in the 1870s, on land which had been granted to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Lakota people]] in the 1868 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]]. The treaty had guaranteed ownership of the [[Black Hills]] to the [[Lakota people]], who considered this area to be sacred. The settlers' [[squatting]] led to numerous land disputes, several of which reached the [[United States Supreme Court]]. \n\nEverything changed after Colonel [[George Armstrong Custer]] led an expedition into the Black Hills and announced the discovery of gold in 1874, on French Creek near present-day [[Custer, South Dakota]]. This announcement was a catalyst for the [[Black Hills Gold Rush]], and miners and entrepreneurs swept into the area. They created the new and lawless town of Deadwood, which quickly reached a population of approximately 5,000. By 1876, over 25,000 people settled in Deadwood.<ref>{{Cite book|url=|title=Deadshot in Deadwood: Pettigrew Visits the Black Hills|last=|first=|publisher=Siouxland Heritage Museums|others=Reprint of: The Sunshine State Magazie|year=2002|isbn=|location=Sioux Falls, SD|pages=7|orig-year=March, 1926}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1876, frontiersman [[Charlie Utter]] and his brother Steve led to Deadwood a [[wagon train]] containing what they believed were needed commodities, to bolster business. The town's numerous gamblers and prostitutes staffed several profitable ventures. [[Eleanor Dumont|Madame Mustache]] and Dirty Em were on the wagon train, and set up shop in what was referred to as Deadwood Gulch.<ref name=\"South Dakota Legends\">{{cite web | url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/sd-deadwoodpaintedladies.html | title=The Painted Ladies of Deadwood Gulch | website=Legends of America | date=2003 | accessdate=October 18, 2015}}</ref> Women were in high demand by the miners, and the business of prostitution proved to have a good market. Madam [[Dora DuFran]] eventually became the most profitable [[brothel]] owner in Deadwood, closely followed by Madam [[Mollie Johnson]].\n\n[[File:Cyark Deadwood Bullock Clark.jpg|thumb|Photo-textured [[3D scanner|3D laser scan]] image of the Bullock-Clark Building, 616\u2013618 Main Street (1894)]]\nDeadwood became known for its lawlessness; murders were common, and justice for murders not always fair and impartial.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  The town attained further notoriety when gunman [[Wild Bill Hickok]] was killed on August 2, 1876. Both he and [[Calamity Jane]] were buried at [[Mount Moriah Cemetery (South Dakota)|Mount Moriah Cemetery]], as well as other notable figures such as [[Seth Bullock]]. \n\nHickok's murderer, [[Jack McCall]], was prosecuted twice, despite the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against [[double jeopardy]]. Because Deadwood was an illegal town in [[Indian Territory]], non-native civil authorities lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute  McCall. McCall's trial was moved to a [[Dakota Territory]] court, where he was found guilty of murder and hanged.\n\nBeginning August 12, 1876, a [[smallpox]] epidemic swept through. So many people fell ill that tents were erected to [[quarantine]] the stricken.\n\nIn 1876, [[George Crook|General George Crook]] pursued the [[Sioux Indians]] from the [[Battle of Little Big Horn]], on an expedition that ended in Deadwood in early September, known as the [[Horsemeat March]]. The same month, businessman Tom Miller opened the [[Bella Union Saloon]].\n\nOn April 7, 1877, [[Al Swearengen]], who controlled Deadwood's [[opium]] trade, also opened a saloon; his was called the [[Gem Theater|Gem Variety Theater]]. The saloon burned down and was rebuilt in 1879. When it burned down again in 1899, Swearengen left town.\n\nAs the economy changed from gold panning to deep mining, the individual miners went elsewhere or began to work in other fields; thusly, Deadwood lost some of its rough and rowdy character, and began to develop into a prosperous town. \n\nThe [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] in nearby [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] was established in October 1877. It operated for more than a century, becoming the longest continuously operating gold mine in the United States. Gold mining operations did not cease until 2002. The mine has been open for visiting by tourists. \n\nOn September 26, 1879, a fire devastated Deadwood, destroying more than 300 buildings and consuming the belongings of many inhabitants. Many of the newly impoverished left town to start again elsewhere.\n\nIn 1879, [[Thomas Edison]] demonstrated the incandescent lamp in [[New Jersey]], and on September 17, 1883, Judge Squire P. Romans took a gamble and founded the \"Pilcher Electric Light Company of Deadwood\". He ordered an Edison dynamo, wiring, and 15 [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent lights]] with globes. After delays, the equipment arrived without the globes. Romans had been advertising an event to show off the new lights and decided to continue with the lighting, which was a success. His company grew. Deadwood had electricity service fewer than four years after Edison invented it, less than a year after commercial service was started in [[Roselle, New Jersey]], and around the same time that many larger cities around the country established the service.<ref name=\"Electricity in Deadwood\">{{cite web | url=https://www.blackhillscorp.com/sites/default/files/bhc-ilwe-ch1.pdf | title=Illuminating The Frontier | website=blackhillscorp | accessdate=October 11, 2015 | pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nIn 1888, J.K.P. Miller and his associates founded a [[narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge railroad]], the [[Deadwood Central Railroad]], to serve their mining interests.  In 1893, [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] purchased the railroad. In 1902, a portion of the railroad between Deadwood and [[Lead, South Dakota|Lead]] was [[railway electrification|electrified]] for operation as an [[interurban]] passenger system, which operated until 1924. In 1930, the railroad was abandoned, apart from a portion from [[Kirk, South Dakota|Kirk]] to [[Fantail Junction, South Dakota|Fantail Junction]], which was converted to [[standard gauge]]. In 1984, [[Burlington Northern Railroad]] abandoned the remaining section.<ref>{{Hilton Narrow Gauge}}</ref>\n\nSome of the other early town residents and frequent visitors included [[Martha Bullock]], [[Aaron Dunn]], [[E.

A Chinese quarter arose on Main Street, as there were no restrictions on foreign property ownership in Dakota Territory, and a relatively high level of tolerance of different peoples existed in the frontier town.

The northern end of the [[George S. Mickelson Trail]] starts in Deadwood and runs south through the Black Hills to Edgemont. Several man made lakes, including [[Sheridan Lake (South Dakota)|Sheridan Lake]], provide fishing and swimming. [[Spearfish Canyon]] to the north has many places to rock climb. In early June, the Mickelson Trail Marathon and 5K, as well as accompanying races for children, are held.\n\nDuring the winter, two ski areas operate just a few miles outside of nearby [[Lead, South Dakota]]: [[Terry Peak]] and [[Mystic Miner Ski Resort|Deer Mountain]].\n\nThe Midnight Star was a casino in Deadwood owned by American film actor [[Kevin Costner]].

While most of the state receives less than {{convert|25|in|mm|-1}} of precipitation per year, annual precipitation in the Lead\u2014Deadwood area reaches nearly {{convert|30|in|mm}}. Despite a mean annual snowfall of {{convert|102.9|in|m|1}}, warm [[chinook wind]]s are frequent enough that the median snow cover is zero even in January, although during cold spells after big snowstorms there can be considerable snow on the ground. On November 6, 2008, after a storm had deposited {{convert|45.7|in|m|1}} of snow, with a water equivalent of {{convert|4.25|in|mm|}}, {{convert|35|in|m|1}} of snow lay on the ground.<ref>{{cite web|website=[[National Weather Service]]| url=http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=unr |title=NOW Data| location= Rapid City, South Dakota}}</ref>\n\nSpring is brief, and is characterized by large wet snow storms and periods of rain. April 2006, although around {{convert|4|F-change|C-change|1}} hotter than the long-term mean overall, saw a major storm of {{convert|54.4|in|m|1}}, with a water equivalent {{convert|4.3|in|mm|0}}, and left a record snow depth of {{convert|39|in|m|0}} on the 19th. Typically the first {{convert|70|F}} temperature will be reached at the beginning of April, the first {{convert|80|F}} near the beginning of May, and the first {{convert|90|F}} around mid-June. Despite the fact that warm afternoons begin occasionally so early, 191.1 mornings each year fall to or below freezing, and even in May 6.8 mornings reach this temperature. Over the year, {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} is reached on 17.8 mornings per year, and 47.9 afternoons do not top freezing. The spring season sees heavy snow and rainfall, with {{convert|34|in|m|1}} of snow having fallen in April 1986 and as much as {{convert|15.99|in}} of precipitation in the record wet May 1982.\n\nThe summer season is very warm, although with cool nights: only one afternoon in five years will top {{convert|100|F|0}}, and only 10.7 afternoons equal or exceed {{convert|90|F|0}}. Rainfall tapers off during the summer: August 2000 was one of only two months in the 30-year 1971 to 2000 period to see not even a trace of precipitation.

STAAD can be used for analysis and design of all types of structural projects from plants, buildings, and bridges to towers, tunnels, metro stations, water/wastewater treatment plants and more.\n\n== Important Features ==\n\n=== Analytical Modeling ===\nAnalytical model can be created using the ribbon-based user interface, by editing the command file or by importing several other files types like dxf, cis/2 etc. The model geometry can even be generated from the data of macro-enabled applications (like Microsoft Excel, Microstation etc.) by using Macros.\n\n=== Physical Modeling ===\nPhysical modeling has been a significant feature included in the program. STAAD.Pro Physical Modeler takes advantage of physical modeling to simplify modeling of a structure, which in turn more accurately reflects the process of building a model. Beams and surfaces are placed in the model on the scale of which they would appear in the physical world. A column may span multiple floors and a surface represents an entire floor of a building, for example. A joint is then generated anywhere two physical objects meet in the model (as well as at the free ends of cantilevered members, for convenience).\n\n=== STAAD Building Planner ===\nSTAAD Building Planner is a module that enables seamless generation of building models that can be analyzed and designed thereafter in the program itself. Operations like defining geometry, making changes in the geometric specifications are matters of only few clicks in this workflow.\n\n=== Steel AutoDrafter ===\nSteel AutoDrafter workflow extracts planar drawings and material take-off from a structural steel model prepared in STAAD.Pro. It produces excellent quality plans at any level and sections in any of the orthogonal directions.\n\n=== STAAD.Beava ===\nThe general philosophy governing the design of bridges is that, subject to a set of loading rules and constraints, the worst effects due to load application should be established and designed against. The process of load application can be complex as governing rules can impose interdependent parameters such as loaded length on a lane, lane factors, and load intensity. To obtain the maximum design effects, engineers have to try many loading situations on a trial and error basis.\n\nThis leads to the generation of many live load application instances (and a large volume of output data) that then must be combined with dead load and other effects, as well. Bridge Deck is used to minimize the load application process while complying with national code requirements.\n\nThe program is based on the use of influence surfaces, which are generated by STAAD.Pro as part of the loading process. An influence surface for a given effect on a bridge deck relates its value to movement of a unit load over the point of interest. The influence surface is a three-dimensional form of an influence line for a single member (or, in other words, it is a 2D influence function).\n\nSTAAD.Pro will automatically generate influence surfaces for effects such as bending moments for elements, deflection in all the degrees of freedom of nodes, and support reactions. The user then instruct the program to utilize the relevant influence surfaces and, with due regards to code requirements, optimize load positions to obtain the maximum desired effects.\n\n=== Advanced Concrete Design ===\nThe Advanced Concrete Design workflow provides direct access for STAAD.Pro models to leverage the power of the RCDC application. This is a standalone application, which is operated outside the STAAD.Pro environment, but requires a model and results data from a suitable analysis.\nThe model should typically be formed from beams and columns (plates are currently not supported). RCDC can be used to design the following objects: Pile Caps, Footings, Columns and walls, Beams, Slabs.\n\nAs the projects progresses, each design created in RCDC is retained and displayed when RCDC is re-entered, so that previous designs can be recalled and/or continued. \nDetailed drawings and BBS of excellent quality can be generated as required and they are quite ready to be sent for execution.\n\n=== Advanced Slab Design ===\nThe STAAD.Pro Advanced Slab Design workflow is an integrated tool that works from within the STAAD.Pro environment. Concrete slabs can be defined, and the data can be transferred to RAM Concept.\nThe data passed into RAM Concept includes the geometry, section and material properties, loads and combination information, and analysis results.\n\n=== Earthquake Mode ===\nEurocode 8: Part 1 contains specific requirements and recommendations for building structures that are to be constructed in seismic regions. Essentially, these fundamental requirements have been provided to ensure that the structures can sustain the seismic loads without collapse and also \u2013 where required\u2013 avoid suffering unacceptable damage and can continue to function after an exposure to a seismic event.\nThis STAAD.Pro workflow is used to check if the structure conforms to the basic geometric recommendations made in Eurocode 8 (EC8). This workflow is in addition to the normal post-processing workflow which gives the various analysis results. These checks are intended to give you a \"feel\" for the structure and are not mandatory to proceed to the design phase.\n\n=== OpenSTAAD Macro Editor ===\n==== OpenSTAAD Macro Editor ====\nOpenSTAAD is a library of exposed functions enabling engineers access STAAD.Pro\u2019s internal functions and routines as well as its graphical commands. With OpenSTAAD, one can use VBA macros to perform such tasks as automating repetitive modeling or post-processing tasks or embedding customized design routines. Following an open architecture paradigm, OpenSTAAD was built using ATL, COM, and COM+ standards as specified by Microsoft. This allows OpenSTAAD to be used in a macro application like Microsoft Excel or Autodesk AutoCAD. OpenSTAAD can also be used to link STAAD data to Web-based applications using ActiveX, HTML, and ASP. Through the in-built Macro Editor, one can leverage the functionalities of OpenSTAAD and automate the analysis and design workflows, thereby eliminating the chance of occurrence of potential errors due to manual intervention and reducing the required time for execution of the whole workflow (as compared to the manual execution time), to a large extent.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Products/STAAD.Pro Bentley.com]\n\n[[Category:Computer-aided engineering software]]\n[[Category:Structural analysis]]\n[[Category:Structural engineering]]\n", "name_user": "Astaad official", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STAAD"}

The dynasty was founded by [[Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] in 1925, a former brigadier-general of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdicate by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah of Iran]].\n\nThe Pahlavis came to power after [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] ruler of Iran, proved unable to stop British and Soviet encroachment on Iranian sovereignty, had his position extremely weakened by a military coup, and was removed from power by the parliament while in France. The Iranian parliament, known as the ''[[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]'', convening as a [[Constituent Assembly]] on 12 December 1925, deposed the young Ahmad Shah Qajar, and declared Reza Khan the new King (''[[Shah]]'') of Imperial State of [[Name of Iran|Persia]]. In 1935, [[Reza Shah]] asked foreign delegates to use the [[endonym]] [[Name of Iran|Iran]] in formal correspondence and the official name the Imperial State of Iran was adopted.\n\nFollowing the [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] in 1953 supported by the [[United Kingdom]] and the United States, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became more autocratic and was aligned with the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. Faced with growing public discontent and popular rebellion throughout 1978 and after declaring surrender and officially resigning, the second Pahlavi went into exile with his family in January 1979, sparking a series of events that quickly led to the [[Iranian Revolution|end]] of the state and the beginning of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 11 February 1979.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |title=Iran marks Islamic Republic Day |publisher=Press TV |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922151735/http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |archivedate=22 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe Pahlavi dynasty was an Iranian royal dynasty of [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani]] ethnicity.

In 1935, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term Iran in formal correspondence, in accordance with the fact that \"[[Persia]]\" was a term used by Western peoples for the country called \"Iran\" in Persian. His successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, announced in 1959 that both Persia and Iran were acceptable and could be used interchangeably.\n\nReza Shah tried to avoid involvement with the UK and the [[Soviet Union]]. Though many of his development projects required foreign technical expertise, he avoided awarding contracts to British and Soviet companies because of dissatisfaction during the Qajar Dynasty between Persia, the UK, and the Soviets. Although the UK, through its ownership of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], controlled all of Iran's oil resources, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h preferred to obtain technical assistance from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries. This created problems for Iran after 1939, when Germany and Britain became enemies in [[World War II]]. Reza Shah proclaimed Iran as a [[neutral country]], but Britain insisted that German engineers and technicians in Iran were spies with missions to [[sabotage]] British oil facilities in southwestern Iran. Britain demanded that Iran expel all German citizens, but Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h refused, claiming this would adversely affect his development projects.\n\n==World War II==\n{{History of Iran}}\n{{Main|Invasion of Iran (1941)}}\nOn 13 September 1943 the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] reassured the Iranians that all foreign troops would leave by 2 March 1946.<ref name=Jessup>{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945\u20131985 |year=1989 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York |isbn=0-313-24308-5 |page= |pages=}}</ref> At the time, the [[Tudeh Party of Iran]], a [[communist party]] that was already influential and had parliamentary representation, was becoming increasingly militant, especially in the North. This promoted actions from the side of the government, including attempts of the Iranian armed forces to restore order in the Northern provinces. While the Tudeh headquarters in [[Tehran]] were occupied and the [[Isfahan]] branch crushed, the Soviet troops present in the Northern parts of the country prevented the Iranian forces from entering. Thus, by November 1945 [[Azerbaijan People's Government|Azerbaijan]] had become an autonomous state helped by the Tudeh party.<ref name=\"Jessup\" /><ref>''The Iranian Crisis of 1945\u20131946 and the Spiral Model of International Conflict'', by Fred H.

His wife was crowned as the [[Shahbanu]] of Iran.]]\n[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] replaced his father on the throne on 16 September 1941. He wanted to continue the reform policies of his father, but a contest for control of the government soon erupted between him and an older professional politician, the nationalistic [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]].\n\nIn 1951, the ''Majlis'' (the [[Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Parliament of Iran]]) named [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] as new prime minister by a vote of 79\u201312, who shortly after nationalized the British-owned oil industry (see [[Abadan Crisis]]). Mossadegh was opposed by the Shah who feared a resulting oil embargo imposed by the West would leave Iran in economic ruin. The Shah fled Iran but returned when the United Kingdom and the United States staged a coup against Mossadegh in August 1953 (see [[Operation Ajax]]). Mossadegh was then arrested by pro-Shah army forces.\n\nMajor plans to build Iran's infrastructure were undertaken, a new middle class began flourishing and in less than two decades Iran became the indisputable major economic and military power of the Middle East.\n\n==Collapse of the dynasty==\n{{Main|Iranian Revolution}}\n[[File:Shah and Farah.jpg|thumb|The Shah and his wife left Iran on 16 January 1979.]]\n[[File:ShahVaRohanioon1.jpg|thumb|The last [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] meets clergy. Some of Iranian clergy opposed him while some others supported him as \"The only Shi'ite ruler\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}]]\n\nThe Shah's government suppressed its opponents with the help of Iran's security and intelligence secret police, [[SAVAK]]. Such opponents included leftists and Islamists.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, relying on increased oil revenues, Mohammad Reza began a series of even more ambitious and bolder plans for the progress of his country and the march toward the \"[[White Revolution]]\". But his socioeconomic advances increasingly irritated the clergy. Islamic leaders, particularly the exiled cleric [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], were able to focus this discontent with an ideology tied to Islamic principles that called for the overthrow of the Shah and the return to Islamic traditions, called the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]]. The Pahlavi regime collapsed following widespread uprisings in 1978 and 1979. The Islamic Revolution dissolved the SAVAK and replaced it with the [[SAVAMA]]. It was run after the revolution, according to U.S. sources and Iranian exile sources in the US and in Paris, by Gen. [[Hossein Fardoust]], who was deputy chief of SAVAK under Mohammad Reza's reign, and a friend from boyhood of the deposed monarch.\n\nMohammad Reza fled the country, seeking medical treatment in [[Egypt]], Mexico, the United States, and Panama, and finally resettled with his family in Egypt as a guest of [[Anwar Sadat]]. On his death, his son [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi]] succeeded him ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' as heir apparent to the Pahlavi dynasty.

[[Parviz Sabeti]], a high-ranking official of [[SAVAK]] believed that the one important reason for successful opposition to the regime was corruption.<ref>Ganji, p. 8-9</ref>\n\n== Line of succession to the [[Shah|Persian throne]] ==\nSuccession order is who should take over if the monarch dies or abdicates. The succession order of the [[List of monarchs of Persia|Persian throne]] in [[Iranian Revolution|1979]] was: (If Mohammad Reza Shah were to die or abdicate, \"[[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|number 1]]\" would take over the throne)\n\n# Crown Prince [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Cyrus Reza Pahlavi,]] eldest son of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]]\n# Prince [[Ali-Reza Pahlavi|Ali Reza Pahlavi II,]] youngest son of Mohammad Reza Shah\n# Prince [[Patrick Ali Pahlavi]], son of Prince [[Ali Reza Pahlavi I]]. The second son of [[Reza Shah]].\n# Prince [[Gholamreza Pahlavi|Gholam Reza Pahlavi]], third son of [[Reza Shah]]\n# Prince [[Bahman Pahlavi]], eldest son of Prince Gholam Reza Pahlavi.\n# Prince [[Abdul Reza Pahlavi]], fourth son of Reza Shah\n# Prince [[Ahmad Reza Pahlavi]], fifth son of Reza Shah\n# Prince [[Mahmud Reza Pahlavi]], sixth son of Reza Shah\n\nReza Shah also had a seventh son, Prince [[Hamid Reza Pahlavi]], but Mohammad Reza Shah ejected him from the Royal House, on the grounds that Prince Hamid Reza was a promiscuous \"fun-lover,\" partying from club to club to private parties night after night, and he was also deeply addicted to [[Drug|drugs.]] After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Revolution]], Prince Hamid Reza was one of the few members of the Pahlavi Dynasty who stayed in Iran.\n\nReza Shah and Mohammad Reza Shah both had several daughters but at that time in Iran women could not inherit the throne.\n\n<br />If the Pahlavi Dynasty were still to rule Iran now, women would probably be allowed to inherit the throne. So if the Pahlavi Dynasty returns to Iran now, with Crown Prince Cyrus Reza as the King, here is how the succession order might look like:\n\n# Princess [[Princess Noor Pahlavi|Noor Pahlavi,]] eldest daughter of Crown Prince [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Cyrus Reza]] \n# Princess [[Iman Pahlavi]], second daughter of Crown Prince Cyrus Reza\n# Princess [[Farah Pahlavi, Princess of Iran|Farah

The dynasty was founded by [[Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] in 1925, a former brigadier-general of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdicate by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah of Iran]].\n\nThe Pahlavis came to power after [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] ruler of Iran, proved unable to stop British and Soviet encroachment on Iranian sovereignty, had his position extremely weakened by a military coup, and was removed from power by the parliament while in France. The Iranian parliament, known as the ''[[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]'', convening as a [[Constituent Assembly]] on 12 December 1925, deposed the young Ahmad Shah Qajar, and declared Reza Khan the new King (''[[Shah]]'') of Imperial State of [[Name of Iran|Persia]]. In 1935, [[Reza Shah]] asked foreign delegates to use the [[endonym]] [[Name of Iran|Iran]] in formal correspondence and the official name the Imperial State of Iran was adopted.\n\nFollowing the [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] in 1953 supported by United Kingdom and the United States, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became more autocratic and was aligned with the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. Faced with growing public discontent and popular rebellion throughout 1978 and after declaring surrender and officially resigning, the second Pahlavi went into exile with his family in January 1979, sparking a series of events that quickly led to the [[Iranian Revolution|end]] of the state and the beginning of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 11 February 1979.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |title=Iran marks Islamic Republic Day |publisher=Press TV |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922151735/http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |archivedate=22 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe Pahlavi dynasty was an Iranian royal dynasty of [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani]] ethnicity.

In 1935, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term Iran in formal correspondence, in accordance with the fact that \"[[Persia]]\" was a term used by Western peoples for the country called \"Iran\" in Persian. His successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, announced in 1959 that both Persia and Iran were acceptable and could be used interchangeably.\n\nReza Shah tried to avoid involvement with the UK and the [[Soviet Union]]. Though many of his development projects required foreign technical expertise, he avoided awarding contracts to British and Soviet companies because of dissatisfaction during the Qajar Dynasty between Persia, the UK, and the Soviets. Although the UK, through its ownership of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], controlled all of Iran's oil resources, Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h preferred to obtain technical assistance from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries. This created problems for Iran after 1939, when Germany and Britain became enemies in [[World War II]]. Reza Shah proclaimed Iran as a [[neutral country]], but Britain insisted that German engineers and technicians in Iran were spies with missions to [[sabotage]] British oil facilities in southwestern Iran. Britain demanded that Iran expel all German citizens, but Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h refused, claiming this would adversely affect his development projects.\n\n==World War II==\n{{History of Iran}}\n{{Main|Invasion of Iran (1941)}}\nOn 13 September 1943 the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] reassured the Iranians that all foreign troops would leave by 2 March 1946.<ref name=Jessup>{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945\u20131985 |year=1989 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York |isbn=0-313-24308-5 |page= |pages=}}</ref> At the time, the [[Tudeh Party of Iran]], a [[communist party]] that was already influential and had parliamentary representation, was becoming increasingly militant, especially in the North. This promoted actions from the side of the government, including attempts of the Iranian armed forces to restore order in the Northern provinces. While the Tudeh headquarters in [[Tehran]] were occupied and the [[Isfahan]] branch crushed, the Soviet troops present in the Northern parts of the country prevented the Iranian forces from entering. Thus, by November 1945 [[Azerbaijan People's Government|Azerbaijan]] had become an autonomous state helped by the Tudeh party.<ref name=\"Jessup\" /><ref>''The Iranian Crisis of 1945\u20131946 and the Spiral Model of International Conflict'', by Fred H.

His wife was crowned as the [[Shahbanu]] of Iran.]]\n[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] replaced his father on the throne on 16 September 1941. He wanted to continue the reform policies of his father, but a contest for control of the government soon erupted between him and an older professional politician, the nationalistic [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]].\n\nIn 1951, the ''Majlis'' (the [[Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Parliament of Iran]]) named [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] as new prime minister by a vote of 79\u201312, who shortly after nationalized the British-owned oil industry (see [[Abadan Crisis]]). Mossadegh was opposed by the Shah who feared a resulting oil embargo imposed by the West would leave Iran in economic ruin. The Shah fled Iran but returned when the United Kingdom and the United States staged a coup against Mossadegh in August 1953 (see [[Operation Ajax]]). Mossadegh was then arrested by pro-Shah army forces.\n\nMajor plans to build Iran's infrastructure were undertaken, a new middle class began flourishing and in less than two decades Iran became the indisputable major economic and military power of the Middle East.\n\n==Collapse of the dynasty==\n{{Main|Iranian Revolution}}\n[[File:Shah and Farah.jpg|thumb|The Shah and his wife left Iran on 16 January 1979.]]\n[[File:ShahVaRohanioon1.jpg|thumb|The last [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] meets clergy. Some of Iranian clergy opposed him while some others supported him as \"The only Shi'ite ruler\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}]]\n\nThe Shah's government suppressed its opponents with the help of Iran's security and intelligence secret police, [[SAVAK]]. Such opponents included leftists and Islamists.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, relying on increased oil revenues, Mohammad Reza began a series of even more ambitious and bolder plans for the progress of his country and the march toward the \"[[White Revolution]]\". But his socioeconomic advances increasingly irritated the clergy. Islamic leaders, particularly the exiled cleric [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], were able to focus this discontent with an ideology tied to Islamic principles that called for the overthrow of the Shah and the return to Islamic traditions, called the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]]. The Pahlavi regime collapsed following widespread uprisings in 1978 and 1979. The Islamic Revolution dissolved the SAVAK and replaced it with the [[SAVAMA]]. It was run after the revolution, according to U.S. sources and Iranian exile sources in the US and in Paris, by Gen. [[Hossein Fardoust]], who was deputy chief of SAVAK under Mohammad Reza's reign, and a friend from boyhood of the deposed monarch.\n\nMohammad Reza fled the country, seeking medical treatment in [[Egypt]], Mexico, the United States, and Panama, and finally resettled with his family in Egypt as a guest of [[Anwar Sadat]]. On his death, his son [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi]] succeeded him ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' as heir apparent to the Pahlavi dynasty.

The use of minority languages in schools and newspapers was not tolerated.
