During 1735, when construction was at its peak, at least 23.  Astronomers were employed in Jaipur, and due to the changing political climate, Jaipur replaced Delhi as Jai Singh's main observatory, and remained Jai Singh's central observatory until his death in 1743. The observatory lost support under [[Ishvari Singh|Isvari Singh]] (r.1743-1750) because of a succession war between him and his brother. However, [[Madho Singh I|Mado Singh]] (r. 1750-1768), Isvari Singh's successor, supported the observatory, although it did not see the same level of activity as under Jai Singh. Although some restorations were made to the Jantar Mantar under Pratap Singh (r.1778-1803), activity at the observatory died down again. During this time, a temple was constructed, and Pratap Singh turned the site of the observatory into a gun factory.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[File:Bhairav Temple Jantar Mantar Jaipur.jpg|thumb|Bhairav Temple - located within the Jantar Mantar Complex]]\nRam Singh (r. 1835-1880) began the restoration of the Jantar Mantar, and completed restoring it in 1876, and even made some of the instruments more durable by inserting the lead into the lines in the instruments, and restoring some of the plaster instruments with stone instead. However, the observatory soon became neglected again, and was not restored until 1901 under [[Madho Singh II]] (r. 1880-1922) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ecliptic equator galactic anim.gif|thumb|Jantar Mantar deploys all three ancient coordinate systems of the five celestial coordinate systems known.

The scale to which they have been built has been alleged to increase their accuracy.

He constructed five new observatories in different cities in order to create a more accurate Zij. The astronomical tables Jai Singh created, known as the Zij-i Muhammad Shahi, was continuously used in India for a century. However, the table had little significance outside of India also it was used to measure time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sawai Jai Singh and his astronomy|last=Nath.|first=Sharma, Virendra|date=2016|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|others=Jai Singh II, Maharaja of Jaipur, 1686-1743.|isbn=978-81-208-1256-7|edition= 2nd|location=Delhi|oclc=32699670}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nWhen Jai Singh began construction in Jaipur is unknown, but several instruments had been built by 1728, and the construction of the instruments in Jaipur continued until 1738. During 1735, when construction was at its peak, at least 23.  Astronomers were employed in Jaipur, and due to the changing political climate, Jaipur replaced Delhi as Jai Singh's main observatory, and remained Jai Singh's central observatory until his death in 1743. The observatory lost support under [[Ishvari Singh|Isvari Singh]] (r.1743-1750) because of a succession war between him and his brother. However, [[Madho Singh I|Mado Singh]] (r. 1750-1768), Isvari Singh's successor, supported the observatory, although it did not see the same level of activity as under Jai Singh. Although some restorations were made to the Jantar Mantar under Pratap Singh (r.1778-1803), activity at the observatory died down again. During this time, a temple was constructed, and Pratap Singh turned the site of the observatory into a gun factory.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n[[File:Bhairav Temple Jantar Mantar Jaipur.jpg|thumb|Bhairav Temple - located within the Jantar Mantar Complex]]\nRam Singh (r. 1835-1880) began the restoration of the Jantar Mantar, and completed restoring it in 1876, and even made some of the instruments more durable by inserting the lead into the lines in the instruments, and restoring some of the plaster instruments with stone instead. However, the observatory soon became neglected again, and was not restored until 1901 under [[Madho Singh II]] (r. 1880-1922) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ecliptic equator galactic anim.gif|thumb|Jantar Mantar deploys all three ancient coordinate systems of the five celestial coordinate systems known.
