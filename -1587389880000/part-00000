The country before 1898 was dominated by several Spanish religious orders. Several years before the De La Salle Christian Brothers were invited to the Philippines, the local American government ordered Ateneo to modernize and use English as a mode of instruction, but the Spanish Jesuits refused and argued that their allegiance was with Spain. The Americans have known this made them decide that it would be best for the De La Salle Christian Brothers (FSC \u2013 Fraternum Scholarum Christianarum) to take over the task, the Christian Brothers have established several De La Salle schools worldwide provided Christian values-based education in 35 countries at that time. The Americans have always known that the De La Salle Christian Brothers were up to the given task due to the Brothers' main religious vocation was Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers had 3 centuries of innovative teaching experience making them highly knowledgeable, capable and qualified in providing modern educational methods to the young Filipinos in Manila. In fact, several Filipinos like the future President Manuel L. Quezon's Secretary of National Defense and General Basilio Valdes were also educated in the oldest De La Salle School in Hong Kong-St. Joseph's College. Initially, the De La Salle Brothers were very hesitant in establishing a De La Salle school in the country because the Americans insisted that the first De La Salle school should only educate the rich children of the Filipino ruling elite. The Americans ordered the Christian Brothers to Americanize future Filipino leaders through their Catholic Lasallian education. The American request had put the De La Salle Brothers in a dilemma because it ran contrary to the original teachings and charism of Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]] \u2013 Patron Saint of Teachers whose religious vocation was to provide tuition-free, quality Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers eventually relented, conceding that the \u201cupper-class children also needed good moral and spiritual training.\" Saint La Salle's mission was to empower the last, the least and the lost among the poorest children in the world in order to free them from the shackles of ignorance that creates poverty.\n\nDe La Salle University traces its founding roots to then [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] [[Jeremiah James Harty]]. Harty, an alumnus of a Christian Brother school in Saint Louis, Missouri U.S.A. believed that the establishment of a De La Salle school in Manila would be instrumental and vital in preempting the spread of [[Protestantism in the Philippines]] through the arrival of the [[Thomasites]] and American Protestant church missions.<ref name =\"Handbook\">{{Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003\u201306 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = June 26, 2003 | accessdate = May 15, 2011 | location = Manila}}</ref> His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by Pope [[Pius X]]. An envoy of De La Salle Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Manila Archbishop Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus.

During the initial outbreak of the invasion of Manila by the Japanese Marines, several La Salle boys helped secure and save Ateneo's prized \"Jesuit Bell\" along with several valuable Jesuit religious antiques just before the Japanese shock troops could enter Manila and ransack the Jesuits' pre-war campus.\n\nThe American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interred in the Japanese Los Banos, Laguna Prison for the duration of the 3-Year Japanese Occupation while the other non-American Brothers led by then Brother President-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC and Brother Flavius Leo FSC, both from Ireland, were allowed by the Japanese to stay in the Taft Campus.\n\nInitially, the De La Salle campus served as a secret shelter for several displaced civilians, wounded soldiers and Filipino guerilla fighters at the beginning of the Japanese occupation. However, later on it was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]], and was made into military defense quarters on January 2, 1942.<ref name=\"DLSU history\"/> Several repeated bombings severely damaged the DLSC campus. Despite this, classes continued as the Christian Brothers taught on during the Japanese occupation of Manila. During this time, several of the De La Salle boys along with the Ateneo boys had to set their school rivalry aside and share their classrooms with each other along with several other students from various neighboring schools. Several schools in Manila had discontinued their operations and closed down due to the fall of Manila to the Japanese invading forces.

On February 7, 1945, Brother Egbert Xavier Kelly FSC was abducted by Japanese soldiers, and was never seen again; he was believed to have been mercilessly tortured and killed.

The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924\u201326 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernie Oca's present DLSU AN1MO!SQUAD has been continuously cheerleading for {{Age|1926|1|1}} years.\n \nThe first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from Saint Scholastica's College, Manila several years before De La Salle College turned co-educational. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \"Men of La Salle!, \"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\", \"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\" and several more.\n\nIn 1941, the DLSC ''Green & White'' yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \"Hail to De La Salle\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \"Invictus La Salle!\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/17/1246180/animo-la-salle|title=ANIMO La Salle!|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Partner institution==\n===Malaysia===\n*[[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Cardinal Jaime Sin in 1988.jpg|thumb|Jaime Sin]]\n{{Main|List of De La Salle University people}}\nNotable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include:\n*[[Jose Diokno]]\n*[[Lorenzo Tanada]]\n*[[Salvador H.

The country before 1898 was dominated by several Spanish religious orders. Several years before the De La Salle Christian Brothers were invited to the Philippines, the local American government ordered Ateneo to modernize and use English as a mode of instruction, but the Spanish Jesuits refused and argued that their allegiance was with Spain. The Americans have known this made them decide that it would be best for the De La Salle Christian Brothers (FSC \u2013 Fraternum Scholarum Christianarum) to take over the task, the Christian Brothers have established several De La Salle schools worldwide provided Christian values-based education in 35 countries at that time. The Americans have always known that the De La Salle Christian Brothers were up to the given task due to the Brothers' main religious vocation was Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers had 3 centuries of innovative teaching experience making them highly knowledgeable, capable and qualified in providing modern educational methods to the young Filipinos in Manila. In fact, several Filipinos like the future President Manuel L. Quezon's Secretary of National Defense and General Basilio Valdes were also educated in the oldest De La Salle School in Hong Kong-St. Joseph's College. Initially, the De La Salle Brothers were very hesitant in establishing a De La Salle school in the country because the Americans insisted that the first De La Salle school should only educate the rich children of the Filipino ruling elite. The Americans ordered the Christian Brothers to Americanize future Filipino leaders through their Catholic Lasallian education. The American request had put the De La Salle Brothers in a dilemma because it ran contrary to the original teachings and charism of Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]] \u2013 Patron Saint of Teachers whose religious vocation was to provide tuition-free, quality Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers eventually relented, conceding that the \u201cupper-class children also needed good moral and spiritual training.\" Saint La Salle's mission was to empower the last, the least and the lost among the poorest children in the world in order to free them from the shackles of ignorance that creates poverty.\n\nDe La Salle University traces its founding roots to then [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] [[Jeremiah James Harty]]. Harty, an alumnus of a Christian Brother school in Saint Louis, Missouri U.S.A. believed that the establishment of a De La Salle school in Manila would be instrumental and vital in preempting the spread of [[Protestantism in the Philippines]] through the arrival of the [[Thomasites]] and American Protestant church missions.<ref name =\"Handbook\">{{Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003\u201306 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = June 26, 2003 | accessdate = May 15, 2011 | location = Manila}}</ref> His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by Pope [[Pius X]]. An envoy of De La Salle Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Manila Archbishop Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus.

During the initial outbreak of the invasion of Manila by the Japanese Marines, several La Salle boys helped secure and save Ateneo's prized \"Jesuit Bell\" along with several valuable Jesuit religious antiques just before the Japanese shock troops could enter Manila and ransack the Jesuits' pre-war campus.\n\nThe American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interred in the Japanese Los Banos, Laguna Prison for the duration of the 3-Year Japanese Occupation while the other non-American Brothers led by then Brother President-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC and Brother Flavius Leo FSC, both from Ireland, were allowed by the Japanese to stay in the Taft Campus.\n\nInitially, the De La Salle campus served as a secret shelter for several displaced civilians, wounded soldiers and Filipino guerilla fighters at the beginning of the Japanese occupation. However, later on it was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]], and was made into military defense quarters on January 2, 1942.<ref name=\"DLSU history\"/> Several repeated bombings severely damaged the DLSC campus. Despite this, classes continued as the Christian Brothers taught on during the Japanese occupation of Manila.

Several schools in Manila had discontinued their operations and closed down due to the fall of Manila to the Japanese invading forces.

Decades later on as the post-war DLSC cheerleading Squad then in the 80's as the DLSU Pep Squad in the UAAP prior to its 2008 renaming by Br. Bernie Oca, FSC as the present DLSU AN1MO! SQUAD. The DLSU Green & White Spirit Team has since then won five cheer dance podium finishes in the span of its UAAP participation, in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2011 and 2013. The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924\u201326 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernie Oca's present DLSU AN1MO!SQUAD has been continuously cheerleading for {{Age|1926|1|1}} years.\n \nThe first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from Saint Scholastica's College, Manila several years before De La Salle College turned co-educational. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \"Men of La Salle!, \"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\", \"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\" and several more.\n\nIn 1941, the DLSC ''Green & White'' yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \"Hail to De La Salle\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \"Invictus La Salle!\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/17/1246180/animo-la-salle|title=ANIMO La Salle!|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Partner institution==\n===Malaysia===\n*[[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Cardinal Jaime Sin in 1988.jpg|thumb|Jaime Sin]]\n{{Main|List of De La Salle University people}}\nNotable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include:\n*[[Jose Diokno]]\n*[[Lorenzo Tanada]]\n*[[Salvador H.

{"title_page": "Labor theory of value", "text_new": "{{short description|Theoretical economics}}\n\nThe '''labour theory of value''' ('''LTV''') is a [[theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] that argues that the [[Value (economics)|economic value]] of a good or service is determined by the total amount of \"[[Socially_necessary_labour_time|socially necessary labour]]\u201d required to produce it.\n\nLTV is usually associated with [[Marxian economics]], though it also appears in the theories of earlier [[Classical_economics|classical]] [[liberal economists]] such as [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]] and later also in [[anarchist economics]]. Smith saw the price of a commodity in terms of the labour that the purchaser must expend to buy it, which embodies the concept of how much labour a commodity, a tool for example, can save the purchaser. The LTV is central to Marxist theory, which holds that the working class is exploited under capitalism, and dissociates price and value. Marx did not refer to his own theory of value as a \"labour theory of value\".<ref>Mike Beggs, \"Zombie Marx and Modern Economics, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Forget the Transformation Problem.\" ''Journal of Australian Political Economy'', issue 70, Summer 2012/13, p. 16 [http://australianpe.wix.com/japehome#!current/c1cok]; Gary Mongiovi, \"Vulgar economy in Marxian garb: a critique of Temporal Single System Marxism.\" In: ''Review of Radical Political Economics'', Vol. 34, Issue 4, December 2002, pp. 393-416, at p. 398.</ref> Mainstream [[neoclassical economics]] tends to reject the need for an LTV, concentrating instead on the fluctuations of price according to [[supply and demand]] using a theory of value based on [[Marginalism|marginal utility]].<ref>[[Philip H.

Both [[David Ricardo#Value theory|David Ricardo]]<ref>It is now interpreted that Ricardo's theory of value is not the labor theory of value, but the cost of production theory of value. See [[David Ricardo#Value theory]]</ref> and [[Karl Marx]] tried to quantify and embody all labour components in order to develop a theory of the real price, or natural price of a commodity.<ref>e.g. see - Junankar, P. N., ''Marx's economics'', Oxford : Philip Allan, 1982, {{ISBN|0-86003-125-X}} or Peach, Terry \"Interpreting Ricardo\", Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-26086-8}}</ref> The labour theory of value as presented by [[Adam Smith]] did not require the quantification of past labour, nor did it deal with the labour needed to create the tools (capital) that might be used in producing a commodity. Smith's theory of value was very similar to the later utility theories in that Smith proclaimed that a commodity was worth whatever labour it would command in others (value in trade) or whatever labour it would \"save\" the self (value in use), or both. However, this \"value\" is subject to supply and demand at a particular time: <blockquote>The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V)</blockquote>\n\nSmith's theory of price (which for many is the same as value) has nothing to do with the past labour spent in producing a commodity.  It speaks only of the labour that can be \"commanded\" or \"saved\" at present.  If there is no use for a buggy whip, then the item is economically worthless in trade or in use, regardless of all the labour spent in creating it.\n\n=== Distinctions of economically pertinent labour ===\nValue \"in use\" is the [[usefulness]] of this commodity, its [[utility]]. A classical [[Paradox of value|paradox]] often comes up when considering this type of value. In the words of Adam Smith: <blockquote>The word value, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called \"value in use\"; the other, \"value in exchange.\" The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter IV).</blockquote>\n\nValue \"in [[Trade|exchange]]\" is the relative proportion with which this commodity exchanges for another commodity (in other words, its [[price]] in the case of [[money]]). It is relative to labour as explained by Adam Smith: <blockquote>The value of any commodity, [...] to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V).</blockquote>\n\nValue (without qualification) is the labour embodied in a commodity under a given structure of production. Marx defined the value of the commodity by the third definition. In his terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. To [[David Ricardo]] and other classical economists, this definition serves as a measure of \"real cost\", \"absolute value\", or a \"measure of value\" invariable under changes in distribution and technology.<ref>Ricardo, David (1823), 'Absolute Value and Exchange Value', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 4, Cambridge University Press, 1951 and Sraffa, Piero and Maurice Dobb (1951), 'Introduction', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1951.</ref>\n\nRicardo, other classical economists and Marx began their expositions with the assumption that value in exchange was equal to or proportional to this labor value. They thought this was a good assumption from which to explore the dynamics of development in capitalist societies. Other supporters of the labour theory of value used the word \"value\" in the second sense to represent \"exchange value\".<ref>Proudhon, Pierre J., 1851, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century'', study 6.</ref>\n\n== LTV and the labour process ==\nSince the term \"value\" is understood in the LTV as denoting something created by labour, and its \"magnitude\" as something proportional to the quantity of labour performed, it is important to explain how the labour process both preserves value and adds new value in the commodities it creates.<ref group=note>Unless otherwise noted, the description of the labor process and the role of the value of means of production in this section are drawn from chapter 7 of ''Capital'' vol1 {{harv|Marx|1867|}}.</ref>\n\nThe value of a commodity increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of labour performed on average for its production. Part of what the LTV means by \"socially necessary\" is that the value only increases in proportion to this labour as it is performed with average skill and average productivity. So though workers may labour with greater skill or more productivity than others, these more skillful and more productive workers thus produce more value through the production of greater quantities of the finished commodity. Each unit still bears the same value as all the others of the same class of commodity. By working sloppily, unskilled workers may drag down the average skill of labour, thus increasing the average labour time necessary for the production of each unit commodity. But these unskillful workers cannot hope to sell the result of their labour process at a higher price (as opposed to value) simply because they have spent more time than other workers producing the same kind of commodities.\n\nHowever, production not only involves labour, but also certain means of labour: tools, materials, power plants and so on. These means of labour\u2014also known as [[means of production]]\u2014are often the product of another labour process as well. So the labour process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process with a certain amount of value. Labour also requires other means of production that are not produced with labour and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms of means of production resulting from another labour process, LTV treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labour process. Due to the constancy of their value, these means of production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.\n\nConsider for example workers who take coffee beans, use a roaster to roast them, and then use a brewer to brew and dispense a fresh cup of coffee. In performing this labour, these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee. The worker also transfers the value of constant capital\u2014the value of the beans; some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer; and the value of the cup\u2014to the value of the final cup of coffee. Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labour previously possessed to the finished cup of coffee<ref group=note>In the case of instruments of labor, such as the roaster and the brewer (or even a ceramic cup) the value transferred to the cup of coffee is only a depreciated value calculated over the life of those instruments of labor according to some accounting convention.</ref> So the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labour\u2014this constant capital\u2014and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.\n\nOften this is expressed mathematically as: \n:::::: <math>c+L=W</math>,\n:where\n:*<math>c</math> is the constant capital of materials used in a period plus the depreciated portion of tools and plant used in the process. (A period is typically a day, week, year, or a single turnover: meaning the time required to complete one batch of coffee, for example.)\n:* <math>L</math> is the quantity of labour time (average skill and productivity) performed in producing the finished commodities during the period\n:* <math>W</math> is the value (or think \"worth\") of the product of the period (<math>w</math> comes from the German word for value: ''wert'')\n\nNote: if the product resulting from the labour process is homogeneous (all similar in quality and traits, for example, all cups of coffee) then the value of the period's product can be divided by the total number of items (use-values or <math>v_u</math>) produced to derive the unit value of each item. <math>\\begin{matrix}w_i= \\frac{W}{\\sum v_u}\\,\\end{matrix}</math> where <math>\\sum v_u</math> is the total items produced.\n\nThe LTV further divides the value added during the period of production, <math>L</math>, into two parts. The first part is the portion of the process when the workers add value equivalent to the wages they are paid. For example, if the period in question is one week and these workers collectively are paid $1,000, then the time necessary to add $1,000 to\u2014while preserving the value of\u2014constant capital is considered the necessary labor portion of the period (or week): denoted <math>NL</math>. The remaining period is considered the surplus labour portion of the week: or <math>SL</math>. The value used to purchase labour-power, for example the $1,000 paid in wages to these workers for the week, is called variable capital (<math>v</math>). This is because in contrast to the constant capital expended on means of production, variable capital can add value in the labour process. The amount it adds depends on the duration, intensity, productivity and skill of the labour-power purchased: in this sense the buyer of labour-power has purchased a commodity of variable use. Finally, the value added during the portion of the period when surplus labor is performed is called [[surplus value]] (<math>s</math>). From the variables defined above, we find two other common expressions for the value produced during a given period:\n::::<math>c+v+s=W</math>\n:::and\n::::<math>c+NL+SL=W</math>\n\nThe first form of the equation expresses the value resulting from production, focusing on the costs <math>c+v</math> and the surplus value appropriated in the process of production, <math>s</math>. The second form of the equation focuses on the value of production in terms of the values added by the labour performed during the process <math>NL+SL</math>.\n\n== Relation between values and prices ==\nOne issue facing the LTV is the relationship between value quantities on one hand and prices on the other. If a commodity's value is not the same as its price, and therefore the magnitudes of each likely differ, then what is the relation between the two, if any? Various LTV schools of thought provide different answers to this question. For example, some argue that value in the sense of the amount of labour embodied in a good acts as a center of gravity for price.\n\nHowever, most economists would say that cases where pricing is given as approximately equal to the value of the labour embodied, are in fact only special cases.  In General Theory pricing most usually fluctuates.  The standard formulation is that prices normally include a level of income for \"[[Capital (economics)|capital]]\" and \"[[Land (economics)|land]]\".  These incomes are known as \"[[Profit (economics)|profit]]\" and \"[[Economic rent|rent]]\" respectively. Yet Marx made the point that value cannot be placed upon labour as a commodity, because capital is a constant, whereas profit is a variable, not an income; thus explaining the importance of profit in relation to pricing variables.<ref name=\"Harv|Marx|1867\"/>\n\nIn Book 1, chapter VI, Adam Smith writes: <blockquote>The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.</blockquote>\n\nThe final sentence explains how Smith sees value of a product as relative to labour of buyer or consumer, as opposite to Marx who sees the value of a product being proportional to labour of labourer or producer. And we value things, price them, based on how much labor we can avoid or command, and we can command labor not only in a simple way but also by [[Trade|trading]] things for a profit.\n\nThe demonstration of the relation between commodities' unit values and their respective prices is known in Marxian terminology as the [[transformation problem]] or the transformation of values into prices of production. The transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the LTV. The problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labour, in proportion to its duration and intensity, is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on capital advanced. If there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation, then the relation between values (proportional to labour) and prices (proportional to total capital advanced) is incomplete. Various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation, but the debate has not reached any clear resolution.\n\nLTV does not deny the role of supply and demand influencing price, since the price of a commodity is something other than its value.  In ''Value, Price and Profit'' (1865), [[Karl Marx]] quotes [[Adam Smith]] and sums up:\n:It suffices to say that if supply and demand equilibrate each other, the market prices of commodities will correspond with their natural prices, that is to say, with their values as determined by the respective quantities of labor required for their production.<ref name = marxprofit>Marx, Karl (1865). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ch02.htm#c6 Value, Price and Profit.]</ref>\n\nThe LTV seeks to explain the level of this equilibrium. This could be explained by a ''[[cost of production]]'' argument\u2014pointing out that all costs are ultimately labor costs, but this does not account for profit, and it is vulnerable to the charge of [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] in that it explains prices by prices.<ref>Piero Sraffa and Maurice H. Dobb (1951). \"General Preface\", ''The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo'', Vol. 1, Cambridge University Press</ref> Marx later called this \"Smith's adding up theory of value\".\n\nSmith argues that labour values are the natural measure of exchange for direct producers like hunters and fishermen.<ref name = ormazabal>{{cite web|url = https://www.ehu.eus/documents/2276258/2294671/il2006_26.pdf |title = Adam Smith on Labor and Value: Challenging the Standard Interpretation |first = Kepa M. |last=Ormazabal |date = 2006|publisher = University of the Basque Country}} </ref> Marx, on the other hand, uses a measurement analogy, arguing that for commodities to be comparable they must have a common element or substance by which to measure them,<ref name=marxprofit/> and that labour is a common substance of what Marx eventually calls ''commodity-values''.<ref name=\"Harv|Marx|1867\">{{Harv|Marx|1867|}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nThe labour theory of value has developed over many centuries.

[[David Ricardo]] (seconded by [[Karl Marx|Marx]]) responded to this paradox by arguing that Smith had confused labour with wages. \"Labour  commanded\", he argued, would always be more than the labour needed to sustain itself (wages).

The LTV and the accompanying theory of exploitation became central to his economic thought.\n\n19th century [[American individualist anarchists]] based their economics on the LTV, with their particular interpretation of it being called \"[[Cost the limit of price]]\". They, as well as contemporary individualist anarchists in that tradition, hold that it is unethical to charge a higher price for a commodity than the amount of labour required to produce it. Hence, they propose that trade should be facilitated by using notes backed by labour.\n\n=== Adam Smith and David Ricardo ===\nAdam Smith held that, in a primitive society, the amount of labour put into producing a good determined its exchange value, with exchange value meaning in this case the amount of labour a good can purchase. However, according to Smith, in a more advanced society the market price is no longer proportional to labour cost since the value of the good now includes compensation for the owner of the means of production: \"The whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him.\"<ref>Smith quoted in Whitaker, Albert C.

[[David Ricardo]] stated it as, \"The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.\" (Ricardo 1817) In this connection Ricardo seeks to differentiate the quantity of labour necessary to produce a commodity from the wages paid to the labourers for its production. However, Ricardo was troubled with some deviations in prices from proportionality with the labour required to produce them.<ref>Fernando Vianello, (1990) \"The Labour Theory of Value\", Eatwell J., Milgate M., Newman P. (eds) in ''Marxian Economics'', The New Palgrave, pp.233-246.</ref>  For example, he said \"I cannot get over the difficulty of the wine, which is kept in the cellar for three or four years [i.e., while constantly increasing in exchange value], or that of the oak tree, which perhaps originally had not 2 s. expended on it in the way of labour, and yet comes to be worth \u00a3100.\" (Quoted in Whitaker) Of course, a capitalist economy stabilizes this discrepancy until the value added to aged wine is equal to the cost of storage. If anyone can hold onto a bottle for four years and become rich, that would make it hard to find freshly corked wine. There is also the theory that adding to the price of a [[luxury goods|luxury]] product increases its [[exchange-value]] by mere prestige.\n\nThe labour theory as an explanation for value contrasts with the [[subjective theory of value]], which says that value of a good is not determined by how much labour was put into it but by its usefulness in satisfying a want and its scarcity. Ricardo's labour theory of value is not a [[Normative economics|normative]] theory, as are some later forms of the labour theory, such as claims that it is ''immoral'' for an individual to be paid less for his labour than the total revenue that comes from the sales of all the goods he produces.\n\nIt is arguable to what extent these classical theorists held the labour theory of value as it is commonly defined.<ref>Whitaker, Albert C.

Marx used the concept of \"[[socially necessary labor time|socially necessary labour time]]\" to introduce a social perspective distinct from his predecessors and [[neoclassical economics]].  Whereas most economists start with the individual's perspective, Marx started with the perspective of society ''as a whole''. \"Social production\" involves a complicated and interconnected [[division of labor|division of labour]] of a wide variety of people who depend on each other for their survival and prosperity. [[Abstract labor and concrete labor|\"Abstract\" labour]] refers to a characteristic of [[commodity]]-producing labour that is shared by all different kinds of heterogeneous (concrete) types of labour. That is, the concept abstracts from the ''particular'' characteristics of all of the labour and is akin to average labour.\n\n\"Socially necessary\" labour refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity \"in a given state of society, under certain social average conditions or production, with a given social average intensity, and average skill of the labour employed.\"<ref name=\"marxprofit\" /> That is, the value of a product is determined more by societal standards than by individual conditions. This explains why technological breakthroughs lower the price of commodities and put less advanced producers out of business. Finally, it is not labour per se that creates value, but labor power sold by free wage workers to capitalists. Another distinction is between [[productive and unproductive labor]]. Only wage workers of productive sectors of the economy produce value.<ref group=note>For the difference between wage workers and working animals or [[slave]]s confer: John R. Bell: Capitalism and the Dialectic - The Uno-Sekine Approach to Marxian Political Economy, p. 45. London, Pluto Press 2009</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{main article|Criticisms of the labour theory of value}}\nThe Marxist labor theory of value has been criticised on several counts. Some argue that it predicts that profits will be higher in labor-intensive industries than in capital-intensive industries, which would be contradicted by measured empirical data inherent in quantitative analysis. This is sometimes referred to as the \"Great Contradiction\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">B\u00f6hm von Bawerk, \"Karl Marx and the Close of His System\" [[Karl Marx and the Close of His System]]</ref> In volume 3 of Capital, Marx explains why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most labor-intensive and why this is consistent with his theory. Whether or not this is consistent with the labor theory of value as presented in volume 1 has been a topic of debate.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Marx, [[surplus value]] is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital, not just the variable component. In the example given earlier, of making a cup of coffee, the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves, and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker. The value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities, and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan. The amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker. We can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital. Capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large contribution of capital, while labor-intensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one.<ref>Ekelund, Jr., Robert B. and Robert F. Hebert (1997, 4th ed), ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'', pp. 239\u2013241</ref> Critics argue that this turns the LTV into a macroeconomic theory, when it was supposed to explain the exchange ratios of individual commodities (making it a microeconomic theory), yet Marx was now maintaining that these ratios must diverge from their labour ratios. Critics thus held that Marx's proposed solution to the \"great contradiction\" was not so much a solution as it was sidestepping the issue.<ref>Temkin, Gabriel. \"Karl Marx and the economics of communism: anniversary recollections.\" Communist and Post-Communist Studies 31, no. 4 (1998): 303-328, pp.321-322</ref> \n\nSteve Keen argues that Marx's idea that only labor can produce value rests on the idea that as capital depreciates over its use, then this is transferring its exchange-value to the product. Keen argues that it is not clear why the value of the machine should depreciate at the same rate it is lost. Keen uses an analogy with labor: If workers receive a subsistence wage and the working day exhausts the capacity to labor, it could be argued that the worker has \"depreciated\" by the amount equivalent to the subsistence wage. However this depreciation is not the limit of value a worker can add in a day (indeed this is critical to Marx's idea that labor is fundamentally exploited). If it were, then the production of a surplus would be impossible. According to Keen, a machine could have a use-value greater than its exchange-value, meaning it could, along with labor, be a source of surplus. Keen claims that Marx almost reached such a conclusion in the [[Grundrisse]] but never developed it any further. Keen further observes that while Marx insisted that the contribution of machines to production is solely their use-value and not their exchange-value, he routinely treated the use-value and exchange-value of a machine as identical, despite the fact that this would contradict his claim that the two were unrelated.<ref>Steve Keen, [https://keenomics.s3.amazonaws.com/debtdeflation_media/papers/Jhet_use.PDF  \"Use-Value, Exchange Value, and the Demise of Marx's Labor Theory of Value\"], Journal of the History of Economic Thought, Volume 15, Issue 1, Spring 1993, pages 107-121</ref> Marxists respond by arguing that use-value and exchange-value are incommensurable magnitudes; to claim that a machine can add \"more use-value\" than it is worth in value-terms is a [[category error]]. According to Marx, a machine by definition cannot be a source of ''human'' labor.<ref> Marx, Karl. *Capital*, Vol. I, p. 141, Penguin edition</ref><ref>D'Arcy, Jim, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/darcy-jim/1974/socecon4machines.htm Socialist Economics 4: Do Machines Produce Surplus Value?], ''Socialist Standard'', 1974</ref> Keen responds by arguing that the labor theory of value only works if the use-value and exchange-value of a machine are identical, as Marx argued that machines cannot create surplus value since as their use-value depreciates along with their exchange-value - they simply transfer it to the new product but create no new value in the process.<ref>Keen, Steve. Debunking economics. ZED Books Limited, 2011, pp.436-438</ref> Keen's machinery argument can also be applied to [[slavery]] based modes of production, which also profit from extracting more use value from the laborers than they return to laborers.<ref>Kara, Siddharth (2008).

According to the authors, these studies attempt to prove the LTV by showing that there is a positive correlation between market prices and labor values. However, the authors argue that these studies measure prices by looking at the price of total output (the unit price of a commodity multiplied by its total quantity) and do these for several sectors of the economy, estimate their total price and value from official statistics and measured for several years. However, Bichler and Nitzan argue that this method has statistical implications as correlations measured this way also reflect the co-variations of the associated quantities of unit values and prices. This means that the unit price and unit value of each sector are multiplied by the same value, which means that the greater the variability out output across different sectors, the tighter the correlation. This means that the overall correlation substantially larger than the underlying correlation between unit values and unit prices; when sectors are controlled for their size, the correlations often drop to insignificant levels.<ref>Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan.

The authors argue that, according to Marx, the value of a commodity indicates the abstract labor time required for its production; however Marxists have been unable to identify a way to measure a unit (elementary particle) of abstract labor (indeed the authors argue that most have given up and little progress has been made beyond Marx's original work) due to numerous difficulties. This means assumptions must be made and according to the authors, these involve circular reasoning:<ref>Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan.

In other words, the researcher assumes precisely what the labour theory of value is supposed to ''demonstrate''.<ref>Nitzan, Jonathan, and Shimshon Bichler.

[[Joan Robinson]], who herself was considered an expert on the writings of Karl Marx,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} wrote that the labor theory of value was largely a tautology and \"a typical example of the way metaphysical ideas operate\".<ref>Joan Robinson, \"Economic Philosophy\" p39</ref>. The well-known Marxian economist [[Roman Rosdolsky]] replied to Robinson's claims at length,<ref> Rosdolsky, Roman. ''The Making of Marx's Capital'', Ch. 33</ref> arguing that Robinson failed to understand key components of Marx's theory; for instance, Robinson argued that \"Marx's theory, as we have seen, rests on the assumption of a constant rate of exploitation\",<ref> Robinson, Joan ''Essay on Marxian Economics'', p. 38</ref> but as Rosdolsky points out, there is a great deal of contrary evidence.<ref> Marx, Karl. ''Capital'', Vol. 3, Ch. 14. Here Marx directly contradicts Robinson's claim by addressing, at length, \"The Increasing Intensity of Exploitation\"</ref>\n\nOthers have argued that the labor theory of value, especially as it arises in the work of Karl Marx, is due to a failure to recognize the fundamentally dialectical nature of how human beings attribute value to objects. Pilkington writes that value is attributed to objects based on our desire for them and that this desire is always inter-subjective and socially determined; Marxists would reply that this argument fails since Marx says the opposite, and the logic of his theory would not require him to deny this anyway.<ref> Campbell, Martha (1991) ''Social Relations of Production: The Method and Critical Implications of Marx's \"Capital'', Ch. 5 </ref> Pilkington writes the following: <blockquote>[V]alue is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in turn, is inter-subjective. We desire to gain [a] medal or to capture [an] enemy flag [in battle] because it will win recognition in the eyes of our peers. [A] medal [or an enemy] flag are not valued for their objective properties, nor are they valued for the amount of labour embodied in them, rather they are desired for the symbolic positions they occupy in the inter-subjective network of desires.</blockquote>\n\nPilkington insists that this is an entirely different conception of value than the one we find in the marginalist theory found in many economics textbooks, although Pilkington's theory, like that of the marginalists, concentrates solely on consumer preferences. He writes that \"actors in marginalist analysis have self-contained preferences; they do not have inter-subjective desires\".<ref>Philip Pilkington.

Both [[David Ricardo#Value theory|David Ricardo]]<ref>It is now interpreted that Ricardo's theory of value is not the labor theory of value, but the cost of production theory of value. See [[David Ricardo#Value theory]]</ref> and [[Karl Marx]] tried to quantify and embody all labour components in order to develop a theory of the real price, or natural price of a commodity.<ref>e.g. see - Junankar, P. N., ''Marx's economics'', Oxford : Philip Allan, 1982, {{ISBN|0-86003-125-X}} or Peach, Terry \"Interpreting Ricardo\", Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-26086-8}}</ref> The labour theory of value as presented by [[Adam Smith]] did not require the quantification of past labour, nor did it deal with the labour needed to create the tools (capital) that might be used in producing a commodity. Smith's theory of value was very similar to the later utility theories in that Smith proclaimed that a commodity was worth whatever labour it would command in others (value in trade) or whatever labour it would \"save\" the self (value in use), or both. However, this \"value\" is subject to supply and demand at a particular time: <blockquote>The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V)</blockquote>\n\nSmith's theory of price (which for many is the same as value) has nothing to do with the past labour spent in producing a commodity.  It speaks only of the labour that can be \"commanded\" or \"saved\" at present.  If there is no use for a buggy whip, then the item is economically worthless in trade or in use, regardless of all the labour spent in creating it.\n\n=== Distinctions of economically pertinent labour ===\nValue \"in use\" is the [[usefulness]] of this commodity, its [[utility]]. A classical [[Paradox of value|paradox]] often comes up when considering this type of value. In the words of Adam Smith: <blockquote>The word value, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called \"value in use\"; the other, \"value in exchange.\" The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter IV).</blockquote>\n\nValue \"in [[Trade|exchange]]\" is the relative proportion with which this commodity exchanges for another commodity (in other words, its [[price]] in the case of [[money]]). It is relative to labour as explained by Adam Smith: <blockquote>The value of any commodity, [...] to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V).</blockquote>\n\nValue (without qualification) is the labour embodied in a commodity under a given structure of production. Marx defined the value of the commodity by the third definition. In his terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. To [[David Ricardo]] and other classical economists, this definition serves as a measure of \"real cost\", \"absolute value\", or a \"measure of value\" invariable under changes in distribution and technology.<ref>Ricardo, David (1823), 'Absolute Value and Exchange Value', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 4, Cambridge University Press, 1951 and Sraffa, Piero and Maurice Dobb (1951), 'Introduction', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1951.</ref>\n\nRicardo, other classical economists and Marx began their expositions with the assumption that value in exchange was equal to or proportional to this labor value. They thought this was a good assumption from which to explore the dynamics of development in capitalist societies. Other supporters of the labour theory of value used the word \"value\" in the second sense to represent \"exchange value\".<ref>Proudhon, Pierre J., 1851, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century'', study 6.</ref>\n\n== LTV and the labour process ==\nSince the term \"value\" is understood in the LTV as denoting something created by labour, and its \"magnitude\" as something proportional to the quantity of labour performed, it is important to explain how the labour process both preserves value and adds new value in the commodities it creates.<ref group=note>Unless otherwise noted, the description of the labor process and the role of the value of means of production in this section are drawn from chapter 7 of ''Capital'' vol1 {{harv|Marx|1867|}}.</ref>\n\nThe value of a commodity increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of labour performed on average for its production. Part of what the LTV means by \"socially necessary\" is that the value only increases in proportion to this labour as it is performed with average skill and average productivity. So though workers may labour with greater skill or more productivity than others, these more skillful and more productive workers thus produce more value through the production of greater quantities of the finished commodity. Each unit still bears the same value as all the others of the same class of commodity. By working sloppily, unskilled workers may drag down the average skill of labour, thus increasing the average labour time necessary for the production of each unit commodity. But these unskillful workers cannot hope to sell the result of their labour process at a higher price (as opposed to value) simply because they have spent more time than other workers producing the same kind of commodities.\n\nHowever, production not only involves labour, but also certain means of labour: tools, materials, power plants and so on. These means of labour\u2014also known as [[means of production]]\u2014are often the product of another labour process as well. So the labour process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process with a certain amount of value. Labour also requires other means of production that are not produced with labour and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms of means of production resulting from another labour process, LTV treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labour process. Due to the constancy of their value, these means of production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.\n\nConsider for example workers who take coffee beans, use a roaster to roast them, and then use a brewer to brew and dispense a fresh cup of coffee. In performing this labour, these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee. The worker also transfers the value of constant capital\u2014the value of the beans; some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer; and the value of the cup\u2014to the value of the final cup of coffee. Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labour previously possessed to the finished cup of coffee<ref group=note>In the case of instruments of labor, such as the roaster and the brewer (or even a ceramic cup) the value transferred to the cup of coffee is only a depreciated value calculated over the life of those instruments of labor according to some accounting convention.</ref> So the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labour\u2014this constant capital\u2014and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.\n\nOften this is expressed mathematically as: \n:::::: <math>c+L=W</math>,\n:where\n:*<math>c</math> is the constant capital of materials used in a period plus the depreciated portion of tools and plant used in the process. (A period is typically a day, week, year, or a single turnover: meaning the time required to complete one batch of coffee, for example.)\n:* <math>L</math> is the quantity of labour time (average skill and productivity) performed in producing the finished commodities during the period\n:* <math>W</math> is the value (or think \"worth\") of the product of the period (<math>w</math> comes from the German word for value: ''wert'')\n\nNote: if the product resulting from the labour process is homogeneous (all similar in quality and traits, for example, all cups of coffee) then the value of the period's product can be divided by the total number of items (use-values or <math>v_u</math>) produced to derive the unit value of each item. <math>\\begin{matrix}w_i= \\frac{W}{\\sum v_u}\\,\\end{matrix}</math> where <math>\\sum v_u</math> is the total items produced.\n\nThe LTV further divides the value added during the period of production, <math>L</math>, into two parts. The first part is the portion of the process when the workers add value equivalent to the wages they are paid. For example, if the period in question is one week and these workers collectively are paid $1,000, then the time necessary to add $1,000 to\u2014while preserving the value of\u2014constant capital is considered the necessary labor portion of the period (or week): denoted <math>NL</math>. The remaining period is considered the surplus labour portion of the week: or <math>SL</math>. The value used to purchase labour-power, for example the $1,000 paid in wages to these workers for the week, is called variable capital (<math>v</math>). This is because in contrast to the constant capital expended on means of production, variable capital can add value in the labour process. The amount it adds depends on the duration, intensity, productivity and skill of the labour-power purchased: in this sense the buyer of labour-power has purchased a commodity of variable use. Finally, the value added during the portion of the period when surplus labor is performed is called [[surplus value]] (<math>s</math>). From the variables defined above, we find two other common expressions for the value produced during a given period:\n::::<math>c+v+s=W</math>\n:::and\n::::<math>c+NL+SL=W</math>\n\nThe first form of the equation expresses the value resulting from production, focusing on the costs <math>c+v</math> and the surplus value appropriated in the process of production, <math>s</math>. The second form of the equation focuses on the value of production in terms of the values added by the labour performed during the process <math>NL+SL</math>.\n\n== Relation between values and prices ==\nOne issue facing the LTV is the relationship between value quantities on one hand and prices on the other. If a commodity's value is not the same as its price, and therefore the magnitudes of each likely differ, then what is the relation between the two, if any? Various LTV schools of thought provide different answers to this question. For example, some argue that value in the sense of the amount of labour embodied in a good acts as a center of gravity for price.\n\nHowever, most economists would say that cases where pricing is given as approximately equal to the value of the labour embodied, are in fact only special cases.  In General Theory pricing most usually fluctuates.  The standard formulation is that prices normally include a level of income for \"[[Capital (economics)|capital]]\" and \"[[Land (economics)|land]]\".  These incomes are known as \"[[Profit (economics)|profit]]\" and \"[[Economic rent|rent]]\" respectively. Yet Marx made the point that value cannot be placed upon labour as a commodity, because capital is a constant, whereas profit is a variable, not an income; thus explaining the importance of profit in relation to pricing variables.<ref name=\"Harv|Marx|1867\"/>\n\nIn Book 1, chapter VI, Adam Smith writes: <blockquote>The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.</blockquote>\n\nThe final sentence explains how Smith sees value of a product as relative to labour of buyer or consumer, as opposite to Marx who sees the value of a product being proportional to labour of labourer or producer. And we value things, price them, based on how much labor we can avoid or command, and we can command labor not only in a simple way but also by [[Trade|trading]] things for a profit.\n\nThe demonstration of the relation between commodities' unit values and their respective prices is known in Marxian terminology as the [[transformation problem]] or the transformation of values into prices of production. The transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the LTV. The problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labour, in proportion to its duration and intensity, is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on capital advanced. If there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation, then the relation between values (proportional to labour) and prices (proportional to total capital advanced) is incomplete. Various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation, but the debate has not reached any clear resolution.\n\nLTV does not deny the role of supply and demand influencing price, since the price of a commodity is something other than its value.  In ''Value, Price and Profit'' (1865), [[Karl Marx]] quotes [[Adam Smith]] and sums up:\n:It suffices to say that if supply and demand equilibrate each other, the market prices of commodities will correspond with their natural prices, that is to say, with their values as determined by the respective quantities of labor required for their production.<ref name = marxprofit>Marx, Karl (1865). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ch02.htm#c6 Value, Price and Profit.]</ref>\n\nThe LTV seeks to explain the level of this equilibrium. This could be explained by a ''[[cost of production]]'' argument\u2014pointing out that all costs are ultimately labor costs, but this does not account for profit, and it is vulnerable to the charge of [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] in that it explains prices by prices.<ref>Piero Sraffa and Maurice H. Dobb (1951). \"General Preface\", ''The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo'', Vol. 1, Cambridge University Press</ref> Marx later called this \"Smith's adding up theory of value\".\n\nSmith argues that labour values are the natural measure of exchange for direct producers like hunters and fishermen.<ref name = ormazabal>{{cite web|url = https://www.ehu.eus/documents/2276258/2294671/il2006_26.pdf |title = Adam Smith on Labor and Value: Challenging the Standard Interpretation |first = Kepa M. |last=Ormazabal |date = 2006|publisher = University of the Basque Country}} </ref> Marx, on the other hand, uses a measurement analogy, arguing that for commodities to be comparable they must have a common element or substance by which to measure them,<ref name=marxprofit/> and that labour is a common substance of what Marx eventually calls ''commodity-values''.<ref name=\"Harv|Marx|1867\">{{Harv|Marx|1867|}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nThe labour theory of value has developed over many centuries.

He pointed out that if the \"labour embodied\" in a product equaled the \"labour commanded\" (i.e. the amount of labour that could be purchased by selling it), then profit was impossible. [[David Ricardo]] (seconded by [[Karl Marx|Marx]]) responded to this paradox by arguing that Smith had confused labour with wages. \"Labour  commanded\", he argued, would always be more than the labour needed to sustain itself (wages). The value of labour, in this view, covered not just the value of wages (what Marx called the value of [[labor power]]), but the value of the entire product created by labour.<ref name = ormazabal/>\n\nRicardo's theory was a predecessor of the modern theory that equilibrium prices are determined solely by [[Cost-of-production theory of value|production costs]] associated with [[Neo-Ricardianism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neoric.htm |title=The Neo-Ricardians |accessdate=2004-08-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418155154/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/neoric.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2009 }}, [[New School University]]</ref>\n\nBased on the discrepancy between the wages of labour and the value of the product, the \"[[Ricardian socialists]]\"\u2014[[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]], [[Thomas Hodgskin]], [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]], and [[John Francis Bray]], and [[Percy Ravenstone]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |title=Utopians and Socialists: Ricardian Socialists |accessdate=2015-07-12 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040214153800/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=February 14, 2004 }}, History of Economic Thought, [[New School University]]</ref>\u2014applied Ricardo's theory to develop theories of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].\n\nMarx expanded on these ideas, arguing that workers work for a part of each day adding the value required to cover their wages, while the remainder of their labour is performed for the enrichment of the capitalist. The LTV and the accompanying theory of exploitation became central to his economic thought.\n\n19th century [[American individualist anarchists]] based their economics on the LTV, with their particular interpretation of it being called \"[[Cost the limit of price]]\". They, as well as contemporary individualist anarchists in that tradition, hold that it is unethical to charge a higher price for a commodity than the amount of labour required to produce it. Hence, they propose that trade should be facilitated by using notes backed by labour.\n\n=== Adam Smith and David Ricardo ===\nAdam Smith held that, in a primitive society, the amount of labor put into producing a good determined its exchange value, with exchange value meaning in this case the amount of labor a good can purchase. However, according to Smith, in a more advanced society the market price is no longer proportional to labor cost since the value of the good now includes compensation for the owner of the means of production: \"The whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer.

[[David Ricardo]] stated it as, \"The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.\" (Ricardo 1817) In this connection Ricardo seeks to differentiate the quantity of labour necessary to produce a commodity from the wages paid to the laborers for its production. However, Ricardo was troubled with some deviations in prices from proportionality with the labor required to produce them.<ref>Fernando Vianello, (1990) \"The Labour Theory of Value\", Eatwell J., Milgate M., Newman P. (eds) in ''Marxian Economics'', The New Palgrave, pp.233-246.</ref>  For example, he said \"I cannot get over the difficulty of the wine, which is kept in the cellar for three or four years [i.e., while constantly increasing in exchange value], or that of the oak tree, which perhaps originally had not 2 s. expended on it in the way of labour, and yet comes to be worth \u00a3100.\" (Quoted in Whitaker) Of course, a capitalist economy stabilizes this discrepancy until the value added to aged wine is equal to the cost of storage. If anyone can hold onto a bottle for four years and become rich, that would make it hard to find freshly corked wine. There is also the theory that adding to the price of a [[luxury goods|luxury]] product increases its [[exchange-value]] by mere prestige.\n\nThe labor theory as an explanation for value contrasts with the [[subjective theory of value]], which says that value of a good is not determined by how much labor was put into it but by its usefulness in satisfying a want and its scarcity. Ricardo's labor theory of value is not a [[Normative economics|normative]] theory, as are some later forms of the labor theory, such as claims that it is ''immoral'' for an individual to be paid less for his labor than the total revenue that comes from the sales of all the goods he produces.\n\nIt is arguable to what extent these classical theorists held the labor theory of value as it is commonly defined.<ref>Whitaker, Albert C.

Marx used the concept of \"[[socially necessary labor time]]\" to introduce a social perspective distinct from his predecessors and [[neoclassical economics]].  Whereas most economists start with the individual's perspective, Marx started with the perspective of society ''as a whole''. \"Social production\" involves a complicated and interconnected [[division of labor]] of a wide variety of people who depend on each other for their survival and prosperity. [[Abstract labor and concrete labor|\"Abstract\" labor]] refers to a characteristic of [[commodity]]-producing labor that is shared by all different kinds of heterogeneous (concrete) types of labor. That is, the concept abstracts from the ''particular'' characteristics of all of the labor and is akin to average labor.\n\n\"Socially necessary\" labor refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity \"in a given state of society, under certain social average conditions or production, with a given social average intensity, and average skill of the labor employed.\"<ref name=\"marxprofit\" /> That is, the value of a product is determined more by societal standards than by individual conditions. This explains why technological breakthroughs lower the price of commodities and put less advanced producers out of business. Finally, it is not labor per se that creates value, but labor power sold by free wage workers to capitalists. Another distinction is between [[productive and unproductive labor]]. Only wage workers of productive sectors of the economy produce value.<ref group=note>For the difference between wage workers and working animals or [[slave]]s confer: John R. Bell: Capitalism and the Dialectic - The Uno-Sekine Approach to Marxian Political Economy, p. 45. London, Pluto Press 2009</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{main article|Criticisms of the labour theory of value}}\nThe Marxist labor theory of value has been criticised on several counts. Some argue that it predicts that profits will be higher in labor-intensive industries than in capital-intensive industries, which would be contradicted by measured empirical data inherent in quantitative analysis. This is sometimes referred to as the \"Great Contradiction\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">B\u00f6hm von Bawerk, \"Karl Marx and the Close of His System\" [[Karl Marx and the Close of His System]]</ref> In volume 3 of Capital, Marx explains why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most labor-intensive and why this is consistent with his theory. Whether or not this is consistent with the labor theory of value as presented in volume 1 has been a topic of debate.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Marx, [[surplus value]] is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital, not just the variable component. In the example given earlier, of making a cup of coffee, the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves, and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker. The value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities, and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan. The amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker. We can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital. Capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large contribution of capital, while labor-intensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one.<ref>Ekelund, Jr., Robert B. and Robert F. Hebert (1997, 4th ed), ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'', pp. 239\u2013241</ref> Critics argue that this turns the LTV into a macroeconomic theory, when it was supposed to explain the exchange ratios of individual commodities (making it a microeconomic theory), yet Marx was now maintaining that these ratios must diverge from their labour ratios. Critics thus held that Marx's proposed solution to the \"great contradiction\" was not so much a solution as it was sidestepping the issue.<ref>Temkin, Gabriel. \"Karl Marx and the economics of communism: anniversary recollections.\" Communist and Post-Communist Studies 31, no. 4 (1998): 303-328, pp.321-322</ref> \n\nSteve Keen argues that Marx's idea that only labor can produce value rests on the idea that as capital depreciates over its use, then this is transferring its exchange-value to the product. Keen argues that it is not clear why the value of the machine should depreciate at the same rate it is lost. Keen uses an analogy with labor: If workers receive a subsistence wage and the working day exhausts the capacity to labor, it could be argued that the worker has \"depreciated\" by the amount equivalent to the subsistence wage. However this depreciation is not the limit of value a worker can add in a day (indeed this is critical to Marx's idea that labor is fundamentally exploited). If it were, then the production of a surplus would be impossible. According to Keen, a machine could have a use-value greater than its exchange-value, meaning it could, along with labor, be a source of surplus. Keen claims that Marx almost reached such a conclusion in the [[Grundrisse]] but never developed it any further. Keen further observes that while Marx insisted that the contribution of machines to production is solely their use-value and not their exchange-value, he routinely treated the use-value and exchange-value of a machine as identical, despite the fact that this would contradict his claim that the two were unrelated.<ref>Steve Keen, [https://keenomics.s3.amazonaws.com/debtdeflation_media/papers/Jhet_use.PDF  \"Use-Value, Exchange Value, and the Demise of Marx's Labor Theory of Value\"], Journal of the History of Economic Thought, Volume 15, Issue 1, Spring 1993, pages 107-121</ref> Marxists respond by arguing that use-value and exchange-value are incommensurable magnitudes; to claim that a machine can add \"more use-value\" than it is worth in value-terms is a [[category error]]. According to Marx, a machine by definition cannot be a source of ''human'' labor.<ref> Marx, Karl. *Capital*, Vol. I, p. 141, Penguin edition</ref><ref>D'Arcy, Jim, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/darcy-jim/1974/socecon4machines.htm Socialist Economics 4: Do Machines Produce Surplus Value?], ''Socialist Standard'', 1974</ref> Keen responds by arguing that the labor theory of value only works if the use-value and exchange-value of a machine are identical, as Marx argued that machines cannot create surplus value since as their use-value depreciates along with their exchange-value - they simply transfer it to the new product but create no new value in the process.<ref>Keen, Steve.

According to the authors, these studies attempt to prove the LTV by showing that there is a positive correlation between market prices and labor values. However, the authors argue that these studies measure prices by looking at the price of total output (the unit price of a commodity multiplied by its total quantity) and do these for several sectors of the economy, estimate their total price and value from official statistics and measured for several years. However, Bichler and Nitzan argue that this method has statistical implications as correlations measured this way also reflect the co-variations of the associated quantities of unit values and prices. This means that the unit price and unit value of each sector are multiplied by the same value, which means that the greater the variability out output across different sectors, the tighter the correlation. This means that the overall correlation substantially larger than the underlying correlation between unit values and unit prices; when sectors are controlled for their size, the correlations often drop to insignificant levels.<ref>Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan.

The well-known Marxian economist [[Roman Rosdolsky]] replied to Robinson's claims at length,<ref> Rosdolsky, Roman. ''The Making of Marx's Capital'', Ch. 33</ref> arguing that Robinson failed to understand key components of Marx's theory; for instance, Robinson argued that \"Marx's theory, as we have seen, rests on the assumption of a constant rate of exploitation\",<ref> Robinson, Joan ''Essay on Marxian Economics'', p. 38</ref> but as Rosdolsky points out, there is a great deal of contrary evidence.<ref> Marx, Karl. ''Capital'', Vol. 3, Ch. 14. Here Marx directly contradicts Robinson's claim by addressing, at length, \"The Increasing Intensity of Exploitation\"</ref>\n\nOthers have argued that the labor theory of value, especially as it arises in the work of Karl Marx, is due to a failure to recognize the fundamentally dialectical nature of how human beings attribute value to objects. Pilkington writes that value is attributed to objects based on our desire for them and that this desire is always inter-subjective and socially determined; Marxists would reply that this argument fails since Marx says the opposite, and the logic of his theory would not require him to deny this anyway.<ref> Campbell, Martha (1991) ''Social Relations of Production: The Method and Critical Implications of Marx's \"Capital'', Ch. 5 </ref> Pilkington writes the following: <blockquote>[V]alue is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in turn, is inter-subjective. We desire to gain [a] medal or to capture [an] enemy flag [in battle] because it will win recognition in the eyes of our peers.

Smith saw the price of a commodity in terms of the labour that the purchaser must expend to buy it, which embodies the concept of how much labour a commodity, a tool for example, can save the purchaser. The LTV is central to Marxist theory, which holds that the working class is exploited under capitalism, and dissociates price and value.

Both [[David Ricardo#Value theory|David Ricardo]]<ref>It is now interpreted that Ricardo's theory of value is not the labor theory of value, but the cost of production theory of value. See [[David Ricardo#Value theory]]</ref> and [[Karl Marx]] tried to quantify and embody all labour components in order to develop a theory of the real price, or natural price of a commodity.<ref>e.g. see - Junankar, P. N., ''Marx's economics'', Oxford : Philip Allan, 1982, {{ISBN|0-86003-125-X}} or Peach, Terry \"Interpreting Ricardo\", Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-26086-8}}</ref> The labour theory of value as presented by [[Adam Smith]] did not require the quantification of past labour, nor did it deal with the labour needed to create the tools (capital) that might be used in producing a commodity. Smith's theory of value was very similar to the later utility theories in that Smith proclaimed that a commodity was worth whatever labour it would command in others (value in trade) or whatever labour it would \"save\" the self (value in use), or both. However, this \"value\" is subject to supply and demand at a particular time: <blockquote>The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V)</blockquote>\n\nSmith's theory of price (which for many is the same as value) has nothing to do with the past labour spent in producing a commodity.  It speaks only of the labour that can be \"commanded\" or \"saved\" at present.  If there is no use for a buggy whip, then the item is economically worthless in trade or in use, regardless of all the labour spent in creating it.\n\n=== Distinctions of economically pertinent labour ===\nValue \"in use\" is the [[usefulness]] of this commodity, its [[utility]]. A classical [[Paradox of value|paradox]] often comes up when considering this type of value. In the words of Adam Smith: <blockquote>The word value, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called \"value in use\"; the other, \"value in exchange.\" The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter IV).</blockquote>\n\nValue \"in [[Trade|exchange]]\" is the relative proportion with which this commodity exchanges for another commodity (in other words, its [[price]] in the case of [[money]]). It is relative to labour as explained by Adam Smith: <blockquote>The value of any commodity, [...] to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V).</blockquote>\n\nValue (without qualification) is the labour embodied in a commodity under a given structure of production. Marx defined the value of the commodity by the third definition. In his terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. To [[David Ricardo]] and other classical economists, this definition serves as a measure of \"real cost\", \"absolute value\", or a \"measure of value\" invariable under changes in distribution and technology.<ref>Ricardo, David (1823), 'Absolute Value and Exchange Value', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 4, Cambridge University Press, 1951 and Sraffa, Piero and Maurice Dobb (1951), 'Introduction', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1951.</ref>\n\nRicardo, other classical economists and Marx began their expositions with the assumption that value in exchange was equal to or proportional to this labor value. They thought this was a good assumption from which to explore the dynamics of development in capitalist societies. Other supporters of the labour theory of value used the word \"value\" in the second sense to represent \"exchange value\".<ref>Proudhon, Pierre J., 1851, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century'', study 6.</ref>\n\n== LTV and the labour process ==\nSince the term \"value\" is understood in the LTV as denoting something created by labour, and its \"magnitude\" as something proportional to the quantity of labour performed, it is important to explain how the labour process both preserves value and adds new value in the commodities it creates.<ref group=note>Unless otherwise noted, the description of the labor process and the role of the value of means of production in this section are drawn from chapter 7 of ''Capital'' vol1 {{harv|Marx|1867|}}.</ref>\n\nThe value of a commodity increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of labour performed on average for its production. Part of what the LTV means by \"socially necessary\" is that the value only increases in proportion to this labour as it is performed with average skill and average productivity. So though workers may labour with greater skill or more productivity than others, these more skillful and more productive workers thus produce more value through the production of greater quantities of the finished commodity. Each unit still bears the same value as all the others of the same class of commodity. By working sloppily, unskilled workers may drag down the average skill of labour, thus increasing the average labour time necessary for the production of each unit commodity. But these unskillful workers cannot hope to sell the result of their labour process at a higher price (as opposed to value) simply because they have spent more time than other workers producing the same kind of commodities.\n\nHowever, production not only involves labour, but also certain means of labour: tools, materials, power plants and so on. These means of labour\u2014also known as [[means of production]]\u2014are often the product of another labour process as well. So the labour process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process with a certain amount of value. Labour also requires other means of production that are not produced with labour and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms of means of production resulting from another labour process, LTV treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labour process. Due to the constancy of their value, these means of production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.\n\nConsider for example workers who take coffee beans, use a roaster to roast them, and then use a brewer to brew and dispense a fresh cup of coffee. In performing this labour, these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee. The worker also transfers the value of constant capital\u2014the value of the beans; some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer; and the value of the cup\u2014to the value of the final cup of coffee. Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labour previously possessed to the finished cup of coffee<ref group=note>In the case of instruments of labor, such as the roaster and the brewer (or even a ceramic cup) the value transferred to the cup of coffee is only a depreciated value calculated over the life of those instruments of labor according to some accounting convention.</ref> So the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labour\u2014this constant capital\u2014and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.\n\nOften this is expressed mathematically as: \n:::::: <math>c+L=W</math>,\n:where\n:*<math>c</math> is the constant capital of materials used in a period plus the depreciated portion of tools and plant used in the process. (A period is typically a day, week, year, or a single turnover: meaning the time required to complete one batch of coffee, for example.)\n:* <math>L</math> is the quantity of labour time (average skill and productivity) performed in producing the finished commodities during the period\n:* <math>W</math> is the value (or think \"worth\") of the product of the period (<math>w</math> comes from the German word for value: ''wert'')\n\nNote: if the product resulting from the labour process is homogeneous (all similar in quality and traits, for example, all cups of coffee) then the value of the period's product can be divided by the total number of items (use-values or <math>v_u</math>) produced to derive the unit value of each item. <math>\\begin{matrix}w_i= \\frac{W}{\\sum v_u}\\,\\end{matrix}</math> where <math>\\sum v_u</math> is the total items produced.\n\nThe LTV further divides the value added during the period of production, <math>L</math>, into two parts. The first part is the portion of the process when the workers add value equivalent to the wages they are paid. For example, if the period in question is one week and these workers collectively are paid $1,000, then the time necessary to add $1,000 to\u2014while preserving the value of\u2014constant capital is considered the necessary labor portion of the period (or week): denoted <math>NL</math>. The remaining period is considered the surplus labour portion of the week: or <math>SL</math>. The value used to purchase labour-power, for example the $1,000 paid in wages to these workers for the week, is called variable capital (<math>v</math>). This is because in contrast to the constant capital expended on means of production, variable capital can add value in the labour process. The amount it adds depends on the duration, intensity, productivity and skill of the labour-power purchased: in this sense the buyer of labour-power has purchased a commodity of variable use. Finally, the value added during the portion of the period when surplus labor is performed is called [[surplus value]] (<math>s</math>). From the variables defined above, we find two other common expressions for the value produced during a given period:\n::::<math>c+v+s=W</math>\n:::and\n::::<math>c+NL+SL=W</math>\n\nThe first form of the equation expresses the value resulting from production, focusing on the costs <math>c+v</math> and the surplus value appropriated in the process of production, <math>s</math>. The second form of the equation focuses on the value of production in terms of the values added by the labour performed during the process <math>NL+SL</math>.\n\n== Relation between values and prices ==\nOne issue facing the LTV is the relationship between value quantities on one hand and prices on the other. If a commodity's value is not the same as its price, and therefore the magnitudes of each likely differ, then what is the relation between the two, if any? Various LTV schools of thought provide different answers to this question. For example, some argue that value in the sense of the amount of labour embodied in a good acts as a center of gravity for price.\n\nHowever, most economists would say that cases where pricing is given as approximately equal to the value of the labour embodied, are in fact only special cases.  In General Theory pricing most usually fluctuates.  The standard formulation is that prices normally include a level of income for \"[[Capital (economics)|capital]]\" and \"[[Land (economics)|land]]\".  These incomes are known as \"[[Profit (economics)|profit]]\" and \"[[Economic rent|rent]]\" respectively. Yet Marx made the point that value cannot be placed upon labour as a commodity, because capital is a constant, whereas profit is a variable, not an income; thus explaining the importance of profit in relation to pricing variables.<ref name=\"Harv|Marx|1867\"/>\n\nIn Book 1, chapter VI, Adam Smith writes: <blockquote>The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.</blockquote>\n\nThe final sentence explains how Smith sees value of a product as relative to labour of buyer or consumer, as opposite to Marx who sees the value of a product being proportional to labour of labourer or producer. And we value things, price them, based on how much labor we can avoid or command, and we can command labor not only in a simple way but also by [[Trade|trading]] things for a profit.\n\nThe demonstration of the relation between commodities' unit values and their respective prices is known in Marxian terminology as the [[transformation problem]] or the transformation of values into prices of production. The transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the LTV. The problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labour, in proportion to its duration and intensity, is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on capital advanced. If there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation, then the relation between values (proportional to labour) and prices (proportional to total capital advanced) is incomplete. Various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation, but the debate has not reached any clear resolution.\n\nLTV does not deny the role of supply and demand influencing price, since the price of a commodity is something other than its value.  In ''Value, Price and Profit'' (1865), [[Karl Marx]] quotes [[Adam Smith]] and sums up:\n:It suffices to say that if supply and demand equilibrate each other, the market prices of commodities will correspond with their natural prices, that is to say, with their values as determined by the respective quantities of labor required for their production.<ref name = marxprofit>Marx, Karl (1865). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ch02.htm#c6 Value, Price and Profit.]</ref>\n\nThe LTV seeks to explain the level of this equilibrium. This could be explained by a ''[[cost of production]]'' argument\u2014pointing out that all costs are ultimately labor costs, but this does not account for profit, and it is vulnerable to the charge of [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] in that it explains prices by prices.<ref>Piero Sraffa and Maurice H.

The LTV and the accompanying theory of exploitation became central to his economic thought.\n\n19th century [[American individualist anarchists]] based their economics on the LTV, with their particular interpretation of it being called \"[[Cost the limit of price]]\". They, as well as contemporary individualist anarchists in that tradition, hold that it is unethical to charge a higher price for a commodity than the amount of labour required to produce it. Hence, they propose that trade should be facilitated by using notes backed by labour.\n\n=== Adam Smith and David Ricardo ===\nAdam Smith held that, in a primitive society, the amount of labour put into producing a good determined its exchange value, with exchange value meaning in this case the amount of labour a good can purchase. However, according to Smith, in a more advanced society the market price is no longer proportional to labour cost since the value of the good now includes compensation for the owner of the means of production: \"The whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him.\"<ref>Smith quoted in Whitaker, Albert C.

[[David Ricardo]] stated it as, \"The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.\" (Ricardo 1817) In this connection Ricardo seeks to differentiate the quantity of labour necessary to produce a commodity from the wages paid to the labourers for its production. However, Ricardo was troubled with some deviations in prices from proportionality with the labour required to produce them.<ref>Fernando Vianello, (1990) \"The Labour Theory of Value\", Eatwell J., Milgate M., Newman P. (eds) in ''Marxian Economics'', The New Palgrave, pp.233-246.</ref>  For example, he said \"I cannot get over the difficulty of the wine, which is kept in the cellar for three or four years [i.e., while constantly increasing in exchange value], or that of the oak tree, which perhaps originally had not 2 s. expended on it in the way of labour, and yet comes to be worth \u00a3100.\" (Quoted in Whitaker) Of course, a capitalist economy stabilizes this discrepancy until the value added to aged wine is equal to the cost of storage. If anyone can hold onto a bottle for four years and become rich, that would make it hard to find freshly corked wine. There is also the theory that adding to the price of a [[luxury goods|luxury]] product increases its [[exchange-value]] by mere prestige.\n\nThe labour theory as an explanation for value contrasts with the [[subjective theory of value]], which says that value of a good is not determined by how much labour was put into it but by its usefulness in satisfying a want and its scarcity. Ricardo's labour theory of value is not a [[Normative economics|normative]] theory, as are some later forms of the labour theory, such as claims that it is ''immoral'' for an individual to be paid less for his labour than the total revenue that comes from the sales of all the goods he produces.\n\nIt is arguable to what extent these classical theorists held the labour theory of value as it is commonly defined.<ref>Whitaker, Albert C.

Marx used the concept of \"[[socially necessary labor time|socially necessary labour time]]\" to introduce a social perspective distinct from his predecessors and [[neoclassical economics]].  Whereas most economists start with the individual's perspective, Marx started with the perspective of society ''as a whole''. \"Social production\" involves a complicated and interconnected [[division of labor|division of labour]] of a wide variety of people who depend on each other for their survival and prosperity. [[Abstract labor and concrete labor|\"Abstract\" labour]] refers to a characteristic of [[commodity]]-producing labour that is shared by all different kinds of heterogeneous (concrete) types of labour. That is, the concept abstracts from the ''particular'' characteristics of all of the labour and is akin to average labour.\n\n\"Socially necessary\" labour refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity \"in a given state of society, under certain social average conditions or production, with a given social average intensity, and average skill of the labour employed.\"<ref name=\"marxprofit\" /> That is, the value of a product is determined more by societal standards than by individual conditions. This explains why technological breakthroughs lower the price of commodities and put less advanced producers out of business. Finally, it is not labour per se that creates value, but labor power sold by free wage workers to capitalists. Another distinction is between [[productive and unproductive labor]]. Only wage workers of productive sectors of the economy produce value.<ref group=note>For the difference between wage workers and working animals or [[slave]]s confer: John R.

London, Pluto Press 2009</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{main article|Criticisms of the labour theory of value}}\nThe Marxist labour theory of value has been criticised on several counts. Some argue that it predicts that profits will be higher in labour-intensive industries than in capital-intensive industries, which would be contradicted by measured empirical data inherent in quantitative analysis. This is sometimes referred to as the \"Great Contradiction\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">B\u00f6hm von Bawerk, \"Karl Marx and the Close of His System\" [[Karl Marx and the Close of His System]]</ref> In volume 3 of Capital, Marx explains why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most labour-intensive and why this is consistent with his theory. Whether or not this is consistent with the labour theory of value as presented in volume 1 has been a topic of debate.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Marx, [[surplus value]] is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital, not just the variable component. In the example given earlier, of making a cup of coffee, the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves, and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker. The value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities, and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan. The amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker. We can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital. Capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large contribution of capital, while labour-intensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one.<ref>Ekelund, Jr., Robert B. and Robert F. Hebert (1997, 4th ed), ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'', pp. 239\u2013241</ref> Critics argue that this turns the LTV into a macroeconomic theory, when it was supposed to explain the exchange ratios of individual commodities (making it a microeconomic theory), yet Marx was now maintaining that these ratios must diverge from their labour ratios. Critics thus held that Marx's proposed solution to the \"great contradiction\" was not so much a solution as it was sidestepping the issue.<ref>Temkin, Gabriel. \"Karl Marx and the economics of communism: anniversary recollections.\" Communist and Post-Communist Studies 31, no. 4 (1998): 303-328, pp.321-322</ref> \n\nSteve Keen argues that Marx's idea that only labour can produce value rests on the idea that as capital depreciates over its use, then this is transferring its exchange-value to the product. Keen argues that it is not clear why the value of the machine should depreciate at the same rate it is lost. Keen uses an analogy with labour: If workers receive a subsistence wage and the working day exhausts the capacity to labour, it could be argued that the worker has \"depreciated\" by the amount equivalent to the subsistence wage. However this depreciation is not the limit of value a worker can add in a day (indeed this is critical to Marx's idea that labour is fundamentally exploited). If it were, then the production of a surplus would be impossible. According to Keen, a machine could have a use-value greater than its exchange-value, meaning it could, along with labour, be a source of surplus. Keen claims that Marx almost reached such a conclusion in the [[Grundrisse]] but never developed it any further. Keen further observes that while Marx insisted that the contribution of machines to production is solely their use-value and not their exchange-value, he routinely treated the use-value and exchange-value of a machine as identical, despite the fact that this would contradict his claim that the two were unrelated.<ref>Steve Keen, [https://keenomics.s3.amazonaws.com/debtdeflation_media/papers/Jhet_use.PDF  \"Use-Value, Exchange Value, and the Demise of Marx's Labor Theory of Value\"], Journal of the History of Economic Thought, Volume 15, Issue 1, Spring 1993, pages 107-121</ref> Marxists respond by arguing that use-value and exchange-value are incommensurable magnitudes; to claim that a machine can add \"more use-value\" than it is worth in value-terms is a [[category error]]. According to Marx, a machine by definition cannot be a source of ''human'' labour.<ref> Marx, Karl. *Capital*, Vol. I, p. 141, Penguin edition</ref><ref>D'Arcy, Jim, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/darcy-jim/1974/socecon4machines.htm Socialist Economics 4: Do Machines Produce Surplus Value?], ''Socialist Standard'', 1974</ref> Keen responds by arguing that the labor theory of value only works if the use-value and exchange-value of a machine are identical, as Marx argued that machines cannot create surplus value since as their use-value depreciates along with their exchange-value - they simply transfer it to the new product but create no new value in the process.<ref>Keen, Steve.

According to the authors, these studies attempt to prove the LTV by showing that there is a positive correlation between market prices and labor values. However, the authors argue that these studies measure prices by looking at the price of total output (the unit price of a commodity multiplied by its total quantity) and do these for several sectors of the economy, estimate their total price and value from official statistics and measured for several years. However, Bichler and Nitzan argue that this method has statistical implications as correlations measured this way also reflect the co-variations of the associated quantities of unit values and prices. This means that the unit price and unit value of each sector are multiplied by the same value, which means that the greater the variability out output across different sectors, the tighter the correlation. This means that the overall correlation substantially larger than the underlying correlation between unit values and unit prices; when sectors are controlled for their size, the correlations often drop to insignificant levels.<ref>Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan.

The authors argue that, according to Marx, the value of a commodity indicates the abstract labour time required for its production; however Marxists have been unable to identify a way to measure a unit (elementary particle) of abstract labor (indeed the authors argue that most have given up and little progress has been made beyond Marx's original work) due to numerous difficulties. This means assumptions must be made and according to the authors, these involve circular reasoning:<ref>Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan.

The well-known Marxian economist [[Roman Rosdolsky]] replied to Robinson's claims at length,<ref> Rosdolsky, Roman. ''The Making of Marx's Capital'', Ch. 33</ref> arguing that Robinson failed to understand key components of Marx's theory; for instance, Robinson argued that \"Marx's theory, as we have seen, rests on the assumption of a constant rate of exploitation\",<ref> Robinson, Joan ''Essay on Marxian Economics'', p. 38</ref> but as Rosdolsky points out, there is a great deal of contrary evidence.<ref> Marx, Karl.

Pilkington writes that value is attributed to objects based on our desire for them and that this desire is always inter-subjective and socially determined; Marxists would reply that this argument fails since Marx says the opposite, and the logic of his theory would not require him to deny this anyway.<ref> Campbell, Martha (1991) ''Social Relations of Production: The Method and Critical Implications of Marx's \"Capital'', Ch. 5 </ref> Pilkington writes the following: <blockquote>[V]alue is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in turn, is inter-subjective. We desire to gain [a] medal or to capture [an] enemy flag [in battle] because it will win recognition in the eyes of our peers. [A] medal [or an enemy] flag are not valued for their objective properties, nor are they valued for the amount of labour embodied in them, rather they are desired for the symbolic positions they occupy in the inter-subjective network of desires.</blockquote>\n\nPilkington insists that this is an entirely different conception of value than the one we find in the marginalist theory found in many economics textbooks, although Pilkington's theory, like that of the marginalists, concentrates solely on consumer preferences. He writes that \"actors in marginalist analysis have self-contained preferences; they do not have inter-subjective desires\".<ref>Philip Pilkington.

Both [[David Ricardo#Value theory|David Ricardo]]<ref>It is now interpreted that Ricardo's theory of value is not the labor theory of value, but the cost of production theory of value. See [[David Ricardo#Value theory]]</ref> and [[Karl Marx]] tried to quantify and embody all labour components in order to develop a theory of the real price, or natural price of a commodity.<ref>e.g. see - Junankar, P. N., ''Marx's economics'', Oxford : Philip Allan, 1982, {{ISBN|0-86003-125-X}} or Peach, Terry \"Interpreting Ricardo\", Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-26086-8}}</ref> The labour theory of value as presented by [[Adam Smith]] did not require the quantification of past labour, nor did it deal with the labour needed to create the tools (capital) that might be used in producing a commodity. Smith's theory of value was very similar to the later utility theories in that Smith proclaimed that a commodity was worth whatever labour it would command in others (value in trade) or whatever labour it would \"save\" the self (value in use), or both. However, this \"value\" is subject to supply and demand at a particular time: <blockquote>The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people. (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V)</blockquote>\n\nSmith's theory of price (which for many is the same as value) has nothing to do with the past labour spent in producing a commodity.  It speaks only of the labour that can be \"commanded\" or \"saved\" at present.  If there is no use for a buggy whip, then the item is economically worthless in trade or in use, regardless of all the labour spent in creating it.\n\n=== Distinctions of economically pertinent labour ===\nValue \"in use\" is the [[usefulness]] of this commodity, its [[utility]]. A classical [[Paradox of value|paradox]] often comes up when considering this type of value. In the words of Adam Smith: <blockquote>The word value, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called \"value in use\"; the other, \"value in exchange.\" The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use. Nothing is more useful than water: but it will purchase scarce anything; scarce anything can be had in exchange for it. A diamond, on the contrary, has scarce any value in use; but a very great quantity of other goods may frequently be had in exchange for it (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter IV).</blockquote>\n\nValue \"in [[Trade|exchange]]\" is the relative proportion with which this commodity exchanges for another commodity (in other words, its [[price]] in the case of [[money]]). It is relative to labour as explained by Adam Smith: <blockquote>The value of any commodity, [...] to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour, therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities (''Wealth of Nations'' Book 1, chapter V).</blockquote>\n\nValue (without qualification) is the labour embodied in a commodity under a given structure of production. Marx defined the value of the commodity by the third definition. In his terms, value is the 'socially necessary abstract labor' embodied in a commodity. To [[David Ricardo]] and other classical economists, this definition serves as a measure of \"real cost\", \"absolute value\", or a \"measure of value\" invariable under changes in distribution and technology.<ref>Ricardo, David (1823), 'Absolute Value and Exchange Value', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 4, Cambridge University Press, 1951 and Sraffa, Piero and Maurice Dobb (1951), 'Introduction', in \"The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo\", Volume 1, Cambridge University Press, 1951.</ref>\n\nRicardo, other classical economists and Marx began their expositions with the assumption that value in exchange was equal to or proportional to this labor value. They thought this was a good assumption from which to explore the dynamics of development in capitalist societies. Other supporters of the labour theory of value used the word \"value\" in the second sense to represent \"exchange value\".<ref>Proudhon, Pierre J., 1851, ''General Idea of the Revolution in the 19th Century'', study 6.</ref>\n\n== LTV and the labour process ==\nSince the term \"value\" is understood in the LTV as denoting something created by labour, and its \"magnitude\" as something proportional to the quantity of labour performed, it is important to explain how the labour process both preserves value and adds new value in the commodities it creates.<ref group=note>Unless otherwise noted, the description of the labor process and the role of the value of means of production in this section are drawn from chapter 7 of ''Capital'' vol1 {{harv|Marx|1867|}}.</ref>\n\nThe value of a commodity increases in proportion to the duration and intensity of labour performed on average for its production. Part of what the LTV means by \"socially necessary\" is that the value only increases in proportion to this labour as it is performed with average skill and average productivity. So though workers may labour with greater skill or more productivity than others, these more skillful and more productive workers thus produce more value through the production of greater quantities of the finished commodity. Each unit still bears the same value as all the others of the same class of commodity. By working sloppily, unskilled workers may drag down the average skill of labour, thus increasing the average labour time necessary for the production of each unit commodity. But these unskillful workers cannot hope to sell the result of their labour process at a higher price (as opposed to value) simply because they have spent more time than other workers producing the same kind of commodities.\n\nHowever, production not only involves labour, but also certain means of labour: tools, materials, power plants and so on. These means of labour\u2014also known as [[means of production]]\u2014are often the product of another labour process as well. So the labour process inevitably involves these means of production that already enter the process with a certain amount of value. Labour also requires other means of production that are not produced with labour and therefore bear no value: such as sunlight, air, uncultivated land, unextracted minerals, etc. While useful, even crucial to the production process, these bring no value to that process. In terms of means of production resulting from another labour process, LTV treats the magnitude of value of these produced means of production as constant throughout the labour process. Due to the constancy of their value, these means of production are referred to, in this light, as constant capital.\n\nConsider for example workers who take coffee beans, use a roaster to roast them, and then use a brewer to brew and dispense a fresh cup of coffee. In performing this labour, these workers add value to the coffee beans and water that comprise the material ingredients of a cup of coffee. The worker also transfers the value of constant capital\u2014the value of the beans; some specific depreciated value of the roaster and the brewer; and the value of the cup\u2014to the value of the final cup of coffee. Again, on average the worker can transfer no more than the value of these means of labour previously possessed to the finished cup of coffee<ref group=note>In the case of instruments of labor, such as the roaster and the brewer (or even a ceramic cup) the value transferred to the cup of coffee is only a depreciated value calculated over the life of those instruments of labor according to some accounting convention.</ref> So the value of coffee produced in a day equals the sum of both the value of the means of labour\u2014this constant capital\u2014and the value newly added by the worker in proportion to the duration and intensity of their work.\n\nOften this is expressed mathematically as: \n:::::: <math>c+L=W</math>,\n:where\n:*<math>c</math> is the constant capital of materials used in a period plus the depreciated portion of tools and plant used in the process. (A period is typically a day, week, year, or a single turnover: meaning the time required to complete one batch of coffee, for example.)\n:* <math>L</math> is the quantity of labour time (average skill and productivity) performed in producing the finished commodities during the period\n:* <math>W</math> is the value (or think \"worth\") of the product of the period (<math>w</math> comes from the German word for value: ''wert'')\n\nNote: if the product resulting from the labour process is homogeneous (all similar in quality and traits, for example, all cups of coffee) then the value of the period's product can be divided by the total number of items (use-values or <math>v_u</math>) produced to derive the unit value of each item. <math>\\begin{matrix}w_i= \\frac{W}{\\sum v_u}\\,\\end{matrix}</math> where <math>\\sum v_u</math> is the total items produced.\n\nThe LTV further divides the value added during the period of production, <math>L</math>, into two parts. The first part is the portion of the process when the workers add value equivalent to the wages they are paid. For example, if the period in question is one week and these workers collectively are paid $1,000, then the time necessary to add $1,000 to\u2014while preserving the value of\u2014constant capital is considered the necessary labor portion of the period (or week): denoted <math>NL</math>. The remaining period is considered the surplus labour portion of the week: or <math>SL</math>. The value used to purchase labour-power, for example the $1,000 paid in wages to these workers for the week, is called variable capital (<math>v</math>). This is because in contrast to the constant capital expended on means of production, variable capital can add value in the labour process. The amount it adds depends on the duration, intensity, productivity and skill of the labour-power purchased: in this sense the buyer of labour-power has purchased a commodity of variable use. Finally, the value added during the portion of the period when surplus labor is performed is called [[surplus value]] (<math>s</math>). From the variables defined above, we find two other common expressions for the value produced during a given period:\n::::<math>c+v+s=W</math>\n:::and\n::::<math>c+NL+SL=W</math>\n\nThe first form of the equation expresses the value resulting from production, focusing on the costs <math>c+v</math> and the surplus value appropriated in the process of production, <math>s</math>. The second form of the equation focuses on the value of production in terms of the values added by the labour performed during the process <math>NL+SL</math>.\n\n== Relation between values and prices ==\nOne issue facing the LTV is the relationship between value quantities on one hand and prices on the other. If a commodity's value is not the same as its price, and therefore the magnitudes of each likely differ, then what is the relation between the two, if any? Various LTV schools of thought provide different answers to this question. For example, some argue that value in the sense of the amount of labour embodied in a good acts as a center of gravity for price.\n\nHowever, most economists would say that cases where pricing is given as approximately equal to the value of the labour embodied, are in fact only special cases.  In General Theory pricing most usually fluctuates.  The standard formulation is that prices normally include a level of income for \"[[Capital (economics)|capital]]\" and \"[[Land (economics)|land]]\".  These incomes are known as \"[[Profit (economics)|profit]]\" and \"[[Economic rent|rent]]\" respectively. Yet Marx made the point that value cannot be placed upon labour as a commodity, because capital is a constant, whereas profit is a variable, not an income; thus explaining the importance of profit in relation to pricing variables.<ref name=\"Harv|Marx|1867\"/>\n\nIn Book 1, chapter VI, Adam Smith writes: <blockquote>The real value of all the different component parts of price, it must be observed, is measured by the quantity of labour which they can, each of them, purchase or command. Labour measures the value not only of that part of price which resolves itself into labour, but of that which resolves itself into rent, and of that which resolves itself into profit.</blockquote>\n\nThe final sentence explains how Smith sees value of a product as relative to labour of buyer or consumer, as opposite to Marx who sees the value of a product being proportional to labour of labourer or producer. And we value things, price them, based on how much labor we can avoid or command, and we can command labor not only in a simple way but also by [[Trade|trading]] things for a profit.\n\nThe demonstration of the relation between commodities' unit values and their respective prices is known in Marxian terminology as the [[transformation problem]] or the transformation of values into prices of production. The transformation problem has probably generated the greatest bulk of debate about the LTV. The problem with transformation is to find an algorithm where the magnitude of value added by labour, in proportion to its duration and intensity, is sufficiently accounted for after this value is distributed through prices that reflect an equal rate of return on capital advanced. If there is an additional magnitude of value or a loss of value after transformation, then the relation between values (proportional to labour) and prices (proportional to total capital advanced) is incomplete. Various solutions and impossibility theorems have been offered for the transformation, but the debate has not reached any clear resolution.\n\nLTV does not deny the role of supply and demand influencing price, since the price of a commodity is something other than its value.  In ''Value, Price and Profit'' (1865), [[Karl Marx]] quotes [[Adam Smith]] and sums up:\n:It suffices to say that if supply and demand equilibrate each other, the market prices of commodities will correspond with their natural prices, that is to say, with their values as determined by the respective quantities of labor required for their production.<ref name = marxprofit>Marx, Karl (1865). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/ch02.htm#c6 Value, Price and Profit.]</ref>\n\nThe LTV seeks to explain the level of this equilibrium. This could be explained by a ''[[cost of production]]'' argument\u2014pointing out that all costs are ultimately labor costs, but this does not account for profit, and it is vulnerable to the charge of [[Tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] in that it explains prices by prices.<ref>Piero Sraffa and Maurice H. Dobb (1951). \"General Preface\", ''The Works and Correspondence of David Ricardo'', Vol. 1, Cambridge University Press</ref> Marx later called this \"Smith's adding up theory of value\".\n\nSmith argues that labour values are the natural measure of exchange for direct producers like hunters and fishermen.<ref name = ormazabal>{{cite web|url = https://www.ehu.eus/documents/2276258/2294671/il2006_26.pdf |title = Adam Smith on Labor and Value: Challenging the Standard Interpretation |first = Kepa M. |last=Ormazabal |date = 2006|publisher = University of the Basque Country}} </ref> Marx, on the other hand, uses a measurement analogy, arguing that for commodities to be comparable they must have a common element or substance by which to measure them,<ref name=marxprofit/> and that labour is a common substance of what Marx eventually calls ''commodity-values''.<ref name=\"Harv|Marx|1867\">{{Harv|Marx|1867|}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nThe labour theory of value has developed over many centuries.

[[David Ricardo]] (seconded by [[Karl Marx|Marx]]) responded to this paradox by arguing that Smith had confused labour with wages. \"Labour  commanded\", he argued, would always be more than the labour needed to sustain itself (wages).

The LTV and the accompanying theory of exploitation became central to his economic thought.\n\n19th century [[American individualist anarchists]] based their economics on the LTV, with their particular interpretation of it being called \"[[Cost the limit of price]]\". They, as well as contemporary individualist anarchists in that tradition, hold that it is unethical to charge a higher price for a commodity than the amount of labour required to produce it. Hence, they propose that trade should be facilitated by using notes backed by labour.\n\n=== Adam Smith and David Ricardo ===\nAdam Smith held that, in a primitive society, the amount of labour put into producing a good determined its exchange value, with exchange value meaning in this case the amount of labour a good can purchase. However, according to Smith, in a more advanced society the market price is no longer proportional to labour cost since the value of the good now includes compensation for the owner of the means of production: \"The whole produce of labour does not always belong to the labourer. He must in most cases share it with the owner of the stock which employs him.\"<ref>Smith quoted in Whitaker, Albert C.

[[David Ricardo]] stated it as, \"The value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.\" (Ricardo 1817) In this connection Ricardo seeks to differentiate the quantity of labour necessary to produce a commodity from the wages paid to the labourers for its production. However, Ricardo was troubled with some deviations in prices from proportionality with the labour required to produce them.<ref>Fernando Vianello, (1990) \"The Labour Theory of Value\", Eatwell J., Milgate M., Newman P. (eds) in ''Marxian Economics'', The New Palgrave, pp.233-246.</ref>  For example, he said \"I cannot get over the difficulty of the wine, which is kept in the cellar for three or four years [i.e., while constantly increasing in exchange value], or that of the oak tree, which perhaps originally had not 2 s. expended on it in the way of labour, and yet comes to be worth \u00a3100.\" (Quoted in Whitaker) Of course, a capitalist economy stabilizes this discrepancy until the value added to aged wine is equal to the cost of storage. If anyone can hold onto a bottle for four years and become rich, that would make it hard to find freshly corked wine. There is also the theory that adding to the price of a [[luxury goods|luxury]] product increases its [[exchange-value]] by mere prestige.\n\nThe labour theory as an explanation for value contrasts with the [[subjective theory of value]], which says that value of a good is not determined by how much labour was put into it but by its usefulness in satisfying a want and its scarcity. Ricardo's labour theory of value is not a [[Normative economics|normative]] theory, as are some later forms of the labour theory, such as claims that it is ''immoral'' for an individual to be paid less for his labour than the total revenue that comes from the sales of all the goods he produces.\n\nIt is arguable to what extent these classical theorists held the labour theory of value as it is commonly defined.<ref>Whitaker, Albert C.

Marx used the concept of \"[[socially necessary labor time|socially necessary labour time]]\" to introduce a social perspective distinct from his predecessors and [[neoclassical economics]].  Whereas most economists start with the individual's perspective, Marx started with the perspective of society ''as a whole''. \"Social production\" involves a complicated and interconnected [[division of labor|division of labour]] of a wide variety of people who depend on each other for their survival and prosperity. [[Abstract labor and concrete labor|\"Abstract\" labour]] refers to a characteristic of [[commodity]]-producing labour that is shared by all different kinds of heterogeneous (concrete) types of labour. That is, the concept abstracts from the ''particular'' characteristics of all of the labour and is akin to average labour.\n\n\"Socially necessary\" labour refers to the quantity required to produce a commodity \"in a given state of society, under certain social average conditions or production, with a given social average intensity, and average skill of the labour employed.\"<ref name=\"marxprofit\" /> That is, the value of a product is determined more by societal standards than by individual conditions. This explains why technological breakthroughs lower the price of commodities and put less advanced producers out of business. Finally, it is not labour per se that creates value, but labor power sold by free wage workers to capitalists. Another distinction is between [[productive and unproductive labor]]. Only wage workers of productive sectors of the economy produce value.<ref group=note>For the difference between wage workers and working animals or [[slave]]s confer: John R. Bell: Capitalism and the Dialectic - The Uno-Sekine Approach to Marxian Political Economy, p. 45. London, Pluto Press 2009</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n{{main article|Criticisms of the labour theory of value}}\nThe Marxist labor theory of value has been criticised on several counts. Some argue that it predicts that profits will be higher in labor-intensive industries than in capital-intensive industries, which would be contradicted by measured empirical data inherent in quantitative analysis. This is sometimes referred to as the \"Great Contradiction\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">B\u00f6hm von Bawerk, \"Karl Marx and the Close of His System\" [[Karl Marx and the Close of His System]]</ref> In volume 3 of Capital, Marx explains why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most labor-intensive and why this is consistent with his theory. Whether or not this is consistent with the labor theory of value as presented in volume 1 has been a topic of debate.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> According to Marx, [[surplus value]] is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital, not just the variable component. In the example given earlier, of making a cup of coffee, the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves, and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker. The value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities, and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan. The amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker. We can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital. Capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large contribution of capital, while labor-intensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one.<ref>Ekelund, Jr., Robert B. and Robert F. Hebert (1997, 4th ed), ''A History of Economic Theory and Method'', pp. 239\u2013241</ref> Critics argue that this turns the LTV into a macroeconomic theory, when it was supposed to explain the exchange ratios of individual commodities (making it a microeconomic theory), yet Marx was now maintaining that these ratios must diverge from their labour ratios. Critics thus held that Marx's proposed solution to the \"great contradiction\" was not so much a solution as it was sidestepping the issue.<ref>Temkin, Gabriel. \"Karl Marx and the economics of communism: anniversary recollections.\" Communist and Post-Communist Studies 31, no. 4 (1998): 303-328, pp.321-322</ref> \n\nSteve Keen argues that Marx's idea that only labor can produce value rests on the idea that as capital depreciates over its use, then this is transferring its exchange-value to the product. Keen argues that it is not clear why the value of the machine should depreciate at the same rate it is lost. Keen uses an analogy with labor: If workers receive a subsistence wage and the working day exhausts the capacity to labor, it could be argued that the worker has \"depreciated\" by the amount equivalent to the subsistence wage. However this depreciation is not the limit of value a worker can add in a day (indeed this is critical to Marx's idea that labor is fundamentally exploited). If it were, then the production of a surplus would be impossible. According to Keen, a machine could have a use-value greater than its exchange-value, meaning it could, along with labor, be a source of surplus. Keen claims that Marx almost reached such a conclusion in the [[Grundrisse]] but never developed it any further. Keen further observes that while Marx insisted that the contribution of machines to production is solely their use-value and not their exchange-value, he routinely treated the use-value and exchange-value of a machine as identical, despite the fact that this would contradict his claim that the two were unrelated.<ref>Steve Keen, [https://keenomics.s3.amazonaws.com/debtdeflation_media/papers/Jhet_use.PDF  \"Use-Value, Exchange Value, and the Demise of Marx's Labor Theory of Value\"], Journal of the History of Economic Thought, Volume 15, Issue 1, Spring 1993, pages 107-121</ref> Marxists respond by arguing that use-value and exchange-value are incommensurable magnitudes; to claim that a machine can add \"more use-value\" than it is worth in value-terms is a [[category error]]. According to Marx, a machine by definition cannot be a source of ''human'' labor.<ref> Marx, Karl. *Capital*, Vol. I, p. 141, Penguin edition</ref><ref>D'Arcy, Jim, [https://www.marxists.org/archive/darcy-jim/1974/socecon4machines.htm Socialist Economics 4: Do Machines Produce Surplus Value?], ''Socialist Standard'', 1974</ref> Keen responds by arguing that the labor theory of value only works if the use-value and exchange-value of a machine are identical, as Marx argued that machines cannot create surplus value since as their use-value depreciates along with their exchange-value - they simply transfer it to the new product but create no new value in the process.<ref>Keen, Steve. Debunking economics. ZED Books Limited, 2011, pp.436-438</ref> Keen's machinery argument can also be applied to [[slavery]] based modes of production, which also profit from extracting more use value from the laborers than they return to laborers.<ref>Kara, Siddharth (2008).

According to the authors, these studies attempt to prove the LTV by showing that there is a positive correlation between market prices and labor values. However, the authors argue that these studies measure prices by looking at the price of total output (the unit price of a commodity multiplied by its total quantity) and do these for several sectors of the economy, estimate their total price and value from official statistics and measured for several years. However, Bichler and Nitzan argue that this method has statistical implications as correlations measured this way also reflect the co-variations of the associated quantities of unit values and prices. This means that the unit price and unit value of each sector are multiplied by the same value, which means that the greater the variability out output across different sectors, the tighter the correlation. This means that the overall correlation substantially larger than the underlying correlation between unit values and unit prices; when sectors are controlled for their size, the correlations often drop to insignificant levels.<ref>Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan.

The authors argue that, according to Marx, the value of a commodity indicates the abstract labor time required for its production; however Marxists have been unable to identify a way to measure a unit (elementary particle) of abstract labor (indeed the authors argue that most have given up and little progress has been made beyond Marx's original work) due to numerous difficulties. This means assumptions must be made and according to the authors, these involve circular reasoning:<ref>Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan.

In other words, the researcher assumes precisely what the labour theory of value is supposed to ''demonstrate''.<ref>Nitzan, Jonathan, and Shimshon Bichler.

[[Joan Robinson]], who herself was considered an expert on the writings of Karl Marx,{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} wrote that the labor theory of value was largely a tautology and \"a typical example of the way metaphysical ideas operate\".<ref>Joan Robinson, \"Economic Philosophy\" p39</ref>. The well-known Marxian economist [[Roman Rosdolsky]] replied to Robinson's claims at length,<ref> Rosdolsky, Roman. ''The Making of Marx's Capital'', Ch. 33</ref> arguing that Robinson failed to understand key components of Marx's theory; for instance, Robinson argued that \"Marx's theory, as we have seen, rests on the assumption of a constant rate of exploitation\",<ref> Robinson, Joan ''Essay on Marxian Economics'', p. 38</ref> but as Rosdolsky points out, there is a great deal of contrary evidence.<ref> Marx, Karl. ''Capital'', Vol. 3, Ch. 14. Here Marx directly contradicts Robinson's claim by addressing, at length, \"The Increasing Intensity of Exploitation\"</ref>\n\nOthers have argued that the labor theory of value, especially as it arises in the work of Karl Marx, is due to a failure to recognize the fundamentally dialectical nature of how human beings attribute value to objects. Pilkington writes that value is attributed to objects based on our desire for them and that this desire is always inter-subjective and socially determined; Marxists would reply that this argument fails since Marx says the opposite, and the logic of his theory would not require him to deny this anyway.<ref> Campbell, Martha (1991) ''Social Relations of Production: The Method and Critical Implications of Marx's \"Capital'', Ch. 5 </ref> Pilkington writes the following: <blockquote>[V]alue is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in turn, is inter-subjective. We desire to gain [a] medal or to capture [an] enemy flag [in battle] because it will win recognition in the eyes of our peers. [A] medal [or an enemy] flag are not valued for their objective properties, nor are they valued for the amount of labour embodied in them, rather they are desired for the symbolic positions they occupy in the inter-subjective network of desires.</blockquote>\n\nPilkington insists that this is an entirely different conception of value than the one we find in the marginalist theory found in many economics textbooks, although Pilkington's theory, like that of the marginalists, concentrates solely on consumer preferences. He writes that \"actors in marginalist analysis have self-contained preferences; they do not have inter-subjective desires\".<ref>Philip Pilkington.
