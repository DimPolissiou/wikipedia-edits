He was elected MDC spokesman at the party Congress in June 2006. In April 2011 at the Party's congress in Bulawayo, he was elected as the Party's Organising secretary, a post that previously belonged to Elias Mudzuri. In Parliament, he  was chair  of the portfolio committees of Defence and Home Affairs, Public Accounts, Gender and Youth and Transport and Communications. Chamisa is also a member of the Local Government, Public Works & Urban Development and the African Caribbean and Pacific Parliament. He is a former secretary-general of the Zimbabwe National Students Union.\n\nIn March 2007 he was attacked at [[Harare International Airport]] as he attempted to leave the country for [[Belgium]]; he was admitted to a hospital with a broken skull. On the current situation in Zimbabwe, he said, \"There is no security. There is no protection.

''The Herald'' reported on 10 April 2009, that President [[Robert Mugabe]] had assigned responsibility for telecommunications to the Ministry of Transport, headed by [[Nicholas Goche]].<ref>[http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=84&art_id=nw20090410124717675C344831 \"Mugabe gives ally control of telecoms\"], Sapa-AFP (''IOL''), 10 April 2009.</ref> Chamisa and Tsvangirai objected to this decision, saying that Mugabe had no power to unilaterally assign telecommunications to another ministry under the terms of the power-sharing agreement.\n\nChamisa served as a cabinet minister from February 2009 to July 2013, until the end of the [[Government]] of national Unity. He also served as the Movement for Democratic Change's ([[MDC-T]]) organising secretary. He lost the position of party Secretary-General in the party's 2014 Congress to Douglas Mwonzora. Chamisa has been accused of barring other youth and student leaders from having closer access to party president Tsvangirai, a move allegedly meant to protect his position. After the expulsion of [[Tendai Biti]] and [[Elton Mangoma]], Chamisa's relationship with Morgan Tsvangirai deteriorated; he was apparently not well liked by Tsvangirai's loyalists. On 16 July 2016 Chamisa was appointed as co-Vice President of the MDC by Tsvangirai to serve alongside Mudzuri and Khupe.\n\nWhen party leader Morgan Tsvangirai began battling colon cancer, power struggles began to ensue in the party, mainly between the three Vice Presidents Chamisa, [[Elias Mudzuri]] and [[Thokozani Khupe]]. On 14 February 2018, it was announced that Tsvangirai had succumbed to colon cancer in the hospital and the next day, the Party's national council appointed Chamisa acting President for a period of 12 months effectively elbowing Mudzuri and Khupe out. As the new President of the MDC he also took over the role of Leader of the [[MDC Alliance]].\n\nOn 30 July 2018, Chamisa lost a disputed election to ZANU PF's [[Emmerson Mnangagwa|Mnangagwa]]. The election has been widely criticized for lacking credibility and being unfair.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Chamisa challenged the election results in Zimbabwe's constitutional court but his challenge was dismissed with cost. After the failure to convince the Constitutional Court, Chamisa questioned the independence of the judiciary and has since promised his supporters a strategy to regain stolen electoral victory.<ref>[https://www.thehararetimes.com/what-next-for-nelson-chamisa]</ref>\n\nChamisa claims ZANU-PF lost elections.

Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. [[Max Keith]], the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp |title = The Reich Stuff? |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |publisher = [[Snopes]] |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate= May 8, 2014 }}</ref> The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in [[plastic bottle]]s or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.\n\nIn 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to [[7 Up]].\n\n[[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using [[saccharin]] as a [[sugar substitute]]. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of [[Diet Coke]].<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite news|last1=Estes|first1=Adam|title=A Brief History of Racist Soft Drinks|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822013457/http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Last Minute Refreshment.jpg|thumb|right|An ad in Berlin, Germany.]]\nCoca-Cola South Africa also released [[Valpre]] Bottled \"still\" and \"sparkling\" water.\n\nIn 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand.  The tagline was \"Simba \u2013 It Cures the African Thirst.\"\n\nAlso in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale.  Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.\n\n====BreakMate====\n{{Main|BreakMate}}\n\nNo longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and [[Siemens]] in 1988. Intended for use in offices with five to fifty people,<ref>{{cite news |title=Coca-Cola seeping into coffee breaks |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0eEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |publisher=Eugene Register-Guard |date=November 19, 1988 |access-date=March 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403174211/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19881119&id=beZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0eEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3496,4781541 |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO<sub>2</sub> tank.

These included [[Minute Maid]] Juices to Go, [[Powerade]] sports beverage, flavored tea [[Nestea]] (in a joint venture with [[Nestl\u00e9]]), [[Fruitopia]] fruit drink, and [[Dasani]] water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the [[Simply Orange]] brand of juices including [[orange juice]]. In 2016, [[Coca-Cola India]] introduced [[Vio (flavoured milk)|Vio]] to enter into the value-added [[Dairy product|dairy]] category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after [[Soft drink|carbonated beverages]], water and juices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|title=Coca-Cola India Enters Dairy Market With VIO Flavored Milk|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=June 22, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170407143024/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|archive-date=April 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s such as the [[Atkins diet]], Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed [[C2 Cola]]. C2 contains a mix of [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], and [[Acesulfame potassium]]. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the [[food energy]] and [[carbohydrate]]s of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.\n\nStarting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in [[Innocent Drinks]], first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation |last=Neate |first=Rupert |date=February 22, 2013 |title=Coca-Cola takes full control of Innocent |publisher='\u2019[[The Guardian]]'\u2019 |location=London (I believe) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |accessdate=June 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729200236/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavored drink, was launched in France.

The Coca-Cola Company has been faced with multiple lawsuits concerning these various criticisms.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:'96-'02 Chevrolet Express Wagon Coca-Cola.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Chevrolet Express]] van bearing the logo of The Coca-Cola Company.]]\nCoca-Cola advertising has \"been among the most prolific in marketing history\", with a notable and major impact on popular culture and society as a whole.\n\nThe logo, bottle design, and brand image are internationally recognizable. Their product is ranked the number one soft drink, repeatedly, internationally, and has notoriety as the first soft drink consumed by astronauts in space. Coca-Cola employs a diverse range of integrated marketing communications to advertise through direct marketing, web based media, social media, and sales promotions (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author=Stringer, G. |date=2015|title= Case Study: Coca Cola Integrated Marketing Communications|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-study-coca-cola-integrated-marketing-gregory-stringer}}\n</ref>\n\nThe company carefully considers all touch points a consumer (or prospective consumer) has with the brand as potential delivery channels for the brand's message, and makes use of all relevant communication systems. This well established, long-standing, consistent approach has created a longing for the product that by far \"superseded the desire for that typically associated with a drink to quench one's thirst\" (Dudovskiy, 2015).<ref>{{cite web|author=Dudovskiy, J.|year=2015|title=Coca-Cola Marketing Communications: A Critical Analysis|accessdate=March 1, 2015|website=Research Methodology|url=http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221114805/http://research-methodology.net/coca-cola-marketing-communications-a-critical-analysis/|archive-date=February 21, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;Direct marketing\nThey have exclusive vendor company partnerships, which eliminates competition, e.g. cinemas and [[restaurants]] only serving Coca-Cola over [[Pepsi]]. At sponsored sporting events, they again eliminate competition by attaining sole sale rights as well as VIP sales opportunities to important clients, for example, [[baseball field]]s.\n\n;Viral marketing\nThe company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns (Stringer, 2015).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Web and social media\nThey set the industry benchmark as the brand so universally recognized that audience building is unnecessary.

The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, Columbia released many popular films including ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|The Karate Kid]]'', and some others.

Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. [[Max Keith]], the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.snopes.com/cokelore/fanta.asp |title = The Reich Stuff? |last = Mikkelson |first = Barbara |publisher = [[Snopes]] |date = April 29, 2011 |accessdate= May 8, 2014 }}</ref> The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange flavored soft drink which can come in [[plastic bottle]]s or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, grapefruit, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.\n\nIn 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, and another of the company's bestsellers and its response to [[7 Up]].\n\n[[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] was Coca-Cola's first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using [[saccharin]] as a [[sugar substitute]]. Introduced in 1963, the product is still sold today, although its sales have dwindled since the introduction of [[Diet Coke]].<ref name=\"tab\">{{cite news|last1=Estes|first1=Adam|title=A Brief History of Racist Soft Drinks|url=http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|accessdate=August 10, 2016|work=The Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822013457/http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/01/brief-history-racist-soft-drinks/61515/|archive-date=August 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Last Minute Refreshment.jpg|thumb|right|An ad in Berlin, Germany.]]\nCoca-Cola South Africa also released [[Valpre]] Bottled \"still\" and \"sparkling\" water.\n\nIn 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand.  The tagline was \"Simba \u2013 It Cures the African Thirst.\"\n\nAlso in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale.  Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short lived in the marketplace.\n\n====BreakMate====\n{{Main|BreakMate}}\n\nNo longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and [[Siemens]] in 1988.

These included [[Minute Maid]] Juices to Go, [[Powerade]] sports beverage, flavored tea [[Nestea]] (in a joint venture with [[Nestl\u00e9]]), [[Fruitopia]] fruit drink, and [[Dasani]] water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the [[Simply Orange]] brand of juices including [[orange juice]]. In 2016, [[Coca-Cola India]] introduced [[Vio (flavoured milk)|Vio]] to enter into the value-added [[Dairy product|dairy]] category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola's new segment after [[Soft drink|carbonated beverages]], water and juices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|title=Coca-Cola India Enters Dairy Market With VIO Flavored Milk|publisher=The Coca-Cola Company|access-date=June 22, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.fo/20170407143024/http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/coca-cola-india-enters-dairy-market-with-vio-flavored-milk|archive-date=April 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of [[low-carbohydrate diet]]s such as the [[Atkins diet]], Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed [[C2 Cola]]. C2 contains a mix of [[high fructose corn syrup]], [[aspartame]], [[sucralose]], and [[Acesulfame potassium]]. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the [[food energy]] and [[carbohydrate]]s of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales.\n\nStarting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in [[Innocent Drinks]], first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.<ref name=ccc>{{Citation |last=Neate |first=Rupert |date=February 22, 2013 |title=Coca-Cola takes full control of Innocent |publisher='\u2019[[The Guardian]]'\u2019 |location=London (I believe) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |accessdate=June 28, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729200236/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/22/coca-cola-full-control-innocent |archive-date=July 29, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIt was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavored drink, was launched in France.
