Wilson]]. Produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] as its first feature film, it was released by [[20th Century Fox]] on March 15, 2002. The film features the voices of [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], and [[Denis Leary]]. Set during the days of the [[Pleistocene|ice age]], the film centers around three main characters - Manny (Romano), a no-nonsense [[woolly mammoth]]; Sid (Leguizamo), a loudmouthed [[ground sloth]]; and Diego (Leary), a sardonic [[smilodon|saber-tooth tiger]] -  who come across a human baby and work together to return it to its tribe. Additionally, the film occasionally follows Scrat, a speechless \"saber-toothed squirrel\" voiced by Wedge who is perpetually searching for a place in the ground to bury his acorn.\n\n''Ice Age'' was originally intended as a [[traditional animation|2D animated]] film developed by [[Fox Animation Studios]], but eventually became the first full-length animated film for the newly-reformed Blue Sky, which had been reshaped from a VFX house to a computer animation studio. Focus shifted from making an action-adventure drama film to a more comedy-oriented one, and several writers, such as [[Michael Berg (screenwriter)|Michael Berg]] and [[Peter Ackerman (playwright)|Peter Ackerman]], were brought on to bring out a wittier tone.\n\nUpon release, ''Ice Age'' received mostly positive reviews and was nominated at the [[75th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[Spirited Away]]''. It was a [[box office]] success and grossed over $383 million, starting the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' franchise]], being followed by four sequels: ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' in 2006, ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' in 2009, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' in 2012, and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Cronopio (mammal)|saber-toothed squirrel]] known as Scrat attempts to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. Eventually, as he tries to stomp it into the ground, he inadvertently causes a large crack to form in the ice that extends for miles before setting off a large avalanche which nearly crushes him. He barely escapes but finds himself getting stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals migrating south in order to escape the forthcoming [[ice age]]. Sid, a clumsy [[ground sloth]], is left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself, but is attacked by two ''Brontotheres'' after ruining their meal and making them angry. Sid is soon rescued by Manny, a gruff [[woolly mammoth]] heading north, who fights the rhinos off and continues on his path. Sid joins Manny, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanor and wishes to migrate on his own, but Sid nonetheless continues to follow Manny. Meanwhile, Soto, the leader of a pack of [[Smilodon|saber-toothed tiger]]s, wants revenge on a tribe of neanderthals for killing half of his pack by eating the chief's infant son, Roshan,<ref name=\"Strong Official\">{{cite web |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192553/https://www.tarastrong.com/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url=https://www.tarastrong.com |title=Tara Strong official website |author=Tara Strong |accessdate=April 19, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> alive. Soto leads a raid on the neanderthal camp, during which the Roshan's mother is separated from everyone else and jumps down a waterfall upon being cornered by Soto's lieutenant, [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]]. As punishment for his failure to retrieve Roshan, Diego is sent to find and retrieve the baby.\n\nLater, Sid and Manny encounter the mother struggling out of the lake, dying from her plunge. The mother only has enough strength to entrust Roshan to Manny before she dies and disappears into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but when they reach the neanderthal settlement, they find it deserted. They meet up with Diego, who convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the neanderthals. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to Half-Peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them.\n\nAfter encountering several misadventures on their way, the group reaches a cave with several [[cave painting]]s. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with the neanderthal hunters, in which they slaughtered his family, consisting of his mate and child, leaving Manny a depressed loner. Later, the group almost reaches their destination, Half-Peak, only to encounter a forming river of lava. Manny and Sid, along with Roshan, make it across safely, but Diego ends up hanging on a cliff, about to fall into the lava. Manny saves him, narrowly missing certain death by falling into the lava himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and Roshan takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who starts to have a change of heart about his mission.\n\nThe next day, the herd approaches the ambush, causing Diego, now full of respect for Manny for saving his life to change his mind and confess to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego asks for their trust and tries to foil the attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, but despite their efforts, Soto's associates manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks a distracted Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall onto Soto, impaling and instantly killing him. Horrified, the rest of the pack retreat. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego's injury, which they believe is fatal, and continue their journey without him. The two manage to successfully return Roshan to his tribe, and to their surprise, Diego manages to rejoin them, in time to see Roshan leave. The group then begin to head off to warmer climates.\n\n20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, ends up on the shores of a tropical island. As the ice slowly melts, an acorn that was also frozen in the same ice block is washed away. Scrat then finds a coconut and tries to stomp it into the ground, only to accidentally trigger a volcanic eruption.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Ice Age characters}}\nThe characters are all [[prehistory|prehistoric]] animals.  The animals can talk to and understand each other and are voiced by a variety of famous [[actor]]s.  Like many films of prehistoric life, the rules of time periods apply very loosely, as many of the species shown in the film never actually lived in the same time periods or the same geographic regions.\n[[File:15-07-21-Mexico-Stadtzentrum-RalfR-N3S 9683.jpg|thumb|A person wearing a Sid costume]]\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manfred \"Manny\"]], a [[woolly mammoth]] \n* [[Denis Leary]] as [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]], a ''[[Smilodon]]'' \n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]], a ''[[Megalonyx]]'' \n* [[Chris Wedge]] as [[Scrat]], a ''[[Cronopio (mammal)|Cronopio]]\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Soto, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Jack Black]] as Zeke, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Oscar, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Lenny, a ''[[Homotherium]]''\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Carl, an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' \n* [[Stephen Root]] as Frank, a ''[[Brontops]]''\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] and [[Lorri Bagley]] as Rachel and Jennifer, respectively, a pair of female giant ground sloths\n* [[Tara Strong]] as Roshan, a human infant<ref name=\"Strong Official\"/>\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\n''Ice Age'' was originally pitched to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1997 by producer Lori Forte. The film, originally envisioned as a [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] movie with an action-oriented [[comedy-drama]] tone, was intended to be developed by [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]]'s [[Fox Animation Studios]]. Around the same time, [[Blue Sky Studios]], a small [[visual effects]] studio in [[White Plains, New York]], was bought out by Fox and reshaped into a full-fledged [[computer animation|CG animation]] film studio. In light of this, [[20th Century Fox Animation|Fox Animation]] head [[Chris Meledandri]] and executive producer Steve Bannerman approached Forte with the proposition of developing the film as a computer-animated movie, which Forte realized was \"basically a no-brainer,\" according to her. [[Michael J. Wilson]], who had written and developed the film's original story treatments in conjunction with Forte, wrote the first draft for the script, and [[Chris Wedge]], a co-founder of Blue Sky, was brought on to the project as the director in late 1998. Fox also opted for the movie to take a more comedy-oriented direction (albeit while still maintaining some dramatic elements),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/coming-out-ice-age |title=Coming Out of the Ice Age |first=John C. |last=Donkin |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=March 12, 2002 |accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> and brought writer [[Michael Berg (screenwriter)|Michael Berg]] to help emphasize a funnier tone. After being hired, Berg reportedly told the studio that he couldn't write a kid's film, to which the studio responded \"Great! Just write a good story.\"<ref name=\"la\">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-mar-15-et-iceage15-story.html|title=Working With Sloths Can Be Time-Consuming|date=March 15, 2002|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\nStory development began in spring of 1999,<ref name=\"Ice Pack\"/> and official production on the movie began in June 2000, one week following the closure of Fox Animation Studios.<ref name=\"E\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/40065/fox-shuts-down-animation-hq|title=Fox Shuts Down Animation HQ|date=June 27, 2000|website=E!

Wilson stated on his blog that his daughter Flora came up with the idea for an animal that was a mixture of both squirrel and rat, naming it Scrat, and that the animal was obsessed with pursuing his acorn.<ref>[http://sootheatrenews.blogspot.com/2009/11/ice-age-story-behind-story-from-writer.html?m=1 Ice Age: The Story Behind the Story (from the writer Michael J. Wilson)], News from the Soo Theatre, Inc. Retrieved April 2nd, 2017.</ref> The plan to have Scrat talk was quickly dropped, as he worked better as a silent character for comedic effect. The name 'Scrat' is a combination of the words 'squirrel' and 'rat', as Scrat has characteristics of both species; Wedge has also called him \"saber-toothed squirrel.\" Scrat's opening adventure was inserted because, without it, the first real snow and ice sequence wouldn't take place until about 37 minutes into the film. This was the only role intended for Scrat, but he proved to be such a popular character with test audiences that he was given more scenes. The filmmakers made it so that many of the scenes with Scrat appear directly after dramatic moments in the film.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with [[Jay Leno]], [[Denis Leary]] revealed that his character, Diego the sabertooth, originally died near the end of the film. However, it was reported that kids in the test audience bursted into tears when his death was shown. Leary himself warned the producers that something like this would happen. When it was proven true, the scene was re-written to ensure Diego survived.\n\nOriginally, Sid the Sloth was supposed to be a con-artist and a hustler, and there was even finished scene of the character conning some aardvark kids. His character was later changed to a talkative-clumsy sloth because the team felt the audience would have hated him. There was also an alternate scene of Sid in the hottub with the ladies which shows him saying to them \"Let's jump in the gene pool and see what happens.\" One of the female sloths then kicks him in the groin. This was cut because it was not suitable for children and may have gotten the film a PG-13 rating. Other innuendos with Sid were also cut from the film. Sid was also supposed to have a female sloth named Sylvia (voiced by Kristen Johnston) chasing after him, whom he despised and kept ditching. All the removed scenes can be seen on the DVD.\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe characters and environments in ''Ice Age'' were modeled and animated using WaveFront's [[Maya (software)|Maya]] animation software. Rendering was completed using CGI Studio, an in-house [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] program being developed since Blue Sky's formation in 1987 and previously used for Wedge's 1998 short film, ''[[Bunny (short)|Bunny]]''. While ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', released three months before ''Ice Age'', became the first computer-animated film to make use of ray tracing technology, ''Ice Age'' would have received the distinction had it been released at the time Blue Sky began work on the movie.<ref name=\"Ice Pack\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/03/12/john_leguizamo_ice_age_interview.shtml|title=BBC - Films - interview - John Leguizamo|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice casting ===\nThe voice cast of ''Ice Age'' was encouraged to [[Improvisation|make up their own dialogue]] during recording.

Wilson]]. Produced by [[Blue Sky Studios]] as its first feature film, it was released by [[20th Century Fox]] on March 15, 2002. The film features the voices of [[Ray Romano]], [[John Leguizamo]], and [[Denis Leary]]. Set during the days of the [[Pleistocene|ice age]], the film centers around three main characters - Manny (Romano), a no-nonsense [[woolly mammoth]]; Sid (Leguizamo), a loudmouthed [[ground sloth]]; and Diego (Leary), a sardonic [[smilodon|saber-tooth tiger]] -  who come across a human baby and work together to return it to its tribe. Additionally, the film occasionally follows Scrat, a speechless \"saber-toothed squirrel\" voiced by Wedge who is perpetually searching for a place in the ground to bury his acorn.\n\n''Ice Age'' was originally intended as a [[traditional animation|2D animated]] film developed by [[Fox Animation Studios]], but eventually became the first full-length animated film for the newly-reformed Blue Sky, which had been reshaped from a VFX house to a computer animation studio. Focus shifted from making an action-adventure drama film to a more comedy-oriented one, and several writers, such as [[Michael Berg (screenwriter)|Michael Berg]] and [[Peter Ackerman (playwright)|Peter Ackerman]], were brought on to bring out a wittier tone.\n\nUpon release, ''Ice Age'' received mostly positive reviews and was nominated at the [[75th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]], losing to ''[[Spirited Away]]''. It was a [[box office]] success and grossed over $383 million, starting the [[Ice Age (franchise)|''Ice Age'' franchise]], being followed by four sequels: ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]'' in 2006, ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]'' in 2009, ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' in 2012, and ''[[Ice Age: Collision Course]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nA [[Cronopio (mammal)|saber-toothed squirrel]] known as Scrat attempts to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. Eventually, as he tries to stomp it into the ground, he inadvertently causes a large crack to form in the ice that extends for miles before setting off a large avalanche which nearly crushes him. He barely escapes but finds himself getting stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals migrating south in order to escape the forthcoming [[ice age]]. Sid, a clumsy [[ground sloth]], is left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself, but is attacked by two ''Brontotheres'' after ruining their meal and making them angry. Sid is soon rescued by Manny, a gruff [[woolly mammoth]] heading north, who fights the rhinos off and continues on his path. Sid joins Manny, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanor and wishes to migrate on his own, but Sid nonetheless continues to follow Manny. Meanwhile, Soto, the leader of a pack of [[Smilodon|saber-toothed tiger]]s, wants revenge on a tribe of neanderthals for killing half of his pack by eating the chief's infant son, Roshan,<ref name=\"Strong Official\">{{cite web |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192553/https://www.tarastrong.com/ |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |url=https://www.tarastrong.com |title=Tara Strong official website |author=Tara Strong |accessdate=April 19, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> alive. Soto leads a raid on the neanderthal camp, during which the Roshan's mother is separated from everyone else and jumps down a waterfall upon being cornered by Soto's lieutenant, [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]]. As punishment for his failure to retrieve Roshan, Diego is sent to find and retrieve the baby.\n\nLater, Sid and Manny encounter the mother struggling out of the lake, dying from her plunge. The mother only has enough strength to entrust Roshan to Manny before she dies and disappears into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but when they reach the neanderthal settlement, they find it deserted. They meet up with Diego, who convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the neanderthals. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to Half-Peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them.\n\nAfter encountering several misadventures on their way, the group reaches a cave with several [[cave painting]]s. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with the neanderthal hunters, in which they slaughtered his family, consisting of his mate and child, leaving Manny a depressed loner. Later, the group almost reaches their destination, Half-Peak, only to encounter a forming river of lava. Manny and Sid, along with Roshan, make it across safely, but Diego ends up hanging on a cliff, about to fall into the lava. Manny saves him, narrowly missing certain death by falling into the lava himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and Roshan takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who starts to have a change of heart about his mission.\n\nThe next day, the herd approaches the ambush, causing Diego, now full of respect for Manny for saving his life to change his mind and confess to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego asks for their trust and tries to foil the attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, but despite their efforts, Soto's associates manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks a distracted Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall onto Soto, impaling anf instantly killing him. Horrified, the rest of the pack retreat. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego's injury, which they believe is fatal, and continue their journey without him. The two manage to successfully return Roshan to his tribe, and to their surprise, Diego manages to rejoin them, in time to see Roshan leave. The group then begin to head off to warmer climates.\n\n20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, ends up on the shores of a tropical island. As the ice slowly melts, an acorn that was also frozen in the same ice block is washed away. Scrat then finds a coconut and tries to stomp it into the ground, only to accidentally trigger a volcanic eruption.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Ice Age characters}}\nThe characters are all [[prehistory|prehistoric]] animals.  The animals can talk to and understand each other and are voiced by a variety of famous [[actor]]s.  Like many films of prehistoric life, the rules of time periods apply very loosely, as many of the species shown in the film never actually lived in the same time periods or the same geographic regions.\n[[File:15-07-21-Mexico-Stadtzentrum-RalfR-N3S 9683.jpg|thumb|A person wearing a Sid costume]]\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Manny (Ice Age)|Manfred \"Manny\"]], a [[woolly mammoth]] \n* [[Denis Leary]] as [[Diego (Ice Age)|Diego]], a ''[[Smilodon]]'' \n* [[John Leguizamo]] as [[Sid (Ice Age)|Sid]], a ''[[Megalonyx]]'' \n* [[Chris Wedge]] as [[Scrat]], a ''[[Cronopio (mammal)|Cronopio]]\n* [[Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107]] as Soto, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Jack Black]] as Zeke, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Oscar, a ''Smilodon''\n* [[Alan Tudyk]] as Lenny, a ''[[Homotherium]]''\n* [[Cedric the Entertainer]] as Carl, an ''[[Embolotherium]]'' \n* [[Stephen Root]] as Frank, a ''[[Brontops]]''\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] and [[Lorri Bagley]] as Rachel and Jennifer, respectively, a pair of female giant ground sloths\n* [[Tara Strong]] as Roshan, a human infant<ref name=\"Strong Official\"/>\n\n==Production==\n=== Development ===\n''Ice Age'' was originally pitched to [[20th Century Fox]] in 1997 by producer Lori Forte. The film, originally envisioned as a [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] movie with an action-oriented [[comedy-drama]] tone, was intended to be developed by [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]]'s [[Fox Animation Studios]]. Around the same time, [[Blue Sky Studios]], a small [[visual effects]] studio in [[White Plains, New York]], was bought out by Fox and reshaped into a full-fledged [[computer animation|CG animation]] film studio. In light of this, [[20th Century Fox Animation|Fox Animation]] head [[Chris Meledandri]] and executive producer Steve Bannerman approached Forte with the proposition of developing the film as a computer-animated movie, which Forte realized was \"basically a no-brainer,\" according to her. [[Michael J. Wilson]], who had written and developed the film's original story treatments in conjunction with Forte, wrote the first draft for the script, and [[Chris Wedge]], a co-founder of Blue Sky, was brought on to the project as the director in late 1998. Fox also opted for the movie to take a more comedy-oriented direction (albeit while still maintaining some dramatic elements),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/animationworld/coming-out-ice-age |title=Coming Out of the Ice Age |first=John C. |last=Donkin |work=[[Animation World Network]] |date=March 12, 2002 |accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> and brought writer [[Michael Berg (screenwriter)|Michael Berg]] to help emphasize a funnier tone. After being hired, Berg reportedly told the studio that he couldn't write a kid's film, to which the studio responded \"Great!

Wilson stated on his blog that his daughter Flora came up with the idea for an animal that was a mixture of both squirrel and rat, naming it Scrat, and that the animal was obsessed with pursuing his acorn.<ref>[http://sootheatrenews.blogspot.com/2009/11/ice-age-story-behind-story-from-writer.html?m=1 Ice Age: The Story Behind the Story (from the writer Michael J. Wilson)], News from the Soo Theatre, Inc. Retrieved April 2nd, 2017.</ref> The plan to have Scrat talk was quickly dropped, as he worked better as a silent character for comedic effect. The name 'Scrat' is a combination of the words 'squirrel' and 'rat', as Scrat has characteristics of both species; Wedge has also called him \"saber-toothed squirrel.\" Scrat's opening adventure was inserted because, without it, the first real snow and ice sequence wouldn't take place until about 37 minutes into the film. This was the only role intended for Scrat, but he proved to be such a popular character with test audiences that he was given more scenes. The filmmakers made it so that many of the scenes with Scrat appear directly after dramatic moments in the film.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with [[Jay Leno]], [[Denis Leary]] revealed that his character, Diego the sabertooth, originally died near the end of the film. However, it was reported that kids in the test audience bursted into tears when his death was shown. Leary himself warned the producers that something like this would happen. When it was proven true, the scene was re-written to ensure Diego survived.\n\nOriginally, Sid the Sloth was supposed to be a con-artist and a hustler, and there was even finished scene of the character conning some aardvark kids. His character was later changed to a talkative-clumsy sloth because the team felt the audience would have hated him. There was also an alternate scene of Sid in the hottub with the ladies which shows him saying to them \"Let's jump in the gene pool and see what happens.\" One of the female sloths then kicks him in the groin. This was cut because it was not suitable for children and may have gotten the film a PG-13 rating. Other innuendos with Sid were also cut from the film. Sid was also supposed to have a female sloth named Sylvia (voiced by Kristen Johnston) chasing after him, whom he despised and kept ditching. All the removed scenes can be seen on the DVD.\n\n=== Animation ===\nThe characters and environments in ''Ice Age'' were modeled and animated using WaveFront's [[Maya (software)|Maya]] animation software. Rendering was completed using CGI Studio, an in-house [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] program being developed since Blue Sky's formation in 1987 and previously used for Wedge's 1998 short film, ''[[Bunny (short)|Bunny]]''. While ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'', released three months before ''Ice Age'', became the first computer-animated film to make use of ray tracing technology, ''Ice Age'' would have received the distinction had it been released at the time Blue Sky began work on the movie.<ref name=\"Ice Pack\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/03/12/john_leguizamo_ice_age_interview.shtml|title=BBC - Films - interview - John Leguizamo|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Voice casting ===\nThe voice cast of ''Ice Age'' was encouraged to [[Improvisation|make up their own dialogue]] during recording.
