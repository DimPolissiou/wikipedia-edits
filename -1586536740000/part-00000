(season 7)|seventh season]] of ''[[American Dad!]]''.  It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on January 16, 2011. The episode follows housewife [[Francine Smith|Francine]] as she becomes frustrated and bored with her daily routine of taking care of her family. But when Roger accidentally passes lethal gas in the house, the family moves into a luxury hotel for a week. While there, Francine decides to assume the identity and life of a familyless career woman, the CEO of a concrete company.\n\nThe episode was written by Chris and Matt McKenna, and directed by Rodney Clouden. It received mixed reception among television critics upon its release, with many going on to criticize the main storyline. It was viewed by 3.58 million homes upon its original airing. The episode features guest appearances from [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Will Forte]], [[Richard Gant]], [[Missi Pyle]], [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[J.K. Simmons]], and [[Alan Tudyk]].\n\n==Plot==\nFrancine's daily routine starts to get to her when the family complains about dinner being prepared with the wrong vegetable (okra). She imagines herself killing the family in revenge; after Francine threatens them, they agree to eat the dinner anyway. Roger warns the family that he will have a bad reaction to the okra but eats it at Stan's urging. He farts a lethal gas during the middle of the night, prompting the family to leave their residence and stay at a hotel for a week. Discovering that she has never taken the time to get in touch with herself, Francine decides to spend the day assuming the identity of a recently deceased concrete saleswoman, Sarah Blanch. At the work convention in the hotel, Francine becomes more and more impressed with the exciting life she has fabricated for Sarah and fully assumes her identity, demonstrating business prowess that lands her a [[CEO]] job in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Francine decides to give up her former life and her family to pursue a new life as Sarah.\n\nMeanwhile, at the hotel, Steve becomes drawn to a [[Patrick Nagel]] painting of a woman and the concierge, [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], explains that the portrait was painted in 1981 at the hotel. Steve is disappointed that he cannot meet the woman in the portrait, but H\u00e9ctor tells him that if he uses the power of his mind, [[Somewhere in Time (film)|he can will himself to travel back in time to meet his dream girl]]. He successfully travels through time and meets Nagel.  However, Nagel drugs his champagne. He awakens naked on the bed and sees the painting of the woman.  Nagel explains that he painted Steve, revealing that [[Predestination paradox|Steve himself is the woman in the painting]] and the shock returns him to his own time. The concierge then asks Steve if the woman in the painting was him (Steve). Steve then asks how he knows and the concierge reveals that he once fell in love, a painting of him as a woman is then shown.\n\nTen years in the future, after having accepted the CEO position, Francine is a successful but lonely old woman. On her way to another convention, she visits her old house and sees that Stan and Steve have moved on with their lives (Stan having married another woman). She returns to the hotel for another convention and admits to H\u00e9ctor that she regrets her decision to change her life and abandon her family. H\u00e9ctor tells her that with the power of her mind she can also travel back in time and stop herself. She does so and arrives in the present, telling present-Francine not to accept the job and convincing her to stay with her current life with her family.

In the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]], James Talbot's estate was confiscated because he was a Catholic and he was granted an estate in 1655 at Castle Rubey, County Roscommon instead. He died in 1687. Talbot's land in Killynaff was distributed as follows-\n\nJohn Blachford obtained Killynaff after the Cromwellian settlement.

He was born in 1598 in Ashmore, Dorset, England, the son of Richard and Frances Blachford. He became a merchant in Dorchester, Dorset but fled to France in 1633 when facing a warrant from the Exchequer for not paying customs.

This produces the best quality output, but introduces some implementation complexity and the range of the output is unlikely to match the desired application; converting to the desired range requires an additional multiplication.\n\nUsing a modulus ''m'' which is a [[power of two]] makes for a particularly convenient computer implementation, but comes at a cost: the period is at most ''m''/4, and the low bits have periods shorter than that.  This is because the low ''k'' bits form a modulo-2{{sup|''k''}} generator all by themselves; the higher-order bits never affect lower-order bits.<ref>{{TAOCP|volume=2|edition=2|pages=12\u201314}}</ref>  The values ''X{{sub|i}}'' are always odd (bit 0 never changes), bits 2 and 1 alternate (the low 3 bits repeat with a period of 2), the low 4 bits repeat with a period of 4, and so on.  Therefore, the application using these random numbers ''must'' use the most significant bits; reducing to a smaller range using a modulo operation with an even modulus will produce disastrous results.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Fast Generation of High-Quality Pseudorandom Numbers and Permutations Using MPI and OpenMP on the Cray XD1 |first1=Stephen |last=Bique |first2=Robert |last2=Rosenberg |date=May 2009 |conference=Cray User Group 2009 |url=https://cug.org/5-publications/proceedings_attendee_lists/CUG09CD/S09_Proceedings/pages/authors/06-10Tuesday/8A-Bique/Bique.htm |quote=The die is determined using modular arithmetic, e.g., <code>lrand48() % 6 + 1,</code>...

For example, a modulus of [[Fermat number|F{{sub|5}}]] = 2{{sup|32}}+1 might seem attractive, as the outputs can be easily mapped to a 32-bit word 0 \u2264 ''X{{sub|i}}''\u22121 &lt; 2{{sup|32}}.  However, a seed of ''X''{{sub|0}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;6700417 (which divides 2{{sup|32}}+1) or any multiple would lead to an output with a period of only 640.\n\nA more popular implementation for large periods is a [[combined linear congruential generator]]; combining (e.g. by summing their outputs) several generators is equivalent to the output of a single generator whose modulus is the product of the component generators' moduli.<ref name=mcomp91>{{cite journal\n |title=Structural Properties for Two Classes of Combined Random Number Generators\n |first1=Pierre |last1=L'Ecuyer |first2=Shu |last2=Tezuka\n |journal=Mathematics of Computation |volume=57 |issue=196 |date=October 1991 |pages=735\u2013746\n |doi=10.2307/2938714\n}}</ref> and whose period is the [[least common multiple]] of the component periods.  Although the periods will share a [[common divisor]] of 2, the moduli can be chosen so that is the only common divisor and the resultant period is (''m''{{sub|1}}\u22121)(''m''{{sub|2}}\u22121)(''m''{{sub|2}}\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(''m{{sub|k}}''\u22121)/2{{sup|''k''\u22121}}.{{r|cacm88|p=744}}  One example of this is the [[Wichmann\u2013Hill]] generator.\n\n== Relation to LCG ==\n\nWhile the Lehmer RNG can be viewed as a particular case of the [[linear congruential generator]] with {{gaps|''c''|{{=}}|0}}, it is a special case that implies certain restrictions and properties. In particular, for the Lehmer RNG, the initial seed ''X''{{sub|0}} must be [[coprime]] to the modulus ''m'' that is not required for LCGs in general. The choice of the modulus ''m'' and the multiplier ''a'' is also more restrictive for the Lehmer RNG. In contrast to LCG, the maximum period of the Lehmer RNG equals ''m''\u22121 and it is such when ''m'' is prime and ''a'' is a primitive root modulo ''m''.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[discrete logarithm]]s (to base ''a'' or any primitive root modulo ''m'') of ''X{{sub|k}}'' in <math>\\mathbb{Z}_m</math> represent a linear congruential sequence modulo the [[Euler totient]] <math>\\varphi(m)</math>.\n\n== Implementation ==\n\nA prime modulus requires the computation of a double-width product and an explicit reduction step.  If a modulus just less than a power of 2 is used (the [[Mersenne prime]]s 2<sup>31</sup>\u22121 and 2<sup>61</sup>\u22121 are popular, as are 2<sup>32</sup>\u22125 and 2<sup>64</sup>\u221259), reduction modulo {{nobr|1=''m'' = 2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2212 ''d''}} can be implemented more cheaply than a general double-width division using the identity {{nobr|2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2261 ''d'' (mod ''m'')}}.\n\nThe basic reduction step divides the product into two ''e''-bit parts, multiplies the high part by ''d'', and adds them: {{nobr|(''ax'' mod 2<sup>''e''</sup>) + ''d''&thinsp;{{floor|''ax''/2<sup>''e''</sup>}}}}.  This can  be followed by subtracting ''m'' until the result is in range.  The number of subtractions is limited to ''ad''/''m'', which can be easily limited to one if ''d'' is small and {{nobr|''a'' &lt; ''m''/''d''}} is chosen.  (This condition also ensures that ''d''&thinsp;{{floor|''ax''/2<sup>''e''</sup>}} is a single-width product; if it is violated, a double-width product must be computed.)\n\nWhen the modulus is a Mersenne prime (''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), the procedure is particularly simple.  Not only is multiplication by ''d'' trivial, but the [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional]] subtraction can be replaced by an unconditional shift and addition.  To see this, note that the algorithm guarantees that {{nobr|''x'' \u2262 0 (mod m)}}, meaning that x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and x&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'' are both impossible.  This avoids the need to consider equivalent ''e''-bit representations of the state; only values where the high bits are non-zero need reduction.\n\nThe low ''e'' bits of the product ''ax'' cannot represent a value larger than ''m'', and the high bits will never hold a value greater than ''a''\u22121&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;m\u22122.  Thus, the first reduction step produces a value at most ''m''+''a''\u22121 \u2264 2''m''\u22122 = 2<sup>''e''+1</sup>\u22124.  This is an ''e''+1-bit number which can be greater than ''m'' (i.e. might have bit ''e'' set), but the high half is at most 1, and if it is, the low ''e'' bits will be strictly less than ''m''.  Thus, whether the high bit is 1 or 0, a second reduction step (addition of the halves) will never overflow ''e'' bits and the sum will be the desired value.\n\nIf ''d''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1, conditional subtraction can also be avoided, but the procedure is more intricate.  The fundamental challenge of a modulus like 2<sup>32</sup>\u22125 lies in ensuring that we produce only one representation for values such as 1&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;2<sup>32</sup>\u22124.  The solution is to temporarily add ''d'' so that the range of possible values is ''d'' through 2<sup>''e''</sup>\u22121, and reduce values larger than ''e'' bits in a way that never generates representations less than ''d''.  Finally subtracting the temporary offset produces the desired value.\n\nBegin by assuming that we have a partially reduced value ''y'' which is bounded so 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&lt; 2''m'' =&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup>\u22122''d''.  In this case, a single offset subtraction step will produce 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''{{prime|y}}''  {{nobr|{{=}} ((''y''+''d'') mod 2<sup>''e''</sup>) + ''d''&thinsp;{{floor|(''y''+''d'')/2<sup>''e''</sup>}} \u2212 ''d''}} &lt;&nbsp;''m''.  To see this, consider two cases:\n; 0 \u2264 ''y'' &lt; ''m'' = 2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2212 ''d''\n: In this case, ''y'' + ''d'' &lt; 2<sup>''e''</sup> and ''{{prime|y}}''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', as desired.\n; ''m'' \u2264 ''y'' &lt; 2''m''\n: In this case, 2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2264&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d'' &lt;&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup> is an ''e''+1-bit number, and {{floor|(''y''+''d'')/2<sup>''e''</sup>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.  Thus, ''{{prime|y}}''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''y''+''d'')&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;+''d''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d'' =&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d'' =&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', as desired.  Because the multiplied high part is ''d'', the sum is at least ''d'' and subtracting the offset never causes underflow.\n\n(For the case of a Lehmer generator specifically, a zero state or its image ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'' will never occur, so an offset of ''d''\u22121 will work just the same, if that is more convenient.  This reduces the offset to 0 in the Mersenne prime case, when ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.)\n\nReducing a larger product ''ax'' to less than 2''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2''d'' can be done by one or more reduction steps without an offset.\n\nIf ''ad''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''m'', then one additional reduction step suffices.  Since ''x''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', ''ax''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''am'' \u2264&nbsp;(''a''\u22121)2<sup>''e''</sup>, and one reduction step converts this to at most 2<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''a''\u22121)''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''ad''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.  This is within the limit of 2''m'' if ''ad''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', which is the initial assumption.\n\nIf ''ad''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''m'', then it is possible for the first reduction step to produce a sum greater than 2''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup>\u22122''d'', which is too large for the final reduction step.  (It also requires the multiplication by ''d'' to produce a product larger than ''e'' bits, as mentioned above.)  However, as long as ''d''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2<sup>''e''</sup>,{{^|This bound is not exactly tight; it's more like a*d^2 < 2^2e}} the first reduction will produce a value in the range required for the preceding case of two reduction steps to apply.\n\n== Schrage's method ==\n\nIf a double-width product is not available, '''Schrage's method''',<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A More Portable Fortran Random Number Generator\n |first=Linus |last=Schrage\n |journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)\n |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=June 1979 |pages=132\u2013138 \n |doi=10.1145/355826.355828 |citeseerx=10.1.1.470.6958\n |url=http://degiorgi.math.hr/aaa_sem/Rand_Gen/p132-schrage.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title=Computer Systems Performance Analysis Chapter 26: Random-Number Generation\n |first=Raj |last=Jain |date=9 July 2010\n |pages=19\u201322\n |url=http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/iucee/ftp/k_26rng.pdf#page=19\n |accessdate=2017-10-31\n}}</ref> also called the approximate factoriation method,<ref name=toms91>{{cite journal\n |title=Implementing a random number package with splitting facilities\n |first=Pierre |last1=L'Ecuyer |first2=Serge |last2=C\u00f4t\u00e9\n |journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software |volume=17 |issue=1 |date=March 1991 |pages=98\u2013111\n |doi=10.1145/103147.103158\n}}  This explores several different implementations of modular multiplication by a constant.</ref> may be used to compute {{nobr|''ax'' mod ''m''}}, but this comes at the cost:\n* The modulus must be representable in a [[signed integer]]; arithmetic operations must allow a range of \u00b1''m''.\n* The choice of multiplier ''a'' is restricted.  We require that {{nobr|''m'' mod ''a'' \u2264 {{floor|''m''/''a''}}}}, commonly achieved by choosing ''a''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;{{sqrt|''m''}}.\n* One division (with remainder) per iteration is required.\n\nWhile this technique is popular for portable implementations in [[high-level language]]s which lack double-width operations,{{r|cacm88|p=744}} on modern computers [[Division algorithm#Division by a constant|division by a constant]] is usually implemented using double-width multiplication, so this technique should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.  Even in high-level languages, if the multiplier ''a'' is limited to {{sqrt|''m''}}, then the double-width product ''ax'' can be computed using two single-width multiplications, and reduced using the techniques described above.\n\nTo use Schrage's method, first factor {{nobr|1=''m'' = ''qa'' + ''r''}}, i.e. precompute the auxiliary constants {{nobr|1=''r'' = ''m'' mod ''a''}} and {{nobr|1=''q'' = {{floor|''m''/''a''}}}} = (''m''\u2212''r'')/''a''. Then, each iteration, compute {{nobr|''ax'' \u2261 ''a''(''x'' mod ''q'') \u2212 ''r''&thinsp;{{floor|''x''/''q''}} (mod ''m'')}}.\n\nThis equality holds because\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\naq &= a \\cdot (m - r) / a \\\\\n   &= (a / a) \\cdot (m - r) \\\\\n   &= (m - r) \\\\\n   &\\equiv -r \\pmod m \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nso if we factor ''x'' = (''x'' mod ''q'') + ''q''{{floor|''x''/''q''}}, we get:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nax &= a(x \\bmod q) + aq\\lfloor x/q \\rfloor \\\\\n   &= a(x \\bmod q) + (m-r)\\lfloor x/q \\rfloor \\\\\n   &\\equiv a(x \\bmod q) - r\\lfloor x/q \\rfloor \\pmod m \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe reason it does not overflow is that both terms are less than ''m''.  Since ''x''&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''q'' < ''q'' \u2264 ''m''/''a'', the first term is strictly less than ''am''/''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'' and may be computed with a single-width product.\n\nIf ''a'' is chosen so that ''r''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''q'' (and thus ''r''/''q''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;1), then the second term is also less than ''m'': ''r''&thinsp;{{floor|''x''/''q''}} \u2264 ''rx''/''q'' = ''x''(''r''/''q'') \u2264 ''x''(1) = ''x'' < ''m''. Thus, the difference lies in the range [1\u2212''m'',&nbsp;''m''\u22121] and can be reduced to [0,&nbsp;''m''\u22121] with a single conditional add.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Schrage's Method\n |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~pfenerty/pi/schrages_method.html\n |first=Paul |last=Fenerty |date=11 September 2006\n |accessdate=2017-10-31\n}}</ref>\n\nThis technique may be extended to allow a negative ''r'' (\u2212''q''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0), changing the final reduction to a conditional subtract.\n\nThe technique may also be extended to allow larger ''a'' by applying it recursively.{{r|toms91|p=102}}  Of the two terms subtracted to produce the final result, only the second (''r''&thinsp;{{floor|''x''/''q''}}) risks overflow.  But this is itself a modular multiplication by a [[Constant folding|compile-time constant]] ''r'', and may be implemented by the same technique.  Because each step, on average, halves the size of the multiplier (0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''a'', average value (''a''\u22121)/2), this would appear to require one step per bit and be spectacularly inefficient.  However, each step also divides ''x'' by an ever-increasing quotient {{nobr|1=''q'' = {{floor|''m''/''a''}}}}, and quickly a point is reached where the argument is 0 and the recursion may be terminated.\n\n== Sample C99 code ==\nUsing [[ISO C|C]] code, the Park-Miller RNG can be written as follows:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nuint32_t lcg_parkmiller(uint32_t *state)\n{\n\treturn *state = (uint64_t)*state * 48271 % 0x7fffffff;\n}\n</source>\nThis function can be called repeatedly to generate pseudorandom numbers, as long as the caller is careful to initialize the state to any number greater than zero and less than the modulus.  In this implementation, 64-bit arithmetic is required; otherwise, the product of two 32-bit integers may overflow.\n\nTo avoid the 64-bit division, do the reduction by hand:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nuint32_t lcg_parkmiller(uint32_t *state)\n{\n\tuint64_t product = (uint64_t)*state * 48271;\n\tuint32_t x = (product & 0x7fffffff) + (product >> 31);\n\n\tx = (x & 0x7fffffff) + (x >> 31);\n\treturn *state = x;\n}\n</source>\n\nTo use only 32-bit arithmetic, use Schrage's method:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nuint32_t lcg_parkmiller(uint32_t *state)\n{\n\t// Precomputed parameters for Schrage's method\n\tconst uint32_t M = 0x7fffffff;\n\tconst uint32_t A = 48271;\n\tconst uint32_t Q = M / A;    // 44488\n\tconst uint32_t R = M % A;    //  3399\n\n\tuint32_t div = *state / Q;\t// max: M / Q = A = 48,271\n\tuint32_t rem = *state % Q;\t// max: Q - 1     = 44,487\n\n\tint32_t s = rem * A;\t// max: 44,487 * 48,271 = 2,147,431,977 = 0x7fff3629\n\tint32_t t = div * R;\t// max: 48,271 *  3,399 =   164,073,129\n\tint32_t result = s - t;\n\n\tif (result < 0)\n\t\tresult += M;\n\n\treturn *state = result;\n}\n</source>\nor use two 16\u00d716-bit multiplies:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nuint32_t lcg_parkmiller(uint32_t *state)\n{\n\tconst uint32_t A = 48271;\n\n\tuint32_t low  = (*state & 0x7fff) * A;\t\t\t// max: 32,767 * 48,271 = 1,581,695,857 = 0x5e46c371\n\tuint32_t high = (*state >> 15)    * A;\t\t\t// max: 65,535 * 48,271 = 3,163,439,985 = 0xbc8e4371\n\tuint32_t x = low + ((high & 0xffff) << 15) + (high >> 16);\t// max: 0x5e46c371 + 0x7fff8000 + 0xbc8e = 0xde46ffff\n\n\tx = (x & 0x7fffffff) + (x >> 31);\n\treturn *state = x;\n}\n</source>\n\nAnother popular Lehmer generator uses the prime modulus 2{{sup|32}}\u22125:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nuint32_t lcg_rand(uint32_t *state)\n{\n    return *state = (uint64_t)*state * 279470273u % 0xfffffffb;\n}\n</source>\n\nThis can also be written without a 64-bit division:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nuint32_t lcg_rand(uint32_t *state)\n{\n\tuint64_t product = (uint64_t)*state * 279470273u;\n\tuint32_t x;\n\n\t// Not required because 5 * 279470273 = 0x5349e3c5 fits in 32 bits.\n\t// product = (product & 0xffffffff) + 5 * (product >> 32);\n\t// A multiplier larger than 0x33333333 = 858,993,459 would need it.\n\n\t// The multiply result fits into 32 bits, but the sum might be 33 bits.\n\tproduct = (product & 0xffffffff) + 5 * (uint32_t)(product >> 32);\n\n\tproduct += 4;\n\t// This sum is guaranteed to be 32 bits.\n\tx = (uint32_t)product + 5 * (uint32_t)(product >> 32);\n\treturn *state = x - 4;\n}\n</source>\n\nMany other Lehmer generators have good properties.

This produces the best quality output, but introduces some implementation complexity and the range of the output is unlikely to match the desired application; converting to the desired range requires an additional multiplication.\n\nUsing a modulus ''m'' which is a [[power of two]] makes for a particularly convenient computer implementation, but comes at a cost: the period is at most ''m''/4, and the low bits have periods shorter than that.  This is because the low ''k'' bits form a modulo-2{{sup|''k''}} generator all by themselves; the higher-order bits never affect lower-order bits.<ref>{{TAOCP|volume=2|edition=2|pages=12\u201314}}</ref>  The values ''X{{sub|i}}'' are always odd (bit 0 never changes), bits 2 and 1 alternate (the low 3 bits repeat with a period of 2), the low 4 bits repeat with a period of 4, and so on.  Therefore, the application using these random numbers ''must'' use the most significant bits; reducing to a smaller range using a modulo operation with an even modulus will produce disastrous results.<ref>{{cite conference |title=Fast Generation of High-Quality Pseudorandom Numbers and Permutations Using MPI and OpenMP on the Cray XD1 |first1=Stephen |last=Bique |first2=Robert |last2=Rosenberg |date=May 2009 |conference=Cray User Group 2009 |url=https://cug.org/5-publications/proceedings_attendee_lists/CUG09CD/S09_Proceedings/pages/authors/06-10Tuesday/8A-Bique/Bique.htm |quote=The die is determined using modular arithmetic, e.g., <code>lrand48() % 6 + 1,</code>...

For example, a modulus of [[Fermat number|F{{sub|5}}]] = 2{{sup|32}}+1 might seem attractive, as the outputs can be easily mapped to a 32-bit word 0 \u2264 ''X{{sub|i}}''\u22121 &lt; 2{{sup|32}}.  However, a seed of ''X''{{sub|0}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;6700417 (which divides 2{{sup|32}}+1) or any multiple would lead to an output with a period of only 640.\n\nA more popular implementation for large periods is a [[combined linear congruential generator]]; combining (e.g. by summing their outputs) several generators is equivalent to the output of a single generator whose modulus is the product of the component generators' moduli.<ref name=mcomp91>{{cite journal\n |title=Structural Properties for Two Classes of Combined Random Number Generators\n |first1=Pierre |last1=L'Ecuyer |first2=Shu |last2=Tezuka\n |journal=Mathematics of Computation |volume=57 |issue=196 |date=October 1991 |pages=735\u2013746\n |doi=10.2307/2938714\n}}</ref> and whose period is the [[least common multiple]] of the component periods.  Although the periods will share a [[common divisor]] of 2, the moduli can be chosen so that is the only common divisor and the resultant period is (''m''{{sub|1}}\u22121)(''m''{{sub|2}}\u22121)(''m''{{sub|2}}\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(''m{{sub|k}}''\u22121)/2{{sup|''k''\u22121}}.{{r|cacm88|p=744}}  One example of this is the [[Wichmann\u2013Hill]] generator.\n\n== Relation to LCG ==\n\nWhile the Lehmer RNG can be viewed as a particular case of the [[linear congruential generator]] with {{gaps|''c''|{{=}}|0}}, it is a special case that implies certain restrictions and properties. In particular, for the Lehmer RNG, the initial seed ''X''{{sub|0}} must be [[coprime]] to the modulus ''m'' that is not required for LCGs in general. The choice of the modulus ''m'' and the multiplier ''a'' is also more restrictive for the Lehmer RNG. In contrast to LCG, the maximum period of the Lehmer RNG equals ''m''\u22121 and it is such when ''m'' is prime and ''a'' is a primitive root modulo ''m''.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[discrete logarithm]]s (to base ''a'' or any primitive root modulo ''m'') of ''X{{sub|k}}'' in <math>\\mathbb{Z}_m</math> represent a linear congruential sequence modulo the [[Euler totient]] <math>\\varphi(m)</math>.\n\n== Implementation ==\n\nA prime modulus requires the computation of a double-width product and an explicit reduction step.  If a modulus just less than a power of 2 is used (the [[Mersenne prime]]s 2<sup>31</sup>\u22121 and 2<sup>61</sup>\u22121 are popular, as are 2<sup>32</sup>\u22125 and 2<sup>64</sup>\u221259), reduction modulo {{nobr|1=''m'' = 2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2212 ''d''}} can be implemented more cheaply than a general double-width division using the identity {{nobr|2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2261 ''d'' (mod ''m'')}}.\n\nThe basic reduction step divides the product into two ''e''-bit parts, multiplies the high part by ''d'', and adds them: {{nobr|(''ax'' mod 2<sup>''e''</sup>) + ''d''&thinsp;{{floor|''ax''/2<sup>''e''</sup>}}}}.  This can  be followed by subtracting ''m'' until the result is in range.  The number of subtractions is limited to ''ad''/''m'', which can be easily limited to one if ''d'' is small and {{nobr|''a'' &lt; ''m''/''d''}} is chosen.  (This condition also ensures that ''d''&thinsp;{{floor|''ax''/2<sup>''e''</sup>}} is a single-width product; if it is violated, a double-width product must be computed.)\n\nWhen the modulus is a Mersenne prime (''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), the procedure is particularly simple.  Not only is multiplication by ''d'' trivial, but the [[Conditional (computer programming)|conditional]] subtraction can be replaced by an unconditional shift and addition.  To see this, note that the algorithm guarantees that {{nobr|''x'' \u2262 0 (mod m)}}, meaning that x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and x&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'' are both impossible.  This avoids the need to consider equivalent ''e''-bit representations of the state; only values where the high bits are non-zero need reduction.\n\nThe low ''e'' bits of the product ''ax'' cannot represent a value larger than ''m'', and the high bits will never hold a value greater than ''a''\u22121&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;m\u22122.  Thus, the first reduction step produces a value at most ''m''+''a''\u22121 \u2264 2''m''\u22122 = 2<sup>''e''+1</sup>\u22124.  This is an ''e''+1-bit number which can be greater than ''m'' (i.e. might have bit ''e'' set), but the high half is at most 1, and if it is, the low ''e'' bits will be strictly less than ''m''.  Thus, whether the high bit is 1 or 0, a second reduction step (addition of the halves) will never overflow ''e'' bits and the sum will be the desired value.\n\nIf ''d''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1, conditional subtraction can also be avoided, but the procedure is more intricate.  The fundamental challenge of a modulus like 2<sup>32</sup>\u22125 lies in ensuring that we produce only one representation for values such as 1&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;2<sup>32</sup>\u22124.  The solution is to temporarily add ''d'' so that the range of possible values is ''d'' through 2<sup>''e''</sup>\u22121, and reduce values larger than ''e'' bits in a way that never generates representations less than ''d''.  Finally subtracting the temporary offset produces the desired value.\n\nBegin by assuming that we have a partially reduced value ''y'' which is bounded so 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&lt; 2''m'' =&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup>\u22122''d''.  In this case, a single offset subtraction step will produce 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''{{prime|y}}''  {{nobr|{{=}} ((''y''+''d'') mod 2<sup>''e''</sup>) + ''d''&thinsp;{{floor|(''y''+''d'')/2<sup>''e''</sup>}} \u2212 ''d''}} &lt;&nbsp;''m''.  To see this, consider two cases:\n; 0 \u2264 ''y'' &lt; ''m'' = 2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2212 ''d''\n: In this case, ''y'' + ''d'' &lt; 2<sup>''e''</sup> and ''{{prime|y}}''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', as desired.\n; ''m'' \u2264 ''y'' &lt; 2''m''\n: In this case, 2<sup>''e''</sup> \u2264&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d'' &lt;&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup> is an ''e''+1-bit number, and {{floor|(''y''+''d'')/2<sup>''e''</sup>}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.  Thus, ''{{prime|y}}''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''y''+''d'')&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;+''d''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d'' =&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d'' =&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', as desired.  Because the multiplied high part is ''d'', the sum is at least ''d'' and subtracting the offset never causes underflow.\n\n(For the case of a Lehmer generator specifically, a zero state or its image ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'' will never occur, so an offset of ''d''\u22121 will work just the same, if that is more convenient.  This reduces the offset to 0 in the Mersenne prime case, when ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.)\n\nReducing a larger product ''ax'' to less than 2''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2''d'' can be done by one or more reduction steps without an offset.\n\nIf ''ad''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''m'', then one additional reduction step suffices.  Since ''x''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', ''ax''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''am'' \u2264&nbsp;(''a''\u22121)2<sup>''e''</sup>, and one reduction step converts this to at most 2<sup>''e''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''a''\u22121)''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''ad''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.  This is within the limit of 2''m'' if ''ad''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''m'', which is the initial assumption.\n\nIf ''ad''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;''m'', then it is possible for the first reduction step to produce a sum greater than 2''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''e''+1</sup>\u22122''d'', which is too large for the final reduction step.  (It also requires the multiplication by ''d'' to produce a product larger than ''e'' bits, as mentioned above.)  However, as long as ''d''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2<sup>''e''</sup>,{{^|This bound is not exactly tight; it's more like a*d^2 < 2^2e}} the first reduction will produce a value in the range required for the preceding case of two reduction steps to apply.\n\n== Schrage's method ==\n\nIf a double-width product is not available, '''Schrage's method''',<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A More Portable Fortran Random Number Generator\n |first=Linus |last=Schrage\n |journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)\n |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=June 1979 |pages=132\u2013138 \n |doi=10.1145/355826.355828 |citeseerx=10.1.1.470.6958\n |url=http://degiorgi.math.hr/aaa_sem/Rand_Gen/p132-schrage.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title=Computer Systems Performance Analysis Chapter 26: Random-Number Generation\n |first=Raj |last=Jain |date=9 July 2010\n |pages=19\u201322\n |url=http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/iucee/ftp/k_26rng.pdf#page=19\n |accessdate=2017-10-31\n}}</ref> also called the approximate factoriation method,<ref name=toms91>{{cite journal\n |title=Implementing a random number package with splitting facilities\n |first=Pierre |last1=L'Ecuyer |first2=Serge |last2=C\u00f4t\u00e9\n |journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software |volume=17 |issue=1 |date=March 1991 |pages=98\u2013111\n |doi=10.1145/103147.103158\n}}  This explores several different implementations of modular multiplication by a constant.</ref> may be used to compute {{nobr|''ax'' mod ''m''}}, but this comes at the cost:\n* The modulus must be representable in a [[signed integer]]; arithmetic operations must allow a range of \u00b1''m''.\n* The choice of multiplier ''a'' is restricted.  We require that {{nobr|''m'' mod ''a'' \u2264 {{floor|''m''/''a''}}}}, commonly achieved by choosing ''a''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;{{sqrt|''m''}}.\n* One division (with remainder) per iteration is required.\n\nWhile this technique is popular for portable implementations in [[high-level language]]s which lack double-width operations,{{r|cacm88|p=744}} on modern computers [[Division algorithm#Division by a constant|division by a constant]] is usually implemented using double-width multiplication, so this technique should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.  Even in high-level languages, if the multiplier ''a'' is limited to {{sqrt|''m''}}, then the double-width product ''ax'' can be computed using two single-width multiplications, and reduced using the techniques described above.\n\nTo use Schrage's method, first factor {{nobr|1=''m'' = ''qa'' + ''r''}}, i.e. precompute the auxiliary constants {{nobr|1=''r'' = ''m'' mod ''a''}} and {{nobr|1=''q'' = {{floor|''m''/''a''}}}} = (''m''\u2212''r'')/''a''. Then, each iteration, compute {{nobr|''ax'' \u2261 ''a''(''x'' mod ''q'') \u2212 ''r''&thinsp;{{floor|''x''/''q''}} (mod ''m'')}}.\n\nThis equality holds because\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\naq &= a \\cdot (m - r) / a \\\\\n   &= (a / a) \\cdot (m - r) \\\\\n   &= (m - r) \\\\\n   &\\equiv -r \\pmod m \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nso if we factor ''x'' = (''x'' mod ''q'') + ''q''{{floor|''x''/''q''}}, we get:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nax &= a(x \\bmod q) + aq\\lfloor x/q \\rfloor \\\\\n   &= a(x \\bmod q) + (m-r)\\lfloor x/q \\rfloor \\\\\n   &\\equiv a(x \\bmod q) - r\\lfloor x/q \\rfloor \\pmod m \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe reason it does not overflow is that both terms are less than ''m''.  Since ''x''&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''q'' < ''q'' \u2264 ''m''/''a'', the first term is strictly less than ''am''/''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'' and may be computed with a single-width product.\n\nIf ''a'' is chosen so that ''r''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''q'' (and thus ''r''/''q''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;1), then the second term is also less than ''m'': ''r''&thinsp;{{floor|''x''/''q''}} \u2264 ''rx''/''q'' = ''x''(''r''/''q'') \u2264 ''x''(1) = ''x'' < ''m''. Thus, the difference lies in the range [1\u2212''m'',&nbsp;''m''\u22121] and can be reduced to [0,&nbsp;''m''\u22121] with a single conditional add.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Schrage's Method\n |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~pfenerty/pi/schrages_method.html\n |first=Paul |last=Fenerty |date=11 September 2006\n |accessdate=2017-10-31\n}}</ref>\n\nThis technique may be extended to allow a negative ''r'' (\u2212''q''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;0), changing the final reduction to a conditional subtract.\n\nThe technique may also be extended to allow larger ''a'' by applying it recursively.{{r|toms91|p=102}}  Of the two terms subtracted to produce the final result, only the second (''r''&thinsp;{{floor|''x''/''q''}}) risks overflow.  But this is itself a modular multiplication by a [[Constant folding|compile-time constant]] ''r'', and may be implemented by the same technique.  Because each step, on average, halves the size of the multiplier (0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''a'', average value (''a''\u22121)/2), this would appear to require one step per bit and be spectacularly inefficient.  However, each step also divides ''x'' by an ever-increasing quotient {{nobr|1=''q'' = {{floor|''m''/''a''}}}}, and quickly a point is reached where the argument is 0 and the recursion may be terminated.\n\n== Sample C99 code ==\nUsing [[ISO C|C]] code, the Park-Miller RNG can be written as follows:\n<source lang=\"c\">\nuint32_t lcg_parkmiller(uint32_t *state)\n{\n\treturn *state = (uint64_t)*state * 48271 % 0x7fffffff;\n}\n</source>\nThis function can be called repeatedly to generate pseudorandom numbers, as long as the caller is careful to initialize the state to any number greater than zero and less than the modulus.

Dalbeattie is in a wooded valley on the [[Urr Water]] {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Castle Douglas]] and {{convert|19|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south west of [[Dumfries]]. The town is famed for its granite industry and for being the home town of [[William McMaster Murdoch]], the First Officer of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].\n\nThe Dalbeattie War Memorial was designed by [[Pilkington Jackson]] and was unveiled in 1921.\n\n==History==\n[[File:(General view, Dalbeattie, Scotland) (LOC) (3450350630).jpg|thumb|left|Dalbeattie, Scotland, ca. 1890 - 1900.]]\nThere are indications from Court Records that a settlement existed on the site as early as 1658 and it is further mentioned in 1747. There is also evidence from Presbytery Records which indicate there was a School Master in Dalbeattie in 1751.\n\nThe formal beginnings of Dalbeattie originate in 1781 when George Maxwell of Munches and Alexander Copeland of Kingsgrange (or Colliston) decided to encourage the development of the town by [[Feu (land tenure)|feuing]] their property. The Maxwells owned the land on the north side of the [[river|burn]] and the Copelands owned the land on the south side. Every feu consisted of a piece of land, fronting a street, large enough to build a house and grow vegetables and keep chickens and pigs. Each feu also had the right to cut [[Peat|turves]] (peat) from Aucheninnes Moss. This was important as fuel was scarce in Galloway, coal was expensive and there were very few trees. The feu duties brought in an income for the landowners and gave security for the tenants.\n\nThe building of the bridge over the River Urr at Craignair in 1797 and the rapid expansion of the granite industry in Dalbeattie attracted more people to settle in the town. By 1810 work in the quarries was plentiful, and over the next 30 years a lot of tradespeople settled and founded businesses in Dalbeattie. However, the expanded population brought other problems, high incidents of sickness, including cholera and typhoid, and law-and-order issues.\n\nThe town today has a greatly reduced industry, and most residents commute to the nearby town of [[Dumfries]] for employment. The town is frequented by tourists as its position is well situated for access to the [[Solway Firth|Solway coast]].\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Andrew Carruthers|Bishop Andrew Carruthers]], (1770-1852) was a priest and horticulturist and builder of St Peter's Church. On 29 June 2014 it celebrated its 200th anniversary. \n* [[Murray Grierson]] is a retired rally driver who won the [[Scottish Rally Championship]] in 1987 using an Opel Kadett 400 and again in 1993 using a [[MG Metro 6R4]]. He also won numerous British National Championship rallies, finishing runner-up in the Championship in 1988 in an Opel Kadett 400 and again in 1997 and 1998, when he used a [[Subaru Impreza 555]]. Latterly, he was often seen on rounds of the [[World Rally Championship]] doing gravel notes for [[Colin McRae]] and [[Alister McRae]].\n* [[Alister Jack]] (born 7 July 1963) is a Scottish politician serving as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] since 2019. Raised in Dalbeattie and Kippford.\n* [[John Keats]] and his friend [[Charles Armitage Brown]] stayed at an inn here  on their walking tour of Scotland in 1818.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Walking North With Keats|last=Walker|first=Carol Kyros|publisher=Yale University|year=1992|isbn=0 300 04824 6|location=New Haven and London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/walkingnorthwith0000walk/page/236 236\u2013237]|url=https://archive.org/details/walkingnorthwith0000walk/page/236}}</ref>\n* [[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]] (1905-1962) artist born in the town and later travelled around Europe, he exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1935.\n* [[Jimmy McKinnell (footballer)|Jimmy McKinnell]] was a professional footballer who played for [[Dumfries]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.]] and [[Blackburn Rovers]]\n* [[William McMaster Murdoch]] was born and raised in Dalbeattie and is by far the town's most famous resident. He served as First Officer of the {{RMS|Titanic}} and died when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. A memorial to Murdoch was placed in the town hall. A charitable prize in his name was established in 1997 after a donation by film director [[James Cameron]]. Residents of the town had complained about Cameron's depiction of Murdoch in the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.\n* [[Ian Simpson (motorcycle racer)|Ian Simpson]] a retired motorcycle racer who won the 1994 [[British Superbike Championship]] as well as 3 [[Isle of Man TT]] and 5 [[North West 200]] races.\n* [[Jim Steel (footballer)|Jim Steel]] had a successful career as a footballer playing in England's lower divisions with [[Oldham Athletic]], [[Wigan Athletic]], [[Wrexham A.F.C.]], [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] and [[Tranmere Rovers]].<ref name = \"js\">{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=367 |title=Jim Steel full career profile |publisher=Qosfc.com |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}</ref>\n* [[John Menzies Strain|Archbishop John Menzies Strain]] (1770-1852) in the town for twenty-three years before becoming the first Archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh in 1878.\n* [[Andrew Swann (footballer)|Andrew Swann]] (1878- ''unknown'') professional footballer\n* Fr [[George Thompson (Scottish National Party politician)|George Thompson]] (1928-2016) parish priest, 1993-2005 of St Peter's,  teacher and former MP for Galloway.\n*David Rae, artist born 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://davidraeart.com/|title=Home|website=David Rae Art|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newbloodart.com/artist/david-rae|title=Rae David {{!}} New Blood Art|website=newbloodart.com|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe town is under the management of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] council and is located in the Abbey ward. The town is in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] constituency of [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] and currently represent by [[Alister Jack]]. In the Scottish Parliament the town is within the [[Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Galloway and Upper Nithsdale]] constituency and the [[South of Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|South of Scotland]] region and was represented by [[Alex Fergusson (MSP)|Alex Fergusson]].\n\n==Geography==\nDalbeattie is situated in the Urr valley of which most of the east side is covered by forest. The [[River Urr]] flows from the north southwards to the [[Solway Firth]] and passes by the west side of the town. The town has an abundance of distinctive grey granite.\n\n==Economy==\n===Granite Quarrying===\n[[File:Dalbeattie, Craignair Quarry.jpg|thumb|Craignair quarry is a notable town landmark]]\n[[File:Intriguing sculpture in Colliston Park - geograph.org.uk - 211770.jpg|thumb|Sculpture in [[Colliston Park]] commemorating Dalbeattie's heritage as a producer of the quality [[granite]] which has been used in major construction projects worldwide]]\n\nFormerly [[granite]] quarrying was an important part of the Dalbeattie economy. The most prominent of which is the characteristic Craignair quarry which is clearly visible to the west of the town. Dalbeattie Granite works was established in 1820 and was situated in Craignair Street, following a direct route from Craignair quarry. The industry died down locally around 1883 due to cheaper imports from [[Denmark]].\n\nMany of the workers emigrated to other parts of the world in order to find work, a number emigrated to the United States to work at a sister quarry in [[Westerly, Rhode Island]]. Granite exported from Dalbeattie went into the Mersey Docks in [[Liverpool]], the Thames Embankment in London, various British lighthouses, even as far as the lighthouse at the southern tip of Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]).<ref>{{cite book|editor=Francis Groome|title=Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory348.html|year=1885|publisher=Grange Publishing}}</ref> Its most famous use was probably the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] in southern England.\n\nDalbeattie is credited with developing the technique of polishing granite stone to form a shiny surface. This technique was exported throughout the world by the skilled workers of Dalbeattie as they travelled.\n\n===Modern Day===\nThe town has a sawmill \"Howie Forest Products\", which employs around 120 people, and a souvenir factory.\n\nMost of the residents commute to nearby [[Dumfries]] for employment.\n\n==Transport==\nThe town is accessible by roads from Dumfries, Castle Douglas, and is on the [[Solway Coast|Solway]] coastal road.

Dalbeattie is in a wooded valley on the [[Urr Water]] {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Castle Douglas]] and {{convert|19|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south west of [[Dumfries]]. The town is famed for its granite industry and for being the home town of [[William McMaster Murdoch]], the First Officer of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']].\n\nThe Dalbeattie War Memorial was designed by [[Pilkington Jackson]] and was unveiled in 1921.\n\n==History==\n[[File:(General view, Dalbeattie, Scotland) (LOC) (3450350630).jpg|thumb|left|Dalbeattie, Scotland, ca. 1890 - 1900.]]\nThere are indications from Court Records that a settlement existed on the site as early as 1658 and it is further mentioned in 1747. There is also evidence from Presbytery Records which indicate there was a School Master in Dalbeattie in 1751.\n\nThe formal beginnings of Dalbeattie originate in 1781 when George Maxwell of Munches and Alexander Copeland of Kingsgrange (or Colliston) decided to encourage the development of the town by [[Feu (land tenure)|feuing]] their property. The Maxwells owned the land on the north side of the [[river|burn]] and the Copelands owned the land on the south side. Every feu consisted of a piece of land, fronting a street, large enough to build a house and grow vegetables and keep chickens and pigs. Each feu also had the right to cut [[Peat|turves]] (peat) from Aucheninnes Moss. This was important as fuel was scarce in Galloway, coal was expensive and there were very few trees. The feu duties brought in an income for the landowners and gave security for the tenants.\n\nThe building of the bridge over the River Urr at Craignair in 1797 and the rapid expansion of the granite industry in Dalbeattie attracted more people to settle in the town. By 1810 work in the quarries was plentiful, and over the next 30 years a lot of tradespeople settled and founded businesses in Dalbeattie. However, the expanded population brought other problems, high incidents of sickness, including cholera and typhoid, and law-and-order issues.\n\nThe town today has a greatly reduced industry, and most residents commute to the nearby town of [[Dumfries]] for employment. The town is frequented by tourists as its position is well situated for access to the [[Solway Firth|Solway coast]].\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Andrew Carruthers|Bishop Andrew Carruthers]], (1770-1852) was a priest and horticulturist and builder of St Peter's Church. On 29 June 2014 it celebrated its 200th anniversary. \n* [[Murray Grierson]] is a retired rally driver who won the [[Scottish Rally Championship]] in 1987 using an Opel Kadett 400 and again in 1993 using a [[MG Metro 6R4]]. He also won numerous British National Championship rallies, finishing runner-up in the Championship in 1988 in an Opel Kadett 400 and again in 1997 and 1998, when he used a [[Subaru Impreza 555]]. Latterly, he was often seen on rounds of the [[World Rally Championship]] doing gravel notes for [[Colin McRae]] and [[Alister McRae]].\n* [[Alister Jack]] (born 7 July 1963) is a Scottish politician serving as [[Secretary of State for Scotland]] since 2019. Raised in Dalbeattie and Kippford.\n* [[John Keats]] and his friend [[Charles Armitage Brown]] stayed at an inn here  on their walking tour of Scotland in 1818.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Walking North With Keats|last=Walker|first=Carol Kyros|publisher=Yale University|year=1992|isbn=0 300 04824 6|location=New Haven and London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/walkingnorthwith0000walk/page/236 236\u2013237]|url=https://archive.org/details/walkingnorthwith0000walk/page/236}}</ref>\n* [[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]] (1905-1962) artist born in the town and later travelled around Europe, he exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1935.\n* [[Jimmy McKinnell (footballer)|Jimmy McKinnell]] was a professional footballer who played for [[Dumfries]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.]] and [[Blackburn Rovers]]\n* [[William McMaster Murdoch]] was born and raised in Dalbeattie and is by far the town's most famous resident. He served as First Officer of the {{RMS|Titanic}} and died when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. A memorial to Murdoch was placed in the town hall. A charitable prize in his name was established in 1997 after a donation by film director [[James Cameron]]. Residents of the town had complained about Cameron's depiction of Murdoch in the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]''.\n* [[Ian Simpson (motorcycle racer)|Ian Simpson]] a retired motorcycle racer who won the 1994 [[British Superbike Championship]] as well as 3 [[Isle of Man TT]] and 5 [[North West 200]] races.\n* [[Jim Steel (footballer)|Jim Steel]] had a successful career as a footballer playing in England's lower divisions with [[Oldham Athletic]], [[Wigan Athletic]], [[Wrexham A.F.C.]], [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] and [[Tranmere Rovers]].<ref name = \"js\">{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=367 |title=Jim Steel full career profile |publisher=Qosfc.com |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}</ref>\n* [[John Menzies Strain|Archbishop John Menzies Strain]] (1770-1852) in the town for twenty-three years before becoming the first Archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh in 1878.\n* [[Andrew Swann (footballer)|Andrew Swann]] (1878- ''unknown'') professional footballer\n* Fr [[George Thompson (Scottish National Party politician)|George Thompson]] (1928-2016) parish priest, 1993-2005 of St Peter's,  teacher and former MP for Galloway.\n*David Rae, artist born 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://davidraeart.com/|title=Home|website=David Rae Art|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newbloodart.com/artist/david-rae|title=Rae David {{!}} New Blood Art|website=newbloodart.com|access-date=2020-02-02}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\nThe town is under the management of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] council and is located in the Abbey ward. The town is in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] constituency of [[Dumfries and Galloway (UK Parliament constituency)|Dumfries and Galloway]] and currently represent by [[Alister Jack]]. In the Scottish Parliament the town is within the [[Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Galloway and Upper Nithsdale]] constituency and the [[South of Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|South of Scotland]] region and was represented by [[Alex Fergusson (MSP)|Alex Fergusson]].\n\n==Geography==\nDalbeattie is situated in the Urr valley of which most of the east side is covered by forest. The [[River Urr]] flows from the north southwards to the [[Solway Firth]] and passes by the west side of the town. The town has an abundance of distinctive grey granite.\n\n==Economy==\n===Granite Quarrying===\n[[File:Dalbeattie, Craignair Quarry.jpg|thumb|Craignair quarry is a notable town landmark]]\n[[File:Intriguing sculpture in Colliston Park - geograph.org.uk - 211770.jpg|thumb|Sculpture in [[Colliston Park]] commemorating Dalbeattie's heritage as a producer of the quality [[granite]] which has been used in major construction projects worldwide]]\n\nFormerly [[granite]] quarrying was an important part of the Dalbeattie economy. The most prominent of which is the characteristic Craignair quarry which is clearly visible to the west of the town. Dalbeattie Granite works was established in 1820 and was situated in Craignair Street, following a direct route from Craignair quarry. The industry died down locally around 1883 due to cheaper imports from [[Denmark]].\n\nMany of the workers emigrated to other parts of the world in order to find work, a number emigrated to the United States to work at a sister quarry in [[Westerly, Rhode Island]]. Granite exported from Dalbeattie went into the Mersey Docks in [[Liverpool]], the Thames Embankment in London, various British lighthouses, even as far as the lighthouse at the southern tip of Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]).<ref>{{cite book|editor=Francis Groome|title=Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/towns/townhistory348.html|year=1885|publisher=Grange Publishing}}</ref> Its most famous use was probably the [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] in southern England.\n\nDalbeattie is credited with developing the technique of polishing granite stone to form a shiny surface. This technique was exported throughout the world by the skilled workers of Dalbeattie as they travelled.\n\n===Modern Day===\nThe town has a sawmill \"Howie Forest Products\", which employs around 120 people, and a souvenir factory.\n\nMost of the residents commute to nearby [[Dumfries]] for employment.\n\n==Transport==\nThe town is accessible by roads from Dumfries, Castle Douglas, and is on the [[Solway Coast|Solway]] coastal road. A regular bus service based in Dumfries travels though Dalbeattie and Castle Douglas to the west of the region and back. The town also acts as a minor hub for bus routes across the Solway coast. The town previously had access to the [[Rail transport in Great Britain|rail network]]; however, this was removed in the 1960s as it was deemed unprofitable.\n\n==Museums and Galleries==\nDalbeattie has a museum<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dalbeattiemuseum.co.uk/|title=Dalbeattie Museum - Dalbeattie Museum|website=www.dalbeattiemuseum.co.uk}}</ref> devoted to the history of the town and surrounding area.

Shiva rescued Sugriva from his brother Vaali because Sugriva could not compete with Vaali in a fight. Sugriva prayed to Lord Shiva who turned Sugriva to a swan and kept him above the 'Vilva' tree, so Vaali could not find him. It is believed Lord Rama searching for Sita came here with Hanuman and Sugriva and prayed here which gives an additional tribute to this temple.\n\n==The Temple==\nThe temple is located 12&nbsp;km away from [[Kumbakonam]] on the [[Kumbakonam]]- [[Mayiladuthurai]] road.

She sounds panicked and screams about her brother Anto\u00f1ito, and something \"coming to get him\", before the call cuts off.\n\nThe film then goes back in time three days. Ver\u00f3nica is a 15-year-old girl living with her mother and three siblings in an apartment in the [[working-class]] district of [[Puente de Vallecas|Vallecas]], [[Madrid]]. Their father died recently and their mother works long hours at a bar to support the family, leaving Ver\u00f3nica in charge of her younger siblings: twins Lucia and Irene, and Anto\u00f1ito. On the day of the [[Solar eclipse of July 11, 1991|solar eclipse]], her teacher explains how some ancient cultures used eclipses to stage [[human sacrifice]]s and summon dark spirits.\n\nWhile the school gathers on the roof to view the eclipse, Ver\u00f3nica, her friend Rosa, and their classmate Diana go into the basement to conduct a [[s\u00e9ance]] using an [[Ouija board]]. Ver\u00f3nica wants to reach out to her late father, and Diana wants to reach out to her late boyfriend, who died in a motorcycle accident. The board responds right away but Rosa and Diana pull their hands back when the glass cup becomes too hot to touch. Ver\u00f3nica's hand remains on it, and at the moment of the eclipse, the cup shatters, cutting her finger and dripping blood onto the board. Ver\u00f3nica becomes unresponsive, whispering something repeatedly that Rosa leans in to hear, and suddenly lets out a demonic scream. After passing out, she wakes in the school nurse's office, who tells her she probably passed out from [[iron deficiency]].\n\nVer\u00f3nica begins experiencing paranormal occurrences. She is unable to eat her dinner, as if an invisible hand is preventing her. Claw and bite marks appear on her body and she hears strange noises. Her friends begin avoiding her. Looking for answers, she goes back to the school basement and finds the school's elderly blind [[nun]] whom the students call \"Sister Death.\" The nun scolds her for doing something so dangerous and explains that the s\u00e9ance attached a dark spirit to her; she needs to protect her siblings. The nun tries to compel the spirit to leave her, but nothing happens.\n\nVer\u00f3nica draws protective [[Icelandic magical staves|Viking symbols]] for the kids, only for the demon to destroy them. She tries to help Lucia when the spirit chokes her, but Lucia says it was Ver\u00f3nica who was choking her. That night, Ver\u00f3nica dreams that her siblings are eating her. She wakes up to find that she's on her first [[menstruation|period]]. As she scrubs her mattress, she finds burn marks on the underside. Later, she finds on each of the kids' mattresses a large burn mark in the shape of a human body. Ver\u00f3nica goes to Sister Death for advice; the nun tells of how she used to see dark spirits when she was younger, and intentionally blinded herself in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the visions. Sister Death tells her that she can force the spirits to leave by doing right what she did wrong. Ver\u00f3nica learns that it is important to say goodbye to the spirit at the end of the s\u00e9ance. After going to a party at Rosa's house, she asks Rosa and Diana to help her hold another s\u00e9ance, but they refuse. Rosa reveals that, at the s\u00e9ance, Ver\u00f3nica whispered that she herself would die in three days.\n\nDesperate, she decides to hold the s\u00e9ance with her young siblings. She has Anto\u00f1ito draw the protective symbols on the walls, but he flips to the wrong page and instead draws symbols of invocation. When she tells the spirit to say goodbye, it refuses. She calls the police as the spirit snatches Anto\u00f1ito, manages to grab him back, and escapes along with Lucia and Irene. However, when she gets to the exit she sees in a mirror that she is not actually holding Anto\u00f1ito but just imagined it. She returns to find her brother hiding in a closet and calling her name. She finds him and notices he won't go with her. Ver\u00f3nica looks at herself in the mirror and sees the demon, realizing she has been possessed by the demon the entire time, and had been harming her siblings under its control. She attempts to end the possession by slitting her own throat but is prevented by the demon. The police enter to find her being attacked by an invisible force and passing out. The medics carry her and Anto\u00f1ito out while a shaken detective observes the scene. As the detective watches a framed photograph of Ver\u00f3nica suddenly catch fire, he is informed that she has died. Five years later in 1996, he reports of unexplained paranormal activity having occurred in Madrid. It is explained that the movie is based on the true events of the first police report in [[Spain]] where a police officer certifies having witnessed [[paranormal activity]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Escacena]] as Ver\u00f3nica\n* Bruna Gonz\u00e1lez as Luc\u00eda\n* Claudia Placer as Irene\n* Iv\u00e1n Chavero as Anto\u00f1ito\n* [[Ana Torrent]] as Ana\n* [[Consuelo Trujillo]] as Hermana Muerte\n* Sonia Almarcha\n* Maru Valduvielso\n* [[Leticia Dolera]]\n* \u00c1ngela Fabi\u00e1n as Rosa\n* Samuel Romero\n* Carla Campra as Diana\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe film was inspired when Estefania Gutierrez Lazaro reportedly suffered hallucinations and seizures after performing the s\u00e9ance at a school in Madrid to try to contact her friend's deceased boyfriend who had died six months earlier. Her exact cause of death is a mystery. Her house allegedly became haunted after her death according to the British music magazine ''[[NME]]''.<ref name=\"nme\" /> The American magazine ''[[Newsweek]]'', referenced by ''NME'', is more cautious and while acknowledging that the case is real, likens the event to the similar pop-culture phenomenon and urban legend ''[[The Amityville Horror]]''. In the same magazine, director [[Paco Plaza]] says that he didn't feel bound to portray the real events, clarifying \"...the whole story of Veronica and the sisters and Anto\u00f1ito, this little Marlon Brando with glasses, it\u2019s all a vision.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/veronica-netflix-true-story-movie-horror-plot-spanish-828944|title=\"Is Veronica, the New Netflix Horror Movie, a True Story?\"|access-date=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was released on Netflix on 26 February 2018.

Ver\u00f3nica goes to Sister Death for advice; the nun tells of how she used to see dark spirits when she was younger, and intentionally blinded herself in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the visions. Sister Death tells her that she can force the spirits to leave by doing right what she did wrong. Ver\u00f3nica learns that it is important to say goodbye to the spirit at the end of the s\u00e9ance. After going to a party at Rosa's house, she asks Rosa and Diana to help her hold another s\u00e9ance, but they refuse. Rosa reveals that, at the s\u00e9ance, Ver\u00f3nica whispered that she herself would die in three days.\n\nDesperate, she decides to hold the s\u00e9ance with her young siblings. She has Anto\u00f1ito draw the protective symbols on the walls, but he flips to the wrong page and instead draws symbols of invocation. When she tells the spirit to say goodbye, it refuses. She calls the police as the spirit snatches Anto\u00f1ito, manages to grab him back, and escapes along with Lucia and Irene. However, when she gets to the exit she sees in a mirror that she is not actually holding Anto\u00f1ito but just imagined it. She returns to find her brother hiding in a closet and calling her name. She finds him and notices he won't go with her. Ver\u00f3nica looks at herself in the mirror and sees the demon, realizing she has been possessed by the demon the entire time, and had been harming her siblings under its control. She attempts to end the possession by slitting her own throat but is prevented by the demon. The police enter to find her being attacked by an invisible force and passing out. The medics carry her and Anto\u00f1ito out while a shaken detective observes the scene. As the detective watches a framed photograph of Ver\u00f3nica suddenly catch fire, he is informed that she has died. Five years later in 1996, he reports of unexplained paranormal activity having occurred in Madrid. It is explained that the movie is based on the true events of the first police report in [[Spain]] where a police officer certifies having witnessed [[paranormal activity]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sandra Escacena]] as Ver\u00f3nica\n* Bruna Gonz\u00e1lez as Luc\u00eda\n* Claudia Placer as Irene\n* Iv\u00e1n Chavero as Anto\u00f1ito\n* [[Ana Torrent]] as Ana\n* [[Consuelo Trujillo]] as Hermana Muerte\n* Sonia Almarcha\n* Maru Valduvielso\n* [[Leticia Dolera]]\n* \u00c1ngela Fabi\u00e1n as Rosa\n* Samuel Romero\n* Carla Campra as Diana\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe film was inspired when Estefania Gutierrez Lazaro reportedly suffered hallucinations and seizures after performing the s\u00e9ance at a school in Madrid to try to contact her friend's deceased boyfriend who had died six months earlier. Her exact cause of death is a mystery. Her house allegedly became haunted after her death according to the British music magazine ''[[NME]]''.<ref name=\"nme\" /> The American magazine ''[[Newsweek]]'', referenced by ''NME'', is more cautious and while acknowledging that the case is real, likens the event to the similar pop-culture phenomenon and urban legend ''[[The Amityville Horror]]''. In the same magazine, director [[Paco Plaza]] says that he didn't feel bound to portray the real events, clarifying \"...the whole story of Veronica and the sisters and Anto\u00f1ito, this little Marlon Brando with glasses, it\u2019s all a vision.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/veronica-netflix-true-story-movie-horror-plot-spanish-828944|title=\"Is Veronica, the New Netflix Horror Movie, a True Story?\"|access-date=18 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was released on Netflix on 26 February 2018.

{"title_page": "Spaceman Spiff", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n'''Spaceman Spiff''' is a science fiction hero within \nthe ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' [[comic strip]], which [[Bill Watterson]] wrote and illustrated from 1985 to 1995.\n\nSpiff is one of Calvin's many [[alter ego]]s, imaginary personae who have solo adventures (without Hobbes's company) in fantasy worlds which usually have some form of indirect connection with his home or school life.  He travels through the galaxy in a red [[flying saucer]] with a bubble canopy.  In all but one strip, the saucer is tiny, with just enough room for Spiff and apparently little else. Yet, the craft is equipped with an astounding array of weapons, detectors and propulsion devices.  Spiff wears square glasses, or [[goggles]], whose front openings change their shape according to his emotions.  The galaxy is a cruel place where Spiff is often zapped by ferocious and disgusting aliens (who, in reality, are really people such as Calvin's parents, Miss Wormwood, etc.) or stranded on a desert planet or both. He has a raygun, known by various fantastic names, but in reality, it is merely a [[water pistol]].\n\nThe ''Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book'' provides background on Spiff's character.  Watterson first conceived an earlier version of Spiff when he was taking a high school German class, producing a two-page comic titled \"Raumfahrer Rolf\".  When he was in college he reworked the strip and renamed his hero \"Spaceman Mort\".  Later on, after finishing college, he came up with the name Spaceman Spiff and made what he hoped was a professional strip with Spiff as a hero.  There was little resemblance to the Calvin-Spiff character:  The early Spiff was a \"diminutive loudmouth\" with a [[Charlie Chaplin|Chaplin]] moustache who explored space in a [[dirigible]] with his sidekick Fargle. The newspaper syndicates all rejected this early strip, and the present Spiff was finally born as one of the many imaginary alter egos of Calvin when the Calvin and Hobbes strip took off.\n\nEarly in the strip's career, the alien planets Watterson invented were, in his words, \"rather generic\".  As his work matured, Watterson brought the Spiff saga in line with his principle that \"Things are funner when they're specific, rather than generalized\", basing his alien landscapes on the rock formations of southern [[Utah]], as well as the landscapes within [[Krazy Kat]].  Gradually, the monsters also took on more detail, becoming more than blobs of slime.  The vocabulary, and in particular Spiff's array of high-tech gadgetry, offered a caricature of the \"Science\" found in many science fiction books and TV series.\n\nWatterson himself described Spaceman Spiff as a [[parody]] of [[Flash Gordon]]. The grand \"[[space opera]]\" style of Spiff's adventures may also point to a spoof of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''; there is very little [[cyberpunk]] in Watterson's oeuvre.  Since all the Spiff adventures have a lone protagonist playing with reality, they are close to the early work of [[Philip K. Dick]] and that of other writers who have featured lone individuals going to the edge of their perceived world. In the final years of ''Calvin and Hobbes,'' Watterson began to show an interest in information technology, often pitting the progressive and computer-savvy Calvin against his reactionary father, who comments, \"It's bad enough to have a telephone.\"  Watterson's satire of the personal computer and its effects spilled over into the Spaceman Spiff strips.\n\nCalvin had many other science fiction adventures, in addition to the Spiff episodes. Some of them delved farther than the Spiff stories in exploring the aesthetics of science fiction and the nature of id and otherness.\n\n{{Calvin and Hobbes}}\n\n[[Category:Calvin and Hobbes|Spiff, Spaceman]]\n[[Category:Comics characters|Spiff, Spaceman]]\n[[Category:Science fiction characters|Spiff, Spaceman]]\n[[Category:Superheroes|Spiff, Spaceman]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n'''Spaceman Spiff''' is a science fiction hero within \nthe ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' [[comic strip]], which [[Bill Watterson]] wrote and illustrated from 1985 to 1995.\n\nSpiff is one of Calvin's many [[alter ego]]s, imaginary personae who have solo adventures (without Hobbes's company) in fantasy worlds which usually have some form of indirect connection with his home or school life.
