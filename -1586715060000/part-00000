Jaiantsu|formally {{nihongo||\u8aad\u58f2\u5de8\u4eba\u8ecd|Yomiuri Kyojingun}}}} are a [[professional baseball]] team based in [[Bunkyo, Tokyo]], Japan.  The team competes in the [[Central League]] in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]. They play their home games in the [[Tokyo Dome]], opened in 1988. The team's owner is [[Yomiuri Shimbun#Yomiuri Group|Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings]], Japan's largest [[media conglomerate]] which also owns two newspapers (including the eponymous ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'') and the [[Nippon Television Network System|Nippon Television Network]] (which includes flagship [[Nippon TV]]).\n\nThe Giants are the oldest team among the current Japanese professional teams. Their main rivalry is with the [[Hanshin Tigers]], a team especially popular in the [[Kansai]] region. The Yomiuri Giants are regarded as \"The [[New York Yankees]] of Japan\" due to their widespread popularity, past dominance of the league, and polarizing effect on fans. (Baseball fans who are indifferent about teams other than their local team often have an intense dislike for the Giants; on the other hand, the Giants have a large fan base even in areas with a local team.)\n\nThe English-language press occasionally calls the team the \"Tokyo Giants\", but that name has not been in use in Japan for decades. ([[Lefty O'Doul]], a former [[Major League Baseball]] player, named the team \"Tokyo Giants\" in the mid-1930s.) Instead, the team is officially known by the name of its corporate owner, just like the [[Hanshin Tigers]] and [[Orix Buffaloes]]. The team is often referred by fans and in news headlines and tables simply as ''Kyojin'' (\u5de8\u4eba, the Japanese word for \"giant(s)\"), instead of the usual corporate owner's name or the English nickname.\n\nThe Yomiuri Giants name and uniforms were based on the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York (now San Francisco) Giants]]. The team's colors (orange and black) are the same colors worn by the National League's Giants (both in New York and San Francisco). The stylized lettering on the team's jerseys and caps is similar to the fancy lettering used by the Giants when they played in New York in the 1930s, although during the 1970s the Yomiuri Giants modernized their lettering to follow the style worn by the San Francisco Giants.\n\n== Franchise history ==\n\n=== Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club ===\nThe team began in 1934 as {{nihongo|'''The Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club'''|\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u6771\u4eac\u91ce\u7403\u5036\u697d\u90e8|Dai-Nippon T\u014dky\u014d Yaky\u016b Kurabu}}, a team of all-stars organized by media mogul [[Matsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki]] that matched up against an American All-Star team that included [[Babe Ruth]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Lou Gehrig]], and [[Charlie Gehringer]]. While prior Japanese all-star contingents had disbanded, Sh\u014driki went pro with this group, playing in an independent league.\n\n=== Tokyo Kyojin ===\nIn 1936, with the formation of the [[Japanese Baseball League]], the team changed its name to '''[[Tokyo Kyojin]]'''. It won eight league championships under that name from 1936\u20131943, including at one point six championships in a row.\n\nPitcher [[Victor Starffin]], nicknamed \"the blue-eyed Japanese\", starred for the team until 1944. One of the league's premier pitchers, he won two MVP awards and a [[Best Nine Award|Best Nine]] award, and won at least 26 games in six different years, winning a league record 42 games in 1939. He followed his record-setting performance with another 38 wins in 1940. Pitcher [[Eiji Sawamura]] co-starred with Starffin on the Kyojin. He pitched the first [[no-hitter]] in Japanese pro baseball, on September 25, 1936, as well as two others. In 1937, he went 33-10 with a 1.38 [[earned run average]]. From 1937 to 1943 Sawamura had a record of 63-22, 554 strikeouts, and a 1.74 ERA. Sawamura enlisted in the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] in 1943, and was killed in battle when his ship was torpedoed near the end of World War II.\n\nOutfielder [[Haruyasu Nakajima]] was a featured hitter during the franchise's first decade-and-a-half, and as [[player-manager]] led the Kyojin to a championship in 1941. [[Tetsuharu Kawakami]] was a team fixture from 1938\u20131958, winning the batting title five times, two home run crowns, three RBI titles, and had six titles for the most hits in a season. He was the first player in Japanese pro baseball to achieve 2,000 hits and was named the league's MVP three times. Leadoff man [[Shosei Go]] starred for the team from 1937\u20131943, winning league MVP in 1943. Only 5-foot-6 and 140 pounds, he was nicknamed \"The Human Locomotive\" due to his speed.\n\nPitcher [[Hideo Fujimoto]] (also known as Hideo Nakagami) pitched for the team for 12 seasons from 1942\u20131955. He holds the Japanese records for lowest career ERA (1.90) and seasonal ERA (0.73 in 1943), as well as best all-time winning percentage (.697). He threw two career [[no-hitters]], including the first [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in professional baseball. In addition, he served as the Giants' [[player-manager]] in 1944 and part of 1946.\n\n=== Yomiuri Giants ===\nIn 1947 the team became the Yomiuri Giants, winning the final JBL championship in 1949 (again under [[player-manager]] [[Haruyasu Nakajima]]). From 1949\u20131987 the Giants played at [[Korakuen Stadium]], moving to their current home the [[Tokyo Dome]] in 1988.\n\nIn 1950 the Giants were one of the founding members of [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], joining the [[Central League]].\n\nSlugger [[Noboru Aota]] starred for the Giants from 1948\u20131952, winning the home run championship twice, and hitting a home run in the 1951 [[Japan Series]], when the Giants defeated the [[Nankai Hawks]] 4 games to 2 for their first NPB championship. Hawaiian [[Wally Yonamine]] was the first American to play [[professional baseball in Japan]] after World War II when he joined the Giants in 1951. A multi-skilled [[outfielder]], as a Giant Yonamine was a member of four [[Japan Series|Japan Series Championship]] teams, the [[Central League]] [[Nippon Professional Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in 1957, a consecutive seven-time [[Best Nine Award]] winner (1952\u201358), an eleven-time All-Star, and a three-time batting champion.\n\nThe team was the Central League champion every year from 1955\u20131959, winning the [[Japan Series]] championship in 1955, but losing four consecutive Japan Series thereafter.\n\nWorld career [[home run]] record holder [[Sadaharu Oh]] starred for the Giants from 1959\u20131980, and fellow [[Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Shigeo Nagashima]] played for the team from 1958\u20131974. The Giants lineup, consisting of Oh batting third and Nagashima batting fourth, was nicknamed the ''ON Hou'', (translated to: ''Oh-Nagashima Cannon'') as the two players emerged as the best hitters in the league. Now the team's manager, [[Tetsuharu Kawakami]] led the Giants to nine consecutive [[Japan Series]] championships from 1965\u20131973,<ref>[[Robert Whiting|Whiting, Robert]], \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2013/11/27/baseball/kawakamis-philosophy-as-manager-never-wavered/#.UpdRpt6mp9A Kawakami\u2019s philosophy as manager never wavered]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 November 2013, p. 16, retrieved 28 November 2013</ref> and Oh and Nagashima dominated the batting titles during this period.  During his career, Oh was a five-time batting champion and fifteen-time home-run champion, and won the [[Nippon Professional Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Central League]] most valuable player award nine times. Nagashima won the season MVP award five times, and the [[Best Nine Award]] every single year of his career (a total 17 times). Future Hall of Famer [[Tsuneo Horiuchi]] pitched for the team during its heyday, from 1966\u20131983. The renowned left-hander [[Masaichi Kaneda]] pitched for the team from 1965\u20131969, later having his number retired by the Giants.\n\n[[Shigeo Nagashima]] was appointed manager of the Giants almost immediately after his retirement in 1974, staying in that position until 1980. After a couple of down years the Giants re-assumed their dominant position in the Central League, winning league championships in 1976 and 1977. Sadaharu Oh rejoined the team as manager from 1984 to 1988. Nagashima returned as Giants manager from 1993\u20132001, winning Japan Series championships in 1994, 1996, and 2000.\n\nOutfielder [[Hideki Matsui]] starred for the Giants for ten seasons in the 1990s and early 2000s before migrating to [[Major League Baseball]]. He was a three-time NPB [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]], leading his team to four [[Japan Series]], winning three titles (1994, 2000 and 2002), and earning the popular nickname \"[[Godzilla]]\". He also made nine consecutive All-Star Games and led the league in [[home run]]s and [[RBI]]s three times.\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Kawakami Tetsuharu 1946.JPG|[[Tetsuharu Kawakami]] in 1946\nFile:Yomiuri Giants4.jpg|Former three Giants star in 1950's, [[Tetsuharu Kawakami]], [[Shigeru Chiba]] and [[Noboru Aoki]] (left to right)\nFile:Egawa.jpg|[[Suguru Egawa]], after 1981 \nFile:Giants hara 88.jpg|[[Tatsunori Hara]] in 2012\nFile:\u9280\u5ea7\u30fc2.JPG|A celebrate with Giants supporters for NPB championship parade in November 2009\nFile:\u56fd\u6c11\u6804\u8a89\u8cde\u304a\u3081\u3067\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059 (8756593450).jpg|A celebration for awarding the National Honor Award served to [[Shigeo Nagashima]], former stars and manager for long period,  in [[Tokyo Dome]], May 2013.\nFile:Giants sugano 19.jpg|A current main pitcher of Giants, [[Tomoyuki Sugano]] \n</gallery>\n\n==Managerial history==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In fact, for some years the Giants' uniforms had \"Tokyo\" on the jersey instead of \"Yomiuri\" or \"Giants\", seeming to imply that the Giants represent the vast metropolis and geopolitical center of Japan, even though the [[Yakult Swallows]] are also based in Tokyo and three other teams play in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. This bandwagon appeal has been compared with the marketability of the [[New York Yankees]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], except that support for the Giants nearly exceeds 50% of those polled, while in the United States and England, support is judged to be between 30 and 40 percent for the [[New York Yankees]] and Manchester United, respectively.

Bass was intentionally walked four times on four straight pitches each time, leading Bass to famously hold his bat upside down.  Bass reached over the plate on the fifth occasion and batted the ball into the outfield for a single.  After the game, Oh denied ordering his pitchers to walk Bass, but Keith Comstock, an American pitcher for the Giants, later stated that an unnamed Giants coach had threatened a fine of $1,000 for every strike that any Giants pitcher threw to Bass. The magazine Takarajima investigated the incident and reported that the Giants front office had likely ordered the team not to allow Bass an opportunity to tie or break Oh's record.

Kyojingun}}}} are a [[professional baseball]] team based in [[Bunkyo, Tokyo]], Japan.  The team competes in the [[Central League]] in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]. They play their home games in the [[Tokyo Dome]], opened in 1988. The team's owner is the [[Yomiuri Shimbun#Yomiuri Group|The Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings]], Japan's largest [[media conglomerate]] which also owns two newspapers (including the eponymous ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'') and the [[Nippon Television Network System|Nippon Television Network]] (which includes flagship [[Nippon TV]]).\n\nThe Giants are the oldest team among the current Japanese professional teams. Their main rivalry is with the [[Hanshin Tigers]], a team especially popular in the [[Kansai]] region. The Yomiuri Giants are regarded as \"The [[New York Yankees]] of Japan\" due to their widespread popularity, past dominance of the league, and polarizing effect on fans. (Baseball fans who are indifferent about teams other than their local team often have an intense dislike for the Giants; on the other hand, the Giants have a large fan base even in areas with a local team.)\n\nThe English-language press occasionally calls the team the \"Tokyo Giants\", but that name has not been in use in Japan for decades. ([[Lefty O'Doul]], a former [[Major League Baseball]] player, named the team \"Tokyo Giants\" in the mid-1930s.) Instead, the team is officially known by the name of its corporate owner, just like the [[Hanshin Tigers]] and [[Orix Buffaloes]]. The team is often referred by fans and in news headlines and tables simply as ''Kyojin'' (\u5de8\u4eba, the Japanese word for \"giant(s)\"), instead of the usual corporate owner's name or the English nickname.\n\nThe Yomiuri Giants name and uniforms were based on the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York (now San Francisco) Giants]]. The team's colors (orange and black) are the same colors worn by the National League's Giants (both in New York and San Francisco). The stylized lettering on the team's jerseys and caps is similar to the fancy lettering used by the Giants when they played in New York in the 1930s, although during the 1970s the Yomiuri Giants modernized their lettering to follow the style worn by the San Francisco Giants.\n\n== Franchise history ==\n\n=== Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club ===\nThe team began in 1934 as {{nihongo|'''The Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club'''|\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u6771\u4eac\u91ce\u7403\u5036\u697d\u90e8|Dai-Nippon T\u014dky\u014d Yaky\u016b Kurabu}}, a team of all-stars organized by media mogul [[Matsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki]] that matched up against an American All-Star team that included [[Babe Ruth]], [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Lou Gehrig]], and [[Charlie Gehringer]]. While prior Japanese all-star contingents had disbanded, Sh\u014driki went pro with this group, playing in an independent league.\n\n=== Tokyo Kyojin ===\nIn 1936, with the formation of the [[Japanese Baseball League]], the team changed its name to '''[[Tokyo Kyojin]]'''. It won eight league championships under that name from 1936\u20131943, including at one point six championships in a row.\n\nPitcher [[Victor Starffin]], nicknamed \"the blue-eyed Japanese\", starred for the team until 1944. One of the league's premier pitchers, he won two MVP awards and a [[Best Nine Award|Best Nine]] award, and won at least 26 games in six different years, winning a league record 42 games in 1939. He followed his record-setting performance with another 38 wins in 1940. Pitcher [[Eiji Sawamura]] co-starred with Starffin on the Kyojin. He pitched the first [[no-hitter]] in Japanese pro baseball, on September 25, 1936, as well as two others. In 1937, he went 33-10 with a 1.38 [[earned run average]]. From 1937 to 1943 Sawamura had a record of 63-22, 554 strikeouts, and a 1.74 ERA. Sawamura enlisted in the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] in 1943, and was killed in battle when his ship was torpedoed near the end of World War II.\n\nOutfielder [[Haruyasu Nakajima]] was a featured hitter during the franchise's first decade-and-a-half, and as [[player-manager]] led the Kyojin to a championship in 1941. [[Tetsuharu Kawakami]] was a team fixture from 1938\u20131958, winning the batting title five times, two home run crowns, three RBI titles, and had six titles for the most hits in a season. He was the first player in Japanese pro baseball to achieve 2,000 hits and was named the league's MVP three times. Leadoff man [[Shosei Go]] starred for the team from 1937\u20131943, winning league MVP in 1943. Only 5-foot-6 and 140 pounds, he was nicknamed \"The Human Locomotive\" due to his speed.\n\nPitcher [[Hideo Fujimoto]] (also known as Hideo Nakagami) pitched for the team for 12 seasons from 1942\u20131955. He holds the Japanese records for lowest career ERA (1.90) and seasonal ERA (0.73 in 1943), as well as best all-time winning percentage (.697). He threw two career [[no-hitters]], including the first [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in professional baseball. In addition, he served as the Giants' [[player-manager]] in 1944 and part of 1946.\n\n=== Yomiuri Giants ===\nIn 1947 the team became the Yomiuri Giants, winning the final JBL championship in 1949 (again under [[player-manager]] [[Haruyasu Nakajima]]). From 1949\u20131987 the Giants played at [[Korakuen Stadium]], moving to their current home the [[Tokyo Dome]] in 1988.\n\nIn 1950 the Giants were one of the founding members of [[Nippon Professional Baseball]], joining the [[Central League]].\n\nSlugger [[Noboru Aota]] starred for the Giants from 1948\u20131952, winning the home run championship twice, and hitting a home run in the 1951 [[Japan Series]], when the Giants defeated the [[Nankai Hawks]] 4 games to 2 for their first NPB championship. Hawaiian [[Wally Yonamine]] was the first American to play [[professional baseball in Japan]] after World War II when he joined the Giants in 1951. A multi-skilled [[outfielder]], as a Giant Yonamine was a member of four [[Japan Series|Japan Series Championship]] teams, the [[Central League]] [[Nippon Professional Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] in 1957, a consecutive seven-time [[Best Nine Award]] winner (1952\u201358), an eleven-time All-Star, and a three-time batting champion.\n\nThe team was the Central League champion every year from 1955\u20131959, winning the [[Japan Series]] championship in 1955, but losing four consecutive Japan Series thereafter.\n\nWorld career [[home run]] record holder [[Sadaharu Oh]] starred for the Giants from 1959\u20131980, and fellow [[Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Shigeo Nagashima]] played for the team from 1958\u20131974. The Giants lineup, consisting of Oh batting third and Nagashima batting fourth, was nicknamed the ''ON Hou'', (translated to: ''Oh-Nagashima Cannon'') as the two players emerged as the best hitters in the league. Now the team's manager, [[Tetsuharu Kawakami]] led the Giants to nine consecutive [[Japan Series]] championships from 1965\u20131973,<ref>[[Robert Whiting|Whiting, Robert]], \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2013/11/27/baseball/kawakamis-philosophy-as-manager-never-wavered/#.UpdRpt6mp9A Kawakami\u2019s philosophy as manager never wavered]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 28 November 2013, p. 16, retrieved 28 November 2013</ref> and Oh and Nagashima dominated the batting titles during this period.  During his career, Oh was a five-time batting champion and fifteen-time home-run champion, and won the [[Nippon Professional Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Central League]] most valuable player award nine times. Nagashima won the season MVP award five times, and the [[Best Nine Award]] every single year of his career (a total 17 times). Future Hall of Famer [[Tsuneo Horiuchi]] pitched for the team during its heyday, from 1966\u20131983. The renowned left-hander [[Masaichi Kaneda]] pitched for the team from 1965\u20131969, later having his number retired by the Giants.\n\n[[Shigeo Nagashima]] was appointed manager of the Giants almost immediately after his retirement in 1974, staying in that position until 1980. After a couple of down years the Giants re-assumed their dominant position in the Central League, winning league championships in 1976 and 1977. Sadaharu Oh rejoined the team as manager from 1984 to 1988.

In fact, for some years the Giants' uniforms had \"Tokyo\" on the jersey instead of \"Yomiuri\" or \"Giants\", seeming to imply that the Giants represent the vast metropolis and geopolitical center of Japan, even though the [[Yakult Swallows]] are also based in Tokyo and three other teams play in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. This bandwagon appeal has been compared with the marketability of the [[New York Yankees]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], except that support for the Giants nearly exceeds 50% of those polled, while in the United States and England, support is judged to be between 30 and 40 percent for the [[New York Yankees]] and Manchester United, respectively.  Correspondingly, fans of other professional baseball teams in Japan are often openly derisive and contemptuous of the Giants' bandwagon marketing tactics, and an \"anti-Giants\" movement exists in protest of the near hegemony established by the Yomiuri Giants.<ref name=\"Whiting, You Gotta have Wa\">Whiting, ''You Gotta have Wa''.</ref>\n\nIt has also long been alleged that the Giants rely on underhanded tactics to recruit the best players, involving bribes to players and amateur coaches, or using their influence on the governing council of Japanese professional baseball to pass rules that favors their recruiting efforts. This may be one explanation for the Giants' abundance of success in league play.<ref name=\"Whiting, You Gotta have Wa\"/>  In August 2004, Yomiuri president [[Tsuneo Watanabe]] resigned after it was revealed that the club had violated scouting rules by paying \u00a52 million to pitching prospect Yasuhiro Ichiba.

Bass was intentionally walked four times on four straight pitches each time, leading Bass to famously hold his bat upside down.  Bass reached over the plate on the fifth occasion and batted the ball into the outfield for a single.  After the game, Oh denied ordering his pitchers to walk Bass, but Keith Comstock, an American pitcher for the Giants, later stated that an unnamed Giants coach had threatened a fine of $1,000 for every strike that any Giants pitcher threw to Bass. The magazine Takarajima investigated the incident and reported that the Giants front office had likely ordered the team not to allow Bass an opportunity to tie or break Oh's record.
