{"title_page": "Verb phrase ellipsis", "text_new": "In [[linguistics]], '''Verb Phrase Ellipsis''' ('''VP Ellipsis''' or '''VPE''') is a type of [[elliptical construction|Ellipsis]] (i.e. an omission of understood material), and a case of [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], in which a [[verb phrase]] following an [[auxiliary verb]] is elided (deleted), provided that its [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] can be found within the same linguistic context <ref>{{Cite journal|date=2001-01-01|editor-last=Baltin|editor-first=Mark|editor2-last=Collins|editor2-first=Chris|title=The Handbook of Contemporary Syntactic Theory|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9780470756416|doi=10.1002/9780470756416}}</ref>. An example is given in (1).\n\n(1) a. Jane will watch a movie.\n\nb. Jane will watch a movie and Liz will <sub>watch a movie</sub> too.\n\n\nThe requirements of VPE have been studied, but the general agreement is that\u00a0specific selectional properties and conditions of certain elements must be satisfied for VPE to work. \n\n==Features of verb phrase ellipsis in English==\nIn the VP ellipsis considered here, which are features of [[English grammar]], the elided VP must be a [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] VP; it cannot be a [[finite verb|finite]] VP. Further, the ellipsis must be introduced by an [[auxiliary verb]] (''be'', ''can'', ''do'', ''don't'', ''could'', ''have'', ''may'', ''might'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''won't'', ''would'', etc.) or by the infinitive particle ''to''.<ref>See Kroeger (2004:35) concerning the necessity that an auxiliary verb be \"left behind\" in order to license VP ellipsis.</ref> In the examples below, the elided material of VP ellipsis is indicated using subscripts and a smaller font and the antecedent to the ellipsis is bolded:\n\n::You might '''do it''', but I won't <sub>do it</sub>.\n\n::She won't '''laugh''', but he will <sub>laugh</sub>.\n\n::Susan has '''been cheating''', and Fred has <sub>been cheating</sub> too.\n\n::Larry is not '''telling the truth''', neither is Jim <sub>telling the truth</sub>.\n\n::They will '''do it''' if they want to <sub>do it</sub>.\n\nAttempts at VP ellipsis that lack an auxiliary verb fail, unless the infinitive particle ''to'' is retained:\n\n::a. *Sam wants '''to eat''', and Fred wants <sub>to eat</sub> as well. (* indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical)\n::b. Sam wants to '''eat''', and Fred wants to <sub>eat</sub> as well.\n\n::a. *Josh likes '''to sleep late''', and Hillary likes <sub>to sleep late</sub> as well.\n::b. Josh likes to '''sleep late''', and Hillary likes to <sub>sleep late</sub> as well.\n\nApparent exceptions to this restriction on VP ellipsis may be instances of [[null complement anaphora]], e.g. ''?Bill tried to leave, and Jim tried <sub>to leave</sub> too''.\n\nA particularly frequent construction in which VP ellipsis (obligatorily) occurs is the [[tag question]]:\n\n::Jeremy '''likes beer''', doesn't he <sub>like beer</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n::Susan will '''write the paper''', won't she <sub>write the paper</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n\n==The direction of ellipsis==\nVP ellipsis can be said to operate either ''forwards'' or'' backwards'': it operates forwards when the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to the ellipsis precedes the ellipsis (as in the above examples) and backwards when the antecedent follows the ellipsis. It can also be said to operate either ''upwards'' or ''downwards'' (or neither). It operates upwards when the antecedent appears in a clause that is [[subordinate clause|subordinate]] to the clause containing the ellipsis, and downwards when the ellipsis appears in a clause subordinate to the clause containing the antecedent. In the above examples, the two clauses are [[coordination (grammar)|coordinated]], so neither is subordinate to the other, and hence the operation of the ellipsis is neither upward nor downward.\n\nCombinations of these directions of operation of ellipsis are illustrated with the following examples:\n\n:: The people who say they will '''help''' never do <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and upwards</small>\n:: The people who say they will <sub>help</sub> never do '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and downwards</small>\n\n:: The people never do '''help''', who say they will <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and downwards</small>\n:: *The people never do <sub>help</sub>, who say they will '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and upwards</small>\n\nThree of the four combinations are acceptable. However, as the fourth example shows, VP ellipsis is impossible when it operates both backwards and upwards.\n\n==Antecedent-contained ellipsis==\n{{main article|Antecedent-contained deletion}}\nAn aspect of VP ellipsis that has been the subject of much theoretical analysis occurs when the ellipsis appears to be contained inside its antecedent. The phenomenon is called '''antecedent-contained ellipsis''' or '''antecedent-contained deletion'''. Canonical cases of antecedent-contained ellipsis occur when the ellipsis appears inside a quantified object NP, e.g.\n\n::They '''said everything that we did <sub>say</sub>'''.\n::He is '''thinking the same thing I am <sub>thinking</sub>'''.\n\nIf it is assumed that the antecedent to the ellipsis is to be a complete verb phrase, then the only possible antecedent appears to be the VP in bold. This VP, however, contains the ellipsis itself. This analysis would imply an [[infinite regress]], which is an impossibility, since it would mean that the ellipsis could never acquire full semantic content.\n\nOne means of addressing antecedent-contained ellipsis that is pursued in some [[phrase structure grammar]]s is to assume quantifier [[raising (linguistics)|raising]] (QR).<ref>For accounts of antecedent contained deletion in terms of quantifier raising, see for instance Kennedy (1997) and Wilder (2003).</ref> Quantifier raising raises the quantified NP to a position where it is no longer contained inside its antecedent VP. An alternative explanation, pursued in [[dependency grammar]]s, is to assume that the basic unit of syntax is not the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], but rather the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]].<ref>Concerning the status of the catena as the basic unit of syntactic analysis and as a basis for the analysis of ellipsis and antecedent containment, see Osborne (2019: 353-355, 373-375).</ref> On this analysis, the antecedent to the ellipsis does not need to be a complete constituent (an entire verb phrase), but can be merely a catena (the verbs ''say'' and ''thinking'' in the above examples), which need not contain the ellipsis.\n\n==Argument contained ellipsis==\nAs noted above, VP ellipsis is generally impossible if it would operate both backwards and upwards. There are also certain other restrictions on the possibility of ellipsis, although a complete theoretical analysis may be lacking. Two examples of environments in which ellipsis fails are now given:<ref>The two examples illustrating argument contained ellipsis were originally from Wasow 1972.</ref>\n\n:: *A proof that God '''exists''' does <sub>exist</sub>. <small>- Failed upward ellipsis</small>\n:: *A proof that God does <sub>exist</sub> '''exists'''. <small>- Failed argument-contained ellipsis</small>\n\nThe inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these cases has been explored in terms of so-called ''argument contained ellipsis''.<ref>Argument contained ellipsis is explored in detail by Kennedy (1994).</ref> The ellipsis appears inside an argument of the predicate represented by the antecedent to the ellipsis.

An example is given in (1).\n\n(1) a. Jane will watch a movie.\n\nb. Jane will watch a movie and Liz will <sub>watch a movie</sub> too.\n\n\nThe requirements of VPE have been studied, but the general agreement is that\u00a0specific selectional properties and conditions of certain elements must be satisfied for VPE to work. \n\n==Features of verb phrase ellipsis in English==\nIn the VP ellipsis considered here, which are features of [[English grammar]], the elided VP must be a [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] VP; it cannot be a [[finite verb|finite]] VP. Further, the ellipsis must be introduced by an [[auxiliary verb]] (''be'', ''can'', ''do'', ''don't'', ''could'', ''have'', ''may'', ''might'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''won't'', ''would'', etc.) or by the infinitive particle ''to''.<ref>See Kroeger (2004:35) concerning the necessity that an auxiliary verb be \"left behind\" in order to license VP ellipsis.</ref> In the examples below, the elided material of VP ellipsis is indicated using subscripts and a smaller font and the antecedent to the ellipsis is bolded:\n\n::You might '''do it''', but I won't <sub>do it</sub>.\n\n::She won't '''laugh''', but he will <sub>laugh</sub>.\n\n::Susan has '''been cheating''', and Fred has <sub>been cheating</sub> too.\n\n::Larry is not '''telling the truth''', neither is Jim <sub>telling the truth</sub>.\n\n::They will '''do it''' if they want to <sub>do it</sub>.\n\nAttempts at VP ellipsis that lack an auxiliary verb fail, unless the infinitive particle ''to'' is retained:\n\n::a. *Sam wants '''to eat''', and Fred wants <sub>to eat</sub> as well. (* indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical)\n::b. Sam wants to '''eat''', and Fred wants to <sub>eat</sub> as well.\n\n::a. *Josh likes '''to sleep late''', and Hillary likes <sub>to sleep late</sub> as well.\n::b. Josh likes to '''sleep late''', and Hillary likes to <sub>sleep late</sub> as well.\n\nApparent exceptions to this restriction on VP ellipsis may be instances of [[null complement anaphora]], e.g. ''?Bill tried to leave, and Jim tried <sub>to leave</sub> too''.\n\nA particularly frequent construction in which VP ellipsis (obligatorily) occurs is the [[tag question]]:\n\n::Jeremy '''likes beer''', doesn't he <sub>like beer</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n::Susan will '''write the paper''', won't she <sub>write the paper</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n\n==The direction of ellipsis==\nVP ellipsis can be said to operate either ''forwards'' or'' backwards'': it operates forwards when the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to the ellipsis precedes the ellipsis (as in the above examples) and backwards when the antecedent follows the ellipsis. It can also be said to operate either ''upwards'' or ''downwards'' (or neither). It operates upwards when the antecedent appears in a clause that is [[subordinate clause|subordinate]] to the clause containing the ellipsis, and downwards when the ellipsis appears in a clause subordinate to the clause containing the antecedent. In the above examples, the two clauses are [[coordination (grammar)|coordinated]], so neither is subordinate to the other, and hence the operation of the ellipsis is neither upward nor downward.\n\nCombinations of these directions of operation of ellipsis are illustrated with the following examples:\n\n:: The people who say they will '''help''' never do <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and upwards</small>\n:: The people who say they will <sub>help</sub> never do '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and downwards</small>\n\n:: The people never do '''help''', who say they will <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and downwards</small>\n:: *The people never do <sub>help</sub>, who say they will '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and upwards</small>\n\nThree of the four combinations are acceptable. However, as the fourth example shows, VP ellipsis is impossible when it operates both backwards and upwards.\n\n==Antecedent-contained ellipsis==\n{{main article|Antecedent-contained deletion}}\nAn aspect of VP ellipsis that has been the subject of much theoretical analysis occurs when the ellipsis appears to be contained inside its antecedent. The phenomenon is called '''antecedent-contained ellipsis''' or '''antecedent-contained deletion'''. Canonical cases of antecedent-contained ellipsis occur when the ellipsis appears inside a quantified object NP, e.g.\n\n::They '''said everything that we did <sub>say</sub>'''.\n::He is '''thinking the same thing I am <sub>thinking</sub>'''.\n\nIf it is assumed that the antecedent to the ellipsis is to be a complete verb phrase, then the only possible antecedent appears to be the VP in bold. This VP, however, contains the ellipsis itself. This analysis would imply an [[infinite regress]], which is an impossibility, since it would mean that the ellipsis could never acquire full semantic content.\n\nOne means of addressing antecedent-contained ellipsis that is pursued in some [[phrase structure grammar]]s is to assume quantifier [[raising (linguistics)|raising]] (QR).<ref>For accounts of antecedent contained deletion in terms of quantifier raising, see for instance Kennedy (1997) and Wilder (2003).</ref> Quantifier raising raises the quantified NP to a position where it is no longer contained inside its antecedent VP. An alternative explanation, pursued in [[dependency grammar]]s, is to assume that the basic unit of syntax is not the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], but rather the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]].<ref>Concerning the status of the catena as the basic unit of syntactic analysis and as a basis for the analysis of ellipsis and antecedent containment, see Osborne (2019: 353-355, 373-375).</ref> On this analysis, the antecedent to the ellipsis does not need to be a complete constituent (an entire verb phrase), but can be merely a catena (the verbs ''say'' and ''thinking'' in the above examples), which need not contain the ellipsis.\n\n==Argument contained ellipsis==\nAs noted above, VP ellipsis is generally impossible if it would operate both backwards and upwards. There are also certain other restrictions on the possibility of ellipsis, although a complete theoretical analysis may be lacking. Two examples of environments in which ellipsis fails are now given:<ref>The two examples illustrating argument contained ellipsis were originally from Wasow 1972.</ref>\n\n:: *A proof that God '''exists''' does <sub>exist</sub>. <small>- Failed upward ellipsis</small>\n:: *A proof that God does <sub>exist</sub> '''exists'''. <small>- Failed argument-contained ellipsis</small>\n\nThe inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these cases has been explored in terms of so-called ''argument contained ellipsis''.<ref>Argument contained ellipsis is explored in detail by Kennedy (1994).</ref> The ellipsis appears inside an argument of the predicate represented by the antecedent to the ellipsis. A satisfactory account of the inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these sentences is lacking.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Antecedent-contained deletion]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n*Bos, J. and J.

Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, the former President, [[Oscar Arias S\u00e1nchez]] was awarded The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1987 and the country continues to develop strong efforts for natural conservation. The main campus of the University - the [[Rodrigo Carazo Odio|Rodrigo Carazo]] Campus - is located 30&nbsp;km Southwest of San Jose, within a natural reserve composed of a secondary forest and the last remnant of primary forest (200 ha) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Hence, this protected area is very rich in fauna. It shelters mammals such as monkeys and deer; reptiles; and over 300 species of birds, as well as approximately 100 varieties of trees. The University's installations and protected area make up 303 ha.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/|title=About UPEACE|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe closest town to the mountain on which the University is perched, is [[Ciudad Colon]]. Most of the students, staff and faculty members of the University reside in Ciudad Colon, making it one of the most multi-cultural places in the world for its size.\n\nThe Rodrigo Carazo campus of the University for Peace is the principal location for the activities of the University. Most of its [https://www.upeace.org/ Masters programmes] and its recently announced [https://www.upeace.org/departments/doctoral-programme Doctoral programme] are administered from this campus. Students coming from several countries study in a highly [[multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] environment on the campus. The University boasts of a highly accomplished [https://www.upeace.org/ faculty], that comprises a mix of both resident and visiting faculty members. Because of the structure of the programmes and its unique global status, the University has an [https://www.upeace.org/calendar/events/academic academic calendar] that enables bringing on board the most highly acclaimed academicians and practitioners from around the world. The University has also started administering [https://www.upeace.org/departments/distance-education distance education courses], including an online Masters Programme from the main campus.\n\nThe University also carries out hands-on training beyond its Masters and Doctoral Programmes aimed at practitioners and policy makers rather than graduate students. The University has established two Centres for this purpose that are located on the main campus. The [https://www.upeace.org/departments/executive-courses UPEACE Centre for Executive Education] delivers dynamic training courses to leaders from around the world. The Centre reaches out to nonprofit leaders, business executives, educators at all levels, UN staff, students and other professional audiences. According to the Centre's website, the approach to all its courses is innovative, interactive, and participant-centered, using case-studies and field trips when appropriate. The Centre aims to develop key leadership skills by incorporating the crosscutting themes of Intercultural Communication, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and Teambuilding.\n\nThe University has also established the [http://www.hrc.upeace.org/ UPEACE Human Rights Centre] which was created within the contours of the broader mission of the University to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. In particular, the work of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre seeks to promote understanding, respect and enjoyment of [[universal human rights]]. The Centre carries out this objective through human rights education, training, research, capacity building and awareness raising activities. The website of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre states that the Centre takes a practice based approach to the respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights and promotes the integration of theory and practice. The Centre also takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights and attaches equal importance to all human rights. Over the last few years, the UPEACE Human Rights Centre has conducted several training courses for policy makers, staff members of the UN and other inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics and civil servants.\n\nThe Headquarters and main campus of UPEACE also hosts the International Secretariat of the [[Earth Charter Initiative]], whose stated mission is \"to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, ecological integrity, [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights, [[respect for diversity]], [[economic justice]], [[democracy]], and a culture of peace.\" This mission is carried out using '[[The Earth Charter]]' as the principal guiding framework. The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, [[sustainability|sustainable]], and peaceful global society in the 21st century. In 2012, the Earth Charter Initiative and UPEACE were jointly awarded the UNESCO Chair on Education for Sustainable Development and the Earth Charter.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO Chair on ESD and Earth Charter, awarded jointly to EC Initiative and UPEACE|url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/categories/Education/}}</ref> The work related to this UNESCO Chair will be carried out at the newly constructed 'Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development' at the UPEACE main campus.\n\nIn addition to the activities at the Costa Rica Headquarters Campus, UPEACE works with an increasing number of partners in various parts of the world to ensure that the UPEACE mission is extended to reach as many individuals and institutions as possible.\n\n== Around the world ==\n\n'''Africa'''\n\nAs a result of extensive international consultations, which have underlined the importance of according a high priority to activities in Africa, the University for Peace (UPEACE) officially launched its Africa Programme in January 2002.\n\nThe University for Peace (UPEACE) established its [https://web.archive.org/web/20060629044240/http://www.africa.upeace.org/ Africa Programme] in 2002 on the basis of extensive consultations in the continent which aimed at developing a programme that responded to the true needs, aspirations and obstacles for education for building peace in Africa. From its inception, the programme focused on the necessity to stimulate and strengthen the capacity in Africa to teach, train and conduct research in areas of peace and conflict studies.\n\nThe first five years of the programme focused on the development of curricula and teaching materials and the delivery of a range of short courses, workshops, conferences and seminars in various parts of Africa. Within this period, the programme attracted close to one thousand participants from Academia, Policy makers and civil society organisations.\n\nIn a second five-year plan, which came out of a consultative meeting held in March 2007 with partners, the programme will additionally, work with a number of Partner Universities to develop full-fledged master's degree programmes to be based at African Universities. The principal aim of this endeavour is to further strengthen the African capacity and build a wide expertise for a better understanding of conflicts in Africa, their prevention and the creation of the environment favourable to lasting peace and development in the region.\n\n'''Europe'''\n\nIn January 2012, UPEACE created a new Centre at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] ([http://www.upeace.nl/ UPEACE The Hague]), which is housed at the Academy Building of the [[Peace Palace]], next to The [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. UPEACE The Hague will focus on education and research at the forefront of peace studies, closely cooperating with academic and policy-oriented institutions in The Hague region. UPEACE The Hague will initially advance three fields where it can be innovative and complementary: Peace & Conflict Studies, Water & Peace, and Urban Peace & Security. In addition, UPEACE The Hague will strengthen peace education in The Hague region by organising professional trainings, lectures, seminars, and workshops. Educational and research programmes will be characterised by the interaction between theory and practice, also contributing to policy innovations, and will therefore be appealing to both academics and professionals.\n\nThe Geneva Office of UPEACE, established in 2001, has continued to support the development of the overall activities of the University, in particular its regional programmes in Africa and Central Asia. The key focus of work undertaken by the Geneva office is contributing to the development of programme activities of the University in Africa and the Middle East, engaging with the academic community in Geneva to establish joint teaching and training courses on issues of particular relevance to the expertise available within the international community in Geneva and facilitation of relations within Europe and with the United Nations system, national delegations, donor community and academic institutions.\n\nIn November 2015 University for Peace started its work in Rome (Italy - www.unipaceroma.org), thanks to a cooperation agreement with prof. eng. Gianni Cara, already responsible for Europe for 'World Organization for Peace', and serious about teaching: 'For economic growth to lead to the realization of human rights, any growth strategy must be part of a comprehensive set of  policies and Institutions consciously designed to convert resources into rights, or into awareness and competences to bridge the gap and to help ensure that economic growth is translated into the wider enjoyment of human rights for all. These are the main targets for our programs:  1) Facilitating the establishment of temporary/permanent mechanisms for dialogue and engagement at national and local level on development processes, particularly important in some areas of the planet; 2) Introducing innovation and digital shift in training, which can become, as usually they are, the most powerful personal growth driver'.\n\n'''Asia'''\n\nThe [http://www.upeace.org/academic/spec_masters/alp.cfm Asia Leaders Programme], a Dual Campus Master Programme, is a shared initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the University for Peace, in collaboration with [[Ateneo de Manila University]], which aims to provide students from Japan and other Asian countries with an opportunity to pursue a peace studies post graduate degree with a content-based language-training module. This offers the support for individuals who do not have a proficient command of English to work in this increasingly common international language and to become comfortable in their professional abilities as they gain academic skills. As part of the programme, students also have  the opportunity to apply their academic and practical knowledge through a four-month internship at the end of the Master courses.\n\n'''Affiliated institutions'''\n\nArticle 4 of the Charter of the University for Peace reads: \"the University may enter into association or conclude agreements with Governments and intergovernmental and other organizations and institutions in the field of education.\" The University for Peace signed agreements with the governments of Serbia (formerly Yugoslavia), Colombia and Uruguay to open centres in those three countries. These centres have the necessary legal status to enjoy autonomy and academic freedom, while keeping its humanistic purpose within the framework of both the Charter of the University for Peace and the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe European Centre for Peace and Development (ECPD) in Belgrade, Serbia; the World Centre for Training and Research in Conflict Resolution (WCCR) in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; and the World Centre for Research for Peace (CMIP) in Montevideo, Uruguay, have developed close links with their respective governments while being key UPEACE partners in areas of common interest. UPEACE keeps operational agreements with them and lends its logos when necessary in order to undertake joint activities within the framework of UPEACE's and the Centres\u2019 mission. These activities, as with other partners, involve the cooperating parties working together at all stages of jointly agreed-upon projects.\n\n== Academics ==\nUPEACE has been offering master's degree programmes at its Costa Rica campus for students from all parts of the world since its establishment.

Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, the former President, [[Oscar Arias S\u00e1nchez]] was awarded The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1987 and the country continues to develop strong efforts for natural conservation. The main campus of the University - the [[Rodrigo Carazo Odio|Rodrigo Carazo]] Campus - is located 30&nbsp;km Southwest of San Jose, within a natural reserve composed of a secondary forest and the last remnant of primary forest (200 ha) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Hence, this protected area is very rich in fauna. It shelters mammals such as monkeys and deer; reptiles; and over 300 species of birds, as well as approximately 100 varieties of trees. The University's installations and protected area make up 303 ha.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/|title=About UPEACE|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe closest town to the mountain on which the University is perched, is [[Ciudad Colon]]. Most of the students, staff and faculty members of the University reside in Ciudad Colon, making it one of the most multi-cultural places in the world for its size.\n\nThe Rodrigo Carazo campus of the University for Peace is the principal location for the activities of the University. Most of its [https://www.upeace.org/ Masters programmes] and its recently announced [https://www.upeace.org/departments/doctoral-programme Doctoral programme] are administered from this campus. Students coming from several countries study in a highly [[multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] environment on the campus. The University boasts of a highly accomplished [https://www.upeace.org/ faculty], that comprises a mix of both resident and visiting faculty members. Because of the structure of the programmes and its unique global status, the University has an [https://www.upeace.org/calendar/events/academic academic calendar] that enables bringing on board the most highly acclaimed academicians and practitioners from around the world. The University has also started administering [https://www.upeace.org/departments/distance-education distance education courses], including an online Masters Programme from the main campus.\n\nThe University also carries out hands-on training beyond its Masters and Doctoral Programmes aimed at practitioners and policy makers rather than graduate students. The University has established two Centres for this purpose that are located on the main campus. The [https://www.upeace.org/departments/executive-courses UPEACE Centre for Executive Education] delivers dynamic training courses to leaders from around the world. The Centre reaches out to nonprofit leaders, business executives, educators at all levels, UN staff, students and other professional audiences. According to the Centre's website, the approach to all its courses is innovative, interactive, and participant-centered, using case-studies and field trips when appropriate. The Centre aims to develop key leadership skills by incorporating the crosscutting themes of Intercultural Communication, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and Teambuilding.\n\nThe University has also established the [http://www.hrc.upeace.org/ UPEACE Human Rights Centre] which was created within the contours of the broader mission of the University to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. In particular, the work of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre seeks to promote understanding, respect and enjoyment of [[universal human rights]]. The Centre carries out this objective through human rights education, training, research, capacity building and awareness raising activities. The website of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre states that the Centre takes a practice based approach to the respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights and promotes the integration of theory and practice. The Centre also takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights and attaches equal importance to all human rights. Over the last few years, the UPEACE Human Rights Centre has conducted several training courses for policy makers, staff members of the UN and other inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics and civil servants.\n\nThe Headquarters and main campus of UPEACE also hosts the International Secretariat of the [[Earth Charter Initiative]], whose stated mission is \"to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, ecological integrity, [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights, [[respect for diversity]], [[economic justice]], [[democracy]], and a culture of peace.\" This mission is carried out using '[[The Earth Charter]]' as the principal guiding framework. The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, [[sustainability|sustainable]], and peaceful global society in the 21st century. In 2012, the Earth Charter Initiative and UPEACE were jointly awarded the UNESCO Chair on Education for Sustainable Development and the Earth Charter.<ref>{{cite web|title=UNESCO Chair on ESD and Earth Charter, awarded jointly to EC Initiative and UPEACE|url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/categories/Education/}}</ref> The work related to this UNESCO Chair will be carried out at the newly constructed 'Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development' at the UPEACE main campus.\n\nIn addition to the activities at the Costa Rica Headquarters Campus, UPEACE works with an increasing number of partners in various parts of the world to ensure that the UPEACE mission is extended to reach as many individuals and institutions as possible.\n\n== Around the world ==\n\n'''Africa'''\n\nAs a result of extensive international consultations, which have underlined the importance of according a high priority to activities in Africa, the University for Peace (UPEACE) officially launched its Africa Programme in January 2002.\n\nThe University for Peace (UPEACE) established its [https://web.archive.org/web/20060629044240/http://www.africa.upeace.org/ Africa Programme] in 2002 on the basis of extensive consultations in the continent which aimed at developing a programme that responded to the true needs, aspirations and obstacles for education for building peace in Africa. From its inception, the programme focused on the necessity to stimulate and strengthen the capacity in Africa to teach, train and conduct research in areas of peace and conflict studies.\n\nThe first five years of the programme focused on the development of curricula and teaching materials and the delivery of a range of short courses, workshops, conferences and seminars in various parts of Africa. Within this period, the programme attracted close to one thousand participants from Academia, Policy makers and civil society organisations.\n\nIn a second five-year plan, which came out of a consultative meeting held in March 2007 with partners, the programme will additionally, work with a number of Partner Universities to develop full-fledged master's degree programmes to be based at African Universities. The principal aim of this endeavour is to further strengthen the African capacity and build a wide expertise for a better understanding of conflicts in Africa, their prevention and the creation of the environment favourable to lasting peace and development in the region.\n\n'''Europe'''\n\nIn January 2012, UPEACE created a new Centre at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] ([http://www.upeace.nl/ UPEACE The Hague]), which is housed at the Academy Building of the [[Peace Palace]], next to The [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. UPEACE The Hague will focus on education and research at the forefront of peace studies, closely cooperating with academic and policy-oriented institutions in The Hague region. UPEACE The Hague will initially advance three fields where it can be innovative and complementary: Peace & Conflict Studies, Water & Peace, and Urban Peace & Security. In addition, UPEACE The Hague will strengthen peace education in The Hague region by organising professional trainings, lectures, seminars, and workshops. Educational and research programmes will be characterised by the interaction between theory and practice, also contributing to policy innovations, and will therefore be appealing to both academics and professionals.\n\nThe Geneva Office of UPEACE, established in 2001, has continued to support the development of the overall activities of the University, in particular its regional programmes in Africa and Central Asia. The key focus of work undertaken by the Geneva office is contributing to the development of programme activities of the University in Africa and the Middle East, engaging with the academic community in Geneva to establish joint teaching and training courses on issues of particular relevance to the expertise available within the international community in Geneva and facilitation of relations within Europe and with the United Nations system, national delegations, donor community and academic institutions.\n\nIn November 2015 University for Peace started its work in Rome (Italy - www.unipaceroma.org), thanks to a cooperation agreement with prof. eng. Gianni Cara, already responsible for Europe for 'World Organization for Peace', and serious about teaching: 'For economic growth to lead to the realization of human rights, any growth strategy must be part of a comprehensive set of  policies and Institutions consciously designed to convert resources into rights, or into awareness and competences to bridge the gap and to help ensure that economic growth is translated into the wider enjoyment of human rights for all. These are the main targets for our programs:  1) Facilitating the establishment of temporary/permanent mechanisms for dialogue and engagement at national and local level on development processes, particularly important in some areas of the planet; 2) Introducing innovation and digital shift in training, which can become, as usually they are, the most powerful personal growth driver'.\n\n'''Asia'''\n\nThe [http://www.upeace.org/academic/spec_masters/alp.cfm Asia Leaders Programme], a Dual Campus Master Programme, is a shared initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the University for Peace, in collaboration with [[Ateneo de Manila University]], which aims to provide students from Japan and other Asian countries with an opportunity to pursue a peace studies post graduate degree with a content-based language-training module. This offers the support for individuals who do not have a proficient command of English to work in this increasingly common international language and to become comfortable in their professional abilities as they gain academic skills. As part of the programme, students also have  the opportunity to apply their academic and practical knowledge through a four-month internship at the end of the Master courses.\n\n'''Affiliated institutions'''\n\nArticle 4 of the Charter of the University for Peace reads: \"the University may enter into association or conclude agreements with Governments and intergovernmental and other organizations and institutions in the field of education.\" The University for Peace signed agreements with the governments of Serbia (formerly Yugoslavia), Colombia and Uruguay to open centres in those three countries. These centres have the necessary legal status to enjoy autonomy and academic freedom, while keeping its humanistic purpose within the framework of both the Charter of the University for Peace and the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe European Centre for Peace and Development (ECPD) in Belgrade, Serbia; the World Centre for Training and Research in Conflict Resolution (WCCR) in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia; and the World Centre for Research for Peace (CMIP) in Montevideo, Uruguay, have developed close links with their respective governments while being key UPEACE partners in areas of common interest. UPEACE keeps operational agreements with them and lends its logos when necessary in order to undertake joint activities within the framework of UPEACE's and the Centres\u2019 mission. These activities, as with other partners, involve the cooperating parties working together at all stages of jointly agreed-upon projects.\n\n== Academics ==\nUPEACE has been offering master's degree programmes at its Costa Rica campus for students from all parts of the world since its establishment.

Community leaders revitalized the local economy by founding [[Wesleyan University]] in 1831, and investing in textile and machine industries.  The Wesleyan campus was laid out west of High Street, and the area between it and Main Street, originally open land used mainly for gardening, was developed residentially.  Although there had been some houses built during the Federal period, the amount of housing stock in this area tripled between 1830 and 1850.  The area was substantially built out by 1900, with only relatively minor additions and alterations since then.<ref name=NRHP/>\n\nThe historic district is bounded on the north and south by Broad and Church Streets, and the west by High Street, and generally does not include buildings on those streets.
