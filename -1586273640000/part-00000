Following the collapse of the Communist regime, Kun fled to the [[Soviet Union]], where he worked as a [[functionary]] in the [[Communist International]] bureaucracy as the head of the [[Crimea]]n [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|Revolutionary Committee]] from 1920. He organised and actively participated in the [[Red Terror]] in Crimea (1920\u20131921), following which he participated in the [[March Action]] (1921), a failed Communist uprising in Germany.\n\nDuring the [[Great Purge]] of the late 1930s, Kun was arrested, interrogated, tried, and executed in quick succession. He was posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] by the Soviet regime in 1956, following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[De-Stalinization|critical reassessment]] of [[Stalinism]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nB\u00e9la Kohn, later known as B\u00e9la Kun, was born on 20 February 1886 in the village of Lele, located near [[Cehu Silvaniei|Szil\u00e1gycseh]], [[Transylvania]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (today part of [[Hodod]], [[Romania]]). His father, Samu Kohn was a lapsed [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] village notary, while his mother, R\u00f3za Goldberger, was a Jewish convert to [[Protestantism]].<ref>Gy\u00f6rgy Bors\u00e1nyi, ''The Life of a Communist Revolutionary: B\u00e9la Kun.'' Mario D. Fenyo, trans. Boulder, CO: Social Science Monographs/Atlantic Research and Publications, 1993; pg. 1.</ref> Despite his parents' secular outlook, he was educated at the Silvania F\u0151gimn\u00e1zium in Zilah (present-day [[Silvania National College]], [[Zal\u0103u]])<ref>[http://www.cnszalau.ro/personalitati/ Personalit\u0103\u021bi]</ref> and a famous [[Reformed Church in Hungary|Reformed]] ''kollegium'' (grammar school) in the city of Kolozsv\u00e1r (modern [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]).\n\nAt the ''kollegium'' Kun won the prize for best essay on [[Hungarian literature]] that allowed him to attend a gymnasium. His essay was on the poet [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]] and the concluding paragraphs were:\n\n<blockquote>The storming rage of Pet\u0151fi's soul\u2026 turned against the privileged classes, against the people's oppressor\u2026 and confronted them with revolutionary abandon. Pet\u0151fi felt that the country would not be saved through moderation, but through the use of the most extreme means available. He detested even the thought of cowardice\u2026 Pet\u0151fi's vision was correct. There is no room for prudence in revolutions whose fate and eventual success is always decided by boldness and raw courage\u2026 this is why Pet\u0151fi condemned his compatriots for the sin of opportunism and hesitation when faced with the great problems of their age\u2026 Pet\u0151fi's works must be regarded as the law of the Hungarian soul\u2026 and of the\u2026 love of the country\".<ref name=rudolf>Tokes, Rudolf ''B\u00e9la Kun: The Man and the Revolutionary'' pp. 170\u2013207, from ''Hungary in Revolution'' edited by Ivan Volgyes, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971 p. 173.</ref></blockquote>\n\nB\u00e9la [[Magyarization|magyarized]] his birth surname, ''Kohn,'' to ''Kun'' in 1904, although the almanac of the University of Kolozsv\u00e1r still referred to him in print by his former name as late as 1909.<ref name=Life2>Bors\u00e1nyi, ''The Life of a Communist Revolutionary,'' pg. 2.</ref> There is no archival evidence that he took any formal action to change the spelling of his name, although it is clear that from 1904 all those around him referred to him as B\u00e9la Kun rather than Kohn, and he likewise used the Magyar variant in his signature.<ref name=Life2 />\n\nBefore the [[World War I|First World War]], he was a [[Muckraker|muck-raking]] journalist with sympathies for the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] in Kolozsv\u00e1r. In addition, Kun served on the Kolozsv\u00e1r Social Insurance Board, from which he was later to be accused of embezzling. He had a fiery reputation and was involved in duels several times. In May 1913 he married Ir\u00e9n G\u00e1l, a music teacher of middle-class background.\n\n===Early political career===\nDuring his early education at Kolozsv\u00e1r, Kun became friends with the poet [[Endre Ady]], who introduced him to many members of [[Budapest]]'s left-wing [[intelligentsia]].\n\nKun fought for Austria-Hungary in [[World War I]], and was captured and made a [[prisoner of war]] in 1916 by the [[Imperial Russia|Russians]]. He was sent to a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp in the [[Urals]], where he was exposed to [[Communism]]. The popular [[Russian Revolution|revolution]] in March 1917 and the subsequent Bolshevik coup the following November not only set him free but provided him with unforeseen opportunities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Indelicato|first=Alberto|date=19 September 2017|title=TWO ITALIANS AGAINST B\u00c9LA KUN|url=http://www.hungarianreview.com/article/20170919_two_italians_against_bela_kun|journal=Hungarian Review|volume=Volume VIII, No. 5.|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\nIn March 1918, in Moscow, Kun co-founded the Hungarian Group of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]] (the predecessor to the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]) with other former Hungarian POWs.<ref name=\":0\" /> He travelled widely, including to [[Petrograd]] and Moscow. He came to know [[Vladimir Lenin]] there, but inside the party he promoted ultra-radical left-wing political opposition to Lenin and the mainstream [[Bolshevik]]s. Kun and his friends (such as the Italian [[Umberto Terracini]] and the Hungarian [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]]), aggregated around [[Grigory Zinoviev]] or [[Karl Radek]]; whereas Lenin advocated making peace with the Central Powers, despite the harsh conditions they imposed, in order to \"save the revolution\", they took the part of [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]], who wanted to continue and expand the war to transform it into an international revolutionary struggle to impose Communism on the rest of Europe.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lenin often called them \"kunerists\", and said of Kun, \u201cWe can see that this man comes from a country of poets and dreamers.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=L.|title=The Life of Lenin|publisher=|year=1965|isbn=|location=London|pages=197}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918, Kun fought for the Bolsheviks. During this time, he first started to make detailed plans for a Communist revolution in Hungary. In November 1918, with at least several hundred other Hungarian Communists and with a large sum of money provided by the Soviets, he returned to Hungary.\n\n===Hungarian People's Republic===\nIn Hungary, the resources of a shattered government were further strained by refugees from lands lost to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] during the war, and which were due to be lost permanently under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Rampant [[inflation]], housing shortages, mass [[unemployment]], food shortages and coal shortages further weakened the economy and stimulated widespread protests. In October 1918, the [[Aster Revolution]] saw the inauguration the Hungarian People's Republic, under an unstable coalition government of Socialists and other radicals. The party Kun had founded with a few companions in Russia the previous March was officially re-launched eight days after his return to Budapest, on 4 November 1918.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe immediately began a highly energetic [[propaganda]] campaign against the government of President [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], and his [[Social Democrat]]ic allies, accusing them of betraying the working class, of lack of class consciousness, of not wanting to continue the expropriation of large domains and the big capital. His aim was to copy the tactics Lenin had used so successfully, which included pandering to the demands of all the discontented in society: unemployed, pensioners, veterans, employees; relentlessly denouncing the Government and the parties that supported it; as well as infiltrating the trade unions, discrediting their executives, and undermining the Socialist Party by dividing the more moderate leaders from the more extreme ones.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis speeches had a considerable impact on his audiences. One who heard such a speech wrote in his diary:\n\n<blockquote>Yesterday I heard Kun speak\u2026 it was an audacious, hateful, enthusiastic oratory. [...] He knows his audience and rules over them\u2026 Factory workers long at odds with the Social Democratic Party leaders, young intellectuals, teachers, doctors, lawyers, clerks who came to his room\u2026 meet Kun and Marxism.<ref name=rudolf2>Tokes, Rudolf ''B\u00e9la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic'' New York: F.A. Praeger, 1967 pp. 111\u20132.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the Communists held frequent marches and rallies and organised [[strike action|strikes]]. Desiring to achieve a revolution in Hungary, he communicated by [[telegraph]] with [[Vladimir Lenin]] to garner support from the Bolsheviks, which would ultimately not materialise.<ref name=borsanyi>Borsanyi, Gyorgy ''The life of a Communist revolutionary, B\u00e9la Kun'' Boulder, Colo: Social Science Monographs; 1993, pp. 146\u20137.</ref> \n\nDespite Kun's efforts, by February 1919 the Communists had fewer than 30,000 members, compared with the 700,000 of the Social Democrats. Kun knew that if the upcoming elections went ahead, they would be a disaster for the Communists. Therefore, the Communist press launched a campaign against a fictitious \"reactionary conspiracy\" which the K\u00e1rolyi government was either unaware of, or unwilling to crush. On 20 February 1919 the Communists invaded and pillaged the headquarters of the Socialist daily newspaper. The attack left a few dead and many injured, primarily policemen who had tried to stop the Communist aggression. Kun and 67 other Communist leaders were arrested.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, despite the apparent failure of this adventure, there were two factors that worked to Kun's advantage. First the press, even the non-socialist press, claimed that the imprisoned Communists had been mistreated by some members of the police force that supposedly wanted to avenge the death of their colleagues, and also publicised the supposedly courageous attitude of prisoner B\u00e9la Kun, a man previously little known outside his circle of followers. This greatly increased the popularity of Kun and sympathy toward the Communists among the general public. Concerned by this unintended shift in public opinion, the government gave orders that while in prison Kun be allowed to carry out any political activity he wished, which meant he was able to continue directing the Hungarian Communist Party from his cell. There were days in which Kun received up to four hundred visitors, mainly far-left Social Democrats who now considered Kun, whose stature was already increased by the prestige of participating in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, a martyr.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second was that on 19 March 1919, French Lt-Col Fernand Vix presented the \"Vix Note,\" ordering Hungarian forces to be pulled back further from where they were stationed, clearing the areas of Debrecen and Mak\u00f3. It was assumed that the military lines would be the new frontiers that would be established by the peace conference between Hungary and the Allies. The Vix Note created a massive upsurge of nationalist outrage, and the Hungarians resolved to fight the Allies rather than accept the new national borders. K\u00e1rolyi resigned, perhaps in order not to link his name to the acceptance of that imposition, and soon after a proclamation was made public in his name stating that he had voluntarily given up his powers to a \u201cnew government of the proletariat\u201d, i.e. the Socialists. Later in his life K\u00e1rolyi denied that he had made such a statement, though he did not disavow it at the time or in the following years during which he remained quietly in Hungary.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Garbai Kun.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[S\u00e1ndor Garbai]] and B\u00e9la Kun, leaders of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, 1919]]\n\nThe Social Democrats approached Kun on the subject of a coalition government, hoping he would be able to use his Soviet connections to bring the Red Army to Hungary's aid. So desperate were they for the Soviet support they believed Kun could provide that it was Kun, a captive, who dictated the terms to his captors. This was despite the [[Red Army]]'s full involvement in the Russian Civil War and the unlikelihood that it could be of any direct military assistance. Kun proposed the merger of the Social Democrat and Communist parties, the establishment of a Soviet Republic and several other radical measures, which the Social Democrats agreed to.\n\n===Hungarian Soviet Republic===\n[[File:Bela.Kun.Revolution.1919.jpg|thumb|240x240px|B\u00e9la Kun was the leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919.|left]]\nOn 21 March 1919, the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], the second Communist regime in Europe after Russia itself, was proclaimed; the Social Democrats and Communists were merged under the interim name Hungarian Socialist Party, and B\u00e9la Kun was released from prison and sworn into office.\n\nThe nominal head of the Soviet Republic was a Socialist leader, [[S\u00e1ndor Garbai]], but in practice power rested with Kun, although officially he was only People\u2019s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and from April 1919 also People\u2019s Commissar for Defence.<ref name=\":0\" /> As he told Lenin, \"My personal influence in the Revolutionary Governing Council is such that the dictatorship of the proletariat is firmly established, since the masses are backing me.\"<ref name=\"janos\">Janos, Andrew, ''The Politics of Backwardness in Hungary'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 197.</ref>\n\nThe Social Democrats continued to hold the majority of seats in government. Of the thirty-three [[People's Commissar]]s of the Revolutionary Governing Council that ruled the Soviet Republic, fourteen were former Communists, seventeen were former Social Democrats and two had no party affiliation. With the exception of Kun, every Commissar was a former Social Democrat and every Deputy Commissar a former Communist. Despite the fact that the Socialists were by far more numerous, they passively accepted the leadership and the programme of the smaller but far more active and determined Communist Party, which claimed to represent the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the hope of placating the new Hungarian regime, the victorious Entente express willingness to bring the military demarcation to the line specified by the armistice of Belgrade the previous November, stating however that it would have no relevance to the final clauses of the peace treaty. This gesture was an undeniable success for the Socialist-Communist government which was thus offered some badly needed breathing space. However Kun rejected the proposal, declaring during a rally on 19 April: <blockquote>Comrades, we do not profess the doctrine of territorial integrity, but we want to live, and this is why we did not accept that our freed proletarian brothers living in the neutralised zone be rejected under the yoke of capitalism. To do so would deprive the Hungarian proletariat of the physical means necessary to live. [...] It is a matter, therefore, which concerns the struggle between the international revolution and the international counter-revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=B\u00e9la Kun et la R\u00e9publique Hongroise des Conseils.|publisher=|year=1969|isbn=|location=Rome|pages=129}}</ref></blockquote>However he stated in a letter to Lenin a few days later, on 22 April, possibly to exculpate himself from the suspicion of harbouring nationalist sentiment: <blockquote>Whatever happens, all our actions will be dictated by the interests of the world revolution. We do not think even for a moment to sacrifice the interests of the world revolution to those of one of its components. Even if we were obliged to sign a peace \u2018\u00e0 la Brest-Litovsk\u2019, we would do it with the clear conscience which inspired you when you made the Brest-Litovsk peace, concluded against my will and against the will of the Left Communists.</blockquote>Given the disparity in power between Hungary and the Allies, Hungarian chances for victory were slim at best. To buy time, Kun tried to negotiate with the Allies, meeting the British General [[Jan Smuts]] at a summit in Budapest in April. Agreement proved impossible, and Hungary [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|was soon at war]] later in April with the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], both aided by France.\n\nThe \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d was characterised from almost the beginning by harsh measures not only against the old ruling classes, but also against the peasants.The first action of the new government was the [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of the large majority of private property in Hungary. Despite their promises, B\u00e9la Kun's government chose not to redistribute land to the peasantry. Instead, all land was to be converted into [[collective farming|collective farms]] and former estate owners, managers, and [[bailiff]]s were to be retained as the new collective farm managers.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Communists remained highly unpopular in the Hungarian countryside, where they had little to no actual authority.<ref>Robin Okey (2003).

The result was catastrophic: in three weeks only 5,000 \u201cworkers\u201d had asked to enlist. Equally ineffective were the social measures, beginning with the reduction of the rental fees and wage increases immediately negated by inflation. The failures of the Communists in economic issues meant that in three weeks they were excluded from economic affairs by the ex-Socialists. The Communists, however, retained control of the political police. They unleashed terror gangs of thugs called the \u201cLenin boys\u201d who went hunting for \u201cbourgeois\u201d and \u201ccounter-revolutionaries\u201d, and committed armed robberies, kidnappings, shootings and hangings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis indiscriminate terror, in which Kun\u2019s friends, [[Tibor Szamuely]] and [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]] proved especially bloodthirsty, attracted protests from the sole representative of the Allied governments in Budapest, Italian lieutenant colonel [[Guido Romanelli]], which Kun rejected. It also had the effect of splitting the government and dividing the Communists themselves, some of whom doubted the usefulness of the atrocities committed. Kun proved unable to control his more extreme followers, particularly Jancsik, M\u00fcnnich, Szamuely and [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi|R\u00e1kosi]]. Members of the governent demanded Kun either stop the atrocities committed by his men, or face the hostility of organised workers and unions. In response Kun sent his friends as political commissars to the front where, however, the situation was not much better.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Romanians had launched an offensive on 17 April 1919 and by the end of the month they were only 60 kilometres from Budapest. On 26 April Kun was forced to admit publicly that he had made a mistake in rejecting Allied Power's proposals, and spoke of resignation. Thee leaders of the trade unions still controlled by ex-Socialists recruited an army of 50,000 men who managed to halt the Romanians and to reoccupy the most important cities which had been lost in [[Upper Hungary]]. However this victory was attributed to the People\u2019 Commissar for Defence, [[Vilmos B\u00f6hm]] and his soldiers, all of the Socialist Party, and not to the Communist political commissars R\u00e1kosi and M\u00fcnnich.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the second half of June, [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] proposed a memorandum that promised a cessation of hostilities by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] in return for an immediate evacuation of [[Upper Hungary]] by the Hungarian Army, which Kun accepted, though he stated in a speech that \u201cThe imperialist peace that we are forced to conclude will not last longer than that of Brest-Litovsk, because of the revolution that will inevitably burst out in other European countries.\u201d<ref>B\u00e9la Kun, ''La R\u00e9publique hongroise des conseils'', Budapest, 1962, p. 218.</ref> One of these \"inevitable\" revolutions was to be the insurrection Hungarian Communist agents were planning in neighbouring Austria. However Austrian police discovered the plot and arrested the organisers the day before the coup was to be carried out.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe domestic situation was rapidly worsening as a result of the regime's actions, with not only former army officers and Catholic and Protestant clergy but urban workers, the Communist's primary base of support, becoming increasingly disaffected. On 24 June, an uprising against the regime in Budapest was suppressed after twenty hours of fighting in the streets. At the same time an anarchist conspiracy was uncovered and suppressed (its members shot) in Budapest and other cities.<ref name=\":0\" /> The government retaliated with secret police, [[revolutionary tribunal (Hungary)|revolutionary tribunal]]s and semiregular detachments such as [[Tibor Szamuely]]'s bodyguards, the Lenin Boys; this renewed campaign of repression became known as the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]]. Of those arrested, an estimated 370 to about 600 were killed;<ref name=\"borsanyi2\">Borsanyi, Gyorgy ''The life of a Communist revolutionary'' pp. 197\u20138.</ref> others place the number at 590.<ref>Tibor Hajdu.

Budapest, 1979</ref> \n\nAt the front, the Hungarians had suffered repeated defeats at the hands of the Romanians. In the middle of July 1919, Hungary launched a major counter-offensive against the Romanian invasion. The Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French Marshal [[Louis Franchet d'Esperey]], wrote to Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] on 21 July 1919: \"We are convinced that the Hungarian offensive will collapse of its own accord... When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line. Two Romanian brigades will march from Romania to the front in the coming days, according to General Fertianu's promise. You see, Marshal, we have nothing to fear from the Hungarian army. I can assure you that the Hungarian Soviets will last no more than two or three weeks. And should our offensive not bring the Kun regime down, its untenable internal situation surely will.\"<ref name=\"borsanyi3\">Borsanyi, Gyorgy ''The life of a Communist revolutionary'', pp. 435\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Soviets promised to invade Romania and link up with Kun and were on the verge of doing so, but military reversals suffered by the Red Army in [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]] halted the invasion of Romania before it began. When the Romanians crossed the river Tisza at the end of July they met virtually no opposition. However by this point the regime was facing, in Kun's own words, a \u201ccrisis of power, economy and morale\u201d and most fatally, of popular support. The former Social Democrats had withdrawn completely from government; the rural peasantry were disillusioned by the unfulfilled promises of land redistribution and by the decision of the regime to pay for agricultural products in a new paper currency they did not trust. Most fatally, the \u201cindustrial proletariat\u201d in whose name the dictatorship had been established refused to fight for a cause they no longer considered their own.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe only hope for saving the Hungarian Soviet Republic had been \"the military intervention of the Red Army or on a revolution in one or more other European countries.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Both these hopes had now failed. On the 1st of August, Kun gave his last speech in Hungary, stating: <blockquote>The Hungarian proletariat betrayed not their leaders but itself. [...] If there had been in Hungary a proletariat with the consciousness of the dictatorship of the proletariat it would not collapse in this way [...] I would have liked to see the proletariat fighting on the barricades declaring that it would rather die than give up power. [...] The proletariat which continued to shout in factories, \u2018Down with the dictatorship of the proletariat\u2019, will be even less satisfied with any future government.\u201d</blockquote>He fled to Austria a few hours after, and the Romanian Army took Budapest three days later.<ref>Istvan  Deak, \"Budapest and the Hungarian Revolutions of 1918-1919.\" ''Slavonic and East European Review'' 46.106 (1968): 129-140.

Once in Russia, he rejoined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Kun was put in charge of the regional Revolutionary Committee in [[Crimea]], which during the [[Russian Civil War]] changed hands numerous times and was for a time a stronghold for the anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|White Army]]. It was in Crimea that the White Russians led by [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|General Wrangel]] fell to the [[Red Army]] in 1920.

In March 1921, he was sent to Germany to advise the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and encouraged the KPD to follow the \"Theory of the Offensive\" as supported by Zinoviev, [[August Thalheimer]], [[Paul Fr\u00f6lich]], and others which in the words of [[Ruth Fischer]] meant \"\"the working class could be moved only when set in motion by a series of offensive acts.\"<ref name=Hallas>Hallas, Duncan ''The Comintern'' pp. 62-64, Haymarket Books, 2008</ref>\n\nOn 27 March, leaders of the Communist Party of Germany decided to launch a \"revolutionary offensive\" in support of miners in central Germany. Kun along with Thallheimer were among the driving force behind the attempted revolutionary campaign known as \"M\u00e4rzaktion\" (\"[[March Action]]\"), which ultimately ended in failure.\n\nIn the end, Lenin blamed himself for appointing Kun and charged him with responsibility for the failure of the German revolution. He was considerably angered by Kun's actions and his failure to secure a general uprising in Germany. In a closed Congress of the Operative Committee <!-- (V\u00e9grehajt\u00f3 Bizotts\u00e1g) -->\u2014 as [[Victor Serge]] writes \u2014 Lenin called his actions idiotic (\"''les b\u00eatises de B\u00e9la Kun''\"). But Kun did not lose his membership in the Operative Committee, and the closing document accepted at the end of the sitting formally acknowledged the \"battle spirit\" of the German Communists.\n\nKun was not stripped of his Party offices, but the March Action was the end of the radical opposition and of the theory of \"Permanent Offensive\". Lenin wrote <blockquote>\"The final analysis of things shows that [[Paul Levi|Levi]] was politically right in many ways. The thesis of Thallheimer and B\u00e9la Kun is politically totally false. Phrases and bare attending, playing the radical leftist.\".<ref name=lenin>[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] letter to [[Grigory Zinoviev|G.

Back in Moscow, he spent much of his time feuding with other Hungarian Communist \u00e9migr\u00e9s, several of whom he denounced to the Soviet secret police, the [[OGPU]], which arrested and imprisoned them in the late 1920s and early 1930s. During the Comintern's \"Third Period\" from 1928 to 1935, Kun was a prominent supporter of the Social Fascism line that equated the moderate left as \"social fascism\", an animosity in large part owing to Kun's strained relations with the Hungarian Social Democrats, whom he believed had betrayed him sixteen years earlier.<ref name=\"Chase page 454-483\">Chase, William \"Microhistory and Mass Repression: Politics, Personalities, and Revenge in the Fall of B\u00e9la Kun\" page  454-483 from ''The Russian Review'', Volume 67, Issue # 3, July 2008 page 462.</ref> <ref name=\":0\" /> In 1934, Kun was charged with preparing the agenda for the 7th Congress of the Comintern, in which the Social Fascism line was to be abandoned and the Popular Front was to be the new line for Communists all over the world, a policy change that Kun was opposed to.

Following the collapse of the Communist regime, Kun fled to the [[Soviet Union]], where he worked as a [[functionary]] in the [[Communist International]] bureaucracy as the head of the [[Crimea]]n [[Revolutionary committee (Soviet Union)|Revolutionary Committee]] from 1920. He organised and actively participated in the [[Red Terror]] in Crimea (1920\u20131921), following which he participated in the [[March Action]] (1921), a failed Communist uprising in Germany.\n\nDuring the [[Great Purge]] of the late 1930s, Kun was arrested, interrogated, tried, and executed in quick succession. He was posthumously [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] by the Soviet regime in 1956, following the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[De-Stalinization|critical reassessment]] of [[Stalinism]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nB\u00e9la Kohn, later known as B\u00e9la Kun, was born on 20 February 1886 in the village of Lele, located near [[Cehu Silvaniei|Szil\u00e1gycseh]], [[Transylvania]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (today part of [[Hodod]], [[Romania]]). His father, Samu Kohn was a lapsed [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] village notary, while his mother, R\u00f3za Goldberger, was a Jewish convert to [[Protestantism]].<ref>Gy\u00f6rgy Bors\u00e1nyi, ''The Life of a Communist Revolutionary: B\u00e9la Kun.'' Mario D. Fenyo, trans. Boulder, CO: Social Science Monographs/Atlantic Research and Publications, 1993; pg. 1.</ref> Despite his parents' secular outlook, he was educated at the Silvania F\u0151gimn\u00e1zium in Zilah (present-day [[Silvania National College]], [[Zal\u0103u]])<ref>[http://www.cnszalau.ro/personalitati/ Personalit\u0103\u021bi]</ref> and a famous [[Reformed Church in Hungary|Reformed]] ''kollegium'' (grammar school) in the city of Kolozsv\u00e1r (modern [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]).\n\nAt the ''kollegium'' Kun won the prize for best essay on [[Hungarian literature]] that allowed him to attend a gymnasium. His essay was on the poet [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]] and the concluding paragraphs were:\n\n<blockquote>The storming rage of Pet\u0151fi's soul\u2026 turned against the privileged classes, against the people's oppressor\u2026 and confronted them with revolutionary abandon. Pet\u0151fi felt that the country would not be saved through moderation, but through the use of the most extreme means available. He detested even the thought of cowardice\u2026 Pet\u0151fi's vision was correct. There is no room for prudence in revolutions whose fate and eventual success is always decided by boldness and raw courage\u2026 this is why Pet\u0151fi condemned his compatriots for the sin of opportunism and hesitation when faced with the great problems of their age\u2026 Pet\u0151fi's works must be regarded as the law of the Hungarian soul\u2026 and of the\u2026 love of the country\".<ref name=rudolf>Tokes, Rudolf ''B\u00e9la Kun: The Man and the Revolutionary'' pp. 170\u2013207, from ''Hungary in Revolution'' edited by Ivan Volgyes, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971 p. 173.</ref></blockquote>\n\nB\u00e9la [[Magyarization|magyarized]] his birth surname, ''Kohn,'' to ''Kun'' in 1904, although the almanac of the University of Kolozsv\u00e1r still referred to him in print by his former name as late as 1909.<ref name=Life2>Bors\u00e1nyi, ''The Life of a Communist Revolutionary,'' pg. 2.</ref> There is no archival evidence that he took any formal action to change the spelling of his name, although it is clear that from 1904 all those around him referred to him as B\u00e9la Kun rather than Kohn, and he likewise used the Magyar variant in his signature.<ref name=Life2 />\n\nBefore the [[World War I|First World War]], he was a [[Muckraker|muck-raking]] journalist with sympathies for the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] in Kolozsv\u00e1r. In addition, Kun served on the Kolozsv\u00e1r Social Insurance Board, from which he was later to be accused of embezzling. He had a fiery reputation and was involved in duels several times. In May 1913 he married Ir\u00e9n G\u00e1l, a music teacher of middle-class background.\n\n===Early political career===\nDuring his early education at Kolozsv\u00e1r, Kun became friends with the poet [[Endre Ady]], who introduced him to many members of [[Budapest]]'s left-wing [[intelligentsia]].\n\nKun fought for Austria-Hungary in [[World War I]], and was captured and made a [[prisoner of war]] in 1916 by the [[Imperial Russia|Russians]]. He was sent to a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp in the [[Urals]], where he was exposed to [[Communism]]. The popular [[Russian Revolution|revolution]] in March 1917 and the subsequent Bolshevik coup the following November not only set him free but provided him with unforeseen opportunities.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Indelicato|first=Alberto|date=19 September 2017|title=TWO ITALIANS AGAINST B\u00c9LA KUN|url=http://www.hungarianreview.com/article/20170919_two_italians_against_bela_kun|journal=Hungarian Review|volume=Volume VIII, No. 5.|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\nIn March 1918, in Moscow, Kun co-founded the Hungarian Group of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]] (the predecessor to the [[Hungarian Communist Party]]) with other former Hungarian POWs.<ref name=\":0\" /> He travelled widely, including to [[Petrograd]] and Moscow. He came to know [[Vladimir Lenin]] there, but inside the party he promoted ultra-radical left-wing political opposition to Lenin and the mainstream [[Bolshevik]]s. Kun and his friends (such as the Italian [[Umberto Terracini]] and the Hungarian [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]]), aggregated around [[Grigory Zinoviev]] or [[Karl Radek]]; whereas Lenin advocated making peace with the Central Powers, despite the harsh conditions they imposed, in order to \"save the revolution\", they took the part of [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]], who wanted to continue and expand the war to transform it into an international revolutionary struggle to impose Communism on the rest of Europe.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lenin often called them \"kunerists\", and said of Kun, \u201cWe can see that this man comes from a country of poets and dreamers.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=L.|title=The Life of Lenin|publisher=|year=1965|isbn=|location=London|pages=197}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918, Kun fought for the Bolsheviks. During this time, he first started to make detailed plans for a Communist revolution in Hungary. In November 1918, with at least several hundred other Hungarian Communists and with a large sum of money provided by the Soviets, he returned to Hungary.\n\n===Hungarian People's Republic===\nIn Hungary, the resources of a shattered government were further strained by refugees from lands lost to the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] during the war, and which were due to be lost permanently under the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. Rampant [[inflation]], housing shortages, mass [[unemployment]], food shortages and coal shortages further weakened the economy and stimulated widespread protests. In October 1918, the [[Aster Revolution]] saw the inauguration the Hungarian People's Republic, under an unstable coalition government of Socialists and other radicals. The party Kun had founded with a few companions in Russia the previous March was officially re-launched eight days after his return to Budapest, on 4 November 1918.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe immediately began a highly energetic [[propaganda]] campaign against the government of President [[Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi]], and his [[Social Democrat]]ic allies, accusing them of betraying the working class, of lack of class consciousness, of not wanting to continue the expropriation of large domains and the big capital. His aim was to copy the tactics Lenin had used so successfully, which included pandering to the demands of all the discontented in society: unemployed, pensioners, veterans, employees; relentlessly denouncing the Government and the parties that supported it; as well as infiltrating the trade unions, discrediting their executives, and undermining the Socialist Party by dividing the more moderate leaders from the more extreme ones.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis speeches had a considerable impact on his audiences. One who heard such a speech wrote in his diary:\n\n<blockquote>Yesterday I heard Kun speak\u2026 it was an audacious, hateful, enthusiastic oratory. [...] He knows his audience and rules over them\u2026 Factory workers long at odds with the Social Democratic Party leaders, young intellectuals, teachers, doctors, lawyers, clerks who came to his room\u2026 meet Kun and Marxism.<ref name=rudolf2>Tokes, Rudolf ''B\u00e9la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic'' New York: F.A. Praeger, 1967 pp. 111\u20132.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition, the Communists held frequent marches and rallies and organised [[strike action|strikes]]. Desiring to achieve a revolution in Hungary, he communicated by [[telegraph]] with [[Vladimir Lenin]] to garner support from the Bolsheviks, which would ultimately not materialise.<ref name=borsanyi>Borsanyi, Gyorgy ''The life of a Communist revolutionary, B\u00e9la Kun'' Boulder, Colo: Social Science Monographs; 1993, pp. 146\u20137.</ref> \n\nDespite Kun's efforts, by February 1919 the Communists had fewer than 30,000 members, compared with the 700,000 of the Social Democrats. Kun knew that if the upcoming elections went ahead, they would be a disaster for the Communists. Therefore, the Communist press launched a campaign against a fictitious \"reactionary conspiracy\" which the K\u00e1rolyi government was either unaware of, or unwilling to crush. On 20 February 1919 the Communists invaded and pillaged the headquarters of the Socialist daily newspaper. The attack left a few dead and many injured, primarily policemen who had tried to stop the Communist aggression. Kun and 67 other Communist leaders were arrested.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, despite the apparent failure of this adventure, there were two factors that worked to Kun's advantage. First the press, even the non-socialist press, claimed that the imprisoned Communists had been mistreated by some members of the police force that supposedly wanted to avenge the death of their colleagues, and also publicised the supposedly courageous attitude of prisoner B\u00e9la Kun, a man previously little known outside his circle of followers. This greatly increased the popularity of Kun and sympathy toward the Communists among the general public. Concerned by this unintended shift in public opinion, the government gave orders that while in prison Kun be allowed to carry out any political activity he wished, which meant he was able to continue directing the Hungarian Communist Party from his cell. There were days in which Kun received up to four hundred visitors, mainly far-left Social Democrats who now considered Kun, whose stature was already increased by the prestige of participating in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, a martyr.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second was that on 19 March 1919, French Lt-Col Fernand Vix presented the \"Vix Note,\" ordering Hungarian forces to be pulled back further from where they were stationed, clearing the areas of Debrecen and Mak\u00f3. It was assumed that the military lines would be the new frontiers that would be established by the peace conference between Hungary and the Allies. The Vix Note created a massive upsurge of nationalist outrage, and the Hungarians resolved to fight the Allies rather than accept the new national borders. K\u00e1rolyi resigned, perhaps in order not to link his name to the acceptance of that imposition, and soon after a proclamation was made public in his name stating that he had voluntarily given up his powers to a \u201cnew government of the proletariat\u201d, i.e. the Socialists. Later in his life K\u00e1rolyi denied that he had made such a statement, though he did not disavow it at the time or in the following years during which he remained quietly in Hungary.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Garbai Kun.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[S\u00e1ndor Garbai]] and B\u00e9la Kun, leaders of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, 1919]]\n\nThe Social Democrats approached Kun on the subject of a coalition government, hoping he would be able to use his Soviet connections to bring the Red Army to Hungary's aid. So desperate were they for the Soviet support they believed Kun could provide that it was Kun, a captive, who dictated the terms to his captors. This was despite the [[Red Army]]'s full involvement in the Russian Civil War and the unlikelihood that it could be of any direct military assistance. Kun proposed the merger of the Social Democrat and Communist parties, the establishment of a Soviet Republic and several other radical measures, which the Social Democrats agreed to.\n\n===Hungarian Soviet Republic===\n[[File:Bela.Kun.Revolution.1919.jpg|thumb|240x240px|B\u00e9la Kun was the leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1919.|left]]\nOn 21 March 1919, the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], the second Communist regime in Europe after Russia itself, was proclaimed; the Social Democrats and Communists were merged under the interim name Hungarian Socialist Party, and B\u00e9la Kun was released from prison and sworn into office.\n\nThe nominal head of the Soviet Republic was a Socialist leader, [[S\u00e1ndor Garbai]], but in practice power rested with Kun, although officially he was only People\u2019s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and from April 1919 also People\u2019s Commissar for Defence.<ref name=\":0\" /> As he told Lenin, \"My personal influence in the Revolutionary Governing Council is such that the dictatorship of the proletariat is firmly established, since the masses are backing me.\"<ref name=\"janos\">Janos, Andrew, ''The Politics of Backwardness in Hungary'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 197.</ref>\n\nThe Social Democrats continued to hold the majority of seats in government. Of the thirty-three [[People's Commissar]]s of the Revolutionary Governing Council that ruled the Soviet Republic, fourteen were former Communists, seventeen were former Social Democrats and two had no party affiliation. With the exception of Kun, every Commissar was a former Social Democrat and every Deputy Commissar a former Communist. Despite the fact that the Socialists were by far more numerous, they passively accepted the leadership and the programme of the smaller but far more active and determined Communist Party, which claimed to represent the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the hope of placating the new Hungarian regime, the victorious Entente express willingness to bring the military demarcation to the line specified by the armistice of Belgrade the previous November, stating however that it would have no relevance to the final clauses of the peace treaty. This gesture was an undeniable success for the Socialist-Communist government which was thus offered some badly needed breathing space. However Kun rejected the proposal, declaring during a rally on 19 April: <blockquote>Comrades, we do not profess the doctrine of territorial integrity, but we want to live, and this is why we did not accept that our freed proletarian brothers living in the neutralised zone be rejected under the yoke of capitalism. To do so would deprive the Hungarian proletariat of the physical means necessary to live. [...] It is a matter, therefore, which concerns the struggle between the international revolution and the international counter-revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=B\u00e9la Kun et la R\u00e9publique Hongroise des Conseils.|publisher=|year=1969|isbn=|location=Rome|pages=129}}</ref></blockquote>However he stated in a letter to Lenin a few days later, on 22 April, possibly to exculpate himself from the suspicion of harbouring nationalist sentiment: <blockquote>Whatever happens, all our actions will be dictated by the interests of the world revolution. We do not think even for a moment to sacrifice the interests of the world revolution to those of one of its components. Even if we were obliged to sign a peace \u2018\u00e0 la Brest-Litovsk\u2019, we would do it with the clear conscience which inspired you when you made the Brest-Litovsk peace, concluded against my will and against the will of the Left Communists.</blockquote>Given the disparity in power between Hungary and the Allies, Hungarian chances for victory were slim at best. To buy time, Kun tried to negotiate with the Allies, meeting the British General [[Jan Smuts]] at a summit in Budapest in April. Agreement proved impossible, and Hungary [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|was soon at war]] later in April with the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], both aided by France.\n\nThe \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d was characterised from almost the beginning by harsh measures not only against the old ruling classes, but also against the peasants.The first action of the new government was the [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of the large majority of private property in Hungary. Despite their promises, B\u00e9la Kun's government chose not to redistribute land to the peasantry. Instead, all land was to be converted into [[collective farming|collective farms]] and former estate owners, managers, and [[bailiff]]s were to be retained as the new collective farm managers.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Communists remained highly unpopular in the Hungarian countryside, where they had little to no actual authority.<ref>Robin Okey (2003).

The result was catastrophic: in three weeks only 5,000 \u201cworkers\u201d had asked to enlist. Equally ineffective were the social measures, beginning with the reduction of the rental fees and wage increases immediately negated by inflation. The failures of the Communists in economic issues meant that in three weeks they were excluded from economic affairs by the ex-Socialists. The Communists, however, retained control of the political police. They unleashed terror gangs of thugs called the \u201cLenin boys\u201d who went hunting for \u201cbourgeois\u201d and \u201ccounter-revolutionaries\u201d, and committed armed robberies, kidnappings, shootings and hangings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis indiscriminate terror, in which Kun\u2019s friends, [[Tibor Szamuely]] and [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]] proved especially bloodthirsty, attracted protests from the sole representative of the Allied governments in Budapest, Italian lieutenant colonel [[Guido Romanelli]], which Kun rejected. It also had the effect of splitting the government and dividing the Communists themselves, some of whom doubted the usefulness of the atrocities committed. Kun proved unable to control his more extreme followers, particularly Jancsik, M\u00fcnnich, Szamuely and [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi|R\u00e1kosi]]. Members of the governent demanded Kun either stop the atrocities committed by his men, or face the hostility of organised workers and unions. In response Kun sent his friends as political commissars to the front where, however, the situation was not much better.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Romanians had launched an offensive on 17 April 1919 and by the end of the month they were only 60 kilometres from Budapest. On 26 April Kun was forced to admit publicly that he had made a mistake in rejecting Allied Power's proposals, and spoke of resignation. Thee leaders of the trade unions still controlled by ex-Socialists recruited an army of 50,000 men who managed to halt the Romanians and to reoccupy the most important cities which had been lost in [[Upper Hungary]]. However this victory was attributed to the People\u2019 Commissar for Defence, [[Vilmos B\u00f6hm]] and his soldiers, all of the Socialist Party, and not to the Communist political commissars R\u00e1kosi and M\u00fcnnich.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the second half of June, [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] proposed a memorandum that promised a cessation of hostilities by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] in return for an immediate evacuation of [[Upper Hungary]] by the Hungarian Army, which Kun accepted, though he stated in a speech that \u201cThe imperialist peace that we are forced to conclude will not last longer than that of Brest-Litovsk, because of the revolution that will inevitably burst out in other European countries.\u201d<ref>B\u00e9la Kun, ''La R\u00e9publique hongroise des conseils'', Budapest, 1962, p. 218.</ref> One of these \"inevitable\" revolutions was to be the insurrection Hungarian Communist agents were planning in neighbouring Austria. However Austrian police discovered the plot and arrested the organisers the day before the coup was to be carried out.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe domestic situation was rapidly worsening as a result of the regime's actions, with not only former army officers and Catholic and Protestant clergy but urban workers, the Communist's primary base of support, becoming increasingly disaffected. On 24 June, an uprising against the regime in Budapest was suppressed after twenty hours of fighting in the streets. At the same time an anarchist conspiracy was uncovered and suppressed (its members shot) in Budapest and other cities.<ref name=\":0\" /> The government retaliated with secret police, [[revolutionary tribunal (Hungary)|revolutionary tribunal]]s and semiregular detachments such as [[Tibor Szamuely]]'s bodyguards, the Lenin Boys; this renewed campaign of repression became known as the [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]]. Of those arrested, an estimated 370 to about 600 were killed;<ref name=\"borsanyi2\">Borsanyi, Gyorgy ''The life of a Communist revolutionary'' pp. 197\u20138.</ref> others place the number at 590.<ref>Tibor Hajdu. ''The Hungarian Soviet Republic''. Studia Historica. Vol. 131. Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. Budapest, 1979</ref> \n\nAt the front, the Hungarians had suffered repeated defeats at the hands of the Romanians. In the middle of July 1919, Hungary launched a major counter-offensive against the Romanian invasion. The Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French Marshal [[Louis Franchet d'Esperey]], wrote to Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] on 21 July 1919: \"We are convinced that the Hungarian offensive will collapse of its own accord... When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line. Two Romanian brigades will march from Romania to the front in the coming days, according to General Fertianu's promise. You see, Marshal, we have nothing to fear from the Hungarian army. I can assure you that the Hungarian Soviets will last no more than two or three weeks. And should our offensive not bring the Kun regime down, its untenable internal situation surely will.\"<ref name=\"borsanyi3\">Borsanyi, Gyorgy ''The life of a Communist revolutionary'', pp. 435\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe Soviets promised to invade Romania and link up with Kun and were on the verge of doing so, but military reversals suffered by the Red Army in [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]] halted the invasion of Romania before it began. When the Romanians crossed the river Tisza at the end of July they met virtually no opposition. However by this point the regime was facing, in Kun's own words, a \u201ccrisis of power, economy and morale\u201d and most fatally, of popular support. The former Social Democrats had withdrawn completely from government; the rural peasantry were disillusioned by the unfulfilled promises of land redistribution and by the decision of the regime to pay for agricultural products in a new paper currency they did not trust. Most fatally, the \u201cindustrial proletariat\u201d in whose name the dictatorship had been established refused to fight for a cause they no longer considered their own.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe only hope for saving the Hungarian Soviet Republic had been \"the military intervention of the Red Army or on a revolution in one or more other European countries.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Both these hopes had now failed. On the 1st of August, Kun gave his last speech in Hungary, stating: <blockquote>The Hungarian proletariat betrayed not their leaders but itself. [...] If there had been in Hungary a proletariat with the consciousness of the dictatorship of the proletariat it would not collapse in this way [...] I would have liked to see the proletariat fighting on the barricades declaring that it would rather die than give up power. [...] The proletariat which continued to shout in factories, \u2018Down with the dictatorship of the proletariat\u2019, will be even less satisfied with any future government.\u201d</blockquote>He fled to Austria a few hours after, and the Romanian Army took Budapest three days later.<ref>Istvan  Deak, \"Budapest and the Hungarian Revolutions of 1918-1919.\" ''Slavonic and East European Review'' 46.106 (1968): 129-140. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4205930 in JSTOR]</ref> Historian and former Italian diplomat to Hungary Alberto Indelicato attributed the downfall of the regime not to external military intervention by the allies, but by the regime's own internal flaws, stating<blockquote>Whereas the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d could be proclaimed as a result of international political events which weighed heavily on the whole affair, the fall of \u201cthe Republic of Councils\u201d did not occur because of the intervention of the reactionary circles of the Entente or of the \u201cWhite\u201d Hungarian counter- revolution (as a Communist legend maintains and is still affirmed by some partisan historians), but because of its inherent weaknesses, the consequence of its internal, social and economic policies.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Activity in Crimea===\n[[File:B\u00e9la Kun, Jacques Sadoul, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Frunze, Sergey Gusev 1920.jpg|left|thumb|From left: B\u00e9la Kun, [[Jacques Sadoul (politician)|Jacques Sadoul]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Mikhail Frunze]] and [[Sergey Ivanovich Gusev|Sergey Gusev]]. Kharkiv Ukraine 1920. [[Russian Civil War]].]]\nB\u00e9la Kun went into exile in [[Vienna]], then controlled by the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]]. He was captured and interned in Austria, but was released in exchange for Austrian prisoners in Russia in July 1920. He never returned to Hungary. Once in Russia, he rejoined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. Kun was put in charge of the regional Revolutionary Committee in [[Crimea]], which during the [[Russian Civil War]] changed hands numerous times and was for a time a stronghold for the anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|White Army]]. It was in Crimea that the White Russians led by [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|General Wrangel]] fell to the [[Red Army]] in 1920. About 50,000 prisoners of war and anti-Bolshevik civilians who had surrendered after they had been promised amnesty, were subsequently executed, on Kun and [[Rosalia Zemlyachka]]'s order, with Lenin's approval.<ref>[[Donald Rayfield]].

In March 1921, he was sent to Germany to advise the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and encouraged the KPD to follow the \"Theory of the Offensive\" as supported by Zinoviev, [[August Thalheimer]], [[Paul Fr\u00f6lich]], and others which in the words of [[Ruth Fischer]] meant \"\"the working class could be moved only when set in motion by a series of offensive acts.\"<ref name=Hallas>Hallas, Duncan ''The Comintern'' pp. 62-64, Haymarket Books, 2008</ref>\n\nOn 27 March, leaders of the Communist Party of Germany decided to launch a \"revolutionary offensive\" in support of miners in central Germany. Kun along with Thallheimer were among the driving force behind the attempted revolutionary campaign known as \"M\u00e4rzaktion\" (\"[[March Action]]\"), which ultimately ended in failure.\n\nIn the end, Lenin blamed himself for appointing Kun and charged him with responsibility for the failure of the German revolution. He was considerably angered by Kun's actions and his failure to secure a general uprising in Germany. In a closed Congress of the Operative Committee <!-- (V\u00e9grehajt\u00f3 Bizotts\u00e1g) -->\u2014 as [[Victor Serge]] writes \u2014 Lenin called his actions idiotic (\"''les b\u00eatises de B\u00e9la Kun''\"). But Kun did not lose his membership in the Operative Committee, and the closing document accepted at the end of the sitting formally acknowledged the \"battle spirit\" of the German Communists.\n\nKun was not stripped of his Party offices, but the March Action was the end of the radical opposition and of the theory of \"Permanent Offensive\". Lenin wrote <blockquote>\"The final analysis of things shows that [[Paul Levi|Levi]] was politically right in many ways. The thesis of Thallheimer and B\u00e9la Kun is politically totally false. Phrases and bare attending, playing the radical leftist.\".<ref name=lenin>[[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] letter to [[Grigory Zinoviev|G. Zinoviev]]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThroughout the 1920s Kun was a prominent Comintern operative, serving mostly in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, but his notoriety ultimately stopped him being useful for undercover work.\n\n===Later career===\nKun's final undercover assignment ended in 1928 when he was arrested in Vienna by the local police for travelling on a forged passport. Back in Moscow, he spent much of his time feuding with other Hungarian Communist \u00e9migr\u00e9s, several of whom he denounced to the Soviet secret police, the [[OGPU]], which arrested and imprisoned them in the late 1920s and early 1930s. During the Comintern's \"Third Period\" from 1928 to 1935, Kun was a prominent supporter of the Social Fascism line that equated the moderate left as \"social fascism\", an animosity in large part owing to Kun's strained relations with the Hungarian Social Democrats, whom he believed had betrayed him sixteen years earlier.<ref name=\"Chase page 454-483\">Chase, William \"Microhistory and Mass Repression: Politics, Personalities, and Revenge in the Fall of B\u00e9la Kun\" page  454-483 from ''The Russian Review'', Volume 67, Issue # 3, July 2008 page 462.</ref> <ref name=\":0\" /> In 1934, Kun was charged with preparing the agenda for the 7th Congress of the Comintern, in which the Social Fascism line was to be abandoned and the Popular Front was to be the new line for Communists all over the world, a policy change that Kun was opposed to. Instead of submitting to party discipline, Kun did his best to sabotage the adoption of the Popular Front policy, which led to him being formally sanctioned for insubordination.<ref name=\"Chase page 454-483\"/> In 1935-36, the leadership of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Hungarian Communist Party was thrown into crisis as Kun sought to prevent the adoption of the Popular Front policy, which occasioned a vigorous round of party in-fighting.<ref>Chase, William \"Microhistory and Mass Repression: Politics, Personalities, and Revenge in the Fall of B\u00e9la Kun\" page  454-483 from ''The Russian Review'', Volume 67, Issue # 3, July 2008 pages 463-464.</ref> Beyond policy, there was also a clash of personalities as Kun's abrasive and autocratic leadership style had left him with many enemies, who saw the dispute over whether the Hungarian Communist Party was to adopt the Popular Front strategy as a chance to bring down Kun, who many Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9s deeply hated.<ref>Chase, William \"Microhistory and Mass Repression: Politics, Personalities, and Revenge in the Fall of B\u00e9la Kun\" page  454-483 from ''The Russian Review'', Volume 67, Issue # 3, July 2008 pages 464-465.</ref> Hiss embattled position led Kun to denounce one of his leading enemies in the Comintern, [[Dmitry Manuilsky]] who was sympathetic to the anti-Kun faction, to the NKVD as a \"Trotskyite\", who in his turn had also denounced Kun to the NKVD as a \"Trotskyite\".<ref>Chase, William \"Microhistory and Mass Repression: Politics, Personalities, and Revenge in the Fall of B\u00e9la Kun\" page  454-483 from ''The Russian Review'', Volume 67, Issue # 3, July 2008 page 471.</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n[[File:Bela Kun NKVD.jpg|thumb|185px|B\u00e9la Kun after arrest by [[NKVD]] 1937]]\nDuring the [[Great Purge]] of the late 1930s, Kun was accused of [[Trotskyism]] and arrested on 28 June 1937.<ref name=Memorial>L.I.

The sentence was carried out later the same day at the [[Kommunarka shooting ground]].<ref name=Memorial />\n\nWhen Kun was politically rehabilitated in 1956, as part of the [[de-Stalinization]] process, the Soviet Communist Party told its Hungarian counterpart that Kun had died in prison on 30 November 1939.

[[Fossil]] evidence suggests that diatoms originated during or before the early [[Jurassic period]], which was about 150 to 200 million years ago.\n\nDiatoms are used to monitor past and present environmental conditions, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.  [[Diatomaceous earth]] (diatomite) is a collection of diatom shells found in the earth's crust. They are soft, silica-containing sedimentary rocks which are easily crumbled into a fine powder and typically have a particle size of 10 to 200 \u03bcm.

This material is then extruded to the cell exterior and added to the wall. In most species, when a diatom divides to produce two daughter cells, each cell keeps one of the two-halves and grows a smaller half within it. As a result, after each division cycle, the average size of diatom cells in the population gets smaller. Once such cells reach a certain minimum size, rather than simply divide, they reverse this decline by forming an [[auxospore]]. This expands in size to give rise to a much larger cell, which then returns to size-diminishing divisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Auxospore production is almost always linked to [[meiosis]] and sexual reproduction.\n\nThe exact mechanism of transferring [[silica]] absorbed by the diatom to the [[cell wall]] is unknown. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from the search for the mechanism of silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the [[frustule]]. The most success in this area has come from two species, ''[[Thalassiosira pseudonana]]'', which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and ''Cylindrotheca fusiformis'', in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered.<ref name=\"hildebrand06\">{{cite journal|last1=Thamatrakoln|first1=K.|title=Comparative Sequence Analysis of Diatom Silicon Transporters: Toward a Mechanistic Model of Silicon Transport|last2=Alverson|first2=A.J.|last3=Hildebrand|first3=M.|journal=Journal of Phycology|date=2006|volume=42|issue=4|pages=822\u2013834|doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00233.x}}</ref> Silaffins, sets of polycationic [[peptides]], were found in ''C. fusiformis'' cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures.

The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.\n\nThese silica transport proteins are unique to diatoms, with no [[homologs]] found in other species, such as sponges or rice. The divergence of these silica transport genes is also indicative of the structure of the protein evolving from two repeated units composed of five membrane bound segments, which indicates either gene duplication or [[Protein dimer|dimerization]].<ref name=\"hildebrand06\" /> The silica deposition that takes place from the membrane bound vesicle in diatoms has been hypothesized to be a result of the activity of silaffins and long chain polyamines.  This Silica Deposition Vesicle (SDV) has been characterized as an acidic compartment fused with Golgi-derived vesicles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kroger|first1=Nils|title=Handbook of Biomineralization: Biological Aspects and Structure Formation|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH|location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=chapter 3}}</ref> These two protein structures have been shown to create sheets of patterned silica [[in-vivo]] with irregular pores on the scale of diatom [[frustules]]. One hypothesis as to how these proteins work to create complex structure is that residues are conserved within the SDV's, which is unfortunately difficult to identify or observe due to the limited number of diverse sequences available. Though the exact mechanism of the highly uniform deposition of silica is as yet unknown, the ''Thalassiosira pseudonana'' genes linked to silaffins are being looked to as targets for genetic control of nanoscale silica deposition.\n\n===Urea cycle===\nA feature of diatoms is the [[urea cycle]], which links them evolutionarily to animals. This was discovered in research carried out by Andrew Allen, Chris Bowler and colleagues. Their findings, published in 2011, that diatoms have a functioning urea cycle was highly significant, since prior to this, the urea cycle was thought to have originated with the [[metazoans]] which appeared several hundreds of millions of years after the diatoms. Their study showed that while diatoms and animals use the urea cycle for different ends, they are seen to be evolutionarily linked in such a way that animals and plants are not.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature10074 |pmid=21562560 |laysource=Science Daily |laydate=12 May 2011 |lay-url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110511133553.htm |title=Evolution and metabolic significance of the urea cycle in photosynthetic diatoms |journal=Nature |volume=473 |issue=7346 |pages=203\u20137 |year=2011 |last1=Allen |first1=Andrew E. |last2=Dupont |first2=Christopher L. |last3=Oborn\u00edk |first3=Miroslav |last4=Hor\u00e1k |first4=Ale\u0161 |last5=Nunes-Nesi |first5=Adriano |last6=McCrow |first6=John P. |last7=Zheng |first7=Hong |last8=Johnson |first8=Daniel A. |last9=Hu |first9=Hanhua |last10=Fernie |first10=Alisdair R. |last11=Bowler |first11=Chris |bibcode=2011Natur.473..203A }}</ref>\n\n===Pigments===\nMajor [[pigment]]s of diatoms are [[chlorophylls]] a and c, [[beta-carotene]], [[fucoxanthin]], diatoxanthin and diadinoxanthin.<ref name=\"HasleSyvertsen1996\" />\n\n===Storage products===\nStorage products are [[chrysolaminarin]] and [[lipids]].<ref name=\"Horner2002\" />\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Centric diatom life-cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a centric diatom ([[oogamy]])]]\n[[File:Diatom pennate life cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a pinnate diatom (morphological [[isogamy]], physiological [[anisogamy]])]]\n\n===Reproduction and cell size===\nReproduction among these organisms is asexual by [[binary fission]], during which the diatom divides into two parts, producing two \"new\" diatoms with identical genes. Each new organism receives one of the two [[frustule]]s \u2013 one larger, the other smaller \u2013 possessed by the parent, which is now called the [[epitheca]]; and is used to construct a second, smaller frustule, the [[hypotheca]]. The diatom that received the larger frustule becomes the same size as its parent, but the diatom that received the smaller frustule remains smaller than its parent.

The zygote sheds its silica theca and grows into a large sphere covered by an organic membrane, the auxospore.

Each one of their valves have openings that are slits along the [[raphe]]s and their shells are typically elongated parallel to these raphes. They generate cell movement through cytoplasm that streams along the raphes, always moving along solid surfaces.\n\nCentric diatoms are radially symmetric. They are composed of upper and lower valves \u2013 ''epitheca'' and ''hypotheca'' \u2013 each consisting of a valve and a girdle band that can easily slide underneath each other and expand to increase cell content over the diatoms progression. The cytoplasm of the centric diatom is located along the inner surface of the shell and provides a hollow lining around the large vacuole located in the center of the cell. This large, central vacuole is filled by a fluid known as \"cell sap\" which is similar to seawater but varies with specific ion content. The cytoplasmic layer is home to several organelles, like the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Before the centric diatom begins to expand, its nucleus is at the center of one of the valves and begins to move towards the center of the cytoplasmic layer before division is complete. Centric diatoms have a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on from which axis the shell extends, and if spines are present.\n\n[[File:Shape classification of diatom frustules.png|thumb|400px|left| {{center|Shape classification of diatom frustules.

Comparison of the ''T. pseudonana'' proteins with homologs in other organisms suggested that hundreds have their closest homologs in the Plantae lineage. EGT towards diatom genomes can be illustrated by the fact that the ''T. pseudonana'' genome encodes six proteins which are most closely related to genes encoded by the ''[[Guillardia theta]]'' ([[cryptomonad]]) [[nucleomorph]] genome. Four of these genes are also found in red algal plastid genomes, thus demonstrating successive EGT from red algal plastid to red algal nucleus (nucleomorph) to heterokont host nucleus.<ref name=\"armbrust04\" /> More recent [[phylogenomics|phylogenomic analyses]] of diatom proteomes provided evidence for a [[prasinophyte]]-like endosymbiont in the common ancestor of [[chromalveolates]] as supported by the fact the 70% of diatom genes of Plantae origin are of green lineage provenance and that such genes are also found in the genome of other [[stramenopile]]s. Therefore, it was proposed that chromalveolates are the product of serial secondary [[endosymbiosis]] first with a [[green algae]], followed by a second one with a [[red algae]] that conserved the genomic footprints of the previous but displaced the green plastid.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1172983 |pmid=19556510 |title=Genomic Footprints of a Cryptic Plastid Endosymbiosis in Diatoms |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5935 |pages=1724\u20136 |year=2009 |last1=Moustafa |first1=A. |last2=Beszteri |first2=B. |last3=Maier |first3=U.

This diatom is native to Europe and is an [[invasive species]] both in the [[antipodes]] and in parts of [[North America]].<ref>[http://alienspecies.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/eng/species/didymo-rock-snot Didymo, Aliens Among Us.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007110108/http://alienspecies.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/eng/species/didymo-rock-snot |date=7 October 2015 }} Virtual Exhibit of the [[Virtual Museum of Canada]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?A=4013&Q=476204 |title=DEP Reports Didymo Discovered in the West Branch Farmington River.

This sinking is induced by either a loss of buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy ''resting spores''. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell [[metabolism]]). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the [[thermocline]].\n\nUltimately, diatom cells in these resting populations re-enter the upper mixed layer when vertical mixing entrains them. In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients in the upper mixed layer, setting the scene for the next round of diatom blooms. In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous [[upwelling]]<ref name=dugdale98>{{cite journal | last1 = Dugdale | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Wilkerson | first2 = F.

In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.\n\nIn the open ocean, the diatom (spring) bloom is typically ended by a shortage of silicon. Unlike other minerals, the requirement for silicon is unique to diatoms and it is not regenerated in the plankton ecosystem as efficiently as, for instance, [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]] nutrients. This can be seen in maps of surface nutrient concentrations \u2013 as nutrients decline along gradients, silicon is usually the first to be exhausted (followed normally by nitrogen then phosphorus).\n\nBecause of this bloom-and-bust cycle, diatoms are believed to play a disproportionately important role in the export of carbon from oceanic surface waters<ref name=dugdale98 /><ref name=smetacek85>{{cite journal | last1 = Smetacek | first1 = V.

More generally, notwithstanding these possible advantages conferred by their use of silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of the same corresponding size.<ref name=furnas90 />\n\n===Sources for collection===\nDiatoms may be obtained from multiple sources.<ref name=chamberlain1901>Chamberlain, C. J. (1901)  ''Methods in Plant Histology'', University of Chicago Press, USA</ref>\n\n====Marine====\nMarine diatoms can be collected by direct water sampling, and benthic forms can be secured by scraping [[barnacle]]s, [[oyster]] and other shells.\n\n====Fresh waters====\nDiatoms are frequently present as a brown, slippery coating on submerged stones and sticks, and may be seen to \"stream\" with river current. The surface mud of a pond, ditch, or lagoon will almost always yield some diatoms.\n\n====Algae and plants====\nLiving diatoms are often found clinging in great numbers to filamentous algae, or forming gelatinous masses on various submerged plants. ''[[Cladophora]]'' is frequently covered with ''[[Cocconeis]]'', an elliptically shaped diatom; ''[[Vaucheria]]'' is often covered with small forms.\n\n====Animal alimentary tracts====\nSince diatoms form an important part of the food of [[mollusc]]s, [[tunicate]]s, and [[fish]]es, the [[alimentary tract]]s of these animals often yield forms that are not easily secured in other ways.\n\n====Cultivation====\nDiatoms can be made to emerge by filling a jar with water and mud, wrapping it in black paper and letting direct sunlight fall on the surface of the water. Within a day, the diatoms will come to the top in a scum and can be isolated.\n\n==Human uses==\n===Paleontology===\nDecomposition and decay of diatoms leads to [[organic matter|organic]] and [[inorganic]] (in the form of [[silicate]]s) sediment, the inorganic component of which can lead to a method of analyzing past marine environments by corings of ocean floors or [[bay mud]]s, since the inorganic matter is embedded in deposition of [[clay]]s and [[silt]]s and forms a permanent geological record of such marine strata.

Laboratory tests may reveal the presence of diatoms in the body. Since the silica-based skeletons of diatoms do not readily decay, they can sometimes be detected even in heavily decomposed bodies. As they do not occur naturally in the body, if laboratory tests show diatoms in the corpse that are of the same species found in the water where the body was recovered, then it may be good [[evidence]] of drowning as the [[cause of death]].  The blend of diatom species found in a corpse may be the same or different from the surrounding water, indicating whether the victim drowned in the same site in which the body was found.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00000433-199109000-00009 |pmid=1750392 |title=Qualitative Diatom Analysis as a Tool to Diagnose Drowning |journal=The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=213\u20138 |year=1991 |last1=Auer |first1=Antti }}</ref>\n\n=== Nanotechnology  ===\nThe deposition of silica by diatoms may also prove to be of utility to [[nanotechnology]].<ref name=bradbury04>{{cite journal | last1 = Bradbury | first1 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Nature's Nanotechnologists: Unveiling the Secrets of Diatoms | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 10| pages = 1512\u20131515 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020306 | pmid=15486572 | pmc=521728}} {{open access}}</ref> Diatom cells repeatedly and reliably manufacture valves of various shapes and sizes, potentially allowing diatoms to manufacture micro- or nano-scale structures which may be of use in a range of devices, including: optical systems; [[semiconductor]] [[nanolithography]]; and even vehicles for [[drug delivery]].

This endosymbiont has lost its photosynthetic properties, but has kept its ability to perform [[nitrogen fixation]], allowing the diatom to fix atmospheric nitrogen.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 4128115|year = 2014|last1 = Nakayama|first1 = T.|title = Complete genome of a nonphotosynthetic cyanobacterium in a diatom reveals recent adaptations to an intracellular lifestyle|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume = 111|issue = 31|pages = 11407\u201311412|last2 = Kamikawa|first2 = R.|last3 = Tanifuji|first3 = G.|last4 = Kashiyama|first4 = Y.|last5 = Ohkouchi|first5 = N.|last6 = Archibald|first6 = J.

Diatoms are classified as [[eukaryote]]s, organisms with a [[nuclear membrane|membrane-bound]] [[cell nucleus]], that separates them from the [[prokaryote]]s [[archaea]] and [[bacteria]]. Diatoms are a type of [[plankton]] called [[phytoplankton]], the most common of the plankton types.

Several systems for classifying the individual diatom [[species]] exist. [[Fossil]] evidence suggests that diatoms originated during or before the early [[Jurassic period]], which was about 150 to 200 million years ago.\n\nDiatoms are used to monitor past and present environmental conditions, and are commonly used in studies of water quality.  [[Diatomaceous earth]] (diatomite) is a collection of diatom shells found in the earth's crust. They are soft, silica-containing sedimentary rocks which are easily crumbled into a fine powder and typically have a particle size of 10 to 200 \u03bcm. Diatomaceous earth is used for a variety of purposes including for water filtration, as a mild abrasive, in cat litter, and as a dynamite stabilizer.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Diatom Anatomy.svg|thumb|left|300px| Diagrammatic representation of a diatom.<br />1) [[Cell nucleus|Nucleus]]; holds the genetic material<br />2) [[Nucleolus]]; Location of the [[chromosome]]s<br />3) [[Golgi complex]]; modifies [[protein]]s and sends them out of the cell<br />4) [[Cell Wall]]; Outer membrane of the cell<br />5) [[Pyrenoid]]; center of [[carbon fixation]]<br />6) [[Chromatophore]]; pigment carrying membrane structure<br />7) [[Vacuole]]s; vesicle of a cell that contains fluid bound by a membrane<br />8) Cytoplasmic strands; hold the nucleus<br />9) [[Mitochondria]]; create [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (energy) for the cell<br />10) Valves/Striae; allow nutrients in, and waste out, of the cell]]\n[[File:20110123 185042 Diatom.jpg|thumb|255px|Light microscopy of a living diatom.&nbsp; Numbered graduations are 10 micrometres apart]]\n\n[[File:Surirella spiralis - SEM MUSE - sharpened.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|{{center|Scanning electron microscope image of the diatom ''Surirella spiralis''}}]]\n\nDiatoms are 2 to 200 micrometers in length.<ref name=\"HasleSyvertsen1996\" /> Their yellowish-brown [[chloroplast]]s, the site of photosynthesis, are typical of [[heterokont]]s, having four [[plasma membrane|membranes]] and containing [[biological pigment|pigments]] such as the [[carotenoid]] [[fucoxanthin]].

This material is then extruded to the cell exterior and added to the wall. In most species, when a diatom divides to produce two daughter cells, each cell keeps one of the two-halves and grows a smaller half within it. As a result, after each division cycle, the average size of diatom cells in the population gets smaller. Once such cells reach a certain minimum size, rather than simply divide, they reverse this decline by forming an [[auxospore]]. This expands in size to give rise to a much larger cell, which then returns to size-diminishing divisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Auxospore production is almost always linked to [[meiosis]] and sexual reproduction.\n\nThe exact mechanism of transferring [[silica]] absorbed by the diatom to the [[cell wall]] is unknown. Much of the sequencing of diatom genes comes from the search for the mechanism of silica uptake and deposition in nano-scale patterns in the [[frustule]]. The most success in this area has come from two species, ''[[Thalassiosira pseudonana]]'', which has become the model species, as the whole genome was sequenced and methods for genetic control were established, and ''Cylindrotheca fusiformis'', in which the important silica deposition proteins silaffins were first discovered.<ref name=\"hildebrand06\">{{cite journal|last1=Thamatrakoln|first1=K.|title=Comparative Sequence Analysis of Diatom Silicon Transporters: Toward a Mechanistic Model of Silicon Transport|last2=Alverson|first2=A.J.|last3=Hildebrand|first3=M.|journal=Journal of Phycology|date=2006|volume=42|issue=4|pages=822\u2013834|doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2006.00233.x}}</ref> Silaffins, sets of polycationic [[peptides]], were found in ''C. fusiformis'' cell walls and can generate intricate silica structures. These structures demonstrated pores of sizes characteristic to diatom patterns.

The sequences compared in this study were used to create a diverse background in order to identify residues that differentiate function in the silica deposition process. Additionally, the same study found that a number of the regions were conserved within species, likely the base structure of silica transport.\n\nThese silica transport proteins are unique to diatoms, with no [[homologs]] found in other species, such as sponges or rice. The divergence of these silica transport genes is also indicative of the structure of the protein evolving from two repeated units composed of five membrane bound segments, which indicates either gene duplication or [[Protein dimer|dimerization]].<ref name=\"hildebrand06\" /> The silica deposition that takes place from the membrane bound vesicle in diatoms has been hypothesized to be a result of the activity of silaffins and long chain polyamines.  This Silica Deposition Vesicle (SDV) has been characterized as an acidic compartment fused with Golgi-derived vesicles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kroger|first1=Nils|title=Handbook of Biomineralization: Biological Aspects and Structure Formation|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH|location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=chapter 3}}</ref> These two protein structures have been shown to create sheets of patterned silica [[in-vivo]] with irregular pores on the scale of diatom [[frustules]]. One hypothesis as to how these proteins work to create complex structure is that residues are conserved within the SDV's, which is unfortunately difficult to identify or observe due to the limited number of diverse sequences available. Though the exact mechanism of the highly uniform deposition of silica is as yet unknown, the ''Thalassiosira pseudonana'' genes linked to silaffins are being looked to as targets for genetic control of nanoscale silica deposition.\n\n===Urea cycle===\nA feature of diatoms is the [[urea cycle]], which links them evolutionarily to animals. This was discovered in research carried out by Andrew Allen, Chris Bowler and colleagues. Their findings, published in 2011, that diatoms have a functioning urea cycle was highly significant, since prior to this, the urea cycle was thought to have originated with the [[metazoans]] which appeared several hundreds of millions of years after the diatoms. Their study showed that while diatoms and animals use the urea cycle for different ends, they are seen to be evolutionarily linked in such a way that animals and plants are not.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature10074 |pmid=21562560 |laysource=Science Daily |laydate=12 May 2011 |lay-url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110511133553.htm |title=Evolution and metabolic significance of the urea cycle in photosynthetic diatoms |journal=Nature |volume=473 |issue=7346 |pages=203\u20137 |year=2011 |last1=Allen |first1=Andrew E. |last2=Dupont |first2=Christopher L. |last3=Oborn\u00edk |first3=Miroslav |last4=Hor\u00e1k |first4=Ale\u0161 |last5=Nunes-Nesi |first5=Adriano |last6=McCrow |first6=John P. |last7=Zheng |first7=Hong |last8=Johnson |first8=Daniel A. |last9=Hu |first9=Hanhua |last10=Fernie |first10=Alisdair R. |last11=Bowler |first11=Chris |bibcode=2011Natur.473..203A }}</ref>\n\n===Pigments===\nMajor [[pigment]]s of diatoms are [[chlorophylls]] a and c, [[beta-carotene]], [[fucoxanthin]], diatoxanthin and diadinoxanthin.<ref name=\"HasleSyvertsen1996\" />\n\n===Storage products===\nStorage products are [[chrysolaminarin]] and [[lipids]].<ref name=\"Horner2002\" />\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Centric diatom life-cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a centric diatom ([[oogamy]])]]\n[[File:Diatom pennate life cycle.jpg|thumb|200px|Sexual reproduction of a pinnate diatom (morphological [[isogamy]], physiological [[anisogamy]])]]\n\n===Reproduction and cell size===\nReproduction among these organisms is asexual by [[binary fission]], during which the diatom divides into two parts, producing two \"new\" diatoms with identical genes.

Each one of their valves have openings that are slits along the [[raphe]]s and their shells are typically elongated parallel to these raphes. They generate cell movement through cytoplasm that streams along the raphes, always moving along solid surfaces.\n\nCentric diatoms are radially symmetric. They are composed of upper and lower valves \u2013 ''epitheca'' and ''hypotheca'' \u2013 each consisting of a valve and a girdle band that can easily slide underneath each other and expand to increase cell content over the diatoms progression. The cytoplasm of the centric diatom is located along the inner surface of the shell and provides a hollow lining around the large vacuole located in the center of the cell. This large, central vacuole is filled by a fluid known as \"cell sap\" which is similar to seawater but varies with specific ion content. The cytoplasmic layer is home to several organelles, like the chloroplasts and mitochondria. Before the centric diatom begins to expand, its nucleus is at the center of one of the valves and begins to move towards the center of the cytoplasmic layer before division is complete. Centric diatoms have a variety of shapes and sizes, depending on from which axis the shell extends, and if spines are present.\n\n[[File:Shape classification of diatom frustules.png|thumb|400px|left| {{center|Shape classification of diatom frustules.

Consequently, diatoms are ranked anywhere from a class, usually called '''Diatomophyceae''' or '''Bacillariophyceae''', to a division, usually called '''Bacillariophyta''', with corresponding changes in the ranks of their subgroups.\n\n====Genera and species====\nMore than 200 [[genus|genera]] of living diatoms are known, with an estimated 100,000 [[Extant taxon|extant]] [[species]].<ref name=\"HasleSyvertsen1996\">{{cite book|author1=Grethe R.

Comparison of the ''T. pseudonana'' proteins with homologs in other organisms suggested that hundreds have their closest homologs in the Plantae lineage. EGT towards diatom genomes can be illustrated by the fact that the ''T. pseudonana'' genome encodes six proteins which are most closely related to genes encoded by the ''[[Guillardia theta]]'' ([[cryptomonad]]) [[nucleomorph]] genome. Four of these genes are also found in red algal plastid genomes, thus demonstrating successive EGT from red algal plastid to red algal nucleus (nucleomorph) to heterokont host nucleus.<ref name=\"armbrust04\" /> More recent [[phylogenomics|phylogenomic analyses]] of diatom proteomes provided evidence for a [[prasinophyte]]-like endosymbiont in the common ancestor of [[chromalveolates]] as supported by the fact the 70% of diatom genes of Plantae origin are of green lineage provenance and that such genes are also found in the genome of other [[stramenopile]]s. Therefore, it was proposed that chromalveolates are the product of serial secondary [[endosymbiosis]] first with a [[green algae]], followed by a second one with a [[red algae]] that conserved the genomic footprints of the previous but displaced the green plastid.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1172983 |pmid=19556510 |title=Genomic Footprints of a Cryptic Plastid Endosymbiosis in Diatoms |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5935 |pages=1724\u20136 |year=2009 |last1=Moustafa |first1=A. |last2=Beszteri |first2=B. |last3=Maier |first3=U.

This sinking is induced by either a loss of buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage that sticks diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy ''resting spores''. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell [[metabolism]]). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the [[thermocline]].\n\nUltimately, diatom cells in these resting populations re-enter the upper mixed layer when vertical mixing entrains them. In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients in the upper mixed layer, setting the scene for the next round of diatom blooms. In the open ocean (away from areas of continuous [[upwelling]]<ref name=dugdale98>{{cite journal | last1 = Dugdale | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Wilkerson | first2 = F.

In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.\n\nIn the open ocean, the diatom (spring) bloom is typically ended by a shortage of silicon. Unlike other minerals, the requirement for silicon is unique to diatoms and it is not regenerated in the plankton ecosystem as efficiently as, for instance, [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]] nutrients. This can be seen in maps of surface nutrient concentrations \u2013 as nutrients decline along gradients, silicon is usually the first to be exhausted (followed normally by nitrogen then phosphorus).\n\nBecause of this bloom-and-bust cycle, diatoms are believed to play a disproportionately important role in the export of carbon from oceanic surface waters<ref name=dugdale98 /><ref name=smetacek85>{{cite journal | last1 = Smetacek | first1 = V.

Her older half-brother, [[Caesarion]], was the son of her mother and her first partner, [[Julius Caesar]]. Cleopatra most likely planned her only daughter to marry her eldest son Caesarion. Her father also had five other children with previous wives.\n\nHer parents, [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII]], were defeated by Octavian (future [[Roman Emperor]] Caesar [[Augustus]]), during a naval [[Battle of Actium|battle]] at [[Actium]], [[Greece]] in 31 BC. In 30 BC, her parents committed suicide as Octavian and his army invaded Egypt. Octavian captured Cleopatra Selene and her brothers and took them from [[Egypt]] to [[Rome]], parading them in heavy golden chains in his [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. The chains were so heavy that the children were unable to walk in them, eliciting unexpected sympathy from many of the Roman onlookers.

A discovered hoard of Cleopatra's coins was dated at 17 AD. It has traditionally been believed that Cleopatra was alive to mint them; however, this would mean that Juba married the [[Cappadocia]]n Princess, [[Glaphyra]] during Cleopatra's lifetime. Historians generally assume that Juba, being a thoroughly Romanized king, would not have taken a second wife, arguing that if Juba married Glaphyra before 4 AD, then his first wife, Cleopatra, must have already been dead.<ref>Roller, p. 249\u201351</ref> However, even contemporary client kings with Roman citizenship, such as [[Herod the Great]], took multiple wives, and Juba's father had more than one. It is also possible that Cleopatra and Juba separated for a time, and their rift was eventually mended after Juba's divorce from Glaphyra.\n\nThe following epigram by Greek [[Epigram]]matist [[Crinagoras of Mytilene]] is considered to be Cleopatra's eulogy.<ref>Roller, p. 249\u201351</ref>\n\n:''The moon herself grew dark, rising at sunset,\n:''Covering her suffering in the night,\n:''Because she saw her beautiful namesake, Selene,\n:''Breathless, descending to Hades,\n:''With her she had had the beauty of her light in common,\n:''And mingled her own darkness with her death.\n\nIf this poem is not simply literary license, then astronomical correlation can be used to help pinpoint the date of Cleopatra's death. Lunar eclipses occurred in 9, 8, 5 and 1 BC and in AD 3, 7, 10, 11 and 14. The event in 5 BC most closely resembles the description given in the eulogy.<ref>Ancey, pp. 139-141</ref> However, the date of her death is simply not ascertainable with any certainty.  [[Zahi Hawass]], former Director of Egyptian Antiquities, believes Cleopatra died in AD 8.<ref>Roller, p. 250</ref>\n\nWhen Cleopatra died, she was placed in the [[Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania]] in modern [[Algeria]], built by her and Juba east of Caesarea and still visible. A fragmentary inscription was dedicated to Juba and Cleopatra, as the ''King and Queen of Mauretania''. Their human remains have not been found at the site, perhaps due to tomb raids that occurred at an uncertain time (possibly shortly after the Mausoleum's construction), or because the structure was simply meant to serve as a memorial and not an actual place of burial.<ref>Davies, Ethel (2009).

Her second name in ancient Greek means moon, also meaning the Titaness-goddess of the Moon [[Selene]], being the counterpart of her twin brother's second name Helios, meaning sun and the Titan-god of the Sun [[Helios]]. Cleopatra was born, raised and educated in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. In 36 BC in the Donations of Antioch and in late 34 BC during the [[Donations of Alexandria]], she was made ruler of [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Libya]].<ref>Roller, p. 76\u201381</ref>  After the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra [[Battle of Actium|at Actium]] and [[Death of Cleopatra|their suicides]] in Egypt in 30 BC, Cleopatra Selene was brought to [[Rome]] and placed in the household of [[Octavian]]'s sister [[Octavia the Younger]] (a former wife of Antony). Cleopatra Selene was eventually married to [[Juba II]] of [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]] and they produced a son and successor [[Ptolemy of Mauretania]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = An ancient Roman bust of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt2.jpg\n| width1 = 120\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = An ancient Roman bust of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt1.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = An ancient [[Roman Republican portraiture|Roman sculpture]] of either Cleopatra Selene II or her mother [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the [[Archaeological Museum of Cherchell|Archaeological Museum]] of [[Cherchel]], Algeria<ref>Roller, Duane W.

Her older half-brother, [[Caesarion]], was the son of her mother and her first partner, [[Julius Caesar]]. Cleopatra most likely planned her only daughter to marry her eldest son Caesarion. Her father also had five other children with previous wives.\n\nHer parents, [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII]], were defeated by Octavian (future [[Roman Emperor]] Caesar [[Augustus]]), during a naval [[Battle of Actium|battle]] at [[Actium]], [[Greece]] in 31 BC. In 30 BC, her parents committed suicide as Octavian and his army invaded Egypt. Octavian captured Cleopatra Selene and her brothers and took them from [[Egypt]] to [[Rome]], parading them in heavy golden chains in his [[Roman triumph|triumph]]. The chains were so heavy that the children were unable to walk in them, eliciting unexpected sympathy from many of the Roman onlookers. Octavian gave the siblings to his elder sister (Mark Antony's former wife) [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia Minor]] to be raised in her household in Rome.<ref>Roller, p. 82\u201385</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Juba and cleopatra coin.gif|thumb|Coin of the ancient kingdom of Mauretania.

The couple were sent to [[Mauretania]], an unorganized territory that needed Roman supervision. They renamed their new capital ''Caesarea'' (modern [[Cherchell]], [[Algeria]]), in honor of the Emperor.<ref>Roller, p. 98\u2013100</ref> Cleopatra is said to have exercised great influence on policies that Juba created. Through her influence, the Mauretanian Kingdom flourished. Mauretania exported and traded well throughout the Mediterranean. The construction and sculptural projects at Caesarea and at another city [[Volubilis]], were built and display a rich mixture of Ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], Greek and [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman]] architectural styles.<ref>Roller, p. 91\u2013162</ref>\n[[File:Ptolemy of Mauretania bust, Cherchell, Algeria 3.jpg|thumb|An ancient Roman bust of [[Ptolemy of Mauretania]], [[Archaeological Museum of Cherchell]], Algeria]]\n\nThe children of Cleopatra and Juba were:\n* [[Ptolemy of Mauretania]] born in 10 BC <ref name=\"CB\">[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/selene_ii_fr.htm Cleopatra Selene] by Chris Bennett</ref>\n* A daughter, whose name has not been recorded, is mentioned in an inscription.

A discovered hoard of Cleopatra's coins was dated at 17 AD. It has traditionally been believed that Cleopatra was alive to mint them; however, this would mean that Juba married the [[Cappadocia]]n Princess, [[Glaphyra]] during Cleopatra's lifetime. Historians generally assume that Juba, being a thoroughly Romanized king, would not have taken a second wife, arguing that if Juba married Glaphyra before 4 AD, then his first wife, Cleopatra, must have already been dead.<ref>Roller, p. 249\u201351</ref> However, even contemporary client kings with Roman citizenship, such as [[Herod the Great]], took multiple wives, and Juba's father had more than one. It is also possible that Cleopatra and Juba separated for a time, and their rift was eventually mended after Juba's divorce from Glaphyra.\n\nThe following epigram by Greek [[Epigram]]matist [[Crinagoras of Mytilene]] is considered to be Cleopatra's eulogy.<ref>Roller, p. 249\u201351</ref>\n\n:''The moon herself grew dark, rising at sunset,\n:''Covering her suffering in the night,\n:''Because she saw her beautiful namesake, Selene,\n:''Breathless, descending to Hades,\n:''With her she had had the beauty of her light in common,\n:''And mingled her own darkness with her death.\n\nIf this poem is not simply literary license, then astronomical correlation can be used to help pinpoint the date of Cleopatra's death. Lunar eclipses occurred in 9, 8, 5 and 1 BC and in AD 3, 7, 10, 11 and 14. The event in 5 BC most closely resembles the description given in the eulogy.<ref>Ancey, pp. 139-141</ref> However, the date of her death is simply not ascertainable with any certainty.  [[Zahi Hawass]], former Director of Egyptian Antiquities, believes Cleopatra died in AD 8.<ref>Roller, p. 250</ref>\n\nWhen Cleopatra died, she was placed in the [[Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania]] in modern [[Algeria]], built by her and Juba east of Caesarea and still visible. A fragmentary inscription was dedicated to Juba and Cleopatra, as the ''King and Queen of Mauretania''. Their human remains have not been found at the site, perhaps due to tomb raids that occurred at an uncertain time (possibly shortly after the Mausoleum's construction), or because the structure was simply meant to serve as a memorial and not an actual place of burial.<ref>Davies, Ethel (2009).

Bendtner was released by Arsenal in 2014. He subsequently joined [[VfL Wolfsburg]] on a free transfer, for whom he scored the winning goal in the [[2015 DFL-Supercup]]. Released in 2016, he returned to England where he spent the first half of the 2016\u201317 season with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] of the Championship, and in March 2017 he signed for Rosenborg.\n\nBendtner has played internationally for Denmark at [[Denmark national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[Denmark national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19]], [[Denmark national under-21 football team|under-21]] and senior levels. He made his senior international debut as an 18-year-old, on 16 August 2006 in a [[friendly match]] against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and scored his first international goal in that match.

He made his debut in October 2005 in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. For the [[2006\u201307 Birmingham City F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]], Bendtner was loaned out to [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], where he made 48 appearances. Following his return to Arsenal, he became a regular first team player, but began to slip out of favour during the [[2010\u201311 Arsenal F.C. season|2010\u201311 season]]. As a result, he moved on loan to Premier League club Sunderland for the majority of the [[2011\u201312 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2011\u201312 season]], where he made 30 appearances. He then spent the entire [[2012\u201313 Juventus F.C. season|2012\u201313 season]] on loan to [[Serie A]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], where he made 10 appearances but failed to score. Bendtner was released by Arsenal in 2014. He subsequently joined [[VfL Wolfsburg]] on a free transfer, for whom he scored the winning goal in the [[2015 DFL-Supercup]]. Released in 2016, he returned to England where he spent the first half of the 2016\u201317 season with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] of the Championship, and in March 2017 he signed for Rosenborg.\n\nBendtner has played internationally for Denmark at [[Denmark national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[Denmark national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19]], [[Denmark national under-21 football team|under-21]] and senior levels. He made his senior international debut as an 18-year-old, on 16 August 2006 in a [[friendly match]] against [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and scored his first international goal in that match. Bendtner was a member of Denmark's [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012]] squads, and helped them qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Youth career===\nBendtner was born in [[Copenhagen]].

The Frankish pronunciation was like ''Hlu-do-vig''. The name literally means \"famous battle\". A contemporary source, [[Ermoldus Nigellus]], gives its two components as ''Hluto'', [[:wikt:praeclarum|praeclarum]], and ''Wigch'', [[Mars (god)|Mars]].{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|pp=26\u201327}}}} (c. 806{{sfn|Dutton|1990|p=92}}{{sfn|Costambeys|Innes|Maclean|2011|p=xx}}/810{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|pp=26\u201327}} \u2013 28 August 876), also known as '''Louis II''', was the first king of [[East Francia]], and ruled from 843{{ndash}}876 AD. Grandson of emperor [[Charlemagne]] and the third son of [[Louis the Pious]], emperor of [[Francia]], and his first wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye]],{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=145}} he received the appellation ''Germanicus'' shortly after his death in recognition of Magna [[Germania]] of the Roman Empire, reflecting the Carolingians' assertions that they were the rightful descendants of the [[Roman Empire]].  \n[[File:East Francia 843.svg|thumb|right|Kingdom of East Francia]]\n\nAfter protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish Empire in the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]]. His attempts to conquer the West Frankish Empire of his half-brother [[Charles the Bald]] in 858\u201359 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish Empire in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. Due to a decline in the written form in administration and government, Louis' reign predates Ottonian times.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Prudentius |title=Annals of St. Bertin |date=861}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHis early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, [[Charlemagne]], whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis the Pious divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis was made the ruler of [[Duchy of Bavaria]], following the practice of emperor Charlemagne of bestowing a local kingdom to a close family member who then would serve as his lieutenant and local governor.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=147}} Louis ruled from [[Regensburg]], the old capital of the [[Bavarians#History|Bavarii]]. In 825 he became involved in wars with the [[Wends]] and [[Sorbs]] on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married [[Hemma]], sister of his stepmother [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]], both daughters of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], whose possessions ranged from [[Alsace]] to Bavaria.\n\nIt was not until 826 that Louis first came to rule Bavaria.{{clarify}} In 828 and 829 he undertook two campaigns against the Bulgarians who wanted to penetrate into Pannonia without great success. During his time as Unterk\u00f6nig, he tried to extend his rule to the Rhine-Main area.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |location=Darmstadt |pages=47\u201366}}</ref>\n\n==Rebellious son==\nHis involvement in the first civil war against his father's reign was limited, but in the second his elder brothers, [[Lothair I]], then [[King of Italy]], and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin I]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], persuaded him to invade [[Alamannia]] which their father had given to their young half-brother [[Charles the Bald]], by promising to give him the land in the new partition they would make after a victory. In 832 he led an army of [[Slavs]] into [[Alamannia]], but was driven back by his father.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=154}} Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect; the emperor was soon captured by his own rebellious sons and deposed. Upon his swift reinstatement, however, the emperor Louis made peace with his son Louis and legally restored Bavaria (never actually lost) to him in 836.\n\nLouis was the instigator of the third civil war, which began in 839. A strip of his land having been given to the young half-brother Charles, Louis invaded Alamannia again. This time emperor Louis responded quickly, and soon the younger Louis was forced into the far southeastern corner of his realm, the [[March of Pannonia]]. Peace was then made by force of arms.\n\n==Civil war and aftermath, 840\u2013844==\n[[File:Treaty of Verdun 843.png|thumb|Lands divided by the Treaty of Verdun]]\n\nWhen the emperor Louis died in 840, and [[Lothair I]] claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with [[Charles the Bald]], and defeated Lothair I and their nephew [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], son of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]], at the [[Battle of Fontenoy (841)|Battle of Fontenoy]] in June 841.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=161\u2013162}}  Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to [[Annales Fuldenses|the Annals of Fulda]], it was the biggest bloodbath the Franks had experienced since time immemorial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Eric Joseph |title=Popular revolt, dynastic politics, and aristocratic factionalism in the early Middle Ages. The Saxon Stellinga reconsidered. |date=1995 |publisher=Speculum |pages=467\u2013501}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Disputed Author |title=Annales Fuldenses |date=841 |publisher=Abbey House of Fulda}}</ref> At the same time, it was Louis's last battle in the struggle for the unification of the kingdom.\n\nIn June 842 the three brothers met on an island in the river [[Sa\u00f4ne]] to negotiate a peace and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the [[Treaty of Verdun]], concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the [[Rhine]] ([[East Francia]]), together with a district around [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]], on the left bank of the river (see also [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] 842). His territories included Bavaria (where he made [[Regensburg]] the centre of his government), [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Saxony]].\n\nLouis may be called the founder of the [[German kingdom]], though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony,{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=112}} in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]]{{sfn|Gwatkin|Whitney|Tanner|Previt\u00e9-Orton|Brooke|1957|p=31}} to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging [[Vikings]].\n\n\n==Conflicts with Charles the Bald==\nIn 852 Louis sent his son [[Louis the Younger]] to [[Aquitaine]], where nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald's rule.{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=175}} The younger Louis did not set out until 854, and returned the following year.{{sfn|Reuter|2013|p=71}}\n\nStarting from 853 Louis made repeated attempts to gain the throne of [[West Francia]], which, according to the ''Annals of [[Fulda]]'' (''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews [[Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine|Peppin II]] and [[Charles of Provence]], Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy]]. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated \"the first year of the reign in West Francia.\" However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at [[Koblenz]], both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=174}}\n\nAfter the emperor [[Lothair I]] died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions between themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs \u2013 [[Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II of Italy]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and [[Charles of Provence]]. In 868 at [[Metz]] Louis and Charles agreed to partition [[Lotharingia]]. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands, but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided Lothair's lands among all the claimants.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=199}}\n\n==''Divisio regni'' among the sons==\n[[File:Torhalle Kloster Lorsch.jpg|thumb|Carolingian gatehouse (''Torhalle'') to [[Lorsch Abbey]], where Louis the German was buried]]\nThe later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, [[Carloman of Bavaria]], revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son [[Louis the Younger]], who was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat]]. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands \u2013 [[Saxony]] with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] went to Louis the Younger and [[Swabia]] with [[Raetia]] to Charles the Fat.\n\nA report that the emperor [[Louis II of Italy]] had died led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II of Italy who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.\n\nLouis was preparing for a new war when he died on August 28, 876 in [[Frankfurt]]. He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters. His sons, despite their earlier behaviour, respected the divisions made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom.\n\n==Later Life==\n\n[[File:GrabplatteLudwig_Ludwig_III_Kunigunde.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Louis III]]\n\nIn the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople. After the death of Emperor Louis II in August 875, Louis tried to win the emperorship for himself and his descendants. For this purpose, Abbot Sigihard von Fulda undertook a trip to Rome to Pope John VIII. On 18 May 876 he returned to Ingelheim and reported to Louis that, in December 875, Charles the Bald had been able to obtain the title of emperor by a swift move to Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Wilfried |title=Ludwig der Deutsche |date=Darmstadt |pages=120\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nHis wife Hemma visited Louis for the last time in May 875. In 874 she had lost her voice as a result of a stroke. During his stay, he donated the [[Berg im Donaugau Abbey]] to the Marienkapelle, which he built.<ref>Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche \u2013 Portrait eines wenig bekannten K\u00f6nigs. In: Wilfried Hartmann (Hrsg.): Ludwig der Deutsche und seine Zeit. Darmstadt 2004, S. 1\u201326, hier: S. 7f.</ref> Hemma died at the end of January 876 in Regensburg. Louis then died after a short illness on 28 August 876 in his palace in Frankfurt. The following day he was buried by his son Louis in Lorsch Abbey. However, according to Wilfried Hartmann, it cannot be determined with certainty whether the dead man in his sarcophagus is the Carolingian king.<ref>Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche. Darmstadt 2002, S. 62.</ref> After Louis' death, Charles the Bald tried to win over the East Reich as well.

Grandson of emperor [[Charlemagne]] and the third son of [[Louis the Pious]], emperor of [[Francia]], and his first wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye]],{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=145}} he received the appellation ''Germanicus'' shortly after his death in recognition of Magna [[Germania]] of the Roman Empire, reflecting the Carolingians' assertions that they were the rightful descendants of the [[Roman Empire]].  \n[[File:East Francia 843.svg|thumb|right|Kingdom of East Francia]]\n\nAfter protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish Empire in the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]]. His attempts to conquer the West Frankish Empire of his half-brother [[Charles the Bald]] in 858\u201359 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish Empire in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. Due to a decline in the written form in administration and government, Louis' reign predates Ottonian times.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Prudentius |title=Annals of St. Bertin |date=861}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHis early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, [[Charlemagne]], whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis the Pious divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis was made the ruler of [[Duchy of Bavaria]], following the practice of emperor Charlemagne of bestowing a local kingdom to a close family member who then would serve as his lieutenant and local governor.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=147}} Louis ruled from [[Regensburg]], the old capital of the [[Bavarians#History|Bavarii]]. In 825 he became involved in wars with the [[Wends]] and [[Sorbs]] on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married [[Hemma]], sister of his stepmother [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]], both daughters of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], whose possessions ranged from [[Alsace]] to Bavaria.\n\nIt was not until 826 that Louis first came to rule Bavaria.{{clarify}} In 828 and 829 he undertook two campaigns against the Bulgarians who wanted to penetrate into Pannonia without great success. During his time as Unterk\u00f6nig, he tried to extend his rule to the Rhine-Main area.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |location=Darmstadt |pages=47\u201366}}</ref>\n\n==Rebellious son==\nHis involvement in the first civil war against his father's reign was limited, but in the second his elder brothers, [[Lothair I]], then [[King of Italy]], and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin I]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], persuaded him to invade [[Alamannia]] which their father had given to their young half-brother [[Charles the Bald]], by promising to give him the land in the new partition they would make after a victory. In 832 he led an army of [[Slavs]] into [[Alamannia]], but was driven back by his father.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=154}} Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect; the emperor was soon captured by his own rebellious sons and deposed. Upon his swift reinstatement, however, the emperor Louis made peace with his son Louis and legally restored Bavaria (never actually lost) to him in 836.\n\nLouis was the instigator of the third civil war, which began in 839. A strip of his land having been given to the young half-brother Charles, Louis invaded Alamannia again. This time emperor Louis responded quickly, and soon the younger Louis was forced into the far southeastern corner of his realm, the [[March of Pannonia]]. Peace was then made by force of arms.\n\n==Civil war and aftermath, 840\u2013844==\n[[File:Treaty of Verdun 843.png|thumb|Lands divided by the Treaty of Verdun]]\n\nWhen the emperor Louis died in 840, and [[Lothair I]] claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with [[Charles the Bald]], and defeated Lothair I and their nephew [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], son of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]], at the [[Battle of Fontenoy (841)|Battle of Fontenoy]] in June 841.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=161\u2013162}}  Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to [[Annales Fuldenses|the Annals of Fulda]], it was the biggest bloodbath the Franks had experienced since time immemorial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Eric Joseph |title=Popular revolt, dynastic politics, and aristocratic factionalism in the early Middle Ages.

This developed into the [[Treaty of Verdun]], concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the [[Rhine]] ([[East Francia]]), together with a district around [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]], on the left bank of the river (see also [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] 842). His territories included Bavaria (where he made [[Regensburg]] the centre of his government), [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Saxony]].\n\nLouis may be called the founder of the [[German kingdom]], though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony,{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=112}} in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]]{{sfn|Gwatkin|Whitney|Tanner|Previt\u00e9-Orton|Brooke|1957|p=31}} to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging [[Vikings]].\n\n\n==Conflicts with Charles the Bald==\nIn 852 Louis sent his son [[Louis the Younger]] to [[Aquitaine]], where nobles had grown resentful of Charles the Bald's rule.{{sfn|McKitterick|1999|p=175}} The younger Louis did not set out until 854, and returned the following year.{{sfn|Reuter|2013|p=71}}\n\nStarting from 853 Louis made repeated attempts to gain the throne of [[West Francia]], which, according to the ''Annals of [[Fulda]]'' (''[[Annales Fuldenses]]''), the people of that country offered him in their disgust with the cruel misrule of Charles the Bald. Encouraged by his nephews [[Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine|Peppin II]] and [[Charles of Provence]], Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy]]. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated \"the first year of the reign in West Francia.\" However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at [[Koblenz]], both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=174}}\n\nAfter the emperor [[Lothair I]] died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions between themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs \u2013 [[Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II of Italy]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and [[Charles of Provence]]. In 868 at [[Metz]] Louis and Charles agreed to partition [[Lotharingia]]. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands, but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided Lothair's lands among all the claimants.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=199}}\n\n==''Divisio regni'' among the sons==\n[[File:Torhalle Kloster Lorsch.jpg|thumb|Carolingian gatehouse (''Torhalle'') to [[Lorsch Abbey]], where Louis the German was buried]]\nThe later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, [[Carloman of Bavaria]], revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son [[Louis the Younger]], who was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat]]. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands \u2013 [[Saxony]] with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] went to Louis the Younger and [[Swabia]] with [[Raetia]] to Charles the Fat.\n\nA report that the emperor [[Louis II of Italy]] had died led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II of Italy who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.\n\nLouis was preparing for a new war when he died on August 28, 876 in [[Frankfurt]]. He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters. His sons, despite their earlier behaviour, respected the divisions made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom.\n\n==Later Life==\n\n[[File:GrabplatteLudwig_Ludwig_III_Kunigunde.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Louis III]]\n\nIn the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople. After the death of Emperor Louis II in August 875, Louis tried to win the emperorship for himself and his descendants. For this purpose, Abbot Sigihard von Fulda undertook a trip to Rome to Pope John VIII. On 18 May 876 he returned to Ingelheim and reported to Louis that, in December 875, Charles the Bald had been able to obtain the title of emperor by a swift move to Rome.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Wilfried |title=Ludwig der Deutsche |date=Darmstadt |pages=120\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nHis wife Hemma visited Louis for the last time in May 875. In 874 she had lost her voice as a result of a stroke. During his stay, he donated the [[Berg im Donaugau Abbey]] as a donation to the Marienkapelle, which he built.<ref>Wilfried Hartmann: Ludwig der Deutsche \u2013 Portrait eines wenig bekannten K\u00f6nigs.
