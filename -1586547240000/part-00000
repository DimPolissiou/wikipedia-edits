On the centre service line.

These hand gestures let the server at the baseline know which side of the court they are to serve to, and than move to. For intermediate players such as league, or club players it is recommended that the server head to the opposite side to which the net player is headed so that maximum court coverage is obtained) Advanced competitors such as professional; and tour players are known to use other combinations for example [[Tennis strategy|Australian Doubles]] which deliberately exposes one side of the court to entice the return of serve be hit into the open space.\n\nThe ultimate aim here is for the net player to cut off the return of serve hopefully ending the point.\n\n==Why I-formation is Effective==\nIn tennis you want to keep the ball away from the net player, because it is easy to put the ball away from closer to the net than any other position on the court.\n\nThis tactic has the player returning the serve guess as to which side the opponents net player will be. So basically there is a 50\u201350 chance the person returning the server is going to hit the ball right into their opponents net player which effectively can be the worst place to return the serve in doubles.\n\n==Tips==\nTo play this tactic successfully It's important players be comfortable serving the ball with enough precision to place the ball out wide, into the body; and down the \"T\" in each service box. Accuracy is also required so you don't hit the net-player in the back or head.\n\nAnother key to success with this tactic is understanding the ins and outs of returning a serve, and what is involved when choosing to hit down the line as opposed to a crosscourt return. For example, it is harder to change the direction of the ball when it is travelling quickly. Also, there is a higher margin of error when hitting the ball crosscourt, because the distance between the net and the baseline is longer and the net is lower in the centre where the ball path crosses the net.\n\nIt helps to know your opponent's weaknesses and strengths before playing this strategy; so if your opponent has a whopping big crosscourt return of serve,  this is good to know beforehand; because you can force them to return the ball down the line where the net is higher, the distance is shorter and the angle is harder; this  can [[Intimidation|intimidating]] the player returning the serve into making an error.\n\nThe net-player is required to get low, and it is important that they be able to move quickly out of this position, so it's recommended the net player be on their feet, crouching, as opposed to one or both knees. Also, it is easier to move to the ball from the balls of the feet as opposed to being flat-footed. Also typically you want this position to be uncomfortable because you are going to want to move out of it quickly.\n\n==Communicating to the Server==\n\nOften the net player will put their hands behind the back to indicate where the server should serve. So if the server is serving on the deuce side of the court the index finger is used to point to the ad side, The middle finger is used to indicate a to-the-body shot, and the pinkie finger is used to reflect the down-the-line position.<ref>(Westermann 2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXoOGJkBIuQ</ref> The net-player then communicates if they are going to move to the ad or deuce service-box. It's also common for the net-player to walk back to the service line and whisper his/her choice of combinations to the server; this helps to slow the game down, which can frustrate the returning team's [[rhythm]]; and also helps the server to stay calm.\n\n==References==\n\nAntoun, A.

For intermediate players such as league, or club players it is recommended that the server head to the opposite side to which the net player is headed so that maximum court coverage is obtained) Advanced competitors such as professional; and tour players are known to use other combinations for example [[Tennis strategy|Australian Doubles]] which deliberately exposes one side of the court to entice the return of serve be hit into the open space.\n\nThe ultimate aim here is for the net player to cut off the return of serve hopefully ending the point.\n\n==Why I-formation is Effective==\nIn tennis you want to keep the ball away from the net player, because it is easy to put the ball away from closer to the net than any other position on the court.\n\nThis tactic has the player returning the serve guess as to which side the opponents net player will be. So basically there is a 50\u201350 chance the person returning the server is going to hit the ball right into their opponents net player which effectively can be the worst place to return the serve in doubles.\n\n==Tips==\nTo play this tactic successfully It's important players be comfortable serving the ball with enough precision to place the ball out wide, into the body; and down the \"T\" in each service box. Accuracy is also required so you don't hit the net-player in the back or head.\n\nAnother key to success with this tactic is understanding the ins and outs of returning a serve, and what is involved when choosing to hit down the line as opposed to a crosscourt return. For example, it is harder to change the direction of the ball when it is travelling quickly. Also, there is a higher margin of error when hitting the ball crosscourt, because the distance between the net and the baseline is longer and the net is lower in the centre where the ball path crosses the net.\n\nIt helps to know your opponent's weaknesses and strengths before playing this strategy; so if your opponent has a whopping big crosscourt return of serve,  this is good to know beforehand; because you can force them to return the ball down the line where the net is higher, the distance is shorter and the angle is harder; this  can [[Intimidation|intimidating]] the player returning the serve into making an error.\n\nThe net-player is required to get low, and it is important that they be able to move quickly out of this position, so it's recommended the net player be on their feet, crouching, as opposed to one or both knees. Also, it is easier to move to the ball from the balls of the feet as opposed to being flat-footed. Also typically you want this position to be uncomfortable because you are going to want to move out of it quickly.\n\n==Communicating to the Server==\n\nOften the net player will put their hands behind the back to indicate where the server should serve. So if the server is serving on the deuce side of the court the index finger is used to point to the ad side, The middle finger is used to indicate a to-the-body shot, and the pinkie finger is used to reflect the down-the-line position.<ref>(Westermann 2015) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXoOGJkBIuQ</ref> The net-player then communicates if they are going to move to the ad or deuce service-box. It's also common for the net-player to walk back to the service line and whisper his/her choice of combinations to the server; this helps to slow the game down, which can frustrate the returning team's [[rhythm]]; and also helps the server to stay calm.\n\n==References==\n\nAntoun, A.

His family includes his parents, his grandmother, and his four sisters. Pandurang's relationship with his father is a difficult one, and they have been estranged since Pandurang was a boy. His father, who typifies the patriarchal family head, beats his son in childhood for wandering around in the company of friends. He does not allow the young boy to learn to play flute, or to perform in his school's plays.

Even his father now hesitates to ask him to mend his ways. He is shaken by the untimely death of his younger sister, Mani, but otherwise has no care for anything. In consequence, he fails his exam. After unsuccessful attempts to find work in the city, ultimately Pandurang returns to his village, his mind \"existentially vacant\". He is now one among many unemployed youngsters of the village.

Like other [[Existentialism#Literature|existential novels]], ''Kosala'' uses the [[First-person narrative|first person point of view]] to recount an individual's experiences, and in this exploration raises many questions regarding the [[meaning of life]] and the value of existence. It is considered the first existential novel in Marathi literature.<ref>{{cite thesis|first=Dattatraya Dnyandev|last=Khaladkar |title=Existentialism in the Selected American and Marathi Novels: a Comparative Study|chapter=Existentialism in Marathi Novels |chapter-url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/9899/7/07_chapter%203.pdf |year=2010 |publisher=Department of English, Shivaji University |location=Kolhapur|type=Ph.D|pages=144\u2013145|hdl=10603/9899}}</ref>\n\nThe novel's protagonist, Pandurang, has been described as a \"quintessential [[antihero|anti-hero]]\",<ref name=\"Padgaonkar1997\">{{cite journal|last=Padgaonkar|first=Latika|title=Cocoon by Bhalchandra Nemade (Book Review)|journal=The Book Review|volume=21|year=1997|publisher=C.

Later in the novel, this estrangement develops into a major theme of the younger generation's mute revolt against the patriarchal value system characteristic of traditional Indian life. Pandurang has not found anything meaningful in his experience of village life. Over a six year period, this same experience of meaninglessness repeats itself in his college life in Pune.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel is written in an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] style, reading like a series of [[diary]] entries. The language Pandurang uses, a Marathi dialect spoken in rural [[Maharashtra]], serves as an instrument revealing his [[worldview]]. Despite the pessimistic undertones, there is an element of humour throughout the novel.  Another technique employed by the author is that the narration describes \"historical investigations\" often undertaken by Sangvikar and his friend Suresh Bapat, which ultimately uncover to them the absurdity and pathos of their conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It uses oblique, irrelevant humour as a serious moral strategy to unmask the phoneyness of society and culture.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe narrative of the novel fuses different types of genres such as the autobiography, the diary, the novel, the Indian folktales, folk narratives, and medieval saint literature. The language used in the novel are standard, archaic, urban, non-urban dialects, slangs, jargons, and sometimes poetic and rhetoric.<ref name=\"Gurjarpadhye2014\"/> ''Kosala'' is said to have been inspired partially by [[J.

He decides to make the most of college life, and becomes the secretary of the college debating society, prefect of the hostel, and directs a play at the college Annual Day function. Out of kindness, he gives responsibility for management of the hostel mess to one of his poorer friends. But, although Pandurang tries to help everyone around him, he ultimately discovers that his friends are using him. Finally, when he fails his exams badly and his financial position deteriorates, his father becomes angered by Pandurang's life-style.

Even his father now hesitates to ask him to mend his ways. He is shaken by the untimely death of his younger sister, Mani, but otherwise has no care for anything. In consequence, he fails his exam. After unsuccessful attempts to find work in the city, ultimately Pandurang returns to his village, his mind \"existentially vacant\". He is now one among many unemployed youngsters of the village. As Pandurang tries to understand their views on life, their sorrows and their joys, the true meaning of life begins to dawn.<ref name=\"George1993\"/>\n\n==Theme and techniques==\nThe main theme of ''Kosala'' is [[Social alienation|alienation]].<ref name=\"Chitre1969\"/> The novel is influenced by [[existential philosophy]],<ref name=\"NatarajanNelson1996\"/> exploring existentialist ideas such as an obsession with birth and death, dread, alienation, and absurdity. Like other [[Existentialism#Literature|existential novels]], ''Kosala'' uses the [[First-person narrative|first person point of view]] to recount an individual's experiences, and in this exploration raises many questions regarding the [[meaning of life]] and the value of existence. It is considered the first existential novel in Marathi literature.<ref>{{cite thesis|first=Dattatraya Dnyandev|last=Khaladkar |title=Existentialism in the Selected American and Marathi Novels: a Comparative Study|chapter=Existentialism in Marathi Novels |chapter-url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/9899/7/07_chapter%203.pdf |year=2010 |publisher=Department of English, Shivaji University |location=Kolhapur|type=Ph.D|pages=144\u2013145|hdl=10603/9899}}</ref>\n\nThe novel's protagonist, Pandurang, has been described as a \"quintessential [[antihero|anti-hero]]\",<ref name=\"Padgaonkar1997\">{{cite journal|last=Padgaonkar|first=Latika|title=Cocoon by Bhalchandra Nemade (Book Review)|journal=The Book Review|volume=21|year=1997|publisher=C.

Later in the novel, this estrangement develops into a major theme of the younger generation's mute revolt against the patriarchal value system characteristic of traditional Indian life. Pandurang has not found anything meaningful in his experience of village life. Over a six year period, this same experience of meaninglessness repeats itself in his college life in Pune.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel is written in an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] style, reading like a series of [[diary]] entries. The language Pandurang uses, a Marathi dialect spoken in rural [[Maharashtra]], serves as an instrument revealing his [[worldview]]. Despite the pessimistic undertones, there is an element of humour throughout the novel.  Another technique employed by the author is that the narration describes \"historical investigations\" often undertaken by Sangvikar and his friend Suresh Bapat, which ultimately uncover to them the absurdity and pathos of their conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It uses oblique, irrelevant humour as a serious moral strategy to unmask the phoneyness of society and culture.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe narrative of the novel fuses different types of genres such as the autobiography, the diary, the novel, the Indian folktales, folk narratives, and medieval saint literature. The language used in the novel are standard, archaic, urban, non-urban dialects, slangs, jargons, and sometimes poetic and rhetoric.<ref name=\"Gurjarpadhye2014\"/> ''Kosala'' is said to have been inspired partially by [[J.

Narcissus is the origin of the term ''[[narcissism]]'', a fixation with oneself and one's physical appearance or public perception. \n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name is of uncertain biology. According to [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], \"[t]he suffix [-\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2] clearly points to a [[Pre-Greek]] word.\"<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P.

[[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance ({{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c9}} {{transl|grc|narkao}}, \"I grow numb\") not the youth.\n\n== Family ==\nNarcissus was the son of the river god [[Cephissus (mythology)|Cephissus]] and [[nymph]] [[Liriope (nymph)|Liriope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greekmyths-greekmythology.com/narcissus-myth-echo/|title=The myth of Narcissus|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Mythology ==\nSeveral versions of the myth have survived from ancient sources. The classic version is by [[Ovid]], found in book 3 of his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (completed 8 AD); this is the story of [[Echo and Narcissus]]. One day Narcissus was walking in the woods when [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]], an [[Oread]] (mountain nymph) saw him, fell deeply in love, and followed him. Narcissus sensed he was being followed and shouted \"Who's there?\". Echo repeated \"Who's there?\" She eventually revealed her identity and attempted to embrace him. He stepped away and told her to leave him alone. She was heartbroken and spent the rest of her life in lonely glens until nothing but an echo sound remained of her. [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] (as an aspect of [[Aphrodite]]<ref name=\"theoi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AphroditeWrath2.html#Narkissos|title=Aprodite Wrath: Narcissus|publisher=}}</ref>), the goddess of revenge, noticed this behaviour after learning the story and decided to punish Narcissus. Once, during the summer, he was getting thirsty after hunting, and the goddess lured him to a pool where he leaned upon the water and saw himself in the bloom of youth. Narcissus did not realize it was merely his own reflection and fell deeply in love with it, as if it were somebody else. Unable to leave the allure of his image, he eventually realized that his love could not be reciprocated and he melted away from the fire of passion burning inside him, eventually turning into a gold and white flower.<ref name=\"greekmyths-greekmythology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph3.htm#476975716|title=The myth of Narcissus|publisher=}}</ref><ref>John Tzetzes.

A version by [[Conon (mythographer)|Conon]], a contemporary of Ovid, also ends in suicide (''Narrations,'' 24).

The movement is titled \"How Dare I Be So Beautiful?\".\n\n[[Progressive metal]] band [[Threshold (band)|Threshold]] referenced the myth with an 11-minute epic titled \"Narcissus\", the closing track on their album ''[[Hypothetical (album)|Hypothetical]]''.

According to [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], he was a [[Laconia]]n hunter who loved everything beautiful.<ref>[[John Tzetzes]]. ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.html#9 Chiliades, 1.9 line 234]''</ref> Narcissus was proud, in that he disdained those who loved him, causing some to take their own life to prove their devotion to his striking beauty. Narcissus is the origin of the term ''[[narcissism]]'', a fixation with oneself and one's physical appearance or public perception. \n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name is of uncertain etymology. According to [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], \"[t]he suffix [-\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2] clearly points to a [[Pre-Greek]] word.\"<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 997.</ref> The word narcissus has come to be used for the [[daffodil]], but there is no clarity on whether the flower is named for the myth, or the myth for the flower, or if there is any true connection at all. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the plant was named for its fragrance ({{lang|grc|\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c9}} {{transl|grc|narkao}}, \"I grow numb\") not the youth.\n\n== Family ==\nNarcissus was the son of the river god [[Cephissus (mythology)|Cephissus]] and [[nymph]] [[Liriope (nymph)|Liriope]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greekmyths-greekmythology.com/narcissus-myth-echo/|title=The myth of Narcissus|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Mythology ==\nSeveral versions of the myth have survived from ancient sources. The classic version is by [[Ovid]], found in book 3 of his ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' (completed 8 AD); this is the story of [[Echo and Narcissus]]. One day Narcissus was walking in the woods when [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]], an [[Oread]] (mountain nymph) saw him, fell deeply in love, and followed him. Narcissus sensed he was being followed and shouted \"Who's there?\". Echo repeated \"Who's there?\" She eventually revealed her identity and attempted to embrace him. He stepped away and told her to leave him alone. She was heartbroken and spent the rest of her life in lonely glens until nothing but an echo sound remained of her. [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]] (as an aspect of [[Aphrodite]]<ref name=\"theoi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AphroditeWrath2.html#Narkissos|title=Aprodite Wrath: Narcissus|publisher=}}</ref>), the goddess of revenge, noticed this behaviour after learning the story and decided to punish Narcissus. Once, during the summer, he was getting thirsty after hunting, and the goddess lured him to a pool where he leaned upon the water and saw himself in the bloom of youth. Narcissus did not realize it was merely his own reflection and fell deeply in love with it, as if it were somebody else. Unable to leave the allure of his image, he eventually realized that his love could not be reciprocated and he melted away from the fire of passion burning inside him, eventually turning into a gold and white flower.<ref name=\"greekmyths-greekmythology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph3.htm#476975716|title=The myth of Narcissus|publisher=}}</ref><ref>John Tzetzes.
