He is also successful in gaining her innocent affection. This makes Apollo angry and he puts it into the girl's mind to stop to bathe in the river Ladon; there, as all strip naked, the ruse is revealed, as in the myth of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], and the affronted huntresses plunge their spears into Leucippus. At this moment Apollo's attention becomes engaged, and he begins his own pursuit. Daphne, fleeing to escape Apollo's advances, prays to Zeus to help. Zeus turns her into laurel tree.

When she kept fleeing, Apollo lamented that even though he had the knowledge of medicinal herbs, he had failed to cure himself from the wound of Cupid's arrow. When Apollo finally caught up with her, Daphne prayed for help to her father, the river god [[Peneus]] of [[Thessaly]],<ref>Ovid. ''Metamorphoses''. I:452</ref> who immediately commenced her transformation into a laurel tree (''[[Laurus nobilis]]''):\n\n:''\"a heavy numbness seized her limbs, thin bark closed over her breast, her hair turned into leaves, her arms into branches, her feet so swift a moment ago stuck fast in slow-growing roots, her face was lost in the canopy.

He is also successful in gaining her innocent affection. This makes Apollo angry and he puts it into the girl's mind to stop to bathe in the river Ladon; there, as all strip naked, the ruse is revealed, as in the myth of [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], and the affronted huntresses plunge their spears into Leucippus. At this moment Apollo's attention becomes engaged, and he begins his own pursuit. Daphne, fleeing to escape Apollo's advances, prays to Zeus to help. Zeus turns her into laurel tree. Parthenius' modern editor remarks on the rather awkward transition, linking two narratives.<ref>Lightfoot (1999), p. 471.</ref>\n\n==Laurel varieties==\nThe name Daphne, in Greek \u0394\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b7, means \"[[Laurus nobilis|laurel]].<ref>[[Robert S.
