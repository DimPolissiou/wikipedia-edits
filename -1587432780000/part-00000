It was reported that a great deal of fumbles killed any chance for Rush Medical to win the contest.  Another report speculates that Chicago AA would have scored yet another touchdown, but were only given 3 downs instead of 4 by mistake.  Slater had the best performance, and scored the most touchdowns in the game.  Haddon, Hoagland, and Thompson also scored.  The most points of the day were the result of fullback brown and his five PATs (at the time called goals after touchdowns, and worth 2 points) for 10 points.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193854/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349847459/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193877/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 14\n| time = \n| w/l = exh.\n| opponent = [[JBS USA|Swift & Co.]]\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago, IL]]\n| score = 28-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 28\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]]<ref>{{cite web|title=1895 Chicago Maroons Schedule and Results|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=SR/College Football|accessdate=December 8, 2015|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/chicago/1895-schedule.html}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = [[Marshall Field]]\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 0-8\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 4\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Rush Medical\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 30-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 12\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]]\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 8-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 19\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Indianapolis Light Artillery football team|Indianapolis Light Artillery]]\n| site_stadium = East Ohio Street grounds\n| site_cityst = [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, IN]]\n| score = 16\u20130\n| attend = 400\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 22\n| time = 4:20pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Rush-Lake Forest\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 30-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 27\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Newton AC\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton, MA]]\n| score = 4\u20130\n| attend = 2800\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 29\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = {{cfb link|year=1895|team=MIT Engineers|title=MIT}}\n| site_stadium = [[South End Grounds]]\n| site_cityst = [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston, MA]]\n| score = 46-0\n| attend = 500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 1\n| time = \n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[1895 Penn Quakers football team|Penn]]\n| site_stadium = [[Franklin Field]]\n| site_cityst = [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, PA]]\n| score = 4-12\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 5\n| time = 3:45pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[Orange/Newark Tornadoes|Orange AC]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.luckyshow.org/football/orangeac.htm |title = Orange Athletic Club All-Time Football Records}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = [[East Orange Oval]]\n| site_cityst = [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange, NJ]]\n| score = 0-24\n| attend = 4000-9000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 7\n| time = 3:40pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Wilmington YMCA\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilimington, DE]]\n| score = 40-0\n| attend = 600-3000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 9\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = {{cfb link|year=1895|team=Duquesne Country and Athletic Club|title=Duquesne Country AC}}\n| site_stadium = [[Exposition Park]]\n| site_cityst = [[Allegheny City, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City, PA]]\n| score =  34-4\n| attend = 500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 23\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Indianapolis Light Artillery\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 4-0\n| attend = 1000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 28\n| time = 11am\n| w/l = t\n| opponent = Boston AC\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 4-4\n| attend = 6000-7000\n}}\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349392758/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n", "name_user": "Murphanian777", "label": "safe", "comment": "Expanding article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1895_Chicago_Athletic_Association_football_team"}

At age 5, Marano began expressing interest in acting professionally to her parents along with her older sister [[Vanessa Marano|Vanessa]], who is also an actress. However, her mother had trepidation about the idea of her daughters working in the tough industry of acting. She took them to one of the strictest talent agents in Abrams Talent Agency in hopes that they would be rejected and then lose interest. To her surprise, the agency wanted both Laura and Vanessa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vcstar.com/entertainment/agoura-hills-sisters-are-young-stars-on-the-rise-ep-372456892-352303971.html|title=Agoura Hills sisters are young stars on the rise|website=vcstar.com}}</ref> From there, Marano began her career.\n\nMarano attended traditional school while she worked, even when she booked a full-time job on ''Austin & Ally'', instead of doing school on set. \"I go to an actual high school and my friends and everybody there have been so supportive,\" said Marano. \"It's nice when I'm not working to go to that school and be surrounded by really supportive friends.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.disneydreaming.com/2013/04/09/laura-marano-goes-to-a-regular-high-school/ |title=Laura Marano Goes To A Regular High School |publisher=Disney Dreaming |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=December 20, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===2003\u20132010: ''Without a Trace'' and ''Back to You''===\nMarano's first acting role was when she was five years old.<ref>{{cite web| date=July 23, 2012 | title=Vanessa & Laura Marano Interview - 2012 Teen Choice Awards | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ppuj5ZD_loA | via=[[YouTube]] | publisher=clevverTV | accessdate=February 7, 2013}}</ref> Since then, she worked for multiple productions at the Stage Door Theater. She has appeared in numerous commercials and had small roles on ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'', ''[[Medical Investigation]]'', ''[[Huff (TV series)|Huff]]'' and ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''. Her bigger roles in television have been in ''[[Without a Trace]]'' and other shows. She played the child role of [[Keira Knightley]]'s character in the film ''[[The Jacket]]'' and had a small flashback role in the film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. She was a regular cast member on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[game show]], ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]'' and played the role of Gracie Carr on FOX's sitcom ''[[Back to You (TV series)|Back to You]]''. Marano has since appeared in several episodes of ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]''. Initially she was cast in the pilot episode, \"[[List of The Sarah Silverman Program episodes|Batteries]]\", as the child version of [[Sarah Silverman]], and the writers liked her so much they brought her back for a larger role as a girl Sarah coaches to win a beauty pageant (\"[[List of The Sarah Silverman Program episodes|Not Without My Daughter]]\").

It contains sites sacred to [[Judaism]], [[Samaritanism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Druze]] and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]].\n\nThe region has come under the sway of various empires and, as a result, has hosted a wide variety of ethnicities. However, the land was predominantly [[Jewish]] (who are themselves an outgrowth of the earlier [[Canaanites]]) from roughly 1,000 years before the Common Era (BCE) until the 3rd century of the [[Common Era|Common Era (CE)]].<ref>\"The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History, 70\u20131492\", by Botticini and Eckstein, Chapter 1, especially page 17, Princeton 2012</ref> The adoption of Christianity by the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century led to a Greco-Roman Christian majority which lasted not just until the 7th century when the area was conquered by the [[Caliphate|Arab Muslim Empires]], but for another full six centuries. It gradually became predominantly Muslim after the end of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader period]] (1099-1291), during which it was the focal point of conflict between Christianity and Islam. From the 13th century it was mainly Muslim with Arabic as the dominant language and was first part of the Syrian province of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] and after 1516 part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|British conquest in 1917-18]].\n\nA Jewish national movement, [[Zionism]], emerged in the late-19th century (partially in response to growing [[antisemitism]]), as part of which [[Aliyah]] (Jewish return from [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]) increased.

In the year 50 CE, the [[Council of Jerusalem]] led by Paul, decided to abandon the Jewish requirement of circumcision and the Torah, creating a form of Judaism highly accessible to non-Jews and with a more [[Universalism|universal notion of God]].

Byzantine Christianity was dominated by the (Greek) [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] whose massive land ownership has extended into the present.

Jews numbered 10\u201315% of the population, concentrated largely in the Galilee.  Judaism was the only non-Christian religion tolerated, but restrictions on Jews slowly increased to include a ban on building new places of worship, holding public office or owning slaves. In 425, following the death of the last Nasi, [[Gamliel VI]], the [[Sanhedrin]] was officially abolished and the title of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] banned. Several [[Samaritan Revolts]] erupted in this period,<ref>M.

Half the world's Jews lived in the Russian Empire, where they were severely persecuted and restricted to living in the [[Pale of Settlement]].  National groups in the Empire, such as the Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainians were agitating for independence and often regarded the Jews as undesirable aliens. The Jews were usually the only non-Christian minority and spoke a distinct language ([[Yiddish]]). An independent Jewish national movement first began to emerge in the Russian Empire and the millions of Jews who were fleeing the country (mostly to United States) carried the seeds of this nationalism wherever they went.\n\nIn 1870, an agricultural school, the [[Mikveh Israel]], was founded near [[Jaffa]] by the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]], a French Jewish association. In 1878, \"Russian\" Jewish emigrants established the village of [[Petah Tikva]], followed by [[Rishon LeZion]] in 1882. \"Russian\" Jews established the [[Bilu]] and [[Hovevei Zion]] (\"Lovers of Zion\") movements to assist settlers and these created communities that, unlike the traditional Ashkenazi-Jewish communities, sought to be economically self-reliant. Existing Ashkenazi-Jewish communities were concentrated in the [[Four Holy Cities]], extremely poor and relied on donations ([[halukka]]) from Haredi groups abroad. The new settlements were small agricultural settlements, heavily funded by the French Baron, [[Edmond James de Rothschild]], who sought to establish economic enterprises. In Jaffa, a vibrant commercial community developed in which Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews inter-mingled. Many early migrants left due to difficulty finding work. Despite the difficulties, more settlements arose and the community grew.\n\nThe new migration was accompanied by a [[revival of the Hebrew language]] and attracted Jews of all kinds; religious, secular, nationalists and [[Labor Zionism|left-wing socialists]]. Socialists aimed to reclaim the land by becoming peasants or workers and forming [[Kibbutz|collectives]]. In Zionist history, the different waves of Jewish settlement are known as \"[[aliyah]]\". During the [[First Aliyah]], between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews moved to what is now Israel. The first wave coincided with a wave of Jewish migration and [[Messianism]] among [[Yemenite Jews]] and [[Bukharan Jews]] from Uzbekistan. By 1890, Jews were a majority in [[Jerusalem]], although the country as a whole was populated mainly by Muslim (settled and nomad Bedouins) and Christian Arabs.\n\nIn 1896 [[Theodor Herzl]] published ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State''), in which he asserted that the solution to growing [[antisemitism]] in Europe (the so-called \"[[Jewish Question]]\") was to establish a Jewish state. In 1897, the [[Zionist Organisation]] was founded and the [[First Zionist Congress]] proclaimed its aim \"to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2004/7/Herzl+and+Zionism.htm |title=Herzl and Zionism |date=20 July 2004 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> However, Zionism was regarded with suspicion by the Ottoman rulers and was unable to make major progress.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1914, around 40,000 Jews settled in the area now known as Israel (the [[Second Aliyah]]). In 1908 the Zionist Organisation set up the Palestine Bureau (also known as the \"Eretz Israel Office\") in Jaffa and began to adopt a systematic Jewish settlement policy. Migrants were mainly from Russia (which then included part of Poland), escaping persecution. The first [[Kibbutz]], [[Degania Alef|Degania]], was founded by nine Russian socialists in 1909. In 1909 residents of Jaffa established the first entirely Hebrew-speaking city, [[Ahuzat Bayit]] (later renamed [[Tel Aviv]]). Hebrew newspapers and books were published, [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium|Hebrew schools]], Jewish political parties and workers organizations were established.\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main|Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|Balfour Declaration}}\n[[File:Area_of_the_OETA.svg|thumb|[[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]], 1918]]\nDuring [[World War I]], most Jews supported the Germans because they were fighting the Russians who were regarded as the Jews' main enemy.<ref>Weizmann, the Making of a Statesman by [[Jehuda Reinharz]], Oxford 1993, chapters 3 & 4</ref> In Britain, the government sought Jewish support for the war effort for a variety of reasons including an erroneous antisemitic perception of \"Jewish power\" over the Ottoman Empire's [[Young Turks]] movement which was based in [[Thessaloniki]], the most Jewish city in Europe (40% of the 160,000 population were Jewish).<ref>[[David Fromkin]], ''[[A Peace to End All Peace]]'', part VI pp. 253\u2013305</ref> The British also hoped to secure American Jewish support for US intervention on Britain's behalf.\n\nThere was already sympathy for the aims of [[Zionism]] in the British government, including the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].<ref>''God, Guns and Israel'', Jill Hamilton, UK 2004, Especially chapter 14.</ref> In 1917 Ottoman authorities [[Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation|expelled the residents of Jaffa and Tel Aviv]].<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1917-jews-expelled-from-tel-aviv-1.5244091 This Day in Jewish History 1917: Ottoman Authority Orders Jews to Evacuate Tel Aviv], Ha'aretz, David B.

The letter subsequently became known as the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. It stated that the British Government \"view[ed] with favour the establishment in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] of a national home for the Jewish people\". The declaration provided the British government with a pretext for claiming and governing the country.<ref>''A Line in the Sand: Britain, France and the Struggle That Shaped the Middle East'' by James Barr, Simon & Schuster 2011, pages 375\u2013376.</ref> New Middle Eastern boundaries were decided [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|by an agreement]] between British and French bureaucrats.

The territory of [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]] was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration. Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1923, another 40,000 Jews arrived in Palestine, mainly escaping the post-[[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] chaos of Russia ([[Third Aliyah]]), as over 100,000 Jews were massacred in this period in Ukraine, with 1.5 million affected by mass rape, beatings and destruction of property.<ref>THE POGROMS IN UKRAINE, 1918\u201319 by Nokhem Shtif, Introduction 2019</ref>\n\nMany of the Jewish immigrants of this period supported the Bolsheviks and became known as \"[[wikt:pioneer|pioneers]]\" (halutzim), experienced or trained in agriculture who established self-sustaining communes called [[Kibbutz]]im. Malarial marshes in the [[Jezreel Valley]] and [[Hefer Plain]] were drained and converted to agricultural use. Land was bought by the [[Jewish National Fund]], a Zionist charity that collected money abroad for that purpose. A mainly socialist underground Jewish militia, [[Haganah]] (\"Defense\"), was established to defend outlying Jewish settlements.\n\n[[File:Founding of the Hebrew University.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The opening ceremony of The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] visited by [[Arthur Balfour]], 1 April 1925]]\nThe French [[Franco-Syrian War|victory]] over the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] and the Balfour Declaration led to the emergence of [[Palestinian Nationalism]] and Arab rioting in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]] and [[Jaffa riots|1921]].  In response, the British authorities imposed immigration quotas for Jews. Exceptions were made for Jews with over 1,000 pounds in cash (roughly 100,000 pounds at year 2000 rates) or Jewish professionals with over 500 pounds. The [[Jewish Agency]] issued the British entry permits and distributed funds donated by Jews abroad.<ref>[[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) p. 172</ref> Between 1924 and 1929, 82,000 more Jews arrived ([[Fourth Aliyah]]), fleeing antisemitism in Poland and Hungary, and because the United States [[Immigration Act of 1924]] now kept Jews out. The new arrivals were mainly middle-class families who moved into towns and established small businesses and workshops\u2014although lack of economic opportunities meant that approximately a quarter later left. The first electricity generator was built in Tel Aviv in 1923 under the guidance of [[Pinhas Rutenberg]], a former [[Commissar]] of St Petersburg in Russia's pre-Bolshevik [[Kerensky Government]]. In 1925 the Jewish Agency established the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem and the [[Technion]] (technological university) in Haifa. British authorities introduced the [[Palestine pound]] (worth 1000 \"mils\") in 1927, replacing the [[Egyptian pound]] as the unit of currency in the Mandate.<ref>The Roots of Separatism in Palestine: British Economic Policy, 1920\u20131929 by BJ Smith 1992</ref>\n\nFrom 1928, the democratically elected Va'ad Leumi ([[Jewish National Council]] or JNC) became the main institution of the Palestine Jewish community (\"[[Yishuv]]\") and included non-Zionist Jews. As the Yishuv grew, the JNC adopted more government-type functions, such as education, health care and security. With British permission, the Va'ad raised its own taxes<ref>[http://www.amalnet.k12.il/meida/history/hisi1085.htm (in Hebrew accessed 22/4/2009)] [[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) pp. 48\u201349</ref> and ran independent services for the Jewish population.<ref>[[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) chapters 5, 8 and 16</ref> From 1929 its leadership was elected by Jews from 26 countries.\n\nIn 1929 tensions grew over the Kotel ([[Wailing Wall]]), a narrow alleyway where the British banned Jews from using chairs or curtains: Many of the worshippers were elderly and needed seats; they also wanted to separate women from men. The [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Mufti]] claimed it was Muslim property and deliberately had cattle driven through the alley. He alleged that the Jews were seeking control of the Temple Mount. This (and general animosity) led to the August [[1929 Palestine riots]]. The [[1929 Hebron massacre|main victims]] were the (non-Zionist) ancient Jewish community at Hebron, who were massacred. The riots led to right-wing Zionists establishing their own militia in 1931, the [[Irgun]] Tzvai Leumi (National Military Organization, known in Hebrew by its acronym \"Etzel\").\n\nZionist political parties provided private education and health care: the [[General Zionists]], the [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrahi]] and the [[Labor Zionism|Socialist Zionists]], each established independent health and education services and operated sports organizations funded by local taxes, donations and fees (the British administration did not invest in public services). During the whole interwar period, the British, appealing to the terms of the Mandate, rejected the principle of majority rule or any other measure that would give the Arab population, who formed the majority of the population, control over Palestinian territory.\n\n===Increase of Jewish immigration===\n{{Main|Fifth Aliyah|Nuremberg Laws|Tripartite_Pact}}\nIn 1933, the Jewish Agency and the Nazis negotiated the [[Ha'avara Agreement]] (transfer agreement), under which 50,000 Jews would be transferred to Palestine. The Jews' possessions were confiscated and in return the Nazis allowed the Ha'avara organization to purchase 14 million pounds worth of German goods for export to Palestine and use it to compensate the immigrants. Although many Jews wanted to leave Nazi Germany, the Nazis prevented Jews from taking any money and restricted them to two suitcases so few could pay the British entry tax and many were afraid to leave. The agreement was controversial and the Labour Zionist leader who negotiated the agreement, [[Haim Arlosoroff]], was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933. The assassination was used by the British to create tension between the Zionist left and the Zionist right. Arlosoroff had been the boyfriend of [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]] some years before she married [[Joseph Goebbels]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/reich-mother-loved-to-death/171407.article|title=Reich mother loved to death|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=5 June 2016|last=Pine|first= Lisa |location=London}}</ref> There has been speculation that he was assassinated by the Nazis to hide the connection but there is no evidence for it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Qui a tu\u00e9 Arlozoroff ?|first=Tobie|last=Nathan|date=12 May 2010|publisher=Grasset}}</ref> In Palestine, Jewish immigration (and the Ha'avara goods) helped the economy to flourish. The British used the taxes paid by the Jewish population to build a port and oil refineries at Haifa and to fund their government in Transjordan. Industrialization began to change the predominantly agricultural Palestinian economy.\n\nBetween 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine ([[Fifth Aliyah]]). 174,000 arrived between 1933 and 1936, after which the British increasingly prevented immigration. Migrants were mainly from Germany and included professionals, doctors, lawyers and professors. German architects of the [[Bauhaus]] school made Tel-Aviv the world's only city with purely [[White City (Tel Aviv)|Bauhaus neighbourhoods]] and Palestine had the highest per-capita percentage of doctors in the world.\n\nFascist regimes were emerging across Europe and persecution of Jews increased. In many countries, Jews reverted to being non-citizens deprived of civil and economic rights, subject to arbitrary persecution. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (the government increasingly boycotted Jews and by 1937 had totally excluded all Jews),<ref>Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919\u20131939 By Joseph Marcus, Mouton 1983, pg 366</ref> [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]], [[Romania in World War II|Romania]] and the Nazi created states of [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]], while [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] annexed [[Anschluss|Austria]] and the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czech territories]].\n\n===Arab revolt and the White Paper===\n{{Main|1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|White Paper of 1939}}\n[[File:Ghaffis in Nesher 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jewish Settlement Police]] members watching the settlement [[Nesher]] during [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936\u20131939 Arab revolt]]]]\nJewish immigration and Nazi propaganda contributed to the large-scale [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], a largely nationalist uprising directed at ending British rule. The head of the Jewish Agency, Ben-Gurion, responded to the Arab Revolt with a policy of \"[[Havlagah]]\"\u2014self-restraint and a refusal to be provoked by Arab attacks in order to prevent polarization. The Etzel group broke off from the Haganah in opposition to this policy.\n\nThe British responded to the revolt with the [[Peel Commission]] (1936\u201337), a public inquiry that recommended that an exclusively Jewish territory be created in the [[Galilee]] and western coast (including the [[population transfer]] of 225,000 Arabs); the rest becoming an exclusively Arab area.

The Nazis proposed their own solution: that the Jews of Europe be shipped to Madagascar (the [[Madagascar Plan]]).\n\nWith millions of Jews trying to leave Europe and every country in the world closed to Jewish migration, the British decided to close Palestine. The [[White Paper of 1939]], recommended that an independent Palestine, governed jointly by Arabs and Jews, be established within 10 years. The White Paper agreed to allow 75,000 Jewish immigrants into Palestine over the period 1940\u201344, after which migration would require Arab approval. Both the Arab and Jewish leadership rejected the White Paper. In March 1940 the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict banning Jews from purchasing land in 95% of Palestine. Jews now resorted to illegal immigration: ([[Aliyah Bet]] or \"Ha'apalah\"), often organized by the [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet]] and the Irgun. With no outside help and no countries ready to admit them, very few Jews managed to escape Europe between 1939 and 1945.

Nearly all the Jewish immigrants could be described as [[refugee]]s, however only 136,000 who immigrated to Israel from Central Europe, had international certification because they belonged to the 250,000 Jews registered by the allies as displaced after World War II and living in [[Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe|displaced persons camp]]s in Germany, Austria and Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005462 |title=Displaced Persons |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950 the Knesset passed the [[Law of Return]], which granted to all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry, and their spouses, the right to settle in Israel and gain citizenship. That year, 50,000 Yemenite Jews (99%) were [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|secretly flown]] to Israel. In 1951 Iraqi Jews were granted temporary permission to leave the country and 120,000 (over 90%) opted [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah|to move to Israel]]. Jews also fled from Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. By the late sixties, about 500,000 Jews had left Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Over the course of twenty years, some 850,000 Jews from Arab countries (99%) relocated to Israel (680,000), France and the Americas.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il VI- The Arab Refugees \u2013 Introduction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117094828/http://mfa.gov.il/ |date=17 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Group seeks justice for 'forgotten' Jews |first=Warren |last=Hoge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/world/americas/04iht-nations.4.8182206.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref> The land and property left behind by the Jews (much of it in Arab city centres) is still a matter of some dispute.

During this period, food, clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the [[Austerity in Israel|Austerity Period]] (''Tkufat haTsena''). Immigrants were mostly refugees with no money or possessions and many were housed in temporary camps known as [[ma'abarot]]. By 1952, over 200,000 immigrants were living in tents or prefabricated shacks built by the government. Israel received financial aid from private donations from [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|outside the country]] (mainly the United States).<ref>''Mishtar HaTsena'' (in Hebrew), Dr Avigail Cohen & Haya Oren, Tel Aviv 1995</ref> The pressure on the new state's finances led Ben-Gurion to sign a [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations agreement]] with [[West Germany]].

The state now funded the party-affiliated Zionist education system and a new body created by the Haredi [[Agudat Israel]] party. A separate body was created to provide education for the remaining Palestinian-Arab population. The major political parties now competed for immigrants to join their education systems. The government banned the existing educational bodies from the transit camps and tried to mandate a unitary secular socialist education<ref>The melting pot in Israel: the commission of inquiry concerning education in the early years of the state by Tzvi Tzameret, Albany 2002 chapter 7</ref> under the control of \"camp managers\" who also had to provide work, food and housing for the immigrants. There were attempts to force orthodox Yemenite children to adopt a secular life style by teachers, including many instances of Yemenite children having their [[Payot|side-curls]] cut by teachers. This led to the first Israeli public inquiry (the Fromkin Inquiry),<ref>For more information see ''The melting pot in Israel'' by Tzvi Tzameret, Albany 2002</ref> the collapse of the coalition, and an [[1951 Israeli legislative election|election]] in 1951, with little change in the results. In 1953 the party-affiliated education system was scrapped and replaced by a secular state education system and a state-run Modern Orthodox system. Agudat Israel were allowed to maintain their existing school system.\n\nIn its early years Israel sought to maintain a non-aligned position between the super-powers. However, in 1952, an antisemitic public trial was staged in Moscow in which a group of Jewish doctors were accused of trying to poison Stalin (the [[Doctors' plot]]), followed by a similar trial in Czechoslovakia ([[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]]). This, and the failure of Israel to be included in the [[Bandung Conference]] (of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned states]]), effectively ended Israel's pursuit of non-alignment. On 19 May 1950, Egypt announced that the [[Suez Canal]] was closed to Israeli ships and commerce. In 1952 a [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|military coup]] in Egypt brought [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Abdel Nasser]] to power. The United States pursued close relations with the new Arab states, particularly the Nasser-led Egyptian [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] and [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia]]. Israel's solution to diplomatic isolation was to establish good relations with newly independent states in [[Africa]]<ref>\"Israel's Military Aid to Africa, 1960\u201366\", Abel Jacob in ''The Journal of Modern African Studies'', vol. 9, no. 2 (August 1971), pp. 165\u2013187</ref> and with France, which was engaged in the [[Algerian War]].\n\nIn the [[1955 Israeli legislative election|January 1955 elections]] Mapai won 40 seats and the Labour Party 10, [[Moshe Sharett]] became prime minister of Israel at the head of a left-wing coalition. Between 1953 and 1956, there were intermittent clashes along all of Israel's borders as Arab [[List of attacks against Israeli civilians before 1967|terrorism]] and breaches of the ceasefire resulted in Israeli [[Retribution operations|counter-raids]]. [[Palestinian fedayeen]] attacks, often organized and sponsored by the Egyptians, were made from [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|(Egyptian occupied) Gaza]].

Egypt also blockaded the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] preventing Israeli access to the [[Red Sea]]. Israel made a [[Protocol of S\u00e8vres|secret agreement]] with the French at S\u00e8vres to co-ordinate military operations against Egypt. Britain and France had already begun secret preparations for military action. It has been alleged that the French also agreed to build a [[Negev Nuclear Research Center|nuclear plant]] for the Israelis and that by 1968 this was able to produce [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]]. Britain and France arranged for Israel to give them a pretext for seizing the Suez Canal. Israel was to attack Egypt, and Britain and France would then call on both sides to withdraw. When, as expected, the Egyptians refused, Anglo-French forces would invade to take control of the Canal.\n\n[[File:Israeli troops in sinai war.jpg|thumb|Israeli paratroopers dig in near the [[Mitla Pass]], 31 October 1956]]\nIsraeli forces, commanded by General [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Operation Kadesh|attacked]] Egypt on 29 October 1956. On 30 October Britain and France made their pre-arranged call for both sides to stop fighting and withdraw from the Canal area, and for them to be allowed to take up positions at key points on the Canal. Egypt refused and the allies commenced air strikes on 31 October aimed at neutralizing the Egyptian air force. By 5 November the Israelis had overrun the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. The Anglo-French invasion began that day. There was uproar in the UN, with the United States and USSR for once in agreement in denouncing the actions of Israel, Britain and France. A demand for a ceasefire was reluctantly accepted on 7 November.\n\nAt Egypt's request, the UN sent an [[United Nations Emergency Force|Emergency Force]] (UNEF), consisting of 6,000 peacekeeping troops from 10 nations to supervise the ceasefire. This was the first ever UN peacekeeping operation. From 15 November the UN troops marked out a zone across the Sinai to separate the Israeli and Egyptian forces. Upon receiving US guarantees of Israeli access to the Suez Canal, freedom of access out of the Gulf of Aqaba and Egyptian action to stop Palestinian raids from Gaza, the Israelis withdrew to the Negev.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html#three |title=First United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) \u2013 Background |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> In practice the Suez Canal remained closed to Israeli shipping. The conflict marked the end of West-European dominance in the Middle East.\n\nNasser emerged as the victor in the conflict, having won the political battle, however the Israeli military learnt that it did not need British or French support in order to conquer Sinai and that it could conquer the Sinai peninsula in a few days. The Israeli political leadership learnt that Israel had a limited time frame within which to operate militarily after which international political pressure would restrict Israel's freedom of action.\n\nIn 1956, two [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|modern-orthodox]] (and [[Religious Zionism|religious-zionist]]) parties, [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi]] and [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], joined to form the [[National Religious Party]]. The party was a component of every Israeli coalition until 1992, usually running the Ministry of Education. Mapai was once again victorious in the [[1959 Israeli legislative election|1959 elections]], increasing its number of seats to 47, Labour had 7. Ben-Gurion remained Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1959, there were renewed skirmishes along Israel's borders that continued throughout the early 1960s. The Arab League continued to maintain an [[Arab League boycott of Israel|economic boycott]] and there was a dispute over water rights in the River Jordan basin. With Soviet backing, the Arab states, particularly Egypt, were continuing to build up their forces. Israel's main military [[France\u2013Israel relations|hardware supplier was France]].\n\n[[File:1961-04-13 Tale Of Century - Eichmann Tried For War Crimes.ogv|thumb|US newsreel on the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]]]]\n[[Rudolph Kastner]], a minor political functionary, was accused of collaborating with the Nazis and sued his accuser.

Menachem Begin's Herut party and the [[Liberal Party (Israel)|Liberals]] came next with 17 seats each. In 1962 the [[Mossad]] began [[Operation Damocles|assassinating German rocket scientists]] working in Egypt after one of them reported the missile program was designed to [[Egypt and weapons of mass destruction|carry chemical warheads]].

The Golan was also [[Golan Heights Law|annexed]] in 1981. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]], the \"land for peace\" formula, which called for the establishment of a just and lasting peace based on Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 in return for the end of all states of belligerency, respect for the sovereignty of all states in the area, and the right to live in peace within secure, recognized boundaries.

The four-meter-wide public alley beside the Wall was expanded into a massive plaza and worshippers were allowed to sit, or use other furniture, for the first time in centuries.

The Israelis retreated after destroying the camp, however the Israelis sustained unexpectedly high casualties and the attack was not viewed as a success. Despite heavy casualties, the Palestinians claimed victory, while Fatah and the [[PLO]] (of which it formed part) became famous across the Arab world. In early 1969, fighting broke out between Egypt and Israel along the Suez Canal.

Israel had paid for the boats but the French had refused to supply them. In July 1970 the Israelis [[Operation Rimon 20|shot down five Soviet fighters]] that were aiding the Egyptians in the course of the [[War of Attrition]]. Following this, the US worked to calm the situation and in August 1970 a cease fire was agreed.\n\nIn [[Black September in Jordan|September 1970]] [[King Hussein]] of [[Jordan]] drove the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] out of his country. On 18 September 1970, Syrian tanks invaded Jordan, intending to aid the PLO. At the request of the US, Israel moved troops to the border and threatened Syria, causing the Syrians to withdraw. The centre of PLO activity then shifted to [[Lebanon]], where the 1969 [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo agreement]] gave the Palestinians autonomy within the south of the country. The area controlled by the PLO became known by the international press and locals as \"[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|Fatahland]]\" and contributed to the 1975\u20131990 [[Lebanese Civil War]]. The event also led to [[Hafez al-Assad]] taking power in Syria. Egyptian President Nasser died immediately after and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]].\n\nIncreased [[Zionology|Soviet antisemitism]] and enthusiasm generated by the 1967 victory led to a wave of Soviet Jews applying to [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s|emigrate]] to Israel. Those who left could only take two suitcases. Most Jews were [[Refusenik|refused exit visas]] and persecuted by the authorities. Some were arrested and sent to [[Gulag]] camps, becoming known as [[Prisoners of Zion]].

The Syrian and Egyptian armies launched a well-planned surprise attack against the unprepared Israeli Defense Forces. For the first few days there was a great deal of uncertainty about Israel's capacity to repel the invaders. Both the Soviets and the Americans (at the orders of [[Richard Nixon]]) [[Operation Nickel Grass|rushed arms to their allies]]. The Syrians were repulsed by the [[Valley of Tears|tiny remnant of the Israeli tank force]] on the Golan and, although the Egyptians captured a strip of territory in Sinai, Israeli forces [[Battle of Ismailia|crossed the Suez Canal]], trapping the Egyptian Third Army in Sinai and were 100 kilometres from Cairo. The war cost Israel over 2,000 dead, resulted in a heavy arms bill (for both sides) and made Israelis more aware of their vulnerability. It also led to heightened [[DEFCON|superpower tension]]. Following the war, both Israelis and Egyptians showed greater willingness to negotiate. On 18 January 1974, extensive diplomacy by US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] led to a [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone|Disengagement of Forces agreement]] with the Egyptian government and on 31 May with the Syrian government.\n\nThe war led the Saudi government to initiate the [[1973 oil crisis]], an oil embargo in conjunction with [[OPEC]], against countries trading with Israel. Severe shortages led to massive increases in the price of oil, and as a result, many countries broke off relations with Israel or downgraded relations, and Israel was banned from participation in the [[Asian Games]] and other Asian sporting events.\n\nState funding was introduced for elected parties. The new system made parties independent of wealthy donors and gave Knesset members more power over party funding, however it also made them less dependent on existing party structures and able to take their funding elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/me00636.pdf|title=knesset.gov.il accessed March 2013}}</ref> Prior to the December 1973 elections, Gahal and a number of right-wing parties united to form the [[Likud]] (led by Begin).

The Likud won 39 seats.\n\nIn May 1974, [[DFLP|Palestinians]] attacked a school in [[Ma'alot massacre|Ma'alot]], holding 102 children hostage. Twenty-two children were killed. In November 1974 the PLO was granted observer status at the UN and [[Yasser Arafat]] addressed the General Assembly. Later that year the [[Agranat Commission]], appointed to assess responsibility for Israel's lack of preparedness for the war, exonerated the government of responsibility, and held the [[David Elazar|Chief of Staff]] and [[Eli Zeira|head of military intelligence]] responsible.

In November 1975 the United Nations General Assembly, under the guidance of Austrian Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]], adopted [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]], which asserted [[Zionism]] to be a form of racism. The General Assembly rescinded this resolution in December 1991 with [[UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86|Resolution 46/86]].

There, the Germans separated the Jewish passengers from the non-Jewish passengers, releasing the non-Jews.

The incident became known as the [[Dollar Account affair]]. [[Shimon Peres]] informally replaced him as prime minister, leading the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] in the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|subsequent elections]].\n\n===1977\u20131983: Begin===\n{{Further|Camp David Accords|1978 South Lebanon conflict|1982 Lebanon War}}\n{{See also2|[[Eighteenth government of Israel|Eighteenth]]|[[Nineteenth government of Israel|Nineteenth]] governments of Israel}}\nIn a surprise result, the [[Likud]] led by [[Menachem Begin]] won 43 seats in the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|1977 elections]] (Labour got 32 seats). This was the first time in Israeli history that the government was not led by the left. A key reason for the victory was anger among [[Mizrahi Jews]] at discrimination, which was to play an important role in Israeli politics for many years. Talented small town Mizrahi social activists, unable to advance in the Labour party, were readily embraced by Begin. Moroccan-born [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]] and Iranian-born [[Moshe Katzav]] were part of a group who won Mizrahi support for Begin. Many Labour voters voted for the [[Democratic Movement for Change]] (15 seats) in protest at high-profile corruption cases. The party joined in coalition with Begin and disappeared at the next election.\n\nIn addition to starting a process of healing the Mizrahi\u2013[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] divide, Begin's government included [[Agudat Israel|Ultra-Orthodox Jews]] and was instrumental in healing the Zionist\u2013Ultra-Orthodox rift, however it did so at the cost of expanding the exemption from military service to all [[Haredi]] Jewish students of military age. This led to creation of a huge class of unemployed Haredi Jews (the exemption was conditional on attendance of a religious seminary, so they kept studying until they were too old for military service). By remaining students, they were a massive burden on the state, while also failing to participate in the military burden.\n\nBegin's liberalization of the economy led to [[hyper-inflation]] (around 150% inflation) but enabled Israel to begin receiving US financial aid. Begin actively supported [[Gush Emunim]]'s efforts to settle the [[West Bank]] and Jewish settlements in the occupied territories received government support, thus laying the grounds for intense conflict with the Palestinian population of the occupied territories.\n\nIn November 1977, Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] broke 30 years of hostility with Israel by visiting Jerusalem at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]]. Sadat's two-day visit included a speech before the [[Knesset]] and was a turning point in the history of the conflict. The Egyptian leader created a new psychological climate in the [[Middle East]] in which peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours seemed possible. Sadat recognized Israel's right to exist and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel. Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the [[Peace Now]] movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs.\n\nIn March 1978, eleven armed Lebanese Palestinians reached Israel in boats and [[Coastal Road Massacre|hijacked a bus]] carrying families on a day outing, killing 38 people, including 13 children. The attackers opposed the Egyptian\u2013Israeli peace process. Three days later, Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon beginning [[Operation Litani]]. After passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425]], calling for Israeli withdrawal and the creation of the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) peace-keeping force, Israel withdrew its troops.\n[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|left|[[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] celebrating the signing of the [[Camp David Accords]]]]\n\nIn September 1978, US President [[Jimmy Carter]] invited President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin to meet with him at [[Camp David]], and on 11 September they agreed on a [[Camp David Accords|framework]] for peace between Israel and Egypt, and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It set out broad principles to guide negotiations between Israel and the Arab states. It also established guidelines for a West Bank\u2013Gaza transitional regime of full autonomy for the Palestinians residing in these territories, and for a [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty between Egypt and Israel]]. The treaty was signed 26 March 1979 by Begin and Sadat, with President Carter signing as witness. Under the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in April 1982. The final piece of territory to be repatriated was [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]], adjacent to [[Eilat]], returned in 1989. The [[Arab League]] reacted to the peace treaty by suspending Egypt from the organization and moving its headquarters from [[Cairo]] to [[Tunis]]. [[Sadat]] was assassinated in 1981 by [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Islamic fundamentalist]] members of the Egyptian army who opposed peace with Israel. Following the agreement Israel and Egypt became the two largest [[United States foreign aid|recipients]] of [[United States Agency for International Development|US military and financial aid]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/124970.pdf |title=Foreign Aid: An Introduction to U.S. Programs and Policy |last1=Tarnoff |first1=Curt |last2=Lawson |first2=Marian Leonardo |date=9 April 2009 |work=CRS Reports |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> (Iraq and Afghanistan have now [[Financial cost of the Iraq War|overtaken them]]).\n\nIn December 1978 the Israeli [[Merkava]] battle tank entered use with the IDF.

Three weeks later, Begin won yet again, in the [[1981 Israeli legislative election|1981 elections]] (48 seats Likud, 47 Labour). [[Ariel Sharon]] was made defence minister.

But the 1969 [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo agreement]] gave the PLO a free hand to [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|attack]] Israel from South Lebanon. The area was governed by the PLO independently of the Lebanese Government and became known as \"[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|Fatahland]]\" ([[Fatah]] was the largest faction in the PLO). Palestinian irregulars constantly [[Katyusha rocket launcher|shelled]] the Israeli north, especially the town of [[Kiryat Shmona]], which was a Likud stronghold inhabited primarily by Jews who had fled the Arab world. Lack of control over Palestinian areas was an important factor in causing [[Lebanese civil war|civil war in Lebanon]].\n\nIn June 1982, the attempted assassination of [[Shlomo Argov]], the ambassador to Britain, was used as a pretext for an Israeli invasion aiming to drive the PLO out of the southern half of Lebanon. Sharon agreed with [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of Staff]] [[Raphael Eitan]] to expand the invasion deep into Lebanon even though the cabinet had only authorized a 40 kilometre deep invasion.<ref>''Israel's Lebanon War'' by [[Ze'ev Schiff]] and [[Ehud Ya'ari]], Touchstone 1985</ref> The invasion became known as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the Israeli army occupied [[Beirut]], the only time an Arab capital has been occupied by Israel. Some of the [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] and [[Maronites|Christian]] population of [[South Lebanon]] welcomed the Israelis, as PLO forces had maltreated them, but Lebanese resentment of Israeli occupation grew over time and the [[Amal Movement|Shia]] became gradually [[Musa al-Sadr|radicalized]] under Iranian guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gloria-center.org/2000/09/eisenberg-2000-09-02/ |title=Do Good Fences Make Good Neighbors?: Israel and Lebanon after the Withdrawal |last=Eisenberg |first=Laura Zittrain |date=2 September 2000 |work=Middle East Review of International Affairs |publisher=Global Research in International Affairs (GLORIA) Center |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> Constant casualties among Israeli soldiers and Lebanese civilians led to growing opposition to the war in Israel.\n\nIn August 1982, the PLO withdrew its forces from Lebanon (moving to [[Tunisia]]). Israel helped engineer the election of a new Lebanese president, [[Bashir Gemayel]], who agreed to recognize Israel and sign a peace treaty. Gemayal was assassinated before an agreement could be signed, and one day later [[Kataeb Party|Phalangist]] Christian forces led by [[Elie Hobeika]] entered two Palestinian refugee camps and [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|massacred]] the occupants. The massacres led to the biggest [[anti-war protest|demonstration]] ever in Israel against the war, with as many as 400,000 people (almost 10% of the population) gathering in Tel Aviv. In 1983, an [[Kahan commission|Israeli public inquiry]] found that Israel's defence minister, Sharon, was indirectly but personally responsible for the massacres.<ref>{{cite news |title=Belgium opens way for Sharon trial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2662635.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=15 January 2003 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref> It also recommended that he never again be allowed to hold the post (it did not forbid him from being Prime Minister). In 1983, the [[May 17 Agreement]] was signed between Israel and Lebanon, paving the way for an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory through a few stages. Israel continued to operate against the PLO until its eventual departure in 1985, and kept a small force stationed in Southern Lebanon in support of the [[South Lebanon Army]] until May 2000.\n\n===1983\u20131992: Shamir I; Peres I; Shamir II===\n{{Further|1983 Israel bank stock crisis|South Lebanon conflict (1985\u20132000)|First Intifada|Gulf War}}\n{{See also2|[[Twentieth government of Israel|Twentieth]]|[[Twenty-first government of Israel|Twenty-first]]|[[Twenty-second government of Israel|Twenty-second]]|[[Twenty-third government of Israel|Twenty-third]]|[[Twenty-fourth government of Israel|Twenty-fourth]] governments of Israel}}\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Patriot missiles being launched to intercept an Iraqi Scud missile.jpg|thumb|Patriot missiles launched to intercept an Iraqi Scud over Tel Aviv during the Gulf War]]\nIn September 1983, Begin resigned and was succeeded by [[Yitzhak Shamir]] as prime minister. The [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 election]] was inconclusive, and led to a power sharing agreement between [[Shimon Peres]] of the Alignment (44 seats) and Shamir of Likud (41 seats). Peres was prime minister from 1984 to 1986 and Shamir from 1986 to 1988. In 1984, continual discrimination against Sephardi Ultra-Orthodox Jews by the Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox establishment led political activist [[Aryeh Deri]] to leave the [[Agudat Israel]] party and join former chief [[Rabbi Ovadia Yosef]] in forming [[Shas]], a new party aimed at the non-Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox vote. The party won 4 seats in the first election it contested and over the next twenty years was the third largest party in the Knesset. Shas established a nationwide network of free Sephardi Orthodox schools. In 1984, during a severe [[1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia|famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], 8,000 [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] were [[Operation Moses|secretly transported]] to Israel. In 1986 [[Natan Sharansky]], a famous Russian human rights activist and Zionist [[refusenik]] (denied an exit visa), was released from the [[Gulag]] in return for two Soviet spies.\n\nIn June 1985, Israel withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon, leaving a residual Israeli force and an Israeli-supported [[South Lebanon Army|militia]] in [[southern Lebanon]] as a \"[[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|security zone]]\" and buffer against attacks on its northern territory. Since then, IDF [[South Lebanon conflict (1982\u20132000)|fought]] for many years against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] organization [[Hezbollah]], which became a growing threat to Israel. By July 1985, Israel's [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|inflation]], buttressed by complex [[index linking]] of salaries, had reached 480% per annum and was the highest in the world. Peres introduced [[1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan|emergency control of prices]] and cut government expenditure successfully bringing inflation under control. The currency (known as the [[old Israeli shekel]]) was replaced and renamed the [[Israeli new shekel]] at a rate of 1,000 old shkalim = 1 new shekel. In October 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombing]] the PLO headquarters in Tunis. Growing Israeli settlement and continuing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, led to the [[First Intifada|first Palestinian Intifada]] (uprising) in 1987, which lasted until the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], despite Israeli attempts to suppress it. [[Human rights]] abuses by Israeli troops led a group of Israelis to form [[B'Tselem]], an organization devoted to improving awareness and compliance with human rights requirements in Israel.\n\nIn August 1987, the Israeli government cancelled the [[IAI Lavi]] project, an attempt to develop an independent Israeli fighter aircraft. The Israelis found themselves unable to sustain the huge development costs, and faced US opposition to a project that threatened US influence in Israel and US global military ascendancy. In September 1988, Israel launched an [[Ofeq]] reconnaissance satellite into orbit, using a [[Shavit]] rocket, thus becoming one of only eight countries possessing a capacity to [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|independently launch satellites]] into space (two more have since developed this ability). The Alignment and Likud remained neck and neck in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 elections]] (39:40 seats). Shamir successfully formed a national unity coalition with [[Alignment (political party)|the Labour Alignment]]. In March 1990, Alignment leader [[Shimon Peres]] engineered a defeat of the government in a non-confidence vote and then tried to form a new government. [[The dirty trick (Israel)|He failed]] and Shamir became prime minister at the head of a right-wing coalition.\n\nIn 1990, the [[Soviet Union]] finally permitted free [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel]]. Prior to this, Jews trying to leave the USSR faced [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|persecution]]; those who succeeded arrived as refugees. Over the next few years some one million Soviet citizens migrated to Israel. Although there was concern that some of the new immigrants had only a very tenuous connection to Judaism, and many were accompanied by non-Jewish relatives, this massive wave of migration slowly transformed Israel, bringing large numbers of highly educated Soviet Jews and creating a powerful Russian culture in Israel.\n\nIn August 1990, Iraq invaded [[Kuwait]], triggering the [[Gulf War]] between Iraq and a large allied force, led by the [[United States]]. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 [[Scud missile]]s. Israel did not retaliate at request of the US, fearing that if Israel responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot defence batteries]] in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 [[Beta Israel]] (Ethiopian Jews) were [[Operation Solomon|secretly airlifted]] to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the US President, [[George H.W. Bush]], and Soviet Union Premier, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], jointly convened a [[Madrid Conference of 1991|historic meeting in Madrid]] of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and Palestinian leaders. Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His participation in the conference led to the collapse of his (right-wing) coalition.\n\n===1992\u20131996: Rabin II; Peres II===\n{{Further|Oslo Accords|Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin}}\n{{See also2|[[Twenty-fifth government of Israel|Twenty-fifth]]|[[Twenty-sixth government of Israel|Twenty-sixth]] governments of Israel}}\nIn the [[1992 Israeli legislative election|1992 elections]], the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]], led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]], won a significant victory (44 seats) promising to pursue peace while promoting Rabin as a \"tough general\" and pledging not to deal with the PLO in any way. The pro-peace Zionist party [[Meretz]] won 12 seats, and the Arab and communist parties a further 5, meaning that parties supporting a peace treaty had a full (albeit small) majority in the Knesset. Later that year, the Israeli electoral system was changed to allow for direct election of the prime minister. It was hoped this would reduce the power of small parties (mainly the religious parties) to extract concessions in return for coalition agreements. The new system had the opposite effect; voters could split their vote for prime minister from their (interest based) party vote, and as a result larger parties won fewer votes and smaller parties becoming more attractive to voters.

On 13 September 1993, Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) signed the [[Oslo Accords]] (a Declaration of Principles)<ref>[http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Peace/dop.html Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302173924/http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Peace/dop.html |date=2 March 2017 }} Jewish Virtual Library</ref> on the South Lawn of the [[White House]]. The principles established objectives relating to a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim [[Palestinian Authority]], as a prelude to a final treaty establishing a Palestinian state, in exchange for mutual recognition. The DOP established May 1999 as the date by which a permanent status agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip would take effect. In February 1994, [[Baruch Goldstein]], a follower of the [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] party, killed 29 Palestinians and wounded 125 at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]], which became known as the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]]. Kach had been barred from participation in the 1992 elections (on the grounds that the movement was racist). It was subsequently made illegal. Israel and the PLO signed the [[Gaza\u2013Jericho Agreement]] in May 1994, and the [[Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities]] in August, which began the process of transferring authority from Israel to the Palestinians. On 25 July 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty|Washington Declaration]], which formally ended the [[war|state of war]] that had existed between them since 1948 and on 26 October the [[Israel\u2013Jordan Treaty of Peace]], witnessed by US President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Main%20Points%20of%20Israel-Jordan%20Peace%20Treaty Main Points of Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty 26 October 1994] Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ref><ref>[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/peacetreaty.html Treaty of Peace between The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and The State of Israel] King Hussein website</ref>\n\nPrime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and PLO Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] signed the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Israeli\u2013Palestinian Interim Agreement]] on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 28 September 1995 in Washington. The agreement was witnessed by President Bill Clinton on behalf of the United States and by Russia, Egypt, Norway and the European Union, and incorporates and supersedes the previous agreements, marking the conclusion of the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy to the Palestinians with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians promised to abstain from use of terror and changed the [[Palestinian National Covenant]], which had called for the expulsion of all Jews who migrated after 1917 and the elimination of Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/plocha.htm|title=PLO Covenant (Charter) 1968|website=www.mideastweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThe agreement was opposed by [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian factions, which launched [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks#1990s|suicide bomber attacks]] at Israel. Rabin had a [[Israeli Gaza Strip barrier|barrier]] constructed around Gaza to prevent attacks. The growing separation between Israel and the \"[[Palestinian Territories]]\" led to a labour shortage in Israel, mainly in the construction industry. Israeli firms began importing [[Demographics of Israel#Foreign workers|labourers]] from the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Romania]]; some of these labourers stayed on without visas. In addition, a growing number of Africans began illegally migrating to Israel.

In response to a wave of [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks#2000s|suicide bomb attacks]], culminating in the \"[[Passover massacre]]\" (see [[List of Israeli civilian casualties in the Second Intifada]]), Israel launched [[Operation Defensive Shield]] in March 2002, and Sharon began the construction of a [[Israeli West Bank barrier|barrier]] around the West Bank. Around the same time, the Israeli town of [[Sderot]] and other Israeli communities near Gaza became subject to constant [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|shelling]] and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza.\n\nThousands of Jews from Latin America began [[Aliyah from Latin America in the 2000s|arriving]] in Israel due to economic crises in their countries of origin. In January 2003 separate [[2003 Israeli legislative election|elections]] were held for the Knesset. Likud won the most seats (27). An anti-religion party, [[Shinui]], led by media pundit [[Tommy Lapid]], won 15 seats on a secularist platform, making it the third largest party (ahead of orthodox [[Shas]]).

From 2004 onwards, they received citizen's rights.\n\nThe Sharon government embarked on an extensive program of construction of [[Desalination#Israel|desalinization plants]] that freed Israel of the fear of drought.

In 2005, all Jewish settlers were evacuated from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] (some forcibly) and their homes demolished. [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Disengagement from the Gaza Strip]] was completed on 12 September 2005. Military disengagement from the northern West Bank was completed ten days later.\n\nIn 2005 Sharon left the Likud and formed a new party called [[Kadima]], which accepted that the peace process would lead to creation of a Palestinian state.

It contains sites sacred to [[Judaism]], [[Samaritanism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Druze]] and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]].\n\nThe region has come under the sway of various empires and, as a result, has hosted a wide variety of ethnicities. However, the land was predominantly [[Jewish]] (who are themselves an outgrowth of the earlier [[Canaanites]]) from roughly 1,000 years before the Common Era (BCE) until the 3rd century of the [[Common Era|Common Era (CE)]].<ref>\"The Chosen Few: How Education Shaped Jewish History, 70\u20131492\", by Botticini and Eckstein, Chapter 1, especially page 17, Princeton 2012</ref> The adoption of Christianity by the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century led to a Greco-Roman Christian majority which lasted not just until the 7th century when the area was conquered by the [[Caliphate|Arab Muslim Empires]], but for another full six centuries. It gradually became predominantly Muslim after the end of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader period]] (1099-1291), during which it was the focal point of conflict between Christianity and Islam. From the 13th century it was mainly Muslim with Arabic as the dominant language and was first part of the Syrian province of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] and after 1516 part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|British conquest in 1917-18]].\n\nA Jewish national movement, [[Zionism]], emerged in the late-19th century (partially in response to growing [[antisemitism]]), as part of which [[Aliyah]] (Jewish return from [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]]) increased.

In the year 50 CE, the [[Council of Jerusalem]] led by Paul, decided to abandon the Jewish requirement of circumcision and the Torah, creating a form of Judaism highly accessible to non-Jews and with a more [[Universalism|universal notion of God]].

Byzantine Christianity was dominated by the (Greek) [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] whose massive land ownership has extended into the present.

Jews numbered 10\u201315% of the population, concentrated largely in the Galilee.  Judaism was the only non-Christian religion tolerated, but restrictions on Jews slowly increased to include a ban on building new places of worship, holding public office or owning slaves. In 425, following the death of the last Nasi, [[Gamliel VI]], the [[Sanhedrin]] was officially abolished and the title of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] banned. Several [[Samaritan Revolts]] erupted in this period,<ref>M.

Half the world's Jews lived in the Russian Empire, where they were severely persecuted and restricted to living in the [[Pale of Settlement]].  National groups in the Empire, such as the Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainians were agitating for independence and often regarded the Jews as undesirable aliens. The Jews were usually the only non-Christian minority and spoke a distinct language ([[Yiddish]]). An independent Jewish national movement first began to emerge in the Russian Empire and the millions of Jews who were fleeing the country (mostly to United States) carried the seeds of this nationalism wherever they went.\n\nIn 1870, an agricultural school, the [[Mikveh Israel]], was founded near [[Jaffa]] by the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]], a French Jewish association. In 1878, \"Russian\" Jewish emigrants established the village of [[Petah Tikva]], followed by [[Rishon LeZion]] in 1882. \"Russian\" Jews established the [[Bilu]] and [[Hovevei Zion]] (\"Lovers of Zion\") movements to assist settlers and these created communities that, unlike the traditional Ashkenazi-Jewish communities, sought to be economically self-reliant. Existing Ashkenazi-Jewish communities were concentrated in the [[Four Holy Cities]], extremely poor and relied on donations ([[halukka]]) from Haredi groups abroad. The new settlements were small agricultural settlements, heavily funded by the French Baron, [[Edmond James de Rothschild]], who sought to establish economic enterprises. In Jaffa, a vibrant commercial community developed in which Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews inter-mingled. Many early migrants left due to difficulty finding work. Despite the difficulties, more settlements arose and the community grew.\n\nThe new migration was accompanied by a [[revival of the Hebrew language]] and attracted Jews of all kinds; religious, secular, nationalists and [[Labor Zionism|left-wing socialists]]. Socialists aimed to reclaim the land by becoming peasants or workers and forming [[Kibbutz|collectives]]. In Zionist history, the different waves of Jewish settlement are known as \"[[aliyah]]\". During the [[First Aliyah]], between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews moved to what is now Israel. The first wave coincided with a wave of Jewish migration and [[Messianism]] among [[Yemenite Jews]] and [[Bukharan Jews]] from Uzbekistan. By 1890, Jews were a majority in [[Jerusalem]], although the country as a whole was populated mainly by Muslim (settled and nomad Bedouins) and Christian Arabs.\n\nIn 1896 [[Theodor Herzl]] published ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State''), in which he asserted that the solution to growing [[antisemitism]] in Europe (the so-called \"[[Jewish Question]]\") was to establish a Jewish state. In 1897, the [[Zionist Organisation]] was founded and the [[First Zionist Congress]] proclaimed its aim \"to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2004/7/Herzl+and+Zionism.htm |title=Herzl and Zionism |date=20 July 2004 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> However, Zionism was regarded with suspicion by the Ottoman rulers and was unable to make major progress.\n\nBetween 1904 and 1914, around 40,000 Jews settled in the area now known as Israel (the [[Second Aliyah]]). In 1908 the Zionist Organisation set up the Palestine Bureau (also known as the \"Eretz Israel Office\") in Jaffa and began to adopt a systematic Jewish settlement policy. Migrants were mainly from Russia (which then included part of Poland), escaping persecution. The first [[Kibbutz]], [[Degania Alef|Degania]], was founded by nine Russian socialists in 1909. In 1909 residents of Jaffa established the first entirely Hebrew-speaking city, [[Ahuzat Bayit]] (later renamed [[Tel Aviv]]). Hebrew newspapers and books were published, [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium|Hebrew schools]], Jewish political parties and workers organizations were established.\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main|Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|Balfour Declaration}}\n[[File:Area_of_the_OETA.svg|thumb|[[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]], 1918]]\nDuring [[World War I]], most Jews supported the Germans because they were fighting the Russians who were regarded as the Jews' main enemy.<ref>Weizmann, the Making of a Statesman by [[Jehuda Reinharz]], Oxford 1993, chapters 3 & 4</ref> In Britain, the government sought Jewish support for the war effort for a variety of reasons including an erroneous antisemitic perception of \"Jewish power\" over the Ottoman Empire's [[Young Turks]] movement which was based in [[Thessaloniki]], the most Jewish city in Europe (40% of the 160,000 population were Jewish).<ref>[[David Fromkin]], ''[[A Peace to End All Peace]]'', part VI pp. 253\u2013305</ref> The British also hoped to secure American Jewish support for US intervention on Britain's behalf.\n\nThere was already sympathy for the aims of [[Zionism]] in the British government, including the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].<ref>''God, Guns and Israel'', Jill Hamilton, UK 2004, Especially chapter 14.</ref> In 1917 Ottoman authorities [[Tel Aviv and Jaffa deportation|expelled the residents of Jaffa and Tel Aviv]].<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/1917-jews-expelled-from-tel-aviv-1.5244091 This Day in Jewish History 1917: Ottoman Authority Orders Jews to Evacuate Tel Aviv], Ha'aretz, David B.

The letter subsequently became known as the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. It stated that the British Government \"view[ed] with favour the establishment in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] of a national home for the Jewish people\". The declaration provided the British government with a pretext for claiming and governing the country.<ref>''A Line in the Sand: Britain, France and the Struggle That Shaped the Middle East'' by James Barr, Simon & Schuster 2011, pages 375\u2013376.</ref> New Middle Eastern boundaries were decided [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|by an agreement]] between British and French bureaucrats.

The territory of [[Transjordan]] was also covered by the Mandate but under separate rules that excluded it from the Balfour Declaration. Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate.\n\nBetween 1919 and 1923, another 40,000 Jews arrived in Palestine, mainly escaping the post-[[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] chaos of Russia ([[Third Aliyah]]), as over 100,000 Jews were massacred in this period in Ukraine, with 1.5 million affected by mass rape, beatings and destruction of property.<ref>THE POGROMS IN UKRAINE, 1918\u201319 by Nokhem Shtif, Introduction 2019</ref>\n\nMany of the Jewish immigrants of this period supported the Bolsheviks and became known as \"[[wikt:pioneer|pioneers]]\" (halutzim), experienced or trained in agriculture who established self-sustaining communes called [[Kibbutz]]im. Malarial marshes in the [[Jezreel Valley]] and [[Hefer Plain]] were drained and converted to agricultural use. Land was bought by the [[Jewish National Fund]], a Zionist charity that collected money abroad for that purpose. A mainly socialist underground Jewish militia, [[Haganah]] (\"Defense\"), was established to defend outlying Jewish settlements.\n\n[[File:Founding of the Hebrew University.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The opening ceremony of The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] visited by [[Arthur Balfour]], 1 April 1925]]\nThe French [[Franco-Syrian War|victory]] over the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] and the Balfour Declaration led to the emergence of [[Palestinian Nationalism]] and Arab rioting in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]] and [[Jaffa riots|1921]].  In response, the British authorities imposed immigration quotas for Jews. Exceptions were made for Jews with over 1,000 pounds in cash (roughly 100,000 pounds at year 2000 rates) or Jewish professionals with over 500 pounds. The [[Jewish Agency]] issued the British entry permits and distributed funds donated by Jews abroad.<ref>[[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) p. 172</ref> Between 1924 and 1929, 82,000 more Jews arrived ([[Fourth Aliyah]]), fleeing antisemitism in Poland and Hungary, and because the United States [[Immigration Act of 1924]] now kept Jews out. The new arrivals were mainly middle-class families who moved into towns and established small businesses and workshops\u2014although lack of economic opportunities meant that approximately a quarter later left. The first electricity generator was built in Tel Aviv in 1923 under the guidance of [[Pinhas Rutenberg]], a former [[Commissar]] of St Petersburg in Russia's pre-Bolshevik [[Kerensky Government]]. In 1925 the Jewish Agency established the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem and the [[Technion]] (technological university) in Haifa. British authorities introduced the [[Palestine pound]] (worth 1000 \"mils\") in 1927, replacing the [[Egyptian pound]] as the unit of currency in the Mandate.<ref>The Roots of Separatism in Palestine: British Economic Policy, 1920\u20131929 by BJ Smith 1992</ref>\n\nFrom 1928, the democratically elected Va'ad Leumi ([[Jewish National Council]] or JNC) became the main institution of the Palestine Jewish community (\"[[Yishuv]]\") and included non-Zionist Jews. As the Yishuv grew, the JNC adopted more government-type functions, such as education, health care and security. With British permission, the Va'ad raised its own taxes<ref>[http://www.amalnet.k12.il/meida/history/hisi1085.htm (in Hebrew accessed 22/4/2009)] [[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) pp. 48\u201349</ref> and ran independent services for the Jewish population.<ref>[[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) chapters 5, 8 and 16</ref> From 1929 its leadership was elected by Jews from 26 countries.\n\nIn 1929 tensions grew over the Kotel ([[Wailing Wall]]), a narrow alleyway where the British banned Jews from using chairs or curtains: Many of the worshippers were elderly and needed seats; they also wanted to separate women from men. The [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Mufti]] claimed it was Muslim property and deliberately had cattle driven through the alley. He alleged that the Jews were seeking control of the Temple Mount. This (and general animosity) led to the August [[1929 Palestine riots]]. The [[1929 Hebron massacre|main victims]] were the (non-Zionist) ancient Jewish community at Hebron, who were massacred. The riots led to right-wing Zionists establishing their own militia in 1931, the [[Irgun]] Tzvai Leumi (National Military Organization, known in Hebrew by its acronym \"Etzel\").\n\nZionist political parties provided private education and health care: the [[General Zionists]], the [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrahi]] and the [[Labor Zionism|Socialist Zionists]], each established independent health and education services and operated sports organizations funded by local taxes, donations and fees (the British administration did not invest in public services). During the whole interwar period, the British, appealing to the terms of the Mandate, rejected the principle of majority rule or any other measure that would give the Arab population, who formed the majority of the population, control over Palestinian territory.\n\n===Increase of Jewish immigration===\n{{Main|Fifth Aliyah|Nuremberg Laws|Tripartite_Pact}}\nIn 1933, the Jewish Agency and the Nazis negotiated the [[Ha'avara Agreement]] (transfer agreement), under which 50,000 Jews would be transferred to Palestine. The Jews' possessions were confiscated and in return the Nazis allowed the Ha'avara organization to purchase 14 million pounds worth of German goods for export to Palestine and use it to compensate the immigrants. Although many Jews wanted to leave Nazi Germany, the Nazis prevented Jews from taking any money and restricted them to two suitcases so few could pay the British entry tax and many were afraid to leave. The agreement was controversial and the Labour Zionist leader who negotiated the agreement, [[Haim Arlosoroff]], was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933. The assassination was used by the British to create tension between the Zionist left and the Zionist right. Arlosoroff had been the boyfriend of [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]] some years before she married [[Joseph Goebbels]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/reich-mother-loved-to-death/171407.article|title=Reich mother loved to death|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=5 June 2016|last=Pine|first= Lisa |location=London}}</ref> There has been speculation that he was assassinated by the Nazis to hide the connection but there is no evidence for it.<ref>{{cite book|title=Qui a tu\u00e9 Arlozoroff ?|first=Tobie|last=Nathan|date=12 May 2010|publisher=Grasset}}</ref> In Palestine, Jewish immigration (and the Ha'avara goods) helped the economy to flourish. The British used the taxes paid by the Jewish population to build a port and oil refineries at Haifa and to fund their government in Transjordan. Industrialization began to change the predominantly agricultural Palestinian economy.\n\nBetween 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine ([[Fifth Aliyah]]). 174,000 arrived between 1933 and 1936, after which the British increasingly prevented immigration. Migrants were mainly from Germany and included professionals, doctors, lawyers and professors. German architects of the [[Bauhaus]] school made Tel-Aviv the world's only city with purely [[White City (Tel Aviv)|Bauhaus neighbourhoods]] and Palestine had the highest per-capita percentage of doctors in the world.\n\nFascist regimes were emerging across Europe and persecution of Jews increased. In many countries, Jews reverted to being non-citizens deprived of civil and economic rights, subject to arbitrary persecution. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (the government increasingly boycotted Jews and by 1937 had totally excluded all Jews),<ref>Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919\u20131939 By Joseph Marcus, Mouton 1983, pg 366</ref> [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]], [[Romania in World War II|Romania]] and the Nazi created states of [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]], while [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] annexed [[Anschluss|Austria]] and the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czech territories]].\n\n===Arab revolt and the White Paper===\n{{Main|1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|White Paper of 1939}}\n[[File:Ghaffis in Nesher 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jewish Settlement Police]] members watching the settlement [[Nesher]] during [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936\u20131939 Arab revolt]]]]\nJewish immigration and Nazi propaganda contributed to the large-scale [[1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], a largely nationalist uprising directed at ending British rule. The head of the Jewish Agency, Ben-Gurion, responded to the Arab Revolt with a policy of \"[[Havlagah]]\"\u2014self-restraint and a refusal to be provoked by Arab attacks in order to prevent polarization. The Etzel group broke off from the Haganah in opposition to this policy.\n\nThe British responded to the revolt with the [[Peel Commission]] (1936\u201337), a public inquiry that recommended that an exclusively Jewish territory be created in the [[Galilee]] and western coast (including the [[population transfer]] of 225,000 Arabs); the rest becoming an exclusively Arab area.

The Nazis proposed their own solution: that the Jews of Europe be shipped to Madagascar (the [[Madagascar Plan]]).\n\nWith millions of Jews trying to leave Europe and every country in the world closed to Jewish migration, the British decided to close Palestine. The [[White Paper of 1939]], recommended that an independent Palestine, governed jointly by Arabs and Jews, be established within 10 years. The White Paper agreed to allow 75,000 Jewish immigrants into Palestine over the period 1940\u201344, after which migration would require Arab approval. Both the Arab and Jewish leadership rejected the White Paper. In March 1940 the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict banning Jews from purchasing land in 95% of Palestine. Jews now resorted to illegal immigration: ([[Aliyah Bet]] or \"Ha'apalah\"), often organized by the [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet]] and the Irgun. With no outside help and no countries ready to admit them, very few Jews managed to escape Europe between 1939 and 1945.

Nearly all the Jewish immigrants could be described as [[refugee]]s, however only 136,000 who immigrated to Israel from Central Europe, had international certification because they belonged to the 250,000 Jews registered by the allies as displaced after World War II and living in [[Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe|displaced persons camp]]s in Germany, Austria and Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005462 |title=Displaced Persons |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950 the Knesset passed the [[Law of Return]], which granted to all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry, and their spouses, the right to settle in Israel and gain citizenship. That year, 50,000 Yemenite Jews (99%) were [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|secretly flown]] to Israel. In 1951 Iraqi Jews were granted temporary permission to leave the country and 120,000 (over 90%) opted [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah|to move to Israel]]. Jews also fled from Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. By the late sixties, about 500,000 Jews had left Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Over the course of twenty years, some 850,000 Jews from Arab countries (99%) relocated to Israel (680,000), France and the Americas.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il VI- The Arab Refugees \u2013 Introduction]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117094828/http://mfa.gov.il/ |date=17 January 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Group seeks justice for 'forgotten' Jews |first=Warren |last=Hoge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/world/americas/04iht-nations.4.8182206.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref> The land and property left behind by the Jews (much of it in Arab city centres) is still a matter of some dispute.

During this period, food, clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the [[Austerity in Israel|Austerity Period]] (''Tkufat haTsena''). Immigrants were mostly refugees with no money or possessions and many were housed in temporary camps known as [[ma'abarot]]. By 1952, over 200,000 immigrants were living in tents or prefabricated shacks built by the government. Israel received financial aid from private donations from [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|outside the country]] (mainly the United States).<ref>''Mishtar HaTsena'' (in Hebrew), Dr Avigail Cohen & Haya Oren, Tel Aviv 1995</ref> The pressure on the new state's finances led Ben-Gurion to sign a [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations agreement]] with [[West Germany]].

The state now funded the party-affiliated Zionist education system and a new body created by the Haredi [[Agudat Israel]] party. A separate body was created to provide education for the remaining Palestinian-Arab population. The major political parties now competed for immigrants to join their education systems. The government banned the existing educational bodies from the transit camps and tried to mandate a unitary secular socialist education<ref>The melting pot in Israel: the commission of inquiry concerning education in the early years of the state by Tzvi Tzameret, Albany 2002 chapter 7</ref> under the control of \"camp managers\" who also had to provide work, food and housing for the immigrants. There were attempts to force orthodox Yemenite children to adopt a secular life style by teachers, including many instances of Yemenite children having their [[Payot|side-curls]] cut by teachers. This led to the first Israeli public inquiry (the Fromkin Inquiry),<ref>For more information see ''The melting pot in Israel'' by Tzvi Tzameret, Albany 2002</ref> the collapse of the coalition, and an [[1951 Israeli legislative election|election]] in 1951, with little change in the results. In 1953 the party-affiliated education system was scrapped and replaced by a secular state education system and a state-run Modern Orthodox system. Agudat Israel were allowed to maintain their existing school system.\n\nIn its early years Israel sought to maintain a non-aligned position between the super-powers. However, in 1952, an antisemitic public trial was staged in Moscow in which a group of Jewish doctors were accused of trying to poison Stalin (the [[Doctors' plot]]), followed by a similar trial in Czechoslovakia ([[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]]). This, and the failure of Israel to be included in the [[Bandung Conference]] (of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned states]]), effectively ended Israel's pursuit of non-alignment. On 19 May 1950, Egypt announced that the [[Suez Canal]] was closed to Israeli ships and commerce. In 1952 a [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|military coup]] in Egypt brought [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Abdel Nasser]] to power. The United States pursued close relations with the new Arab states, particularly the Nasser-led Egyptian [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] and [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia]]. Israel's solution to diplomatic isolation was to establish good relations with newly independent states in [[Africa]]<ref>\"Israel's Military Aid to Africa, 1960\u201366\", Abel Jacob in ''The Journal of Modern African Studies'', vol. 9, no. 2 (August 1971), pp. 165\u2013187</ref> and with France, which was engaged in the [[Algerian War]].\n\nIn the [[1955 Israeli legislative election|January 1955 elections]] Mapai won 40 seats and the Labour Party 10, [[Moshe Sharett]] became prime minister of Israel at the head of a left-wing coalition. Between 1953 and 1956, there were intermittent clashes along all of Israel's borders as Arab [[List of attacks against Israeli civilians before 1967|terrorism]] and breaches of the ceasefire resulted in Israeli [[Retribution operations|counter-raids]]. [[Palestinian fedayeen]] attacks, often organized and sponsored by the Egyptians, were made from [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|(Egyptian occupied) Gaza]].

Egypt also blockaded the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] preventing Israeli access to the [[Red Sea]]. Israel made a [[Protocol of S\u00e8vres|secret agreement]] with the French at S\u00e8vres to co-ordinate military operations against Egypt. Britain and France had already begun secret preparations for military action. It has been alleged that the French also agreed to build a [[Negev Nuclear Research Center|nuclear plant]] for the Israelis and that by 1968 this was able to produce [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]]. Britain and France arranged for Israel to give them a pretext for seizing the Suez Canal. Israel was to attack Egypt, and Britain and France would then call on both sides to withdraw. When, as expected, the Egyptians refused, Anglo-French forces would invade to take control of the Canal.\n\n[[File:Israeli troops in sinai war.jpg|thumb|Israeli paratroopers dig in near the [[Mitla Pass]], 31 October 1956]]\nIsraeli forces, commanded by General [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Operation Kadesh|attacked]] Egypt on 29 October 1956. On 30 October Britain and France made their pre-arranged call for both sides to stop fighting and withdraw from the Canal area, and for them to be allowed to take up positions at key points on the Canal. Egypt refused and the allies commenced air strikes on 31 October aimed at neutralizing the Egyptian air force. By 5 November the Israelis had overrun the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. The Anglo-French invasion began that day. There was uproar in the UN, with the United States and USSR for once in agreement in denouncing the actions of Israel, Britain and France. A demand for a ceasefire was reluctantly accepted on 7 November.\n\nAt Egypt's request, the UN sent an [[United Nations Emergency Force|Emergency Force]] (UNEF), consisting of 6,000 peacekeeping troops from 10 nations to supervise the ceasefire. This was the first ever UN peacekeeping operation. From 15 November the UN troops marked out a zone across the Sinai to separate the Israeli and Egyptian forces. Upon receiving US guarantees of Israeli access to the Suez Canal, freedom of access out of the Gulf of Aqaba and Egyptian action to stop Palestinian raids from Gaza, the Israelis withdrew to the Negev.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html#three |title=First United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) \u2013 Background |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> In practice the Suez Canal remained closed to Israeli shipping. The conflict marked the end of West-European dominance in the Middle East.\n\nNasser emerged as the victor in the conflict, having won the political battle, however the Israeli military learnt that it did not need British or French support in order to conquer Sinai and that it could conquer the Sinai peninsula in a few days. The Israeli political leadership learnt that Israel had a limited time frame within which to operate militarily after which international political pressure would restrict Israel's freedom of action.\n\nIn 1956, two [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|modern-orthodox]] (and [[Religious Zionism|religious-zionist]]) parties, [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi]] and [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], joined to form the [[National Religious Party]]. The party was a component of every Israeli coalition until 1992, usually running the Ministry of Education. Mapai was once again victorious in the [[1959 Israeli legislative election|1959 elections]], increasing its number of seats to 47, Labour had 7. Ben-Gurion remained Prime Minister.\n\nIn 1959, there were renewed skirmishes along Israel's borders that continued throughout the early 1960s. The Arab League continued to maintain an [[Arab League boycott of Israel|economic boycott]] and there was a dispute over water rights in the River Jordan basin. With Soviet backing, the Arab states, particularly Egypt, were continuing to build up their forces. Israel's main military [[France\u2013Israel relations|hardware supplier was France]].\n\n[[File:1961-04-13 Tale Of Century - Eichmann Tried For War Crimes.ogv|thumb|US newsreel on the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]]]]\n[[Rudolph Kastner]], a minor political functionary, was accused of collaborating with the Nazis and sued his accuser.

Menachem Begin's Herut party and the [[Liberal Party (Israel)|Liberals]] came next with 17 seats each. In 1962 the [[Mossad]] began [[Operation Damocles|assassinating German rocket scientists]] working in Egypt after one of them reported the missile program was designed to [[Egypt and weapons of mass destruction|carry chemical warheads]].

The Golan was also [[Golan Heights Law|annexed]] in 1981. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]], the \"land for peace\" formula, which called for the establishment of a just and lasting peace based on Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 in return for the end of all states of belligerency, respect for the sovereignty of all states in the area, and the right to live in peace within secure, recognized boundaries.

The four-meter-wide public alley beside the Wall was expanded into a massive plaza and worshippers were allowed to sit, or use other furniture, for the first time in centuries.

The Israelis retreated after destroying the camp, however the Israelis sustained unexpectedly high casualties and the attack was not viewed as a success. Despite heavy casualties, the Palestinians claimed victory, while Fatah and the [[PLO]] (of which it formed part) became famous across the Arab world. In early 1969, fighting broke out between Egypt and Israel along the Suez Canal.

Israel had paid for the boats but the French had refused to supply them. In July 1970 the Israelis [[Operation Rimon 20|shot down five Soviet fighters]] that were aiding the Egyptians in the course of the [[War of Attrition]]. Following this, the US worked to calm the situation and in August 1970 a cease fire was agreed.\n\nIn [[Black September in Jordan|September 1970]] [[King Hussein]] of [[Jordan]] drove the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] out of his country. On 18 September 1970, Syrian tanks invaded Jordan, intending to aid the PLO. At the request of the US, Israel moved troops to the border and threatened Syria, causing the Syrians to withdraw. The centre of PLO activity then shifted to [[Lebanon]], where the 1969 [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo agreement]] gave the Palestinians autonomy within the south of the country. The area controlled by the PLO became known by the international press and locals as \"[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|Fatahland]]\" and contributed to the 1975\u20131990 [[Lebanese Civil War]]. The event also led to [[Hafez al-Assad]] taking power in Syria. Egyptian President Nasser died immediately after and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]].\n\nIncreased [[Zionology|Soviet antisemitism]] and enthusiasm generated by the 1967 victory led to a wave of Soviet Jews applying to [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s|emigrate]] to Israel. Those who left could only take two suitcases. Most Jews were [[Refusenik|refused exit visas]] and persecuted by the authorities. Some were arrested and sent to [[Gulag]] camps, becoming known as [[Prisoners of Zion]].

The Syrian and Egyptian armies launched a well-planned surprise attack against the unprepared Israeli Defense Forces. For the first few days there was a great deal of uncertainty about Israel's capacity to repel the invaders. Both the Soviets and the Americans (at the orders of [[Richard Nixon]]) [[Operation Nickel Grass|rushed arms to their allies]]. The Syrians were repulsed by the [[Valley of Tears|tiny remnant of the Israeli tank force]] on the Golan and, although the Egyptians captured a strip of territory in Sinai, Israeli forces [[Battle of Ismailia|crossed the Suez Canal]], trapping the Egyptian Third Army in Sinai and were 100 kilometres from Cairo. The war cost Israel over 2,000 dead, resulted in a heavy arms bill (for both sides) and made Israelis more aware of their vulnerability. It also led to heightened [[DEFCON|superpower tension]]. Following the war, both Israelis and Egyptians showed greater willingness to negotiate. On 18 January 1974, extensive diplomacy by US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] led to a [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone|Disengagement of Forces agreement]] with the Egyptian government and on 31 May with the Syrian government.\n\nThe war led the Saudi government to initiate the [[1973 oil crisis]], an oil embargo in conjunction with [[OPEC]], against countries trading with Israel. Severe shortages led to massive increases in the price of oil, and as a result, many countries broke off relations with Israel or downgraded relations, and Israel was banned from participation in the [[Asian Games]] and other Asian sporting events.\n\nState funding was introduced for elected parties. The new system made parties independent of wealthy donors and gave Knesset members more power over party funding, however it also made them less dependent on existing party structures and able to take their funding elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/me00636.pdf|title=knesset.gov.il accessed March 2013}}</ref> Prior to the December 1973 elections, Gahal and a number of right-wing parties united to form the [[Likud]] (led by Begin).

The Likud won 39 seats.\n\nIn May 1974, [[DFLP|Palestinians]] attacked a school in [[Ma'alot massacre|Ma'alot]], holding 102 children hostage. Twenty-two children were killed. In November 1974 the PLO was granted observer status at the UN and [[Yasser Arafat]] addressed the General Assembly. Later that year the [[Agranat Commission]], appointed to assess responsibility for Israel's lack of preparedness for the war, exonerated the government of responsibility, and held the [[David Elazar|Chief of Staff]] and [[Eli Zeira|head of military intelligence]] responsible.

In November 1975 the United Nations General Assembly, under the guidance of Austrian Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]], adopted [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]], which asserted [[Zionism]] to be a form of racism. The General Assembly rescinded this resolution in December 1991 with [[UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86|Resolution 46/86]].

There, the Germans separated the Jewish passengers from the non-Jewish passengers, releasing the non-Jews.

The incident became known as the [[Dollar Account affair]]. [[Shimon Peres]] informally replaced him as prime minister, leading the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] in the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|subsequent elections]].\n\n===1977\u20131983: Begin===\n{{Further|Camp David Accords|1978 South Lebanon conflict|1982 Lebanon War}}\n{{See also2|[[Eighteenth government of Israel|Eighteenth]]|[[Nineteenth government of Israel|Nineteenth]] governments of Israel}}\nIn a surprise result, the [[Likud]] led by [[Menachem Begin]] won 43 seats in the [[1977 Israeli legislative election|1977 elections]] (Labour got 32 seats). This was the first time in Israeli history that the government was not led by the left. A key reason for the victory was anger among [[Mizrahi Jews]] at discrimination, which was to play an important role in Israeli politics for many years. Talented small town Mizrahi social activists, unable to advance in the Labour party, were readily embraced by Begin. Moroccan-born [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]] and Iranian-born [[Moshe Katzav]] were part of a group who won Mizrahi support for Begin. Many Labour voters voted for the [[Democratic Movement for Change]] (15 seats) in protest at high-profile corruption cases. The party joined in coalition with Begin and disappeared at the next election.\n\nIn addition to starting a process of healing the Mizrahi\u2013[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] divide, Begin's government included [[Agudat Israel|Ultra-Orthodox Jews]] and was instrumental in healing the Zionist\u2013Ultra-Orthodox rift, however it did so at the cost of expanding the exemption from military service to all [[Haredi]] Jewish students of military age. This led to creation of a huge class of unemployed Haredi Jews (the exemption was conditional on attendance of a religious seminary, so they kept studying until they were too old for military service). By remaining students, they were a massive burden on the state, while also failing to participate in the military burden.\n\nBegin's liberalization of the economy led to [[hyper-inflation]] (around 150% inflation) but enabled Israel to begin receiving US financial aid. Begin actively supported [[Gush Emunim]]'s efforts to settle the [[West Bank]] and Jewish settlements in the occupied territories received government support, thus laying the grounds for intense conflict with the Palestinian population of the occupied territories.\n\nIn November 1977, Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] broke 30 years of hostility with Israel by visiting Jerusalem at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]]. Sadat's two-day visit included a speech before the [[Knesset]] and was a turning point in the history of the conflict. The Egyptian leader created a new psychological climate in the [[Middle East]] in which peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours seemed possible. Sadat recognized Israel's right to exist and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel. Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the [[Peace Now]] movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs.\n\nIn March 1978, eleven armed Lebanese Palestinians reached Israel in boats and [[Coastal Road Massacre|hijacked a bus]] carrying families on a day outing, killing 38 people, including 13 children. The attackers opposed the Egyptian\u2013Israeli peace process. Three days later, Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon beginning [[Operation Litani]]. After passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425]], calling for Israeli withdrawal and the creation of the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) peace-keeping force, Israel withdrew its troops.\n[[File:Begin, Carter and Sadat at Camp David 1978.jpg|thumb|left|[[Menachem Begin]], [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] celebrating the signing of the [[Camp David Accords]]]]\n\nIn September 1978, US President [[Jimmy Carter]] invited President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin to meet with him at [[Camp David]], and on 11 September they agreed on a [[Camp David Accords|framework]] for peace between Israel and Egypt, and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It set out broad principles to guide negotiations between Israel and the Arab states. It also established guidelines for a West Bank\u2013Gaza transitional regime of full autonomy for the Palestinians residing in these territories, and for a [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty between Egypt and Israel]]. The treaty was signed 26 March 1979 by Begin and Sadat, with President Carter signing as witness. Under the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in April 1982. The final piece of territory to be repatriated was [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]], adjacent to [[Eilat]], returned in 1989. The [[Arab League]] reacted to the peace treaty by suspending Egypt from the organization and moving its headquarters from [[Cairo]] to [[Tunis]]. [[Sadat]] was assassinated in 1981 by [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Islamic fundamentalist]] members of the Egyptian army who opposed peace with Israel. Following the agreement Israel and Egypt became the two largest [[United States foreign aid|recipients]] of [[United States Agency for International Development|US military and financial aid]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/124970.pdf |title=Foreign Aid: An Introduction to U.S. Programs and Policy |last1=Tarnoff |first1=Curt |last2=Lawson |first2=Marian Leonardo |date=9 April 2009 |work=CRS Reports |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> (Iraq and Afghanistan have now [[Financial cost of the Iraq War|overtaken them]]).\n\nIn December 1978 the Israeli [[Merkava]] battle tank entered use with the IDF.

Three weeks later, Begin won yet again, in the [[1981 Israeli legislative election|1981 elections]] (48 seats Likud, 47 Labour). [[Ariel Sharon]] was made defence minister.

But the 1969 [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo agreement]] gave the PLO a free hand to [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|attack]] Israel from South Lebanon. The area was governed by the PLO independently of the Lebanese Government and became known as \"[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|Fatahland]]\" ([[Fatah]] was the largest faction in the PLO). Palestinian irregulars constantly [[Katyusha rocket launcher|shelled]] the Israeli north, especially the town of [[Kiryat Shmona]], which was a Likud stronghold inhabited primarily by Jews who had fled the Arab world. Lack of control over Palestinian areas was an important factor in causing [[Lebanese civil war|civil war in Lebanon]].\n\nIn June 1982, the attempted assassination of [[Shlomo Argov]], the ambassador to Britain, was used as a pretext for an Israeli invasion aiming to drive the PLO out of the southern half of Lebanon. Sharon agreed with [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of Staff]] [[Raphael Eitan]] to expand the invasion deep into Lebanon even though the cabinet had only authorized a 40 kilometre deep invasion.<ref>''Israel's Lebanon War'' by [[Ze'ev Schiff]] and [[Ehud Ya'ari]], Touchstone 1985</ref> The invasion became known as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the Israeli army occupied [[Beirut]], the only time an Arab capital has been occupied by Israel. Some of the [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] and [[Maronites|Christian]] population of [[South Lebanon]] welcomed the Israelis, as PLO forces had maltreated them, but Lebanese resentment of Israeli occupation grew over time and the [[Amal Movement|Shia]] became gradually [[Musa al-Sadr|radicalized]] under Iranian guidance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gloria-center.org/2000/09/eisenberg-2000-09-02/ |title=Do Good Fences Make Good Neighbors?: Israel and Lebanon after the Withdrawal |last=Eisenberg |first=Laura Zittrain |date=2 September 2000 |work=Middle East Review of International Affairs |publisher=Global Research in International Affairs (GLORIA) Center |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> Constant casualties among Israeli soldiers and Lebanese civilians led to growing opposition to the war in Israel.\n\nIn August 1982, the PLO withdrew its forces from Lebanon (moving to [[Tunisia]]). Israel helped engineer the election of a new Lebanese president, [[Bashir Gemayel]], who agreed to recognize Israel and sign a peace treaty. Gemayal was assassinated before an agreement could be signed, and one day later [[Kataeb Party|Phalangist]] Christian forces led by [[Elie Hobeika]] entered two Palestinian refugee camps and [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|massacred]] the occupants. The massacres led to the biggest [[anti-war protest|demonstration]] ever in Israel against the war, with as many as 400,000 people (almost 10% of the population) gathering in Tel Aviv. In 1983, an [[Kahan commission|Israeli public inquiry]] found that Israel's defence minister, Sharon, was indirectly but personally responsible for the massacres.<ref>{{cite news |title=Belgium opens way for Sharon trial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2662635.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=15 January 2003 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref> It also recommended that he never again be allowed to hold the post (it did not forbid him from being Prime Minister). In 1983, the [[May 17 Agreement]] was signed between Israel and Lebanon, paving the way for an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory through a few stages. Israel continued to operate against the PLO until its eventual departure in 1985, and kept a small force stationed in Southern Lebanon in support of the [[South Lebanon Army]] until May 2000.\n\n===1983\u20131992: Shamir I; Peres I; Shamir II===\n{{Further|1983 Israel bank stock crisis|South Lebanon conflict (1985\u20132000)|First Intifada|Gulf War}}\n{{See also2|[[Twentieth government of Israel|Twentieth]]|[[Twenty-first government of Israel|Twenty-first]]|[[Twenty-second government of Israel|Twenty-second]]|[[Twenty-third government of Israel|Twenty-third]]|[[Twenty-fourth government of Israel|Twenty-fourth]] governments of Israel}}\n[[File:Flickr - Government Press Office (GPO) - Patriot missiles being launched to intercept an Iraqi Scud missile.jpg|thumb|Patriot missiles launched to intercept an Iraqi Scud over Tel Aviv during the Gulf War]]\nIn September 1983, Begin resigned and was succeeded by [[Yitzhak Shamir]] as prime minister. The [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 election]] was inconclusive, and led to a power sharing agreement between [[Shimon Peres]] of the Alignment (44 seats) and Shamir of Likud (41 seats). Peres was prime minister from 1984 to 1986 and Shamir from 1986 to 1988. In 1984, continual discrimination against Sephardi Ultra-Orthodox Jews by the Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox establishment led political activist [[Aryeh Deri]] to leave the [[Agudat Israel]] party and join former chief [[Rabbi Ovadia Yosef]] in forming [[Shas]], a new party aimed at the non-Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox vote. The party won 4 seats in the first election it contested and over the next twenty years was the third largest party in the Knesset. Shas established a nationwide network of free Sephardi Orthodox schools. In 1984, during a severe [[1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia|famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], 8,000 [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] were [[Operation Moses|secretly transported]] to Israel. In 1986 [[Natan Sharansky]], a famous Russian human rights activist and Zionist [[refusenik]] (denied an exit visa), was released from the [[Gulag]] in return for two Soviet spies.\n\nIn June 1985, Israel withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon, leaving a residual Israeli force and an Israeli-supported [[South Lebanon Army|militia]] in [[southern Lebanon]] as a \"[[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|security zone]]\" and buffer against attacks on its northern territory. Since then, IDF [[South Lebanon conflict (1982\u20132000)|fought]] for many years against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] organization [[Hezbollah]], which became a growing threat to Israel. By July 1985, Israel's [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|inflation]], buttressed by complex [[index linking]] of salaries, had reached 480% per annum and was the highest in the world. Peres introduced [[1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan|emergency control of prices]] and cut government expenditure successfully bringing inflation under control. The currency (known as the [[old Israeli shekel]]) was replaced and renamed the [[Israeli new shekel]] at a rate of 1,000 old shkalim = 1 new shekel. In October 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombing]] the PLO headquarters in Tunis. Growing Israeli settlement and continuing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, led to the [[First Intifada|first Palestinian Intifada]] (uprising) in 1987, which lasted until the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], despite Israeli attempts to suppress it. [[Human rights]] abuses by Israeli troops led a group of Israelis to form [[B'Tselem]], an organization devoted to improving awareness and compliance with human rights requirements in Israel.\n\nIn August 1987, the Israeli government cancelled the [[IAI Lavi]] project, an attempt to develop an independent Israeli fighter aircraft. The Israelis found themselves unable to sustain the huge development costs, and faced US opposition to a project that threatened US influence in Israel and US global military ascendancy. In September 1988, Israel launched an [[Ofeq]] reconnaissance satellite into orbit, using a [[Shavit]] rocket, thus becoming one of only eight countries possessing a capacity to [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|independently launch satellites]] into space (two more have since developed this ability). The Alignment and Likud remained neck and neck in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 elections]] (39:40 seats). Shamir successfully formed a national unity coalition with [[Alignment (political party)|the Labour Alignment]]. In March 1990, Alignment leader [[Shimon Peres]] engineered a defeat of the government in a non-confidence vote and then tried to form a new government. [[The dirty trick (Israel)|He failed]] and Shamir became prime minister at the head of a right-wing coalition.\n\nIn 1990, the [[Soviet Union]] finally permitted free [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel]]. Prior to this, Jews trying to leave the USSR faced [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|persecution]]; those who succeeded arrived as refugees. Over the next few years some one million Soviet citizens migrated to Israel. Although there was concern that some of the new immigrants had only a very tenuous connection to Judaism, and many were accompanied by non-Jewish relatives, this massive wave of migration slowly transformed Israel, bringing large numbers of highly educated Soviet Jews and creating a powerful Russian culture in Israel.\n\nIn August 1990, Iraq invaded [[Kuwait]], triggering the [[Gulf War]] between Iraq and a large allied force, led by the [[United States]]. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 [[Scud missile]]s. Israel did not retaliate at request of the US, fearing that if Israel responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot defence batteries]] in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 [[Beta Israel]] (Ethiopian Jews) were [[Operation Solomon|secretly airlifted]] to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the US President, [[George H.W. Bush]], and Soviet Union Premier, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], jointly convened a [[Madrid Conference of 1991|historic meeting in Madrid]] of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and Palestinian leaders. Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His participation in the conference led to the collapse of his (right-wing) coalition.\n\n===1992\u20131996: Rabin II; Peres II===\n{{Further|Oslo Accords|Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin}}\n{{See also2|[[Twenty-fifth government of Israel|Twenty-fifth]]|[[Twenty-sixth government of Israel|Twenty-sixth]] governments of Israel}}\nIn the [[1992 Israeli legislative election|1992 elections]], the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]], led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]], won a significant victory (44 seats) promising to pursue peace while promoting Rabin as a \"tough general\" and pledging not to deal with the PLO in any way. The pro-peace Zionist party [[Meretz]] won 12 seats, and the Arab and communist parties a further 5, meaning that parties supporting a peace treaty had a full (albeit small) majority in the Knesset. Later that year, the Israeli electoral system was changed to allow for direct election of the prime minister. It was hoped this would reduce the power of small parties (mainly the religious parties) to extract concessions in return for coalition agreements. The new system had the opposite effect; voters could split their vote for prime minister from their (interest based) party vote, and as a result larger parties won fewer votes and smaller parties becoming more attractive to voters.

On 13 September 1993, Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) signed the [[Oslo Accords]] (a Declaration of Principles)<ref>[http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Peace/dop.html Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302173924/http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Peace/dop.html |date=2 March 2017 }} Jewish Virtual Library</ref> on the South Lawn of the [[White House]]. The principles established objectives relating to a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim [[Palestinian Authority]], as a prelude to a final treaty establishing a Palestinian state, in exchange for mutual recognition. The DOP established May 1999 as the date by which a permanent status agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip would take effect. In February 1994, [[Baruch Goldstein]], a follower of the [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] party, killed 29 Palestinians and wounded 125 at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]], which became known as the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]]. Kach had been barred from participation in the 1992 elections (on the grounds that the movement was racist). It was subsequently made illegal. Israel and the PLO signed the [[Gaza\u2013Jericho Agreement]] in May 1994, and the [[Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities]] in August, which began the process of transferring authority from Israel to the Palestinians. On 25 July 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty|Washington Declaration]], which formally ended the [[war|state of war]] that had existed between them since 1948 and on 26 October the [[Israel\u2013Jordan Treaty of Peace]], witnessed by US President [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Main%20Points%20of%20Israel-Jordan%20Peace%20Treaty Main Points of Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty 26 October 1994] Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs</ref><ref>[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/peacetreaty.html Treaty of Peace between The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and The State of Israel] King Hussein website</ref>\n\nPrime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and PLO Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] signed the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Israeli\u2013Palestinian Interim Agreement]] on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 28 September 1995 in Washington. The agreement was witnessed by President Bill Clinton on behalf of the United States and by Russia, Egypt, Norway and the European Union, and incorporates and supersedes the previous agreements, marking the conclusion of the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy to the Palestinians with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians promised to abstain from use of terror and changed the [[Palestinian National Covenant]], which had called for the expulsion of all Jews who migrated after 1917 and the elimination of Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/plocha.htm|title=PLO Covenant (Charter) 1968|website=www.mideastweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThe agreement was opposed by [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian factions, which launched [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks#1990s|suicide bomber attacks]] at Israel. Rabin had a [[Israeli Gaza Strip barrier|barrier]] constructed around Gaza to prevent attacks. The growing separation between Israel and the \"[[Palestinian Territories]]\" led to a labour shortage in Israel, mainly in the construction industry. Israeli firms began importing [[Demographics of Israel#Foreign workers|labourers]] from the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Romania]]; some of these labourers stayed on without visas. In addition, a growing number of Africans began illegally migrating to Israel.

In response to a wave of [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks#2000s|suicide bomb attacks]], culminating in the \"[[Passover massacre]]\" (see [[List of Israeli civilian casualties in the Second Intifada]]), Israel launched [[Operation Defensive Shield]] in March 2002, and Sharon began the construction of a [[Israeli West Bank barrier|barrier]] around the West Bank. Around the same time, the Israeli town of [[Sderot]] and other Israeli communities near Gaza became subject to constant [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|shelling]] and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza.\n\nThousands of Jews from Latin America began [[Aliyah from Latin America in the 2000s|arriving]] in Israel due to economic crises in their countries of origin. In January 2003 separate [[2003 Israeli legislative election|elections]] were held for the Knesset. Likud won the most seats (27). An anti-religion party, [[Shinui]], led by media pundit [[Tommy Lapid]], won 15 seats on a secularist platform, making it the third largest party (ahead of orthodox [[Shas]]).

From 2004 onwards, they received citizen's rights.\n\nThe Sharon government embarked on an extensive program of construction of [[Desalination#Israel|desalinization plants]] that freed Israel of the fear of drought.

In 2005, all Jewish settlers were evacuated from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] (some forcibly) and their homes demolished. [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Disengagement from the Gaza Strip]] was completed on 12 September 2005. Military disengagement from the northern West Bank was completed ten days later.\n\nIn 2005 Sharon left the Likud and formed a new party called [[Kadima]], which accepted that the peace process would lead to creation of a Palestinian state.
