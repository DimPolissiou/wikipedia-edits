Roy Moore. It stars [[Olivia Hussey]], [[Keir Dullea]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Andrea Martin]], Marian Waldman, [[Lynne Griffin]] and [[John Saxon]]. The story follows a group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a deranged killer during the [[Christmas]] season. It is the first film in the [[Black Christmas (film series)|''Black Christmas'' series]].\n\nInspired by the urban legend \"[[The babysitter and the man upstairs]]\" and a series of murders that took place in the [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount section]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Moore wrote the screenplay under the title ''Stop Me''. The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with young adult characters. It was shot in Toronto in 1974 on an estimated budget of $620,000, and was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] in North America.\n\n''Black Christmas'' was released on October 11, 1974, in Canada and December 20 in the United States under the title '''''Silent Night, Evil Night'''''. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews, but it has since received critical re-appraisal, with film historians noting it for being one of the earliest slasher films.<ref>{{Cite book |author= Paszylx, Bart\u0142omiej |title=The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: An Historical Survey |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-786-43695-8 |pages=135\u20136}}</ref> It is also praised for concluding without revealing the identity of its villain, as well as serving as an influence on [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).

One of the girls, Jess, answers an obscene phone call from a mentally unstable man who is implied to call the house regularly. She summons her fellow students into the room, where they listen as the caller screams and curses them on the phone. When one of the girls, foul-mouthed Barb, takes the phone from Jess, she incites the caller, who in turn promises to kill her. Barb argues with a younger student, Clare Harrison, who implies that the caller could be a serial rapist, before Clare returns to her bedroom to finish packing for Christmas break. The disoriented man lures Clare into her closet, where he suffocates her with a plastic dress bag. He moves her body to the attic.\n\nThe following morning, Mr. Harrison arrives at the school to pick up his daughter, but she fails to show up to their agreed meeting place. He quickly makes his way to the sorority house, where the housemother, Mrs. MacHenry, is surprised by Clare's absence. Meanwhile, Jess meets her boyfriend, Peter, a neurotic music student. She explains she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion, angering Peter, who attempts to intimidate her. In town, Mr. Harrison, accompanied by Barb and one of the other girls, Phyllis Carlson, attempt to report Clare as missing, while Jess quickly tells Clare's boyfriend Chris about Clare's sudden disappearance. They learn that another local girl named Janis Quaife has also seemingly vanished while walking home from school.\n\nAfter putting a drunken Barb to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyllis help search for Janis in a nearby park where she allegedly disappeared, hoping to turn up some sign of Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac plans to leave for her sister's home, only to be lured up into the attic, where she discovers Clare's body. The killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. In the park, Janis's disfigured body is found by the police and Jess returns home, while the search continues for Clare. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to appear and surprise her. He attempts to persuade her into marriage for the sake of their child, but Jess adamantly refuses. Peter leaves in an emotional state, while Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller arrives to bug the telephone.\n\nA group of choir children arrive on the house's stoop to sing Christmas carols, distracting Jess. The killer enters Barb's room and murders her with a glass figurine; Barb's cries for help are drowned out by the singing children. One of the women in charge of the children ushers them away, having learned of Janis's murder. Jess experiences another unnerving phone call, in which the caller restates part of her argument with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller theorizes that Peter could be responsible, due to the caller's knowledge of the argument and his own mental fragility, but Jess doubts this. Moments later, Phyllis enters Barb's room and is ambushed by the killer, who murders her off-screen.\n\nJess gets another obscene phone call, in which the killer alludes to some sort of transgression between two children named Agnes and Billy. The call is long enough to be traced by Graham, a telephone company employee, and Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls have been traced to be coming from within the house. Concerned for Barb and Phyllis, Jess arms herself with a poker and ventures upstairs, where she discovers Barb and Phyllis's maimed figures. The killer appears and pursues Jess through the house; Jess locks herself in the cellar, only for Peter to appear outside one of the windows. He smashes the window to get to Jess, who proceeds to bludgeon him with the poker, assuming he is the killer.\n\nThe police arrive moments later, alerted by Jess's screams. They discover her barely conscious in the basement, with Peter's bloody remains next to her. They put Jess to bed and discuss the murders, unaware of the bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry still in the attic. Jess is left in the house to rest, with a policeman standing outside. The killer climbs down from the attic as Jess sleeps in a nearby room. The house's telephone begins to ring, leaving Jess's fate unknown as the credits roll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as Jess Bradford\n* [[Keir Dullea]] as Peter Smythe\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as Barbara \"Barb\" Coard\n* [[John Saxon]] as Lt.

Upon his arrival to the set, however, the producers realized he would be unable to fulfill the duties required of the part due to his failing health (stemming from [[Alzheimer's disease]]).<ref name=\"Chiller\" /> John Saxon, who had read the script prior, was called by the producers who offered him the role. He accepted, and had to arrive in Toronto from New York City within two days to begin shooting.<ref name=onscreen/> For the role of the film's antagonist, Italian-American actor [[Nick Mancuso]] was cast as one of the main voices in the phone call sequences. When [[audition]]ing for the role, director Clark had Mancuso sit in a chair facing away from him, so as not to see the actor's face. Clark then had Mancuso experiment with different voices in order to come up with one that was right for the character, with Clark later offering him the part.<ref name=\"Power2019\"/>\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Harthouse night.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|[[Soldiers' Tower]] at the [[University of Toronto]] is featured in the film]]\n''Black Christmas'' was shot on location in [[Toronto]] in the winter of 1973\u201374. The house featured in the film had been discovered by Clark while scouting for locations, and its owners agreed to lease the home for the production.<ref name=onscreen/> Additional photography was completed on the [[University of Toronto]] campus.<ref name=onscreen/> According to John Saxon, Clark had meticulously drawn out storyboards with key shots, which he brought to the film set each day: \"I could understand exactly what I thought he needed, and the scene needed.\"<ref name=onscreen/> Scenes in the film involving [[POV shot]] of Billy scaling the house was accomplished through the use of a rig designed by [[camera operator]] Bert Dunk, which was attached to Dunk's head as he climbed up the side of the house.<ref name=\"iconsoffright05\" /> Griffin's death scene, which was shot with a handheld camera in a real closet, was accomplished in only a couple of takes. According to Griffin, her character's surprise as the killer lunges from the closet was genuine as the actress later recalled: \"it was a total shock because I didn't really know when to expect him to jump out!\" Shots of Clare's corpse in the rocking chair required the actress to wear an actual plastic bag over her head for extended periods of time. Griffin would also state that these scenes came relatively easy for her, \"I was actually, and still am, a fairly good swimmer so I could hold my breath for a long time. And I could also keep my eyes open for a long time without blinking.\"<ref name=\"griffininterview11\" />\n\nMargot Kidder remembered shooting the film as being \"fun.

However, Clark insisted on keeping the ending ambiguous.

Roy Moore. It stars [[Olivia Hussey]], [[Keir Dullea]], [[Margot Kidder]], [[Andrea Martin]], Marian Waldman, [[Lynne Griffin]] and [[John Saxon]]. The story follows a group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a deranged killer during the [[Christmas]] season. It is the first film in the [[Black Christmas (film series)|''Black Christmas'' series]].\n\nInspired by the urban legend \"[[The babysitter and the man upstairs]]\" and a series of murders that took place in the [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount section]] of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Moore wrote the screenplay under the title ''Stop Me''. The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with young adult characters. It was shot in Toronto in 1974 on an estimated budget of $620,000, and was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] in North America.\n\n''Black Christmas'' was released on October 11, 1974, in Canada and December 20 in the United States under the title '''''Silent Night, Evil Night'''''. Upon its release, the film received mixed reviews, but it has since received critical re-appraisal, with film historians noting it for being one of the earliest slasher films.<ref>{{Cite book |author= Paszylx, Bart\u0142omiej |title=The Pleasure and Pain of Cult Horror Films: An Historical Survey |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-786-43695-8 |pages=135\u20136}}</ref> It is also praised for concluding without revealing the identity of its villain, as well as serving as an influence on [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978).

One of the girls, Jess, answers an obscene phone call from a mentally unstable man who is implied to call the house regularly. She summons her fellow students into the room, where they listen as the caller screams and curses them on the phone. When one of the girls, foul-mouthed Barb, takes the phone from Jess, she incites the caller, who in turn promises to kill her. Barb argues with a younger student, Clare Harrison, who implies that the caller could be a serial rapist, before Clare returns to her bedroom to finish packing for Christmas break. The disoriented man lures Clare into her closet, where he suffocates her with a plastic dress bag. He moves her body to the attic.\n\nThe following morning, Mr. Harrison arrives at the school to pick up his daughter, but she fails to show up to their agreed meeting place. He quickly makes his way to the sorority house, where the housemother, Mrs. MacHenry, is surprised by Clare's absence. Meanwhile, Jess meets her boyfriend, Peter, a neurotic music student. She explains she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion, angering Peter, who attempts to intimidate her. In town, Mr. Harrison, accompanied by Barb and one of the other girls, Phyllis Carlson, attempt to report Clare as missing, while Jess quickly tells Clare's boyfriend Chris about Clare's sudden disappearance. They learn that another local girl named Janis Quaife has also seemingly vanished while walking home from school.\n\nAfter putting a drunken Barb to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyllis help search for Janis in a nearby park where she allegedly disappeared, hoping to turn up some sign of Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac plans to leave for her sister's home, only to be lured up into the attic, where she discovers Clare's body. The killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. In the park, Janis's disfigured body is found by the police and Jess returns home, while the search continues for Clare. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to appear and surprise her. He attempts to persuade her into marriage for the sake of their child, but Jess adamantly refuses. Peter leaves in an emotional state, while Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller arrives to bug the telephone.\n\nA group of choir children arrive on the house's stoop to sing Christmas carols, distracting Jess. The killer enters Barb's room and murders her with a glass figurine; Barb's cries for help are drowned out by the singing children. One of the women in charge of the children ushers them away, having learned of Janis's murder. Jess experiences another unnerving phone call, in which the caller restates part of her argument with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller theorizes that Peter could be responsible, due to the caller's knowledge of the argument and his own mental fragility, but Jess doubts this. Moments later, Phyllis enters Barb's room and is ambushed by the killer, who murders her off-screen.\n\nJess gets another obscene phone call, in which the killer alludes to some sort of transgression between two children named Agnes and Billy. The call is long enough to be traced by Graham, a telephone company employee, and Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls have been traced to be coming from within the house. Concerned for Barb and Phyllis, Jess arms herself with a poker and ventures upstairs, where she discovers Barb and Phyllis's maimed figures. The killer appears and pursues Jess through the house; Jess locks herself in the cellar, only for Peter to appear outside one of the windows. He smashes the window to get to Jess, who proceeds to bludgeon him with the poker, assuming he is the killer.\n\nThe police arrive moments later, alerted by Jess's screams. They discover her barely conscious in the basement, with Peter's bloody remains next to her. They put Jess to bed and discuss the murders, unaware of the bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry still in the attic. Jess is left in the house to rest, with a policeman standing outside.

When [[audition]]ing for the role, director Clark had Mancuso sit in a chair facing away from him, so as not to see the actor's face.

According to Griffin, her character's surprise as the killer lunges from the closet was genuine as the actress later recalled: \"it was a total shock because I didn't really know when to expect him to jump out!\" Shots of Clare's corpse in the rocking chair required the actress to wear an actual plastic bag over her head for extended periods of time. Griffin would also state that these scenes came relatively easy for her, \"I was actually, and still am, a fairly good swimmer so I could hold my breath for a long time.

It is a stop on the [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]] and [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Silver Crown tours.\n\n==History==\nThe [[DuQuoin State Fair]] was founded in 1923 by local businessman William R. \"W.R.\" Hayes, who owned the fair and ran it. (It did not become run by the state of Illinois as a true \"state fair\" until the 1980s; it is now officially called the Illinois State Fair in DuQuoin, as opposed to the longtime one at state capital Springfield.) At the start Hayes had a half-mile harness-racing track on his 30-acre site, with wooden grandstands that seated 3000. In 1939 Hayes started buying adjoining stripmined land to develop its potential as parkland, replanting it and turning the strip pits into family-friendly ponds and lakes. He eventually expanded his little fairgrounds into 1200 acres.\n\nThe DuQuoin \"Magic Mile\" racetrack was constructed on reclaimed stripmine land in 1946 by W.R. Hayes. The track's first [[American Championship Car Racing|national championship]] race was held in September 1948.  In the second race on October 10, popular AAA National driving champion [[Ted Horn]] was killed in the fourth turn when a spindle on his championship car broke.  The national championship race for the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Silver Crown dirt cars is held in his honor.\n\nIn 1957 the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds became the third longtime home of the [[Hambletonian Stakes|Hambletonian]], America's premier harness racing event (established 1926). The grandstands and bleachers were expanded to seat 18,000. When the Hambletonian left DuQuoin after 1980 to be raced at [[Meadowlands Racetrack|the Meadowlands]], the Fair became the home of the World Trotting Derby. This race was held from 1981 until it was discontinued after the 2009 race.   Both off-track and on-track betting are allowed.\n\nMusic concerts are also held at the track, especially during the state fair (in 2012 from August 25 through Labor Day, September 3). The stage is at center at the foot of the grandstand, backed up against the protective cyclone fence that shields the stands from the track.\n{{col-begin}}\n\n==Race winners==\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n===AAA/USAC Champ Car/Silver Crown race winners===\n''All winners were {{flagicon|USA}} American''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

It is a stop on the [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]] and [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Silver Crown tours.\n\n==History==\nThe [[DuQuoin State Fair]] was founded in 1923 by local businessman William R. \"W.R.\" Hayes, who owned the fair and ran it. (It did not become run by the state of Illinois as a true \"state fair\" until the 1980s; it is now officially called the Illinois State Fair in DuQuoin, as opposed to the longtime one at state capital Springfield.) At the start Hayes had a half-mile harness-racing track on his 30-acre site, with wooden grandstands that seated 3000. In 1939 Hayes started buying adjoining stripmined land to develop its potential as parkland, replanting it and turning the strip pits into family-friendly ponds and lakes. He eventually expanded his little fairgrounds into 1200 acres.\n\nThe DuQuoin \"Magic Mile\" racetrack was constructed on reclaimed stripmine land in 1946 by W.R. Hayes. The track's first [[American Championship Car Racing|national championship]] race was held in September 1948.  In the second race on October 10, popular AAA National driving champion [[Ted Horn]] was killed in the fourth turn when a spindle on his championship car broke.  The national championship race for the [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] Silver Crown dirt cars is held in his honor.\n\nIn 1957 the DuQuoin State Fairgrounds became the third longtime home of the [[Hambletonian Stakes|Hambletonian]], America's premier harness racing event (established 1926). The grandstands and bleachers were expanded to seat 18,000. When the Hambletonian left DuQuoin after 1980 to be raced at [[Meadowlands Racetrack|the Meadowlands]], the Fair became the home of the World Trotting Derby. This race was held from 1981 until it was discontinued after the 2009 race.   Both off-track and on-track betting are allowed.\n\nMusic concerts are also held at the track, especially during the state fair (in 2012 from August 25 through Labor Day, September 3). The stage is at center at the foot of the grandstand, backed up against the protective cyclone fence that shields the stands from the track.\n{{col-begin}}\n\n==Race winners==\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n===AAA/USAC Champ Car/Silver Crown race winners===\n''All winners were {{flagicon|USA}} American''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!
