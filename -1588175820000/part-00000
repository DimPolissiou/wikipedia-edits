It covers an area  previously administered by the Essex [[county borough]]s of [[County Borough of West Ham|West Ham]] and [[County Borough of East Ham|East Ham]], authorities that were both abolished by the same act.\n\nThe name Newham reflects its creation and combines the compass points of the old borough names.\n\nIt is {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} east of the [[City of London]], north of the [[River Thames]]. Newham was one of the six host boroughs for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and contains most of the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] including the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|London Stadium]]. The local authority is [[Newham London Borough Council]].\n\nThe borough's motto, from its coat of arms, is ''\"Progress with the People\"''.  The coat of arms was derived from that of the County Borough of West Ham, while the motto is a translation of the County Borough of East Ham's Latin ''\"Progressio cum Populo\"''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://apps.newham.gov.uk/democracy/civicamb/carms.htm | title=The Civic Ambassador, The Coat of Arms | publisher=Archive.Newham.Gov.UK | accessdate=1 March 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602073325/http://apps.newham.gov.uk/democracy/civicamb/carms.htm | archivedate=2 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe borough was formed by merging the former area of the [[Essex]] county borough of [[County Borough of East Ham|East Ham]] and the county borough of [[County Borough of West Ham|West Ham]] as a borough of the newly formed [[Greater London]], on 1 April 1965 \u2013 these in turn were successors to the ancient civil and ecclesiastical parishes of [[St Mary Magdalene's Church, East Ham|East Ham]] and [[All Saints Church, West Ham|West Ham]].  [[Green Street, London|Green Street]] and Boundary Road mark the former boundary between the two.  [[North Woolwich]] also became part of the borough (previously being in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]], south of the river [[Thames]] in the [[County of London]]) along with a small area west of the [[River Roding]] which had previously been part of the [[Municipal Borough of Barking]]. ''Newham'' was devised for the borough as an entirely new name.<ref>Mills, Anthony David (2001). ''Dictionary of London Place Names''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-280106-6}}</ref>\n\n===Ham(me): Pre-partition origins===\nThe area of the modern borough was at one time occupied by a territory called 'Ham'.\n\nThe first known written use of the term, as 'Hamme', is in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 958, and again in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]] as Hame. It is formed from [[Old English]] 'hamm' and means 'a dry area of land between rivers or marshland', referring to the location of the settlement within boundaries formed by the rivers [[River Lea|Lea]], [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Roding|Roding]] and their marshes.<ref name=\"mills_london\">{{cite book|title=Dictionary of London Place Names|year=2001|last=Mills|first=A.D.|publisher=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nThese natural boundaries suggest that [[Little Ilford]], [[North Woolwich]] and areas of the parish of [[Barking (parish)|Barking]] west of the Roding are likely to have been part of Ham(me).\n\nThe territory was subdivided into the more familiar [[West Ham|West]] and [[East Ham]] sometime in the 12th century, with the earliest recorded distinction being as 'Westhamma' in 1186. It could be speculated that the partition arose as a result of population increase resulting from economic prosperity delivered by the construction of Bow Bridge over the [[River Lea|Lea]] and the creation of [[Stratford Langthorne Abbey]].\n\n[[North Woolwich]] was removed from Ham at an earlier date, in the aftermath of the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] but it is unclear when [[Little Ilford]] and western Barking were transferred, and it is not known for sure that they were part of Ham.\n\nThe boundary between [[West Ham|West]] and [[East Ham]] was drawn from the now lost Hamfrith Waste and Hamfrith Wood in the north (then the southernmost parts of [[Epping Forest]] which extended as far south as the Romford Road at that time), along [[Green Street, London|Green Street]] down to the small, similarly lost, natural harbour known as Ham Creek.\n\nThe formation of the modern borough in 1965 saw the merger of [[West Ham|West]] and [[East Ham]], together with [[North Woolwich]] and [[Barking, London|Barking]] west of the [[River Roding]] ([[Little Ilford]] had become part of East Ham as part of earlier local government reorganisations). This reorganisation effectively re-established the earlier territory of Ham.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Newham London UK labelled ward map 2002.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Newham since 2002]]\nUnlike most English districts, its council is led by a [[Directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected]] [[mayor of Newham]].  From 2002 to 2009 one of the councillors had been appointed as the \"civic ambassador\" and performed the civic and ceremonial role previously carried out by the mayor.

It covers an area  previously administered by the Essex [[county borough]]s of [[County Borough of West Ham|West Ham]] and [[County Borough of East Ham|East Ham]], authorities that were both abolished by the same act.\n\nThe name Newham reflects its creation and combines the compass points of the old borough names.\n\nIt is {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} east of the [[City of London]], north of the [[River Thames]]. Newham was one of the six host boroughs for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and contains most of the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] including the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|London Stadium]]. The local authority is [[Newham London Borough Council]].\n\nThe borough's motto, from its coat of arms, is ''\"Progress with the People\"''.  The coat of arms was derived from that of the County Borough of West Ham, while the motto is a translation of the County Borough of East Ham's Latin ''\"Progressio cum Populo\"''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://apps.newham.gov.uk/democracy/civicamb/carms.htm | title=The Civic Ambassador, The Coat of Arms | publisher=Archive.Newham.Gov.UK | accessdate=1 March 2013 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602073325/http://apps.newham.gov.uk/democracy/civicamb/carms.htm | archivedate=2 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe borough was formed by merging the former area of the [[Essex]] county borough of [[County Borough of East Ham|East Ham]] and the county borough of [[County Borough of West Ham|West Ham]] as a borough of the newly formed [[Greater London]], on 1 April 1965 \u2013 these in turn were successors to the ancient civil and ecclesiastical parishes of [[St Mary Magdalene's Church, East Ham|East Ham]] and [[All Saints Church, West Ham|West Ham]].  [[Green Street, London|Green Street]] and Boundary Road mark the former boundary between the two.  [[North Woolwich]] also became part of the borough (previously being in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]], south of the river [[Thames]] in the [[County of London]]) along with a small area west of the [[River Roding]] which had previously been part of the [[Municipal Borough of Barking]]. ''Newham'' was devised for the borough as an entirely new name.<ref>Mills, Anthony David (2001). ''Dictionary of London Place Names''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-280106-6}}</ref>\n\n===Ham(me): Pre-partition origins===\nThe area of the modern borough was at one time occupied by a territory called 'Ham'.\n\nThe first known written use of the term, as 'Hamme', is in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 958, and again in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]] as Hame. It is formed from [[Old English]] 'hamm' and means 'a dry area of land between rivers or marshland', referring to the location of the settlement within boundaries formed by the rivers [[River Lea|Lea]], [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[River Roding|Roding]] and their marshes.<ref name=\"mills_london\">{{cite book|title=Dictionary of London Place Names|year=2001|last=Mills|first=A.D.|publisher=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nThese natural boundaries suggest that [[Little Ilford]], [[North Woolwich]] and areas of the parish of [[Barking (parish)|Barking]] west of the Roding are likely to have been part of Ham(me).\n\nThe territory was subdivided into the more familiar [[West Ham|West]] and [[East Ham]] sometime in the 12th century, with the earliest recorded distinction being as 'Westhamma' in 1186. It could be speculated that the partition arose as a result of population increase resulting from economic prosperity delivered by the construction of Bow Bridge over the [[River Lea|Lea]] and the creation of [[Stratford Langthorne Abbey]].\n\n[[North Woolwich]] was removed from Ham at an earlier date, in the aftermath of the [[Norman Conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] but it is unclear when [[Little Ilford]] and western Barking were transferred, and it is not known for sure that they were part of Ham.\n\nThe boundary between [[West Ham|West]] and [[East Ham]] was drawn from the now lost Hamfrith Waste and Hamfrith Wood in the north (then the southernmost parts of [[Epping Forest]] which extended as far south as the Romford Road at that time), along [[Green Street, London|Green Street]] down to the small, similarly lost, natural harbour known as Ham Creek.\n\nThe formation of the modern borough in 1965 saw the merger of [[West Ham|West]] and [[East Ham]], together with [[North Woolwich]] and [[Barking, London|Barking]] west of the [[River Roding]] ([[Little Ilford]] had become part of East Ham as part of earlier local government reorganisations). This reorganisation effectively re-established the earlier territory of Ham.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Newham London UK labelled ward map 2002.svg|thumb|A map showing the wards of Newham since 2002]]\nUnlike most English districts, its council is led by a [[Directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected]] [[mayor of Newham]].
