{"title_page": "Representation theory of finite groups", "text_new": "{{Short description|Representations of finite groups, particularly on vector spaces}}\nThe [[representation theory]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] is a part of mathematics which examines how groups act on given structures.\n\nHere the focus is in particular on [[Group action (mathematics)|operations of groups]] on [[vector space]]s. Nevertheless, groups acting on other groups or on [[set (mathematics)|sets]] are also considered. For more details, please refer to the section on [[#Permutation representation|permutation representations]].\n\nWith the exception of a few marked exceptions, only finite groups will be considered in this article. We will also restrain to vector spaces over [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero. Because the theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of characteristic zero is complete, a theory valid for a special algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is also valid for every other algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Thus, without loss of generality, we can study vector spaces over <math>\\Complex.</math>\n\nRepresentation theory is used in many parts of mathematics, as well as in quantum chemistry and physics. Among other things it is used in [[algebra]] to examine the structure of groups. There are also applications in [[harmonic analysis]] and [[number theory]]. For example, representation theory is used in the modern approach to gain new results about automorphic forms.\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Linear representations===\nLet <math>V</math> be a <math>K</math>\u2013vector space and <math>G</math> a finite group. A '''linear representation''' of a finite group <math>G</math> is a [[group homomorphism]] <math>\\rho: G\\to \\text{GL}(V)=\\text{Aut}(V).</math> This means that a linear representation is a map <math>\\rho: G\\to \\text{GL}(V)</math> which satisfies <math>\\rho(st)=\\rho(s)\\rho(t)</math> for all <math>s,t \\in G.</math> The vector space <math>V</math> is called representation space of <math>G.</math> Often the term representation of <math>G</math> is also used for the representation space <math>V.</math>\n\nThe representation of a group in a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] instead of a vector space is also called a linear representation.\n\nWe write <math>(\\rho, V_\\rho)</math> for the representation <math>\\rho: G\\to\\text{GL}(V_\\rho)</math> of <math>G.</math> Sometimes we use the notation <math>(\\rho, V)</math> if it is clear to which representation the space <math>V</math> belongs.\n\nIn this article we will restrain ourselves to the study of finite-dimensional representation spaces, except for the last chapter. As in most cases only a finite number of vectors in <math>V</math> is of interest, it is sufficient to study the [[#Properties|subrepresentation]] generated by these vectors. The representation space of this subrepresentation is then finite-dimensional.\n\nThe '''degree''' of a representation is the [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]]  of its representation space <math>V.</math> The notation <math>\\dim (\\rho)</math> is sometimes used to denote the degree of a representation <math>\\rho.</math>\n\n===Examples===\nThe '''trivial representation''' is given by <math>\\rho(s)=\\text{Id}</math> for all <math> s\\in G.</math>\n\nA representation of degree <math>1</math> of a group <math>G</math> is a homomorphism into the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>\\rho:G\\to \\text{GL}_1 (\\Complex)=\\Complex^\\times = \\Complex \\setminus\\{0\\}.</math> As every element of <math>G</math> is of finite order, the values of <math>\\rho(s)</math> are [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. For example, let <math>\\rho: G=\\Z/4\\Z  \\to \\Complex ^\\times</math> be a nontrivial linear representation. Since <math>\\rho</math> is a group homomorphism, it has to satisfy <math>\\rho({0})=1.</math> Because <math>1</math> generates <math>G, \\rho</math> is determined by its value on <math>\\rho(1).</math> And as <math>\\rho</math> is nontrivial, <math>\\rho({1})\\in\\{i,-1,-i\\}.</math> Thus, we achieve the result that the image of <math>G</math> under <math>\\rho</math> has to be a nontrivial subgroup of the group which consists of the fourth roots of unity. In other words, <math>\\rho</math> has to be one of the following three maps:\n:<math> \\begin{cases} \\rho_1({0})=1 \\\\ \\rho_1({1})=i \\\\ \\rho_1({2})=-1 \\\\ \\rho_1({3})=-i \\end{cases} \\qquad  \\begin{cases} \\rho_2({0})=1 \\\\ \\rho_2({1})=-1 \\\\ \\rho_2({2})=1 \\\\ \\rho_2({3})=-1 \\end{cases} \\qquad  \\begin{cases} \\rho_3({0})=1 \\\\ \\rho_3({1})=-i \\\\ \\rho_3({2})=-1 \\\\ \\rho_3({3})=i \\end{cases}</math>\n\nLet <math>G=\\Z /2\\Z \\times\\Z /2\\Z </math> and let <math>\\rho: G\\to\\text{GL}_2(\\Complex )</math> be the group homomorphism defined by: \n:<math> \\rho({0},{0})=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho({1},{0})=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     -1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & -1\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho({0},{1})=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho({1},{1})= \n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     0 & -1 \\\\\n     -1 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nIn this case <math>\\rho</math> is a linear representation of <math>G</math> of degree <math>2.</math>\n\n====Permutation representation====\n{{further|Permutation group}}\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a finite set and let <math>G</math> be a group acting on <math>X.</math> Denote by <math>\\text{Aut}(X)</math> the group of all permutations on <math>X</math> with the composition as group multiplication.\n\nA group acting on a finite set is sometimes considered sufficient for the definition of the permutation representation. However, since we want to construct examples for linear representations - where groups act on vector spaces instead of on arbitrary finite sets - we have to proceed in a different way. In order to construct the permutation representation, we need a vector space <math>V</math> with <math>\\dim (V)=|X|.</math> A basis of <math>V</math> can be indexed by the elements of <math>X.</math> The permutation representation is the group homomorphism <math>\\rho : G \\to\\text{GL}(V)</math> given by <math>\\rho(s)e_x=e_{s.x}</math> for all <math>s\\in G, x\\in X.</math> All linear maps <math>\\rho(s)</math> are uniquely defined by this property.\n\n'''Example.'''

Let <math>G = \\Z /5\\Z </math> and <math>V=\\R^5</math> with the basis <math>\\{e_0,\\ldots, e_4\\}.</math> Then the left-regular representation <math>L_\\rho: G\\to \\text{GL}(V)</math> is defined by <math>L_\\rho(k)e_l=e_{l+k}</math> for <math>k, l \\in \\Z /5\\Z.</math> The right-regular representation is defined analogously by <math>R_\\rho(k)e_l=e_{l-k}</math> for <math>k, l \\in \\Z /5\\Z .</math>\n\n===Representations, modules and the convolution algebra===\nLet <math>G</math> be a finite group, let <math>K</math> be a commutative [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] and let <math>K[G]</math> be the [[group ring|group algebra]] of <math>G</math> over <math>K.</math> This algebra is free and a basis can be indexed by the elements of <math>G.</math> Most often the basis is identified with <math>G</math>. Every element <math>f \\in K[G]</math> can then be uniquely expressed as\n\n:<math>f=\\sum_{s\\in G} a_s s</math> with <math>a_s \\in K</math>.\n\nThe multiplication in <math>K[G]</math> extends that in <math>G</math> distributively.\n\nNow let <math>V</math> be a <math>K</math>\u2013[[Module (mathematics)|module]] and let <math>\\rho: G\\to\\text{GL}(V)</math> be a linear representation of <math>G</math> in <math>V.</math> We define <math>sv=\\rho(s) v</math> for all <math>s\\in G</math> and <math>v\\in V</math>. By linear extension <math>V</math> is endowed with the structure of a left-<math>K[G]</math>\u2013module.  Vice versa we obtain a linear representation of <math>G</math> starting from a <math>K[G]</math>\u2013module <math>V</math>. Additionally, homomorphisms of representations are in bijective correspondence with group algebra homomorphisms. Therefore, these terms may be used interchangeably.<ref>{{harv|Serre|1971|47}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Sengupta|2012|62}}</ref> This is an example of an [[isomorphism of categories]].\n\nSuppose <math>K=\\Complex.</math> In this case the left <math>\\Complex [G]</math>\u2013module given by <math>\\Complex [G]</math> itself corresponds to the left-regular representation. In the same way <math>\\Complex [G]</math> as a right <math>\\Complex [G]</math>\u2013module corresponds to the right-regular representation.\n\nIn the following we will define the [[convolution algebra]]: Let <math>G</math> be a group, the set <math>L^1(G):=\\{f:G\\to\\Complex \\}</math> is a <math>\\Complex </math>\u2013vector space with the operations addition and scalar multiplication then this vector space is isomorphic to <math>\\Complex^{|G|}.</math> The convolution of two elements <math>f, h \\in L^1(G)</math> defined by\n\n:<math>f*h(s):=\\sum_{t\\in G}f(t)h(t^{-1}s)</math>\n\nmakes <math>L^1(G)</math> an [[algebra over a field|algebra]]. The algebra <math>L^1(G)</math> is called the '''convolution algebra'''.\n\nThe convolution algebra is free and has a basis indexed by the group elements: <math>(\\delta_s)_{s\\in G},</math> where\n:<math>\\delta_s(t)=\\begin{cases} 1& t=s\\\\ 0 &  \\text{otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\nUsing the properties of the convolution we obtain: <math>\\delta_s*\\delta_t=\\delta_{st}.</math>\n\nWe define a map between <math>L^1(G)</math> and <math>\\Complex [G],</math> by defining <math>\\delta_s\\mapsto e_s</math> on the basis <math>(\\delta_s)_{s\\in G}</math> and extending it linearly. Obviously the prior map is [[Bijection|bijective]]. A closer inspection of the convolution of two basis elements as shown in the equation above reveals that the multiplication in <math>L^1(G)</math> corresponds to that in <math>\\Complex [G].</math> Thus, the convolution algebra and the group algebra are isomorphic as algebras.\n\nThe [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]\n\n:<math>f^*(s)=\\overline{f(s^{-1})}</math>\n\nturns <math>L^1(G)</math> into a [[*-algebra|<math>^*</math>\u2013algebra]].

In that chapter we will see that (without loss of generality) every linear representation can be assumed to be unitary.\n\nUsing the convolution algebra we can implement a [[Fourier transform]]ation on a group <math>G.</math> In the area of [[harmonic analysis]] it is shown that the following definition is consistent with the definition of the Fourier transformation on <math>\\R.</math>\n\nLet <math>\\rho:G\\to\\text{GL}(V_\\rho)</math> be a representation and let <math>f\\in L^1(G)</math> be a <math>\\Complex</math>-valued function on <math>G</math>. The Fourier transform <math>\\hat{f}(\\rho)\\in \\text{End}(V_\\rho)</math> of <math>f</math> is defined as \n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\rho)=\\sum_{s\\in G} f(s)\\rho(s).</math>\n\nThis transformation satisfies <math>\\widehat{f*g}(\\rho)=\\hat{f}(\\rho)\\cdot\\hat{g}(\\rho).</math>\n\n===Maps between representations===\n{{See also|Equivariant map|Representation theory#Equivariant maps and isomorphisms}}\nA map between two representations <math>(\\rho, V_\\rho),\\, (\\tau, V_\\tau)</math> of the same group <math>G</math> is a linear map <math>T: V_\\rho\\to V_\\tau,</math> with the property that <math>\\tau(s)\\circ T=T\\circ\\rho(s)</math> holds for all <math>s\\in G.</math> In other words, the following diagram commutes for all <math>s\\in G</math>:\n\n:[[Image:Equivariant map.svg|200px]]\n\nSuch a map is also called '''<math>G</math>\u2013linear''', or an '''[[equivariant map]]'''. The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]], the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] and the [[cokernel]] of <math>T</math> are defined by default. The composition of equivariant maps is again an equivariant map. There is a [[category of representations]] with equivariant maps as its [[morphism]]s. They are again <math>G</math>\u2013modules. Thus, they provide representations of <math>G</math> due to the correlation described in the previous section.\n\n==Irreducible representations and Schur's lemma==\n\n{{Main|Schur's lemma}}\nLet <math>\\rho:G\\to\\text{GL}(V)</math> be a linear representation of <math>G.</math> Let <math>W</math> be a <math>G</math>-invariant subspace of <math>V,</math> that is, <math> \\rho(s)w\\in W</math> for all <math> s\\in G</math> and <math>w\\in W</math>.

The representation is called an ''[[irreducible representation]]'', if these two are the only subrepresentations. Some authors also call these representations simple, given that they are precisely the [[simple module]]s over the group algebra <math>\\Complex [G]</math>.\n\n''Schur's lemma'' puts a strong constraint on maps between irreducible representations.

More generally, if <math>\\rho_1</math> and <math>\\rho_2</math> are isomorphic, the space of ''G''-linear maps is one-dimensional.\n*Otherwise, if the two representations are not isomorphic, ''F'' must be 0.\n\n<ref>\n'''Proof.''' Suppose <math>F</math> is nonzero. Then <math>F\\circ\\rho_1(s)\\,(u)=\\rho_2(s)\\circ F(u)=0</math> is valid for all <math>u\\in \\ker(F).</math> Therefore, we obtain <math>\\rho_1(s)u\\in \\ker(F)</math> for all <math> s\\in G</math> and <math>u\\in \\ker(F).</math> And we know now, that <math>\\ker(F)</math> is <math>G</math>\u2013invariant. Since <math> V_1</math> is irreducible and <math>F\\neq 0,</math> we conclude <math>\\ker(F)=0.</math> Now let <math>y\\in\\text{Im}(F).</math> This means, there exists <math>v\\in V_1,</math> such that <math> Fv=y,</math> and we have <math>\\rho_2(s)y=\\rho_2(s)Fv=F\\rho_1(s)v.</math> Thus, we deduce, that <math>\\text{Im}(F)</math> is a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant subspace.

A function <math>\\varphi : G \\to \\Complex</math>  is called a '''class function''' if it is constant on conjugacy classes of <math>G</math>, i.e. \n:<math> \\forall s, t \\in G : \\quad \\varphi \\left (sts^{-1} \\right ) =\\varphi(t).</math>\nNote that every character is a class function, as the trace of a matrix is preserved under conjugation.\n\nThe set of all class functions is a <math>\\Complex </math>\u2013algebra and is denoted by <math> \\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math>. Its dimension is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of <math>G.</math>\n\nProofs of the following results of this chapter may be found in [[#Literature|'''[1]''']], [[#Literature|'''[2]''']] and [[#Literature|'''[3]''']].\n\nAn [[Dot product|inner product]] can be defined on the set of all class functions on a finite group:\n:<math> (f|h)_G=\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{t\\in G}f(t)\\overline{h(t)} </math>\n'''Orthonormal property.''' If  <math>\\chi_1, \\ldots ,\\chi_k</math> are the distinct irreducible characters of <math>G</math>, they form an orthonormal basis for the vector space of all class functions with respect to the inner product defined above, i.e. \n* <math>(\\chi_i|\\chi_j)=\\begin{cases} 1 \\text{ if } i= j \\\\0 \\text{ otherwise }\\end{cases}.</math>\n* Every class function <math>f</math> may be expressed as a unique linear combination of the irreducible characters <math>\\chi_1, \\ldots ,\\chi_k</math>.\nOne might verify that the irreducible characters generate <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> by showing that there exists no nonzero class function which is orthogonal to all the irreducible characters. For <math> \\rho </math> a representation and <math>f</math> a class function, denote <math> \\rho_f = \\sum_g f(g)\\rho (g).</math> Then for <math> \\rho </math> irreducible, we have <math> \\rho_f = \\frac {|G|}{n} \\langle f,\\chi _V^{*} \\rangle \\in End(V)</math> from [[Dot product|Schur's lemma]]. Suppose <math> f </math> is a class function which is orthogonal to all the characters. Then by the above we have <math> \\rho _f = 0 </math> whenever <math> \\rho </math> is irreducible. But then it follows that <math> \\rho _f = 0 </math> for all <math> \\rho </math>, by decomposability. Take <math> \\rho </math> to be the regular representation.

Since this is true for all <math>g</math>, we have <math>f=0.</math>\n\nIt follows from the orthonormal property that the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations of a group <math>G</math> is equal to the number of [[conjugacy class]]es of <math>G.</math>\n\nFurthermore, a class function on <math>G</math> is a character of <math>G</math> if and only if it can be written as a linear combination of the distinct irreducible characters <math>\\chi_j</math> with non-negative integer coefficients: if <math>\\varphi</math> is a class function on <math>G</math> such that <math>\\varphi=c_1 \\chi_1 + \\cdots + c_k \\chi_k </math> where <math>c_j</math> non-negative integers, then <math>\\varphi</math> is the character of the direct sum <math>c_1 \\tau_1 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus c_k \\tau_k</math> of the representations <math>\\tau_j</math> corresponding to <math>\\chi_j.</math> Conversely, it is always possible to write any character as a sum of irreducible characters.\n\nThe [[Dot product|inner product]] defined above can be extended on the set of all <math>\\Complex</math>-valued functions <math>L^1(G)</math> on a finite group:\n:<math> (f|h)_G=\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{t\\in G}f(t)\\overline{h(t)} </math>\n\nA [[symmetric bilinear form]] can also be defined on <math>L^1(G):</math>\n:<math> \\langle f,h\\rangle_G=\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{t\\in G}f(t)h(t^{-1}) </math>\nThese two forms match on the set of characters.

Note that <math>\\Complex [G]</math>\u2013modules are simply representations of <math>G</math>. Since the orthonormal property yields the number of irreducible representations of <math>G</math> is exactly the number of its conjugacy classes, then there are exactly as many simple <math>\\Complex [G]</math>\u2013modules (up to isomorphism) as there are conjugacy classes of <math>G.</math>\n\nWe define <math>\\langle V_1, V_2 \\rangle_G:=\\dim (\\text{Hom}^G(V_1,V_2)),</math> in which <math>\\text{Hom}^G(V_1,V_2)</math> is the vector space of all <math>G</math>\u2013linear maps. This form is bilinear with respect to the direct sum.\n\nIn the following, these bilinear forms will allow us to obtain some important results with respect to the decomposition and irreducibility of representations.\n\nFor instance, let <math>\\chi_1</math> and <math>\\chi_2</math> be the characters of <math>V_1</math> and <math>V_2,</math> respectively. Then<math> \\langle\\chi_1,\\chi_2\\rangle_G = (\\chi_1|\\chi_2)_G=\\langle V_1, V_2 \\rangle_G.</math>\n\nIt is possible to derive the following theorem from the results above, along with Schur's lemma and the complete reducibility of representations.\n\n:'''Theorem.''' Let <math>V</math> be a linear representation of <math>G</math> with character <math>\\xi.</math> Let <math>V=W_1\\oplus \\cdots \\oplus W_k,</math> where <math>W_j</math> are irreducible.

Two representations with the same character are isomorphic. This means that every representation is determined by its character.\n\nWith this we obtain a very useful result to analyse representations:\n\n{{anchor|Irreducibility criterion}} '''Irreducibility criterion.'''

This is the so-called method of \u201clittle groups\u201d of Wigner and Mackey.\n\nSince <math>A</math> is [[abelian group|abelian]], the irreducible characters of <math>A</math> have degree one and form the group <math>\\Chi = \\text{Hom}(A,\\Complex^\\times).</math> The group <math>G</math> [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on <math>\\Chi</math> by <math>(s\\chi)(a) = \\chi(s^{-1}as)</math> for <math>s \\in G, \\chi \\in \\Chi, a \\in A.</math>\n\nLet <math>(\\chi_j)_{j\\in \\Chi/H}</math> be a [[Equivalence class#Notation and formal definition|representative system]] of the [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit]] of <math>H</math> in <math>\\Chi.</math> For every <math>j \\in \\Chi/H</math> let <math>H_j = \\{t \\in H : t\\chi_j = \\chi_j\\}.</math> This is a subgroup of <math>H.</math> Let <math>G_j = A \\cdot H_j</math> be the corresponding subgroup of <math>G.</math> We now extend the function <math>\\chi_j</math> onto <math>G_j</math> by <math>\\chi_j(at) = \\chi_j(a)</math> for <math>a \\in A, t \\in H_j.</math> Thus, <math>\\chi_j</math> is a class function on <math>G_j.</math> Moreover, since <math>t\\chi_j = \\chi_j</math> for all <math>t \\in H_j,</math> it can be shown that <math>\\chi_j</math> is a group homomorphism from <math>G_j</math> to <math>\\Complex^\\times.</math> Therefore, we have a representation of <math>G_j</math> of degree one which is equal to its own character.\n\nLet now <math>\\rho</math> be an irreducible representation of <math>H_j. </math> Then we obtain an irreducible representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> of <math>G_j,</math> by combining <math>\\rho</math> with the [[Projection (linear algebra)|canonical projection]] <math>G_j \\to H_j.</math> Finally, we construct the [[#Tensor product of representations|tensor product]] of <math>\\chi_j</math> and <math>\\tilde{\\rho}.</math> Thus, we obtain an irreducible representation <math>\\chi_j\\otimes \\tilde{\\rho}</math> of <math>G_j.</math>\n\nTo finally obtain the classification of the irreducible representations of <math>G</math> we use the representation <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}</math> of <math>G,</math> which is induced by the tensor product <math>\\chi_j\\otimes \\tilde{\\rho}.</math> Thus, we achieve the following result:\n\n:'''Proposition.'''\n:* <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}</math> is irreducible.\n:* If <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}</math> and <math>\\theta_{j',\\rho'}</math> are isomorphic, then <math>j = j'</math> and additionally <math>\\rho</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\rho'.</math>\n:* Every irreducible representation of <math>G</math> is isomorphic to one of the <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}.</math>\n\nAmongst others, the criterion of Mackey and a conclusion based on the Frobenius reciprocity are needed for the proof of the proposition. Further details may be found in [[#Literature|'''[1]''']].\n\nIn other words, we classified all irreducible representations of <math>G=A \\rtimes H.</math>\n\n==Representation ring==\nThe representation ring of <math>G</math> is defined as the abelian group\n:<math>R(G)= \\left \\{ \\left. \\sum_{j=1}^m a_j \\tau_j \\right |\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_m \\text{ all irreducible representations of } G \\text{ up to isomorphism},  a_j\\in\\Z \\right \\}.</math>\nWith the multiplication provided by the [[#Tensor product of representations|tensor product]], <math>R(G)</math> becomes a ring.

As the product of two characters provides another character, <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is a subring of the ring <math>\\Complex_{\\text{class}}(G)</math> of all class functions on <math>G.</math> Because the <math>\\chi_i</math> form a basis of <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> we obtain, just as in the case of <math>R(G),</math> an isomorphism <math>\\Complex \\otimes \\mathcal{R}(G)\\cong\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G).</math>\n\nLet <math>H</math> be a subgroup of <math>G.</math> The restriction thus defines a ring homomorphism <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)\\to \\mathcal{R}(H), \\phi\\mapsto \\phi|_H,</math> which will be denoted by <math>\\text{Res}^G_H</math> or <math>\\text{Res}.</math> Likewise, the induction on class functions defines a homomorphism of abelian groups <math>\\mathcal{R}(H)\\to \\mathcal{R}(G),</math> which will be written as <math>\\text{Ind}^G_H</math> or in short <math>\\text{Ind}.</math>\n\nAccording to the [[#Frobenius reciprocity|Frobenius reciprocity]], these two homomorphisms are adjoint with respect to the bilinear forms <math>\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_H</math> and <math>\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_G.</math> Furthermore, the formula <math>\\text{Ind}(\\varphi\\cdot \\text{Res}(\\psi))=\\text{Ind}(\\varphi)\\cdot \\psi</math> shows that the image of <math>\\text{Ind}:\\mathcal{R}(H)\\to \\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the ring <math>\\mathcal{R}(G).</math>\n\nBy the restriction of representations, the map <math>\\text{Res}</math> can be defined analogously for <math>R(G),</math> and by the induction we obtain the map <math>\\text{Ind}</math> for <math>R(G).</math> Due to the Frobenius reciprocity, we get the result that these maps are adjoint to each other and that the image <math>\\text{Im}(\\text{Ind})=\\text{Ind}(R(H))</math> is an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the ring <math>R(G).</math>\n\nIf <math>A</math> is a commutative ring, the homomorphisms <math>\\text{Res}</math> and <math>\\text{Ind}</math> may be extended to <math>A</math>\u2013linear maps:\n:<math> \\begin{cases}\nA\\otimes \\text{Res}: A\\otimes R(G) \\to A\\otimes R(H)\\\\\n\\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\tau_j \\right ) \\mapsto \\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\text{Res}(\\tau_j) \\right )\n\\end{cases}, \\qquad  \\begin{cases}\n A\\otimes \\text{Ind}: A\\otimes R(H) \\to A\\otimes R(G)\\\\\n\\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\eta_j \\right )\\mapsto \\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\text{Ind}(\\eta_j) \\right )\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nin which <math>\\eta_j</math> are all the irreducible representations of <math>H</math> up to isomorphism.\n\nWith <math>A=\\Complex </math> we obtain in particular that <math>\\text{Ind}</math> and <math>\\text{Res}</math> supply homomorphisms between <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> and <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(H).</math>\n\nLet <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> be two groups with respective representations <math>(\\rho_1, V_1)</math> and <math>(\\rho_2, V_2).</math> Then, <math>\\rho_1\\otimes\\rho_2</math> is the representation of the [[direct product]] <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> as was shown in a [[#Tensor product of representations|previous section]]. Another result of that section was that all irreducible representations of <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> are exactly the representations <math>\\eta_1\\otimes\\eta_2,</math> where <math>\\eta_1</math> and <math>\\eta_2</math> are irreducible representations of <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2,</math> respectively. This passes over to the representation ring as the identity <math>R(G_1\\times G_2)=R(G_1)\\otimes_{\\Z} R(G_2),</math> in which <math>R(G_1)\\otimes_{\\Z} R(G_2)</math> is the [[tensor product of modules|tensor product]] of the representation rings as <math>\\Z</math>\u2013modules.\n\n==Induction theorems==\n\nInduction theorems relate the representation ring of a given finite group ''G'' to representation rings of a family ''X'' consisting of some subsets ''H'' of ''G''. More precisely, for such a collection of subgroups, the induction functor yields a map \n:<math>\\varphi: \\text{Ind}:\\bigoplus_{H\\in X}\\mathcal{R}(H) \\to \\mathcal{R}(G)</math>; induction theorems give criteria for the surjectivity of this map or closely related ones.\n''Artin's induction theorem'' is the most elementary theorem in this group of results. It asserts that the following are equivalent:\n\n* The [[cokernel]] of <math>\\varphi</math> is finite.\n* <math>G</math> is the union of the conjugates of the subgroups belonging to <math>X,</math> i.e. <math>G=\\bigcup_{H\\in X \\atop s\\in G}sHs^{-1}.</math>\n\nSince <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is finitely generated as a group, the first point can be rephrased as follows:\n*For each character <math>\\chi</math> of <math>G,</math> there exist virtual characters <math>\\chi_H \\in \\mathcal{R}(H), \\,H\\in X</math> and an integer <math> d\\geq 1,</math> such that <math> d\\cdot\\chi = \\sum_{H\\in X}\\text{Ind}^G_H(\\chi_H).</math>\n{{harvtxt|Serre|1977}} gives two proofs of this theorem. For example, since ''G'' is the union of its cyclic subgroups, every character of <math>G</math> is a linear combination with rational coefficients of characters induced by characters of [[cyclic group|cyclic subgroups]] of <math>G.</math> Since the representations of cyclic groups are well-understood, in particular the irreducible representations are one-dimensional, this gives a certain control over representations of ''G''.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, it is not in general true that <math>\\varphi</math> is surjective. ''[[Brauer's theorem on induced characters|Brauer's induction theorem]]'' asserts that <math>\\varphi</math> is surjective, provided that ''X'' is the family of all ''elementary subgroups''.\nHere a group ''H'' is [[elementary group|elementary]] if there is some prime ''p'' such that ''H'' is the [[direct product]] of a [[cyclic group]] of order prime to <math>p</math> and a [[P-group|<math>p</math>\u2013group]].\nIn other words, every [[#Character theory|character]] of <math>G</math> is a linear combination with integer coefficients of characters induced by characters of elementary subgroups.\nThe elementary subgroups ''H'' arising in Brauer's theorem have a richer representation theory than cyclic groups, they at least have the property that any irreducible representation for such ''H'' is induced by a one-dimensional representation of a (necessarily also elementary) subgroup <math>K \\subset H</math>. (This latter property can be shown to hold for any [[supersolvable group]], which includes [[nilpotent group]]s and, in particular, elementary groups.) This ability to induce representations from degree 1 representations has some further consequences in the representation theory of finite groups.\n\n==Real representations==\nFor proofs and more information about representations over general subfields of <math>\\Complex </math> please refer to [[#Literature| '''[2]''']].\n\nIf a group <math>G</math> acts on a real vector space <math>V_0,</math> the corresponding representation on the complex vector space <math>V=V_0\\otimes_\\R \\Complex </math> is called '''real''' (<math>V</math> is called the [[complexification]] of <math>V_0</math>). The corresponding representation mentioned above is given by <math>s \\cdot(v_0\\otimes z) = (s\\cdot v_0)\\otimes z</math> for all <math>s\\in G, v_0\\in V_0, z\\in \\Complex.</math>\n\nLet <math>\\rho</math> be a real representation. The linear map <math>\\rho(s)</math> is <math>\\R</math>-valued for all <math>s\\in G.</math> Thus, we can conclude that the character of a real representation is always real-valued. But not every representation with a real-valued character is real. To make this clear, let <math>G</math> be a finite, non-abelian subgroup of the group\n\n:<math>\\text{SU}(2)= \\left \\{\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -\\overline{b} & \\overline{a} \\end{pmatrix} \\ : \\ |a|^2+|b|^2=1 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nThen <math>G \\subset \\text{SU}(2)</math> acts on <math>V=\\Complex^2.</math> Since the trace of any matrix in <math>\\text{SU}(2)</math> is real, the character of the representation is real-valued. Suppose <math>\\rho</math> is a real representation, then <math>\\rho(G)</math> would consist only of real-valued matrices. Thus, <math>G \\subset \\text{SU}(2)\\cap\\text{GL}_2(\\R )=\\text{SO}(2)=S^1.</math> However the circle group is abelian but <math>G</math> was chosen to be a non-abelian group. Now we only need to prove the existence of a non-abelian, finite subgroup of <math>\\text{SU}(2).</math> To find such a group, observe that <math>\\text{SU}(2)</math> can be identified with the units of the [[quaternion]]s. Now let <math>G=\\{\\pm1,\\pm i,\\pm j, \\pm ij \\}.</math> The following two-dimensional representation of <math>G</math> is not real-valued, but has a real-valued character:\n:<math> \\begin{cases} \\rho : G \\to \\text{GL}_2(\\Complex ) \\\\[4pt] \\rho(\\pm 1)=\\begin{pmatrix} \\pm1&0\\\\0& \\pm1\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\rho(\\pm i)=\\begin{pmatrix} \\pm i&0\\\\0&\\mp i\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\rho(\\pm j)=\\begin{pmatrix} 0&\\pm i\\\\ \\pm i&0\\end{pmatrix} \\end{cases}</math>\nThen the image of <math>\\rho</math> is not real-valued, but nevertheless it is a subset of <math>\\text{SU}(2).</math> Thus, the character of the representation is real.\n\n:'''Lemma.''' An irreducible representation <math>V</math> of <math>G</math> is real if and only if there exists a [[Degenerate bilinear form#Non-degenerate forms|nondegenerate]] [[symmetric bilinear form]] <math>B</math> on <math>V</math> preserved by <math>G.</math>\n\nAn irreducible representation of <math>G</math> on a real vector space can become reducible when extending the field to <math>\\Complex.</math> For example, the following real representation of the cyclic group is reducible when considered over <math>\\Complex</math>\n:<math>  \\begin{cases} \\rho : \\Z /m\\Z  \\to \\text{GL}_2(\\R ) \\\\[4pt]  \\rho(k)= \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos  \\left(\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m}\\right ) & \\sin \\left (\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right ) \\\\ -\\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right ) & \\cos \\left (\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right )\\end{pmatrix} \\end{cases}</math>\n \nTherefore, by classifying all the irreducible representations that are real over <math>\\Complex,</math> we still haven't classified all the irreducible real representations. But we achieve the following:\n\nLet <math>V_0</math> be a real vector space. Let <math>G</math> act irreducibly on <math>V_0</math> and let <math>V=V_0\\otimes \\Complex.</math> If <math>V</math> is not irreducible, there are exactly two irreducible factors which are complex conjugate representations of <math>G.</math>\n\n'''Definition.''' A '''quaternionic''' representation is a (complex) representation <math>V,</math> which possesses a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant anti-linear homomorphism <math>J:V\\to V</math> satisfying <math>J^2=-\\text{Id}.</math> Thus, a [[bilinear form#Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms|skew-symmetric]], nondegenerate <math>G</math>\u2013invariant bilinear form defines a quaternionic structure on <math>V.</math>\n\n:'''Theorem.''' An irreducible representation <math>V</math> is one and only one of the following:\n:: (i) complex: <math>\\chi_V</math> is not real-valued and there exists no <math>G</math>\u2013invariant [[Degenerate bilinear form#Non-degenerate forms|nondegenerate]] bilinear form on <math>V.</math>\n:: (ii) real: <math>V=V_0\\otimes \\Complex ,</math> a real representation; <math>V</math> has a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant nondegenerate [[symmetric bilinear form]].\n:: (iii) quaternionic: <math>\\chi_V</math> is real, but <math>V</math> is not real; <math>V</math> has a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant skew-symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form.\n\n==Representations of particular groups==\n===Symmetric groups===\n\n{{main|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}\nRepresentation of the [[symmetric group]]s <math>S_n</math> have been intensely studied. Conjugacy classes in <math>S_n</math> (and therefore, by the above, irreducible representations) correspond to [[partition (number theory)|partition]]s of ''n''. For example, <math>S_3</math> has three irreducible representations, corresponding to the partitions\n\n:3; 2+1; 1+1+1\n\nof 3. For such a partition, a [[Young tableau]] is a graphical device depicting a partition. The irreducible representation corresponding to such a partition (or Young tableau) is called a [[Specht module]].\n\nRepresentations of different symmetric groups are related: any representation of <math>S_n \\times S_m</math> yields a representation of <math>S_{n+m}</math> by induction, and vice versa by restriction. The direct sum of all these representation rings\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{n \\ge 0} R(S_n)</math>\n\ninherits from these constructions the structure of a [[Hopf algebra]] which, it turns out, is closely related to [[symmetric function]]s.\n\n===Finite groups of Lie type===\n\nTo a certain extent, the representations of the <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> , as ''n'' varies, have a similar flavor as for the <math>S_n</math>; the above-mentioned induction process gets replaced by so-called [[parabolic induction]]. However, unlike for <math>S_n</math>, where all representations can be obtained by induction of trivial representations, this is not true for <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math>. Instead, new building blocks, known as [[cuspidal representation]]s, are needed.\n\nRepresentations of <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> and more generally, representations of [[finite groups of Lie type]] have been thoroughly studied. {{harvtxt|Bonnaf\u00e9|2011}} describes the representations of <math>SL_2(\\mathbf F_q)</math>. A geometric description of irreducible representations of such groups, including the above-mentioned cuspidal representations, is obtained by [[Deligne-Lusztig theory]], which constructs such representation in the [[l-adic cohomology]] of [[Deligne-Lusztig variety|Deligne-Lusztig varieties]].\n\nThe similarity of the representation theory of <math>S_n</math> and <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> goes beyond finite groups. The [[philosophy of cusp forms]] highlights the kinship of representation theoretic aspects of these types of groups with general linear groups of [[local field]]s such as [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] and of the ring of [[adelic algebraic group|adele]]s, see {{harvtxt|Bump|2004}}.\n\n==Outlook\u2014Representations of compact groups==\nThe theory of representations of compact groups may be, to some degree, extended to [[locally compact group]]s. The representation theory unfolds in this context great importance for harmonic analysis and the study of automorphic forms. For proofs, further information and for a more detailed insight which is beyond the scope of this chapter please consult [[#Literature| '''[4]''']] and [[#Literature| '''[5]''']].\n\n===Definition and properties===\nA '''topological group''' is a group together with a [[topology]] with respect to which the group composition and the inversion are [[continuous function|continuous]].\nSuch a group is called '''compact''', if any cover of <math>G,</math> which is open in the topology, has a finite subcover. Closed subgroups of a compact group are compact again.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a compact group and let <math>V</math> be a finite-dimensional <math>\\Complex</math>\u2013vector space. A linear representation of <math>G</math> to <math>V</math> is a '''continuous group homomorphism''' <math>\\rho: G \\to \\text{GL}(V),</math> i.e. <math>\\rho(s)v</math> is a continuous function in the two variables <math>s\\in G</math> and <math>v\\in V.</math>\n\nA linear representation of <math>G</math> into a [[Banach space]] <math>V</math> is defined to be a continuous group homomorphism of <math>G</math> into the set of all bijective [[bounded operator|bounded linear operators]] on <math>V</math> with a continuous inverse. Since <math>\\pi(g)^{-1}=\\pi(g^{-1}),</math> we can do without the last requirement. In the following, we will consider in particular representations of compact groups in [[Hilbert space]]s.\n\nJust as with finite groups, we can define the [[#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|group algebra]] and the [[#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|convolution algebra]]. However, the group algebra provides no helpful information in the case of infinite groups, because the continuity condition gets lost during the construction. Instead the convolution algebra <math>L^1(G)</math> takes its place.\n\nMost properties of representations of finite groups can be transferred with appropriate changes to compact groups. For this we need a counterpart to the summation over a finite group:\n\n===Existence and uniqueness of the Haar measure=== \nOn a compact group <math>G</math> there exists exactly one [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] <math>dt,</math> such that:\n* It is a left-translation-invariant measure\n::<math>\\forall s \\in G: \\quad \\int_{G} f(t) dt = \\int_{G} f(st)dt.</math>\n* The whole group has unit measure:\n::<math>\\int_{G} dt=1,</math>\nSuch a left-translation-invariant, normed measure is called '''[[Haar measure]]''' of the group <math>G.</math>\n\nSince <math>G</math> is compact, it is possible to show that this measure is also right-translation-invariant, i.e. it also applies\n\n:<math>\\forall s \\in G: \\quad  \\int_{G} f(t) dt = \\int_{G} f(ts)dt.</math>\n\nBy the scaling above the Haar measure on a finite group is given by <math>dt(s)=\\tfrac{1}{|G|}</math> for all <math>s\\in G.</math>\n\nAll the definitions to representations of finite groups that are mentioned in the section [[#Properties|\u201dProperties\u201d]], also apply to representations of compact groups. But there are some modifications needed:\n\nTo define a subrepresentation we now need a closed subspace. This was not necessary for finite-dimensional representation spaces, because in this case every subspace is already closed. Furthermore, two representations <math>\\rho, \\pi</math> of a compact group <math>G</math> are called equivalent, if there exists a bijective, continuous, linear operator <math>T</math> between the representation spaces whose inverse is also continuous and which satisfies <math>T\\circ\\rho(s)=\\pi(s)\\circ T</math> for all <math>s\\in G.</math>\n\nIf <math>T</math> is unitary, the two representations are called '''unitary equivalent'''.\n\nTo obtain a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant [[inner product]] from a not <math>G</math>\u2013invariant, we now have to use the integral over <math>G</math> instead of the sum. If <math>(\\cdot|\\cdot)</math> is an inner product on a [[Hilbert space]] <math>V,</math> which is not invariant with respect to the representation <math>\\rho</math> of <math>G,</math> then\n\n:<math> (v|u)_\\rho=\\int_G(\\rho(t)v|\\rho(t)u)dt</math>\n\nis a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant inner product on <math>V</math> due to the properties of the Haar measure <math>dt.</math> Thus, we can assume every representation on a Hilbert space to be unitary.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a compact group and let <math>s\\in G.</math> Let <math>L^2(G)</math> be the Hilbert space of the square integrable functions on <math>G.</math> We define the operator <math>L_s</math> on this space by <math>L_s\\Phi(t)=\\Phi(s^{-1}t),</math> where <math>\\Phi\\in L^2(G), t\\in G.</math>\n\nThe map <math>s\\mapsto L_s</math> is a unitary representation of <math>G.</math> It is called '''left-regular representation'''. The '''right-regular representation''' is defined similarly. As the Haar measure of <math>G</math> is also right-translation-invariant, the operator <math>R_s</math> on <math>L^2(G)</math> is given by <math>R_s\\Phi(t)=\\Phi(ts).</math> The right-regular representation is then the unitary representation given by  <math> s\\mapsto R_s.</math> The two representations <math>s\\mapsto L_s</math> and <math>s\\mapsto R_s</math> are dual to each other.\n\nIf <math>G</math> is infinite, these representations have no finite degree. The [[#Left- and right-regular representation|left- and right-regular representation]] as defined at the beginning are isomorphic to the left- and right-regular representation as defined above, if the group <math>G</math> is finite. This is due to the fact that in this case <math>L^2(G)\\cong L^1(G)\\cong\\Complex [G].</math>\n\n===Constructions and decompositions===\nThe different ways of constructing new representations from given ones can be used for compact groups as well, except for the dual representation with which we will deal later. The [[#Direct sum of representations|direct sum]] and the [[#Tensor product of representations|tensor product]] with a finite number of summands/factors are defined in exactly the same way as for finite groups. This is also the case for the symmetric and alternating square. However, we need a Haar measure on the [[direct product]] of compact groups in order to extend the theorem saying that the irreducible representations of the product of two groups are (up to isomorphism) exactly the tensor product of the irreducible representations of the factor groups. First, we note that the direct product  <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> of two compact groups is again a compact group when provided with the product topology. The Haar measure on the direct product is then given by the product of the Haar measures on the factor groups.\n\nFor the dual representation on compact groups we require the [[Dual space#Continuous dual space|topological dual]] <math>V'</math> of the vector space <math>V.</math> This is the vector space of all continuous linear functionals from the vector space <math>V</math> into the base field. Let <math>\\pi</math> be a representation of a compact group <math>G</math> in <math>V.</math>\n\nThe dual representation <math>\\pi':G\\to\\text{GL}(V')</math> is defined by the property\n\n:<math>\\forall v\\in V, \\forall v'\\in V', \\forall s\\in G: \\qquad  \\left \\langle\\pi'(s)v',\\pi(s)v \\right \\rangle=\\langle v',v\\rangle := v'(v).</math>\n\nThus, we can conclude that the dual representation is given by <math>\\pi'(s)v'=v'\\circ\\pi(s^{-1})</math> for all <math>v'\\in V', s\\in G.</math> The map <math>\\pi'</math> is again a continuous group homomorphism and thus a representation.\n\nOn Hilbert spaces: <math>\\pi</math> is irreducible if and only if <math>\\pi'</math> is irreducible.\n\nBy transferring the results of the section [[#Decompositions|decompositions]] to compact groups, we obtain the following theorems:\n\n:'''Theorem.'''

Let <math>W</math> be a <math>G</math>-invariant subspace of <math>V.</math> Then the complement <math>W^0</math> of <math>W</math> exists in <math>V</math> and is <math>G</math>-invariant.\nA subrepresentation and its complement determine a representation uniquely.\n\nThe following theorem will be presented in a more general way, as it provides a very beautiful result about representations of [[compact group|compact]] \u2013 and therefore also of finite \u2013 groups:\n\n:'''Theorem.''' Every linear representation of a compact group over a field of characteristic zero is a direct sum of irreducible representations.\n\nOr in the language of <math>K[G]</math>-modules: If <math>\\text{char}(K)=0,</math> the group algebra <math>K[G]</math> is semisimple, i.e. it is the direct sum of simple algebras.\n\nNote that this decomposition is not unique. However, the number of how many times a subrepresentation isomorphic to a given irreducible representation is occurring in this decomposition is independent of the choice of decomposition.\n\n'''The canonical decomposition'''\n\nTo achieve a unique decomposition, one has to combine all the irreducible subrepresentations that are isomorphic to each other. That means, the representation space is decomposed into a direct sum of its isotypes. This decomposition is uniquely determined. It is called the '''canonical decomposition'''.\n\nLet <math>(\\tau_j)_{j\\in I}</math> be the set of all irreducible representations of a group <math>G</math> up to isomorphism. Let <math>V</math> be a representation of <math>G</math> and let <math>\\{V(\\tau_j)|j\\in I\\}</math> be the set of all isotypes of <math>V.</math> The [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] <math>p_j:V\\to V(\\tau_j)</math> corresponding to the canonical decomposition is given by\n\n:<math>p_j=\\frac{n_j}{g}\\sum_{t\\in G}\\overline{\\chi_{\\tau_j}(t)}\\rho(t),</math>\n\nwhere <math>n_j=\\dim (\\tau_j),</math> <math>g=\\text{ord}(G)</math> and <math>\\chi_{\\tau_j}</math> is the character belonging to <math>\\tau_j.</math>\n\nIn the following, we show how to determine the isotype to the trivial representation:\n\n'''Definition (Projection formula).''' For every representation <math>(\\rho, V)</math> of a group <math>G</math> we define \n:<math>V^G:=\\{v\\in V : \\rho(s)v=v\\,\\,\\,\\, \\forall\\, s \\in G\\}.</math>\nIn general, <math>\\rho(s): V\\to V</math> is not <math>G</math>-linear. We define \n:<math>P:= \\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{s\\in G} \\rho(s) \\in \\text{End}(V).</math> \nThen <math>P</math> is a <math>G</math>-linear map, because \n:<math>\\forall t \\in G : \\qquad  \\sum_{s\\in G} \\rho(s)= \\sum_{s\\in G} \\rho(tst^{-1}).</math>\n\n:'''Proposition.''' The map <math>P</math> is a [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] from <math>V</math> to <math>V^G.</math>\n\nThis proposition enables us to determine the isotype to the trivial subrepresentation of a given representation explicitly.\n\nHow often the trivial representation occurs in <math>V</math> is given by <math>\\text{Tr}(P).</math> This result is a consequence of the fact that the eigenvalues of a [[Projection (linear algebra)#Properties and classification|projection]] are only <math>0</math> or <math>1</math> and that the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue <math>1</math> is the image of the projection. Since the trace of the projection is the sum of all eigenvalues, we obtain the following result \n:<math>\\dim(V(1))=\\dim(V^G)=Tr(P)=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{s\\in G}\\chi_V(s),</math>\nin which <math>V(1)</math> denotes the isotype of the trivial representation.\n\nLet <math>V_\\pi</math> be a nontrivial irreducible representation of <math>G.</math> Then the isotype to the trivial representation of <math>\\pi</math> is the null space. That means the following equation holds\n:<math>P=\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{s\\in G} \\pi(s)=0.</math>\nLet <math>e_1,...,e_n</math> be a [[orthonormal basis]] of <math>V_\\pi.</math> Then we have:\n:<math>\\sum_{s\\in G} \\text{Tr}(\\pi(s)) = \\sum _{s\\in G} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\langle \\pi(s)e_j, e_j \\rangle = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left  \\langle \\sum_{s\\in G} \\pi(s)e_j, e_j  \\right \\rangle =0.</math>\nTherefore, the following is valid for a nontrivial irreducible representation <math>V</math>: \n:<math>\\sum_{s\\in G} \\chi_V(s)=0.</math>\n\n'''Example.'''

This is because (in terms of the inner product from [[#Inner product and characters|\u201dInner product and characters\u201d]] below) we have <math>(\\eta|\\eta)=1, (\\pi|\\pi)=2.</math>\n\nThe subspace <math>\\Complex (e_1+e_2+e_3)</math> of <math>\\Complex ^3</math> is invariant with respect to the left-regular representation. Restricted to this subspace we obtain the trivial representation.\n\nThe orthogonal complement of <math>\\Complex (e_1+e_2+e_3)</math> is <math>\\Complex (e_1-e_2)\\oplus\\Complex (e_1+e_2-2e_3).</math> Restricted to this subspace, which is also <math>G</math>\u2013invariant as we have seen above, we obtain the representation <math>\\tau</math> given by\n\n:<math> \\tau (1,2)= \\begin{pmatrix} -1 &0 \\\\0 & 1\\end{pmatrix},\\quad \\tau(1,3)=\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{3}{2}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\tau(2,3)=\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{3}{2}\\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nAgain, we can use the irreducibility criterion of the next chapter to prove that <math>\\tau</math> is irreducible.

We consider the representation <math>\\rho(A)=A</math> for all <math>A\\in G.</math> The subspace <math>\\Complex e_1</math> is a <math>G</math>-invariant subspace. However, there exists no <math>G</math>-invariant complement to this subspace. The assumption that such a complement exists would entail that every matrix is [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]] over <math>\\Complex .</math> This is known to be wrong and thus yields a contradiction.\n\nThe moral of the story is that if we consider infinite groups, it is possible that a representation - even one that is not irreducible - can not be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible subrepresentations.\n\n==Character theory==\n{{Main|Character theory}}\n\n===Definitions===\n\nThe ''character'' of a representation <math>\\rho: G\\to \\text{GL}(V)</math> is defined as the map\n\n:<math>\\chi_\\rho : G \\to \\Complex, \\chi_\\rho(s) := \\text{Tr}(\\rho(s)),</math> in which <math>\\text{Tr}(\\rho(s))</math> denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the linear map <math>\\rho(s).</math><ref>Some authors define the character as <math>\\chi(s)=\\dim (V)\\text{Tr}(\\rho(s)),</math>, but this definition is not used in this article.</ref>\n\nEven though the character is a map between two groups, it is not in general a [[group homomorphism]], as the following example shows.\n\nLet <math>\\rho: \\Z /2\\Z \\times\\Z /2\\Z\\to\\text{GL}_2(\\Complex )</math> be the representation defined by:\n:<math>\n\\rho(0,0)=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho(1, 0)=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     -1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & -1\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho(0,1)=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\rho(1,1)=  \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThe character <math>\\chi_\\rho</math> is given by \n:<math>\\chi_\\rho(0,0)=2, \\quad \\chi_\\rho(1,0)=-2,\\quad \\chi_\\rho(0,1)=\\chi_\\rho(1,1)=0.</math>\nCharacters of [[#Permutation representation|permutation representations]] are particularly easy to compute.

Put differently, class functions and in particular characters are constant on each [[conjugacy class]] <math>C_s = \\{tst^{-1}| t \\in G \\}.</math>\nIt also follows from elementary properties of the trace that <math>\\chi(s)</math> is the sum of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of <math>\\rho(s)</math> with multiplicity. If the degree of the representation is ''n'', then the sum is ''n'' long. If ''s'' has order ''m'', these eigenvalues are all ''m''-th [[root of unity|roots of unity]].

If  <math>\\chi_1, \\ldots ,\\chi_k</math> are the distinct irreducible characters of <math>G</math>, they form an orthonormal basis for the vector space of all class functions with respect to the inner product defined above, i.e. \n* <math>(\\chi_i|\\chi_j)=\\begin{cases} 1 \\text{ if } i= j \\\\0 \\text{ otherwise }\\end{cases}.</math>\n* Every class function <math>f</math> may be expressed as a unique linear combination of the irreducible characters <math>\\chi_1, \\ldots ,\\chi_k</math>.\nOne might verify that the irreducible characters generate <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> by showing that there exists no nonzero class function which is orthogonal to all the irreducible characters. For <math> \\rho </math> a representation and <math>f</math> a class function, denote <math> \\rho_f = \\sum_g f(g)\\rho (g).</math> Then for <math> \\rho </math> irreducible, we have <math> \\rho_f = \\frac {|G|}{n} \\langle f,\\chi _V^{*} \\rangle \\in End(V)</math> from [[Dot product|Schur's lemma]]. Suppose <math> f </math> is a class function which is orthogonal to all the characters. Then by the above we have <math> \\rho _f = 0 </math> whenever <math> \\rho </math> is irreducible.

Consider <math>V</math> as an <math>\\mathbb{C}A</math>-module, and decompose it into isotypes as <math>V=\\bigoplus_j{V_j}</math>.  If this decomposition is trivial, we are in the second case.  Otherwise, the larger <math>G</math>-action permutes these isotypic modules; because <math>V</math> is irreducible as a <math>\\mathbb{C}G</math>-module, the permutation action is [[transitive action|transitive]] (in fact [[primitive action|primitive]]).

As the product of two characters provides another character, <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is a subring of the ring <math>\\Complex_{\\text{class}}(G)</math> of all class functions on <math>G.</math> Because the <math>\\chi_i</math> form a basis of <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> we obtain, just as in the case of <math>R(G),</math> an isomorphism <math>\\Complex \\otimes \\mathcal{R}(G)\\cong\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G).</math>\n\nLet <math>H</math> be a subgroup of <math>G.</math> The restriction thus defines a ring homomorphism <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)\\to \\mathcal{R}(H), \\phi\\mapsto \\phi|_H,</math> which will be denoted by <math>\\text{Res}^G_H</math> or <math>\\text{Res}.</math> Likewise, the induction on class functions defines a homomorphism of abelian groups <math>\\mathcal{R}(H)\\to \\mathcal{R}(G),</math> which will be written as <math>\\text{Ind}^G_H</math> or in short <math>\\text{Ind}.</math>\n\nAccording to the [[#Frobenius reciprocity|Frobenius reciprocity]], these two homomorphisms are adjoint with respect to the bilinear forms <math>\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_H</math> and <math>\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_G.</math> Furthermore, the formula <math>\\text{Ind}(\\varphi\\cdot \\text{Res}(\\psi))=\\text{Ind}(\\varphi)\\cdot \\psi</math> shows that the image of <math>\\text{Ind}:\\mathcal{R}(H)\\to \\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the ring <math>\\mathcal{R}(G).</math>\n\nBy the restriction of representations, the map <math>\\text{Res}</math> can be defined analogously for <math>R(G),</math> and by the induction we obtain the map <math>\\text{Ind}</math> for <math>R(G).</math> Due to the Frobenius reciprocity, we get the result that these maps are adjoint to each other and that the image <math>\\text{Im}(\\text{Ind})=\\text{Ind}(R(H))</math> is an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the ring <math>R(G).</math>\n\nIf <math>A</math> is a commutative ring, the homomorphisms <math>\\text{Res}</math> and <math>\\text{Ind}</math> may be extended to <math>A</math>\u2013linear maps:\n:<math> \\begin{cases}\nA\\otimes \\text{Res}: A\\otimes R(G) \\to A\\otimes R(H)\\\\\n\\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\tau_j \\right ) \\mapsto \\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\text{Res}(\\tau_j) \\right )\n\\end{cases}, \\qquad  \\begin{cases}\n A\\otimes \\text{Ind}: A\\otimes R(H) \\to A\\otimes R(G)\\\\\n\\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\eta_j \\right )\\mapsto \\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\text{Ind}(\\eta_j) \\right )\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nin which <math>\\eta_j</math> are all the irreducible representations of <math>H</math> up to isomorphism.\n\nWith <math>A=\\Complex </math> we obtain in particular that <math>\\text{Ind}</math> and <math>\\text{Res}</math> supply homomorphisms between <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> and <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(H).</math>\n\nLet <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> be two groups with respective representations <math>(\\rho_1, V_1)</math> and <math>(\\rho_2, V_2).</math> Then, <math>\\rho_1\\otimes\\rho_2</math> is the representation of the [[direct product]] <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> as was shown in a [[#Tensor product of representations|previous section]]. Another result of that section was that all irreducible representations of <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> are exactly the representations <math>\\eta_1\\otimes\\eta_2,</math> where <math>\\eta_1</math> and <math>\\eta_2</math> are irreducible representations of <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2,</math> respectively. This passes over to the representation ring as the identity <math>R(G_1\\times G_2)=R(G_1)\\otimes_{\\Z} R(G_2),</math> in which <math>R(G_1)\\otimes_{\\Z} R(G_2)</math> is the [[tensor product of modules|tensor product]] of the representation rings as <math>\\Z</math>\u2013modules.\n\n==Induction theorems==\n\nInduction theorems relate the representation ring of a given finite group ''G'' to representation rings of a family ''X'' consisting of some subsets ''H'' of ''G''. More precisely, for such a collection of subgroups, the induction functor yields a map \n:<math>\\varphi: \\text{Ind}:\\bigoplus_{H\\in X}\\mathcal{R}(H) \\to \\mathcal{R}(G)</math>; induction theorems give criteria for the surjectivity of this map or closely related ones.\n''Artin's induction theorem'' is the most elementary theorem in this group of results. It asserts that the following are equivalent:\n\n* The [[cokernel]] of <math>\\varphi</math> is finite.\n* <math>G</math> is the union of the conjugates of the subgroups belonging to <math>X,</math> i.e. <math>G=\\bigcup_{H\\in X \\atop s\\in G}sHs^{-1}.</math>\n\nSince <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is finitely generated as a group, the first point can be rephrased as follows:\n*For each character <math>\\chi</math> of <math>G,</math> there exist virtual characters <math>\\chi_H \\in \\mathcal{R}(H), \\,H\\in X</math> and an integer <math> d\\geq 1,</math> such that <math> d\\cdot\\chi = \\sum_{H\\in X}\\text{Ind}^G_H(\\chi_H).</math>\n{{harvtxt|Serre|1977}} gives two proofs of this theorem. For example, since ''G'' is the union of its cyclic subgroups, every character of <math>G</math> is a linear combination with rational coefficients of characters induced by characters of [[cyclic group|cyclic subgroups]] of <math>G.</math> Since the representations of cyclic groups are well-understood, in particular the irreducible representations are one-dimensional, this gives a certain control over representations of ''G''.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, it is not in general true that <math>\\varphi</math> is surjective. ''[[Brauer's theorem on induced characters|Brauer's induction theorem]]'' asserts that <math>\\varphi</math> is surjective, provided that ''X'' is the family of all ''elementary subgroups''.\nHere a group ''H'' is [[elementary group|elementary]] if there is some prime ''p'' such that ''H'' is the [[direct product]] of a [[cyclic group]] of order prime to <math>p</math> and a [[P-group|<math>p</math>\u2013group]].\nIn other words, every [[#Character theory|character]] of <math>G</math> is a linear combination with integer coefficients of characters induced by characters of elementary subgroups.\nThe elementary subgroups ''H'' arising in Brauer's theorem have a richer representation theory than cyclic groups, they at least have the property that any irreducible representation for such ''H'' is induced by a one-dimensional representation of a (necessarily also elementary) subgroup <math>K \\subset H</math>. (This latter property can be shown to hold for any [[supersolvable group]], which includes [[nilpotent group]]s and, in particular, elementary groups.) This ability to induce representations from degree 1 representations has some further consequences in the representation theory of finite groups.\n\n==Real representations==\nFor proofs and more information about representations over general subfields of <math>\\Complex </math> please refer to [[#Literature| '''[2]''']].\n\nIf a group <math>G</math> acts on a real vector space <math>V_0,</math> the corresponding representation on the complex vector space <math>V=V_0\\otimes_\\R \\Complex </math> is called '''real''' (<math>V</math> is called the [[complexification]] of <math>V_0</math>). The corresponding representation mentioned above is given by <math>s \\cdot(v_0\\otimes z) = (s\\cdot v_0)\\otimes z</math> for all <math>s\\in G, v_0\\in V_0, z\\in \\Complex.</math>\n\nLet <math>\\rho</math> be a real representation. The linear map <math>\\rho(s)</math> is <math>\\R</math>-valued for all <math>s\\in G.</math> Thus, we can conclude that the character of a real representation is always real-valued. But not every representation with a real-valued character is real. To make this clear, let <math>G</math> be a finite, non-abelian subgroup of the group\n\n:<math>\\text{SU}(2)= \\left \\{\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -\\overline{b} & \\overline{a} \\end{pmatrix} \\ : \\ |a|^2+|b|^2=1 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nThen <math>G \\subset \\text{SU}(2)</math> acts on <math>V=\\Complex^2.</math> Since the trace of any matrix in <math>\\text{SU}(2)</math> is real, the character of the representation is real-valued. Suppose <math>\\rho</math> is a real representation, then <math>\\rho(G)</math> would consist only of real-valued matrices.

An irreducible representation <math>V</math> of <math>G</math> is real if and only if there exists a [[Degenerate bilinear form#Non-degenerate forms|nondegenerate]] [[symmetric bilinear form]] <math>B</math> on <math>V</math> preserved by <math>G.</math>\n\nAn irreducible representation of <math>G</math> on a real vector space can become reducible when extending the field to <math>\\Complex.</math> For example, the following real representation of the cyclic group is reducible when considered over <math>\\Complex</math>\n:<math>  \\begin{cases} \\rho : \\Z /m\\Z  \\to \\text{GL}_2(\\R ) \\\\[4pt]  \\rho(k)= \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos  \\left(\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m}\\right ) & \\sin \\left (\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right ) \\\\ -\\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right ) & \\cos \\left (\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right )\\end{pmatrix} \\end{cases}</math>\n \nTherefore, by classifying all the irreducible representations that are real over <math>\\Complex,</math> we still haven't classified all the irreducible real representations.

Let <math>G</math> act irreducibly on <math>V_0</math> and let <math>V=V_0\\otimes \\Complex.</math> If <math>V</math> is not irreducible, there are exactly two irreducible factors which are complex conjugate representations of <math>G.</math>\n\n'''Definition.''' A '''quaternionic''' representation is a (complex) representation <math>V,</math> which possesses a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant anti-linear homomorphism <math>J:V\\to V</math> satisfying <math>J^2=-\\text{Id}.</math> Thus, a [[bilinear form#Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms|skew-symmetric]], nondegenerate <math>G</math>\u2013invariant bilinear form defines a quaternionic structure on <math>V.</math>\n\n:'''Theorem.''' An irreducible representation <math>V</math> is one and only one of the following:\n:: (i) complex: <math>\\chi_V</math> is not real-valued and there exists no <math>G</math>\u2013invariant [[Degenerate bilinear form#Non-degenerate forms|nondegenerate]] bilinear form on <math>V.</math>\n:: (ii) real: <math>V=V_0\\otimes \\Complex ,</math> a real representation; <math>V</math> has a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant nondegenerate [[symmetric bilinear form]].\n:: (iii) quaternionic: <math>\\chi_V</math> is real, but <math>V</math> is not real; <math>V</math> has a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant skew-symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form.\n\n==Representations of particular groups==\n===Symmetric groups===\n\n{{main|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}\nRepresentation of the [[symmetric group]]s <math>S_n</math> have been intensely studied. Conjugacy classes in <math>S_n</math> (and therefore, by the above, irreducible representations) correspond to [[partition (number theory)|partition]]s of ''n''. For example, <math>S_3</math> has three irreducible representations, corresponding to the partitions\n\n:3; 2+1; 1+1+1\n\nof 3. For such a partition, a [[Young tableau]] is a graphical device depicting a partition. The irreducible representation corresponding to such a partition (or Young tableau) is called a [[Specht module]].\n\nRepresentations of different symmetric groups are related: any representation of <math>S_n \\times S_m</math> yields a representation of <math>S_{n+m}</math> by induction, and vice versa by restriction. The direct sum of all these representation rings\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{n \\ge 0} R(S_n)</math>\n\ninherits from these constructions the structure of a [[Hopf algebra]] which, it turns out, is closely related to [[symmetric function]]s.\n\n===Finite groups of Lie type===\n\nTo a certain extent, the representations of the <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> , as ''n'' varies, have a similar flavor as for the <math>S_n</math>; the above-mentioned induction process gets replaced by so-called [[parabolic induction]]. However, unlike for <math>S_n</math>, where all representations can be obtained by induction of trivial representations, this is not true for <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math>. Instead, new building blocks, known as [[cuspidal representation]]s, are needed.\n\nRepresentations of <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> and more generally, representations of [[finite groups of Lie type]] have been thoroughly studied. {{harvtxt|Bonnaf\u00e9|2011}} describes the representations of <math>SL_2(\\mathbf F_q)</math>. A geometric description of irreducible representations of such groups, including the above-mentioned cuspidal representations, is obtained by [[Deligne-Lusztig theory]], which constructs such representation in the [[l-adic cohomology]] of [[Deligne-Lusztig variety|Deligne-Lusztig varieties]].\n\nThe similarity of the representation theory of <math>S_n</math> and <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> goes beyond finite groups. The [[philosophy of cusp forms]] highlights the kinship of representation theoretic aspects of these types of groups with general linear groups of [[local field]]s such as [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] and of the ring of [[adelic algebraic group|adele]]s, see {{harvtxt|Bump|2004}}.\n\n==Outlook\u2014Representations of compact groups==\nThe theory of representations of compact groups may be, to some degree, extended to [[locally compact group]]s. The representation theory unfolds in this context great importance for harmonic analysis and the study of automorphic forms. For proofs, further information and for a more detailed insight which is beyond the scope of this chapter please consult [[#Literature| '''[4]''']] and [[#Literature| '''[5]''']].\n\n===Definition and properties===\nA '''topological group''' is a group together with a [[topology]] with respect to which the group composition and the inversion are [[continuous function|continuous]].\nSuch a group is called '''compact''', if any cover of <math>G,</math> which is open in the topology, has a finite subcover. Closed subgroups of a compact group are compact again.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a compact group and let <math>V</math> be a finite-dimensional <math>\\Complex</math>\u2013vector space. A linear representation of <math>G</math> to <math>V</math> is a '''continuous group homomorphism''' <math>\\rho: G \\to \\text{GL}(V),</math> i.e. <math>\\rho(s)v</math> is a continuous function in the two variables <math>s\\in G</math> and <math>v\\in V.</math>\n\nA linear representation of <math>G</math> into a [[Banach space]] <math>V</math> is defined to be a continuous group homomorphism of <math>G</math> into the set of all bijective [[bounded operator|bounded linear operators]] on <math>V</math> with a continuous inverse. Since <math>\\pi(g)^{-1}=\\pi(g^{-1}),</math> we can do without the last requirement. In the following, we will consider in particular representations of compact groups in [[Hilbert space]]s.\n\nJust as with finite groups, we can define the [[#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|group algebra]] and the [[#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|convolution algebra]]. However, the group algebra provides no helpful information in the case of infinite groups, because the continuity condition gets lost during the construction. Instead the convolution algebra <math>L^1(G)</math> takes its place.\n\nMost properties of representations of finite groups can be transferred with appropriate changes to compact groups. For this we need a counterpart to the summation over a finite group:\n\n===Existence and uniqueness of the Haar measure=== \nOn a compact group <math>G</math> there exists exactly one [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] <math>dt,</math> such that:\n* It is a left-translation-invariant measure\n::<math>\\forall s \\in G: \\quad \\int_{G} f(t) dt = \\int_{G} f(st)dt.</math>\n* The whole group has unit measure:\n::<math>\\int_{G} dt=1,</math>\nSuch a left-translation-invariant, normed measure is called '''[[Haar measure]]''' of the group <math>G.</math>\n\nSince <math>G</math> is compact, it is possible to show that this measure is also right-translation-invariant, i.e. it also applies\n\n:<math>\\forall s \\in G: \\quad  \\int_{G} f(t) dt = \\int_{G} f(ts)dt.</math>\n\nBy the scaling above the Haar measure on a finite group is given by <math>dt(s)=\\tfrac{1}{|G|}</math> for all <math>s\\in G.</math>\n\nAll the definitions to representations of finite groups that are mentioned in the section [[#Properties|\u201dProperties\u201d]], also apply to representations of compact groups. But there are some modifications needed:\n\nTo define a subrepresentation we now need a closed subspace. This was not necessary for finite-dimensional representation spaces, because in this case every subspace is already closed. Furthermore, two representations <math>\\rho, \\pi</math> of a compact group <math>G</math> are called equivalent, if there exists a bijective, continuous, linear operator <math>T</math> between the representation spaces whose inverse is also continuous and which satisfies <math>T\\circ\\rho(s)=\\pi(s)\\circ T</math> for all <math>s\\in G.</math>\n\nIf <math>T</math> is unitary, the two representations are called '''unitary equivalent'''.\n\nTo obtain a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant [[inner product]] from a not <math>G</math>\u2013invariant, we now have to use the integral over <math>G</math> instead of the sum. If <math>(\\cdot|\\cdot)</math> is an inner product on a [[Hilbert space]] <math>V,</math> which is not invariant with respect to the representation <math>\\rho</math> of <math>G,</math> then\n\n:<math> (v|u)_\\rho=\\int_G(\\rho(t)v|\\rho(t)u)dt</math>\n\nis a <math>G</math>\u2013invariant inner product on <math>V</math> due to the properties of the Haar measure <math>dt.</math> Thus, we can assume every representation on a Hilbert space to be unitary.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a compact group and let <math>s\\in G.</math> Let <math>L^2(G)</math> be the Hilbert space of the square integrable functions on <math>G.</math> We define the operator <math>L_s</math> on this space by <math>L_s\\Phi(t)=\\Phi(s^{-1}t),</math> where <math>\\Phi\\in L^2(G), t\\in G.</math>\n\nThe map <math>s\\mapsto L_s</math> is a unitary representation of <math>G.</math> It is called '''left-regular representation'''. The '''right-regular representation''' is defined similarly. As the Haar measure of <math>G</math> is also right-translation-invariant, the operator <math>R_s</math> on <math>L^2(G)</math> is given by <math>R_s\\Phi(t)=\\Phi(ts).</math> The right-regular representation is then the unitary representation given by  <math> s\\mapsto R_s.</math> The two representations <math>s\\mapsto L_s</math> and <math>s\\mapsto R_s</math> are dual to each other.\n\nIf <math>G</math> is infinite, these representations have no finite degree. The [[#Left- and right-regular representation|left- and right-regular representation]] as defined at the beginning are isomorphic to the left- and right-regular representation as defined above, if the group <math>G</math> is finite. This is due to the fact that in this case <math>L^2(G)\\cong L^1(G)\\cong\\Complex [G].</math>\n\n===Constructions and decompositions===\nThe different ways of constructing new representations from given ones can be used for compact groups as well, except for the dual representation with which we will deal later. The [[#Direct sum of representations|direct sum]] and the [[#Tensor product of representations|tensor product]] with a finite number of summands/factors are defined in exactly the same way as for finite groups. This is also the case for the symmetric and alternating square. However, we need a Haar measure on the [[direct product]] of compact groups in order to extend the theorem saying that the irreducible representations of the product of two groups are (up to isomorphism) exactly the tensor product of the irreducible representations of the factor groups. First, we note that the direct product  <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> of two compact groups is again a compact group when provided with the product topology. The Haar measure on the direct product is then given by the product of the Haar measures on the factor groups.\n\nFor the dual representation on compact groups we require the [[Dual space#Continuous dual space|topological dual]] <math>V'</math> of the vector space <math>V.</math> This is the vector space of all continuous linear functionals from the vector space <math>V</math> into the base field. Let <math>\\pi</math> be a representation of a compact group <math>G</math> in <math>V.</math>\n\nThe dual representation <math>\\pi':G\\to\\text{GL}(V')</math> is defined by the property\n\n:<math>\\forall v\\in V, \\forall v'\\in V', \\forall s\\in G: \\qquad  \\left \\langle\\pi'(s)v',\\pi(s)v \\right \\rangle=\\langle v',v\\rangle := v'(v).</math>\n\nThus, we can conclude that the dual representation is given by <math>\\pi'(s)v'=v'\\circ\\pi(s^{-1})</math> for all <math>v'\\in V', s\\in G.</math> The map <math>\\pi'</math> is again a continuous group homomorphism and thus a representation.\n\nOn Hilbert spaces: <math>\\pi</math> is irreducible if and only if <math>\\pi'</math> is irreducible.\n\nBy transferring the results of the section [[#Decompositions|decompositions]] to compact groups, we obtain the following theorems:\n\n:'''Theorem.''' Every irreducible representation <math>(\\tau,V_\\tau)</math> of a compact group into a [[Hilbert space]] is finite-dimensional and there exists an [[inner product]] on <math>V_\\tau</math> such that <math>\\tau</math> is unitary. Since the Haar measure is normalized, this inner product is unique.\n\nEvery representation of a compact group is isomorphic to a [[Direct sum of modules#Direct sum of Hilbert spaces|direct Hilbert sum]] of irreducible representations.\n\nLet <math>(\\rho,V_\\rho)</math> be a unitary representation of the compact group <math>G.</math> Just as for finite groups we define for an irreducible representation <math>(\\tau, V_\\tau)</math> the isotype or isotypic component in <math>\\rho</math> to be the subspace\n\n:<math>V_\\rho(\\tau)=\\sum_{V_{\\tau} \\cong U\\subset V_\\rho} U.</math>\n\nThis is the sum of all invariant closed subspaces <math>U,</math> which are <math>G</math>\u2013isomorphic to <math>V_\\tau.</math>\n\nNote that the isotypes of not equivalent irreducible representations are pairwise orthogonal.\n\n:'''Theorem.'''\n::(i) <math>V_\\rho(\\tau)</math> is a closed invariant subspace of <math>V_\\rho.</math>\n::(ii) <math>V_\\rho(\\tau)</math> is <math>G</math>\u2013isomorphic to the direct sum of copies of <math>V_\\tau.</math>\n::(iii) Canonical decomposition: <math> V_\\rho</math> is the direct Hilbert sum of the isotypes <math>V_\\rho(\\tau),</math> in which <math>\\tau</math> passes through all the isomorphism classes of the irreducible representations.\n\nThe corresponding projection to the canonical decomposition <math>p_\\tau: V\\to V(\\tau),</math> in which <math>V(\\tau)</math> is an isotype of <math>V,</math> is for compact groups given by\n:<math>p_\\tau(v)=n_\\tau\\int_G\\overline{\\chi_\\tau(t)}\\rho(t)(v)dt,</math>\nwhere <math>n_\\tau=\\dim (V(\\tau))</math> and <math>\\chi_\\tau</math> is the character corresponding to the irreducible representation <math>\\tau.</math>\n\n====Projection formula==== \nFor every representation <math>(\\rho,V)</math> of a compact group <math>G</math> we define\n\n:<math>V^G=\\{v\\in V : \\rho(s)v=v \\,\\,\\,\\forall s \\in G\\}.</math>\n\nIn general <math>\\rho(s): V\\to V</math> is not <math>G</math>\u2013linear.

The map <math>P</math> is a projection from <math>V</math> to <math>V^G.</math>\n\nIf the representation is finite-dimensional, it is possible to determine the direct sum of the trivial subrepresentation just as in the case of finite groups.\n\n===Characters, Schur's lemma and the inner product===\nGenerally, representations of compact groups are investigated on [[Hilbert space|Hilbert-]] and [[Banach space]]s. In most cases they are not finite-dimensional. Therefore, it is not useful to refer to [[#Character theory|characters]] when speaking about representations of compact groups. Nevertheless, in most cases it is possible to restrict the study to the case of finite dimensions:\n\nSince irreducible representations of compact groups are finite-dimensional and unitary (see results from the [[#Definition and properties|first subsection]]), we can define irreducible characters in the same way as it was done for finite groups.\n\nAs long as the constructed representations stay finite-dimensional, the characters of the newly constructed representations may be obtained in the same way as for finite groups.\n\n'''Schur's lemma''' is also valid for compact groups:\n\nLet <math>(\\pi,V)</math> be an irreducible unitary representation of a compact group <math>G.</math> Then every bounded [[Operator (mathematics)#linear operators|operator]] <math>T:V\\to V</math> satisfying the property <math>T\\circ\\pi(s)=\\pi(s)\\circ T</math> for all <math>s\\in G,</math> is a scalar multiple of the identity, i.e. there exists <math>\\lambda \\in \\Complex </math> such that <math>T=\\lambda \\text{Id}.</math>\n\n'''Definition.'''

Let <math>\\chi</math> and <math>\\chi'</math> be the characters of two non-isomorphic irreducible representations <math>V</math> and <math>V',</math> respectively.

Every irreducible representation <math>V</math> of <math>G</math> is contained <math>\\dim (V)</math>\u2013times in the left-regular representation.\n\n:'''Lemma.'''

Let <math>G</math> be a group. The non-isomorphic irreducible representations of <math>G</math> form an [[orthonormal basis]] in <math>L^2(G)</math> with respect to this inner product.\n\nAs we already know that the non-isomorphic irreducible representations are orthonormal, we only need to verify that they generate <math>L^2(G).</math> This may be done, by proving that there exists no non-zero square integrable function on <math>G</math> orthogonal to all the irreducible characters.\n\nJust as in the case of finite groups, the number of the irreducible representations up to isomorphism of a group <math>G</math> equals the number of conjugacy classes of <math>G.</math> However, because a compact group has in general infinitely many conjugacy classes, this does not provide any useful information.\n\n===The induced representation===\nIf <math>H</math> is a closed subgroup of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]] in a compact group <math>G,</math> the definition of the [[#The induced representation|induced representation]] for finite groups may be adopted.\n\nHowever, the induced representation can be defined more generally, so that the definition is valid independent of the index of the subgroup <math>H.</math>\n\nFor this purpose let <math>(\\eta, V_\\eta)</math> be a unitary representation of the closed subgroup <math>H.</math> The continuous induced representation <math>\\text{Ind}^G_H(\\eta)=(I,V_I)</math> is defined as follows:\n\nLet <math>V_I</math> denote the Hilbert space of all measurable, square integrable functions <math>\\Phi:G\\to V_\\eta</math> with the property <math>\\Phi(ls)=\\eta(l)\\Phi(s)</math> for all <math>l\\in H, s\\in G.</math> The norm is given by\n\n:<math>\\|\\Phi\\|_G=\\text{sup}_{s\\in G}\\|\\Phi(s)\\|</math>\n\nand the representation <math>I</math> is given as the right-translation: <math>I(s)\\Phi(k)=\\Phi(ks).</math>\n\nThe induced representation is then again a unitary representation.\n\nSince <math>G</math> is compact, the induced representation can be decomposed into the direct sum of irreducible representations of <math>G.</math> Note that all irreducible representations belonging to the same isotype appear with a multiplicity equal to <math>\\dim (\\text{Hom}_G(V_\\eta,V_I))=\\langle V_\\eta,V_I \\rangle_G.</math>\n\nLet <math>(\\rho, V_\\rho)</math> be a representation of <math>G,</math> then there exists a canonical isomorphism\n:<math>T: \\text{Hom}_G(V_\\rho, I^G_H(\\eta))\\to \\text{Hom}_H(V_\\rho|_H, V_\\eta).</math>\n\nThe [[#Frobenius reciprocity|Frobenius reciprocity]] transfers, together with the modified definitions of the inner product and of the bilinear form, to compact groups.

She concluded that the [[Hoabinhian|H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh culture]] existed in this region. Through C14 testing, the artifacts dated back to 10,509 (plus or minus 950) ago. From Quy \u0110\u1ea1t township ([[Tuy\u00ean H\u00f3a District]]) to south-west about 150 m, the Hum grotto contains many stone tools and animal stones from an ancient human community. Inside Khai grotto near the Quy \u0110\u1ea1t township, similar artifacts were found, including ceramics from [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]]. Additionally, artifacts of the Stone Age were unearthed in grottoes in the Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh region. Owners of these artifacts lived in the caves and grottoes and hunted for their food.<ref name=\"nuocnonhuyendieu\"/>\n\nHuman settlement in \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi can be traced 5,000 years back. Many relics and remnants have been found in Bau Tro, a lake in the city, most of which date to the [[Stone Age]]. Around  2880 BC, the site of modern \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was a territory of the Viet Thuong tribe of [[V\u0103n Lang]] during the reign of king [[H\u00f9ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]. The site was a long-disputed territory between the [[Champa|Champa kingdom]] and [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]. It officially became \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t territory in 1069 after [[L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t]] took victory over Champa as a result of the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t-Champa War (1069).\n\nThe area ceased to be the southernmost of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t following the political marriage of the [[Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty]] princess, [[Huy\u1ec1n Tr\u00e2n]], to Champa king, [[Jaya Sinhavarman III]] (Vietnamese: ''Ch\u1ebf M\u00e2n''). Princess Huy\u1ec1n Tr\u00e2n was king [[Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]]'s daughter and king Tr\u1ea7n Anh T\u00f4ng's younger sister. Political matches made to acquire land was a traditional practice by Champa kings. Thanks to this marriage, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t acquired lands (as dowry) of what is now [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]] and [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf Province]] (provinces which were then known respectively as Chau O and Chau Ri or Chau Ly).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/25734/h/history10.html |title=Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303100535/http://library.thinkquest.org/25734/h/history10.html |archive-date=2008-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Kingdom of Champa|url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/549713|publisher=ancientworld|accessdate=2008-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511081540/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/549713|archive-date=2011-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the time of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War]] (1558\u20131775), Vietnam was divided into two countries: Dang Trong (South) and Dang Ngoai (North) with the [[Gianh River]] as frontier line. \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was an important fortress of the southern [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]]. The \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi Wall (Vietnamese: ''Th\u00e0nh \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi'') was considered the barrier that protected the Nguy\u1ec5n lords from the attack by the northern [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh]] family.\n\nDuring the [[First Indochina War]] (between the French and the [[Viet Minh]] in the 1950s), the \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi airbase was used by the French to attack the Viet Minh in north-central Vietnam and the Laotian [[Pathet Lao]] army in central and southern Laos. During the [[Vietnam War]], \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was heavily devastated by bombardments from United States [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bombers]] due to its location near the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]] and the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/580550522.html?dids=580550522:580550522&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Feb+08%2C+1965&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=U.+S.+Hits+Dong+Hoi+Again%2C+Russ+Say&pqatl=google U.

Today the bell tower remains near the town center as a monument.[[File:TamToa.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Ruins of [[Tam T\u00f2a Church]].]]\n\nOn 19 April 1972, during a major North Vietnam offensive, a task force of four US ships were sailing off the coast of Vietnam \u2014 {{USS|Oklahoma City|CLG-5|6}}, {{USS|Sterett|CG-31|6}}, {{USS|Lloyd Thomas|DD-764|6}} and {{USS|Higbee|DD-806|6}}. They were attacked by three North Vietnamese MiG aircraft in the [[Battle of \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi]]. In an attempt to surprise the task force, the MiGs came in low, described as \"getting their feet wet.\" Despite the official stories, they did not surprise the task force, which had spotted them long before engagement range and were ready to shoot. Two ships, ''Oklahoma City'' and ''Sterett'', had anti-aircraft missiles, while ''Higbee'' and ''Lloyd Thomas'' were armed with dual purpose {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns. All ships were at battle stations.\n\nThis city is the narrowest land of Vietnam (around 40&nbsp;km from the east to the west). After the [[fall of Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh province was merged into B\u00ecnh Tr\u1ecb Thi\u00ean province (B\u00ecnh Tr\u1ecb Thi\u00ean is the abbreviation of Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh, Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, and Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean provinces). In 1990, B\u00ecnh Tr\u1ecb Thi\u00ean was once again separated into three provinces as it had been before. \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi then became the capital of Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh province.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\n[[File:Donghoi3.jpg|250px|left|thumb|\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi seen from the air]]\n\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi is on the National Route 1A, North\u2013South Railway, and [[Ho Chi Minh Highway]], at the coordinates 17 21' N and 106 10\u2019 E.

[[Nh\u1eadt L\u1ec7 River]] is the only river that runs through the city. [[B\u00e0u Tr\u00f3|Tro Lake]] is the source of fresh water. The [[Nh\u1eadt L\u1ec7 Beach]] is endowed with fine and white sand.<ref name=\"quangbinh\"/>\n\n===Transportation===\nThere are many ways to get to Dong Hoi from Hue, such as local bus at Hue North Bus Station. There are taxis from city center bus station (6&nbsp;km). The bus fare is around $8. It takes 3.5 hours to drive to Dong Hoi/Quang Binh Town.\n\n==Climate==\nLike all provinces in north and north central of Vietnam, there are four distinct seasons in \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi. In the spring, it is cool, humid and foggy. The average annual temperature is 24.5C, average rainfall varies from 1,300 to 4,000&nbsp;mm, total sunshine hours per year is 1,856 hours, average annual moisture is around 83%. The city has monsoon climate with three types of wind: south-east (gi\u00f3 n\u1ed3m), south-west (gi\u00f3 L\u00e0o), and north-east.\n\nAlthough the city is by the sea, its climate is subject to drought in the summer. This is largely due to the dry south-west wind from [[Gulf of Thailand]] (this flow of wind is wet but when it passes to Vietnam, [[Annamite Range]] mountain range keeps its humidity to cause rains in Laos but drought in central Vietnam). It is rainy in the fall but the weather is comfortable with the temperature around 26 to 31 degrees Celsius. In the winter, due to the north-east wind blowing from the [[China|Chinese]] mainland, the temperature may go down below 18 degrees Celsius, and there may be slight rain. The highest precipitation gets highest level in October (671&nbsp;mm), compared to just 42&nbsp;mm in March.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|location = \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi\n|Jan high C = 21.7\n|Feb high C = 22.0\n|Mar high C = 24.8\n|Apr high C = 28.5\n|May high C = 32.2\n|Jun high C = 33.7\n|Jul high C = 33.9\n|Aug high C = 33.1\n|Sep high C = 30.7\n|Oct high C = 28.0\n|Nov high C = 25.2\n|Dec high C = 22.5\n|year high C = 28.0\n|Jan mean C = 18.9\n|Feb mean C = 19.3\n|Mar mean C = 21.6\n|Apr mean C = 24.7\n|May mean C = 28.0\n|Jun mean C = 29.6\n|Jul mean C = 29.7\n|Aug mean C = 28.9\n|Sep mean C = 27.0\n|Oct mean C = 24.9\n|Nov mean C = 22.3\n|Dec mean C = 19.6\n|year mean C = 24.5\n|Jan low C = 16.6\n|Feb low C = 17.4\n|Mar low C = 19.5\n|Apr low C = 22.2\n|May low C = 24.7\n|Jun low C = 26.5\n|Jul low C = 26.5\n|Aug low C = 25.9\n|Sep low C = 24.1\n|Oct low C = 22.4\n|Nov low C = 20.0\n|Dec low C = 17.4\n|year low C = 21.9\n|Jan record high C = 34.7 |Jan record low C = 7.7\n|Feb record high C = 37.2 |Feb record low C = 8.0\n|Mar record high C = 39.8 |Mar record low C = 8.0\n|Apr record high C = 41.2 |Apr record low C = 11.7\n|May record high C = 42.2 |May record low C = 15.1\n|Jun record high C = 41.8 |Jun record low C = 19.2\n|Jul record high C = 40.9 |Jul record low C = 20.5\n|Aug record high C = 41.5 |Aug record low C = 19.9\n|Sep record high C = 40.9 |Sep record low C = 17.8\n|Oct record high C = 39.6 |Oct record low C = 14.6\n|Nov record high C = 38.1 |Nov record low C = 12.0\n|Dec record high C = 29.6 |Dec record low C = 7.8\n|year record high C = 42.2  |year record low C = 7.7 \n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 57\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44\n|Mar precipitation mm = 42\n|Apr precipitation mm = 55\n|May precipitation mm = 112\n|Jun precipitation mm = 86\n|Jul precipitation mm = 74\n|Aug precipitation mm = 160\n|Sep precipitation mm = 463\n|Oct precipitation mm = 671\n|Nov precipitation mm = 349\n|Dec precipitation mm = 127\n|year precipitation mm = 2240\n|Jan precipitation days = 11.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 11.6\n|Mar precipitation days = 11.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.5\n|May precipitation days = 10.3\n|Jun precipitation days = 7.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 6.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 10.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 15.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 19.5\n|Nov precipitation days = 17.8\n|Dec precipitation days = 14.0\n|year precipitation days = 146.5\n|Jan humidity = 87.3\n|Feb humidity = 89.5\n|Mar humidity = 89.3\n|Apr humidity = 87.0\n|May humidity = 79.5\n|Jun humidity = 72.7\n|Jul humidity = 69.7\n|Aug humidity = 74.6\n|Sep humidity = 83.4\n|Oct humidity = 86.2\n|Nov humidity = 85.4\n|Dec humidity = 85.6\n|year humidity = 82.5\n|Jan sun = 101\n|Feb sun = 73\n|Mar sun = 112\n|Apr sun = 168\n|May sun = 234\n|Jun sun = 222\n|Jul sun = 247\n|Aug sun = 202\n|Sep sun = 176\n|Oct sun = 138\n|Nov sun = 99\n|Dec sun = 84\n|year sun = 1857\n|source 1 = Vietnam Institute for Building Science and Technology<ref name=IBST>{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180722172120/http://ibst.vn/DATA/nhyen/QCVN%2002-2009%20BXD%20So%20lieu%20tu%20nhien.pdf\n| archivedate = 22 July 2018\n| url = http://ibst.vn/DATA/nhyen/QCVN%2002-2009%20BXD%20So%20lieu%20tu%20nhien.pdf\n| title = Vietnam Building Code Natural Physical & Climatic Data for Construction\n| publisher = Vietnam Institute for Building Science and Technology\n| accessdate = 31 July 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n===Topography and geology===\nThe city has diverse topographical and geological features, including hill, mountainous, half mountainous, coastal plains and coastal sand dunes.\n\nThe hilly region is in the west, stretching from north to south (in parts of communes: Dong Son, Thuan Duc) with an average elevation of 12\u201315 m, with total area of 64.93&nbsp;km\u00b2, 41.7% of the city total area.

She concluded that the [[Hoabinhian|H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh culture]] existed in this region. Through C14 testing, the artifacts dated back to 10,509 (plus or minus 950) ago. From Quy \u0110\u1ea1t township ([[Tuy\u00ean H\u00f3a District]]) to south-west about 150 m, the Hum grotto contains many stone tools and animal stones from an ancient human community. Inside Khai grotto near the Quy \u0110\u1ea1t township, similar artifacts were found, including ceramics from [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]]. Additionally, artifacts of the Stone Age were unearthed in grottoes in the Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh region. Owners of these artifacts lived in the caves and grottoes and hunted for their food.<ref name=\"nuocnonhuyendieu\"/>\n\nHuman settlement in \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi can be traced 5,000 years back. Many relics and remnants have been found in Bau Tro, a lake in the city, most of which date to the [[Stone Age]]. Around  2880 BC, the site of modern \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was a territory of the Viet Thuong tribe of [[V\u0103n Lang]] during the reign of king [[H\u00f9ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]. The site was a long-disputed territory between the [[Champa|Champa kingdom]] and [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]. It officially became \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t territory in 1069 after [[L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t]] took victory over Champa as a result of the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t-Champa War (1069).\n\nThe area ceased to be the southernmost of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t following the political marriage of the [[Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty]] princess, [[Huy\u1ec1n Tr\u00e2n]], to Champa king, [[Jaya Sinhavarman III]] (Vietnamese: ''Ch\u1ebf M\u00e2n''). Princess Huy\u1ec1n Tr\u00e2n was king [[Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]]'s daughter and king Tr\u1ea7n Anh T\u00f4ng's younger sister. Political matches made to acquire land was a traditional practice by Champa kings. Thanks to this marriage, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t acquired lands (as dowry) of what is now [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]] and [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf Province]] (provinces which were then known respectively as Chau O and Chau Ri or Chau Ly).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/25734/h/history10.html |title=Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303100535/http://library.thinkquest.org/25734/h/history10.html |archive-date=2008-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Kingdom of Champa|url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/549713|publisher=ancientworld|accessdate=2008-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511081540/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/549713|archive-date=2011-05-11|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the time of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War]] (1558\u20131775), Vietnam was divided into two countries: Dang Trong (South) and Dang Ngoai (North) with the [[Gianh River]] as frontier line. \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was an important fortress of the southern [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]]. The \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi Wall (Vietnamese: ''Th\u00e0nh \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi'') was considered the barrier that protected the Nguy\u1ec5n lords from the attack by the northern [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh]] family.\n\nDuring the [[First Indochina War]] (between the French and the [[Viet Minh]] in the 1950s), the \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi airbase was used by the French to attack the Viet Minh in north-central Vietnam and the Laotian [[Pathet Lao]] army in central and southern Laos. During the [[Vietnam War]], \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi was heavily devastated by bombardments from United States [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bombers]] due to its location near the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]] and the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/580550522.html?dids=580550522:580550522&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Feb+08%2C+1965&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=U.+S.+Hits+Dong+Hoi+Again%2C+Russ+Say&pqatl=google U.

The [[Tam T\u00f2a Church]], a Catholic cathedral, was severely damaged. Today the bell tower remains near the town center as a monument.[[File:TamToa.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Ruins of [[Tam T\u00f2a Church]].]]\n\nOn 19 April 1972, during a major North Vietnam offensive, a task force of four US ships were sailing off the coast of Vietnam \u2014 {{USS|Oklahoma City|CLG-5|6}}, {{USS|Sterett|CG-31|6}}, {{USS|Lloyd Thomas|DD-764|6}} and {{USS|Higbee|DD-806|6}}. They were attacked by three North Vietnamese MiG aircraft in the [[Battle of \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi]]. In an attempt to surprise the task force, the MiGs came in low, described as \"getting their feet wet.\" Despite the official stories, they did not surprise the task force, which had spotted them long before engagement range and were ready to shoot. Two ships, ''Oklahoma City'' and ''Sterett'', had anti-aircraft missiles, while ''Higbee'' and ''Lloyd Thomas'' were armed with dual purpose {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns. All ships were at battle stations.\n\nThis city is the narrowest land of Vietnam (around 40&nbsp;km from the east to the west). After the [[fall of Saigon]] on 30 April 1975, Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh province was merged into B\u00ecnh Tr\u1ecb Thi\u00ean province (B\u00ecnh Tr\u1ecb Thi\u00ean is the abbreviation of Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh, Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb, and Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean provinces). In 1990, B\u00ecnh Tr\u1ecb Thi\u00ean was once again separated into three provinces as it had been before. \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi then became the capital of Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh province.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\n[[File:Donghoi3.jpg|250px|left|thumb|\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi seen from the air]]\n\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi is on the National Route 1A, North\u2013South Railway, and [[Ho Chi Minh Highway]], at the coordinates 17 21' N and 106 10\u2019 E. This city is in the heart of Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province. It borders [[B\u1ed1 Tr\u1ea1ch]] on the north, [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh District|Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh]] on the south, the [[South China Sea]] on the east and [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh District|Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh]] on the west. It is 50&nbsp;km south of [[Phong Nha-K\u1ebb B\u00e0ng National Park]], 50&nbsp;km north of [[Bang Spa]], 180&nbsp;km south-east of Cha Lo border gate with Laos. It has a coastline of 12&nbsp;km. [[Nh\u1eadt L\u1ec7 River]] is the only river that runs through the city. [[B\u00e0u Tr\u00f3|Tro Lake]] is the source of fresh water. The [[Nh\u1eadt L\u1ec7 Beach]] is endowed with fine and white sand.<ref name=\"quangbinh\"/>\n\n===Transportation===\nThere are many ways to get to Dong Hoi from Hue, such as local bus at Hue North Bus Station. There are taxis from city center bus station (6&nbsp;km). The bus fare is around $8. It takes 3.5 hours to drive to Dong Hoi/Quang Binh Town.\n\n==Climate==\nLike all provinces in north and north central of Vietnam, there are four distinct seasons in \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi. In the spring, it is cool, humid and foggy. The average annual temperature is 24.5C, average rainfall varies from 1,300 to 4,000&nbsp;mm, total sunshine hours per year is 1,856 hours, average annual moisture is around 83%. The city has monsoon climate with three types of wind: south-east (gi\u00f3 n\u1ed3m), south-west (gi\u00f3 L\u00e0o), and north-east.\n\nAlthough the city is by the sea, its climate is subject to drought in the summer. This is largely due to the dry south-west wind from [[Gulf of Thailand]] (this flow of wind is wet but when it passes to Vietnam, [[Annamite Range]] mountain range keeps its humidity to cause rains in Laos but drought in central Vietnam). It is rainy in the fall but the weather is comfortable with the temperature around 26 to 31 degrees Celsius. In the winter, due to the north-east wind blowing from the [[China|Chinese]] mainland, the temperature may go down below 18 degrees Celsius, and there may be slight rain. The highest precipitation gets highest level in October (671&nbsp;mm), compared to just 42&nbsp;mm in March.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=y\n|single line=y \n|location = \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi\n|Jan high C = 21.7\n|Feb high C = 22.0\n|Mar high C = 24.8\n|Apr high C = 28.5\n|May high C = 32.2\n|Jun high C = 33.7\n|Jul high C = 33.9\n|Aug high C = 33.1\n|Sep high C = 30.7\n|Oct high C = 28.0\n|Nov high C = 25.2\n|Dec high C = 22.5\n|year high C = 28.0\n|Jan mean C = 18.9\n|Feb mean C = 19.3\n|Mar mean C = 21.6\n|Apr mean C = 24.7\n|May mean C = 28.0\n|Jun mean C = 29.6\n|Jul mean C = 29.7\n|Aug mean C = 28.9\n|Sep mean C = 27.0\n|Oct mean C = 24.9\n|Nov mean C = 22.3\n|Dec mean C = 19.6\n|year mean C = 24.5\n|Jan low C = 16.6\n|Feb low C = 17.4\n|Mar low C = 19.5\n|Apr low C = 22.2\n|May low C = 24.7\n|Jun low C = 26.5\n|Jul low C = 26.5\n|Aug low C = 25.9\n|Sep low C = 24.1\n|Oct low C = 22.4\n|Nov low C = 20.0\n|Dec low C = 17.4\n|year low C = 21.9\n|Jan record high C = 34.7 |Jan record low C = 7.7\n|Feb record high C = 37.2 |Feb record low C = 8.0\n|Mar record high C = 39.8 |Mar record low C = 8.0\n|Apr record high C = 41.2 |Apr record low C = 11.7\n|May record high C = 42.2 |May record low C = 15.1\n|Jun record high C = 41.8 |Jun record low C = 19.2\n|Jul record high C = 40.9 |Jul record low C = 20.5\n|Aug record high C = 41.5 |Aug record low C = 19.9\n|Sep record high C = 40.9 |Sep record low C = 17.8\n|Oct record high C = 39.6 |Oct record low C = 14.6\n|Nov record high C = 38.1 |Nov record low C = 12.0\n|Dec record high C = 29.6 |Dec record low C = 7.8\n|year record high C = 42.2  |year record low C = 7.7 \n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 57\n|Feb precipitation mm = 44\n|Mar precipitation mm = 42\n|Apr precipitation mm = 55\n|May precipitation mm = 112\n|Jun precipitation mm = 86\n|Jul precipitation mm = 74\n|Aug precipitation mm = 160\n|Sep precipitation mm = 463\n|Oct precipitation mm = 671\n|Nov precipitation mm = 349\n|Dec precipitation mm = 127\n|year precipitation mm = 2240\n|Jan precipitation days = 11.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 11.6\n|Mar precipitation days = 11.1\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.5\n|May precipitation days = 10.3\n|Jun precipitation days = 7.7\n|Jul precipitation days = 6.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 10.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 15.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 19.5\n|Nov precipitation days = 17.8\n|Dec precipitation days = 14.0\n|year precipitation days = 146.5\n|Jan humidity = 87.3\n|Feb humidity = 89.5\n|Mar humidity = 89.3\n|Apr humidity = 87.0\n|May humidity = 79.5\n|Jun humidity = 72.7\n|Jul humidity = 69.7\n|Aug humidity = 74.6\n|Sep humidity = 83.4\n|Oct humidity = 86.2\n|Nov humidity = 85.4\n|Dec humidity = 85.6\n|year humidity = 82.5\n|Jan sun = 101\n|Feb sun = 73\n|Mar sun = 112\n|Apr sun = 168\n|May sun = 234\n|Jun sun = 222\n|Jul sun = 247\n|Aug sun = 202\n|Sep sun = 176\n|Oct sun = 138\n|Nov sun = 99\n|Dec sun = 84\n|year sun = 1857\n|source 1 = Vietnam Institute for Building Science and Technology<ref name=IBST>{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180722172120/http://ibst.vn/DATA/nhyen/QCVN%2002-2009%20BXD%20So%20lieu%20tu%20nhien.pdf\n| archivedate = 22 July 2018\n| url = http://ibst.vn/DATA/nhyen/QCVN%2002-2009%20BXD%20So%20lieu%20tu%20nhien.pdf\n| title = Vietnam Building Code Natural Physical & Climatic Data for Construction\n| publisher = Vietnam Institute for Building Science and Technology\n| accessdate = 31 July 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n===Topography and geology===\nThe city has diverse topographical and geological features, including hill, mountainous, half mountainous, coastal plains and coastal sand dunes.\n\nThe hilly region is in the west, stretching from north to south (in parts of communes: Dong Son, Thuan Duc) with an average elevation of 12\u201315 m, with total area of 64.93&nbsp;km\u00b2, 41.7% of the city total area.

Two other professional musicians, violinist {{ill|Jean le Boulaire|fr|Jean Lanier}} and cellist [[\u00c9tienne Pasquier (cellist)|\u00c9tienne Pasquier]], were among his fellow prisoners, and after he managed to obtain some paper and a small pencil from a sympathetic guard ({{ill|Carl-Albert Br\u00fcll|de}}, 1902\u20131989), Messiaen wrote a short [[trio (music)|trio]] for them; this piece developed into the ''Quatuor'' for the same trio with himself at the piano. The combination of instruments was unusual at the time, but not without precedent: [[Walter Rabl]] had composed for it in 1896, as had [[Paul Hindemith]] in 1938.\n\nThe quartet was premiered at the camp, outdoors and in the rain, on 15 January 1941.

And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever ... that there should be time no longer: But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished ...</blockquote>\n\n==Structure==\nThe work is in eight [[Movement (music)|movements]]:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|\"Liturgie de cristal\" (Crystal [[liturgy]])\n|\"Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" ([[Vocalise]], for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\" (Abyss of birds)\n|\"Interm\u00e8de\" ([[Intermezzo|Interlude]])\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the eternity of Jesus)\n|\"Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\" (Dance of fury, for the seven trumpets)\n|\"Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" (Tangle of rainbows, for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the immortality of Jesus)\n}}\nBelow, quotations are translated from Messiaen's Preface to the score.\n\n===I. \"Liturgie de cristal\"===\nIn his preface to the score, Messiaen describes the opening of the quartet:\n\n{{quote|Between three and four in the morning, the awakening of birds: a solo blackbird or nightingale improvises, surrounded by a shimmer of sound, by a halo of trills lost very high in the trees. Transpose this onto a religious plane and you have the harmonious silence of Heaven.}}\nWritten for the full for the full quartet, the opening movement begins with the solo clarinet imitating a blackbird's song and the violin imitating a nightingale\u2019s song. The underlying pulse is provided by the cello and piano: the cello cycles through the same five-note melody (using the pitches C, E, D, F-sharp, and B-flat) and a repeating pattern of 15 durations. The piano part consists of a 17-note rhythmic pattern permuted strictly through 29 chords, as if to give the listener a glimpse of something eternal.\n\n===II. \"Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\"===\nAlso for the full quartet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|The first and third parts (very short) evoke the power of this mighty angel, a rainbow upon his head and clothed with a cloud, who sets one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth. In the middle section are the impalpable harmonies of heaven. In the piano, sweet cascades of blue-orange chords, enclosing in their distant chimes the almost plainchant song of the violin and cello.}}\n\n===III. \"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|The abyss is Time with its sadness, its weariness. The birds are the opposite to Time; they are our desire for light, for stars, for rainbows, and for jubilant songs.}}\nA solo for the clarinet, this movement is a test for even the most accomplished clarinetist, with an extremely slow tempo marking {{nowrap|1=[[quaver]] (eighth note) = [[Tempo#Measuring Tempo|44]]}}.\n\n===IV. \"Interm\u00e8de\"===\nA trio for for violin, cello, and clarinet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|Scherzo, of a more individual character than the other movements, but linked to them nevertheless by certain [[melodic]] recollections.}}\n\n===V. \"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, \"infinitely slow\", on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, \"whose time never runs out\". The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance.  \"In the beginning was the Word, and Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1 (King James Version))}}\nA duet for cello and piano, the music is arranged from an earlier composition, \"IV. L'Eau\" from \"[[F\u00eate des belles eaux]]\" for 6 [[Ondes Martenot]]s, performed at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]] of 1937.  The tempo marking is ''infiniment lent, extatique'' (\"infinitely slow, ecstatic\").\n\n===VI. \"Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\"===\n[[Image:Messiaen Quatuor Danse de fureur excerpt.jpg|thumb|right|450px|An excerpt from Movement VI (\"Danse de la fureur ...\"), which is played by all four instruments in [[unison]]. It shows Messiaen's use of additive rhythms, in which the underlying quaver beat (eighth notes) is sometimes [[augmentation (music)|augmented]] by a semiquaver (sixteenth note).]]\nMessiaen writes of this movement, which is for full quartet:\n\n{{quote|Rhythmically, the most characteristic piece of the series. The four instruments in unison imitate gongs and trumpets (the first six trumpets of the Apocalypse followed by various disasters, the trumpet of the seventh angel announcing consummation of the mystery of God) Use of added values, of augmented or diminished rhythms, of non-retrogradable rhythms. Music of stone, formidable granite sound; irresistible movement of steel, huge blocks of purple rage, icy drunkenness.  Hear especially all the terrible ''fortissimo'' of the augmentation of the theme and changes of register of its different notes, towards the end of the piece.}}\nToward the end of the movement the theme returns, ''fortissimo'', in augmentation and with wide changes of register.\n\n===VII. \"Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\"===\nMessiaen writes of this quartet movement:\n\n{{quote|Recurring here are certain passages from the second movement. The angel appears in full force, especially the rainbow that covers him (the rainbow, symbol of peace, wisdom, and all luminescent and sonorous vibration). \u2013 In my dreams, I hear and see ordered chords and melodies, known colors and shapes; then, after this transitional stage, I pass through the unreal and suffer, with ecstasy, a tournament; a roundabout compenetration of superhuman sounds and colors. These swords of fire, this blue-orange lava, these sudden stars: there is the tangle, there are the rainbows!}}\n===VIII. \"Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Large violin solo, counterpart to the violoncello solo of the 5th movement. Why this second eulogy? It is especially aimed at the second aspect of Jesus, Jesus the Man, the Word made flesh, immortally risen for our communication of his life. It is all love. Its slow ascent to the acutely extreme is the ascent of man to his god, the child of God to his Father, the being made divine towards Paradise.}}\nA duet for violin and piano, the music is an arrangement of the second part of his earlier [[Organ (music)|organ]] piece \"Diptyque\", transposed up a major third from C to E.\n\n==Derivative works==\nThe piece is the inspiration for ''[[Quartet for the End of Time (novel)|Quartet for the End of Time]]'', a 2014 novel by [[Johanna Skibsrud]] that borrows its title and structure from the piece.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Olivier Messiaen, ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps'' (score) (Paris: Durand)\n* Anthony Pople, ''Messiaen:  Quatuor pour la fin du temps'', Cambridge Music Handbooks (Cambridge University Press, 2003)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/messiaen/music/quatuor.html Nigel Simeone on Quatuor pour la fin du temps]\n* [http://www.entretemps.asso.fr/Nicolas/Textes/Messiaen.htm \"Sur le ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps''\"] \u2013 extensive analysis by Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas (in French).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216122341/http://www.oliviermessiaen.net/ Boston University Messiaen Project: performances, studies and information]\n* [http://www2.lawrence.edu/dept/it/musicguides/mq/ \"Quatuor pour la fin du temps\"] \u2013 Musical and Biblical Analysis from Lawrence University Freshman Studies curriculum\n* [http://issuu.com/cmac13/docs/music_for_the_end_of_time \"Music for the End of Time\"] \u2013 an appreciation by Michael R.

He was captured by the German army in June 1940 and imprisoned in [[Stalag VIII-A]], a prisoner-of-war camp in [[G\u00f6rlitz]], Germany (now [[Zgorzelec]], [[Poland]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of Messiaen|last=Dingle|first=Christopher|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-521-63547-0|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=68-70|via=}}</ref> While in transit to the camp, Messiaen showed the clarinetist [[Henri Akoka]], also a prisoner, the sketches for what would become ''Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux''. Two other professional musicians, violinist {{ill|Jean le Boulaire|fr|Jean Lanier}} and cellist [[\u00c9tienne Pasquier (cellist)|\u00c9tienne Pasquier]], were among his fellow prisoners, and after he managed to obtain some paper and a small pencil from a sympathetic guard ({{ill|Carl-Albert Br\u00fcll|de}}, 1902\u20131989), Messiaen wrote a short [[trio (music)|trio]] for them; this piece developed into the ''Quatuor'' for the same trio with himself at the piano. The combination of instruments was unusual at the time, but not without precedent: [[Walter Rabl]] had composed for it in 1896, as had [[Paul Hindemith]] in 1938.\n\nThe quartet was premiered at the camp, outdoors and in the rain, on 15 January 1941. The musicians had decrepit instruments and an audience of about 400 fellow prisoners and guards.<ref>Rebecca Rischin, ''For the End of Time: The Story of the Messiaen Quartet'' (Cornell University Press, 2003), 62</ref> The cello was bought with donations from camp members.<ref>{{Cite book|title=For the End of Time: The Story of the Messiaen Quartet|last=Rischin|first=Rebecca|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8014-7297-8|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=34|via=}}</ref> Messiaen later recalled: \"Never was I listened to with such rapt attention and comprehension.\"<ref>Joseph Stevenson, ''All Music Guide to Classical Music: The Definitive Guide to Classical Music'' (All Media Guide, 2005), 843</ref>\n\nBr\u00fcll provided paper and isolation for composing, and he also helped acquire the three other instruments. By forging papers with a stamp made from a potato, Br\u00fcll even helped the performers to be liberated shortly after the performance.  After the war, Br\u00fcll made a special trip to visit Messiaen, but was sent away and told the composer would not see him.<ref>Mostel, Raphael (9 May 2008).

Retrieved 18 April 2014</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nMessiaen wrote in the Preface to the score that the work was inspired by text from the [[Book of Revelation]] (Rev 10:1\u20132, 5\u20137, [[King James Version]]):\n<blockquote>And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire ... and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth .... And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever ... that there should be time no longer: But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished ...</blockquote>\n\n==Structure==\nThe work is in eight [[Movement (music)|movements]]:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|\"Liturgie de cristal\" (Crystal [[liturgy]])\n|\"Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" ([[Vocalise]], for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\" (Abyss of birds)\n|\"Interm\u00e8de\" ([[Intermezzo|Interlude]])\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the eternity of Jesus)\n|\"Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\" (Dance of fury, for the seven trumpets)\n|\"Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" (Tangle of rainbows, for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the immortality of Jesus)\n}}\nBelow, quotations are translated from Messiaen's Preface to the score.\n\n===Liturgie de cristal===\nIn his preface to the score, Messiaen describes the opening of the quartet:\n\n{{quote|Between three and four in the morning, the awakening of birds: a solo blackbird or nightingale improvises, surrounded by a shimmer of sound, by a halo of trills lost very high in the trees. Transpose this onto a religious plane and you have the harmonious silence of Heaven.}}\nWritten for the full for the full quartet, the opening movement begins with the solo clarinet imitating a blackbird's song and the violin imitating a nightingale\u2019s song. The underlying pulse is provided by the cello and piano: the cello cycles through the same five-note melody (using the pitches C, E, D, F-sharp, and B-flat) and a repeating pattern of 15 durations. The piano part consists of a 17-note rhythmic pattern permuted strictly through 29 chords, as if to give the listener a glimpse of something eternal.\n\n===Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps===\nAlso for the full quartet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|The first and third parts (very short) evoke the power of this mighty angel, a rainbow upon his head and clothed with a cloud, who sets one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth. In the middle section are the impalpable harmonies of heaven. In the piano, sweet cascades of blue-orange chords, enclosing in their distant chimes the almost plainchant song of the violin and cello.}}\n\n===Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|The abyss is Time with its sadness, its weariness. The birds are the opposite to Time; they are our desire for light, for stars, for rainbows, and for jubilant songs.}}\nA solo for the clarinet, this movement is a test for even the most accomplished clarinetist, with an extremely slow tempo marking {{nowrap|1=[[quaver]] (eighth note) = [[Tempo#Measuring Tempo|44]]}}.\n\n===Interm\u00e8de===\nA trio for for violin, cello, and clarinet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|Scherzo, of a more individual character than the other movements, but linked to them nevertheless by certain [[melodic]] recollections.}}\n\n===Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Jesus is considered here as the Word. A broad phrase, \"infinitely slow\", on the cello, magnifies with love and reverence the eternity of the Word, powerful and gentle, \"whose time never runs out\". The melody stretches majestically into a kind of gentle, regal distance.  \"In the beginning was the Word, and Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" ([[Gospel of John|John]] 1:1 (King James Version))}}\nA duet for cello and piano, the music is arranged from an earlier composition, \"IV. L'Eau\" from \"[[F\u00eate des belles eaux]]\" for 6 [[Ondes Martenot]]s, performed at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]] of 1937.  The tempo marking is ''infiniment lent, extatique'' (\"infinitely slow, ecstatic\").\n\n===Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes===\n[[Image:Messiaen Quatuor Danse de fureur excerpt.jpg|thumb|right|450px|An excerpt from Movement VI (\"Danse de la fureur ...\"), which is played by all four instruments in [[unison]]. It shows Messiaen's use of additive rhythms, in which the underlying quaver beat (eighth notes) is sometimes [[augmentation (music)|augmented]] by a semiquaver (sixteenth note).]]\nMessiaen writes of this movement, which is for full quartet:\n\n{{quote|Rhythmically, the most characteristic piece of the series. The four instruments in unison imitate gongs and trumpets (the first six trumpets of the Apocalypse followed by various disasters, the trumpet of the seventh angel announcing consummation of the mystery of God) Use of added values, of augmented or diminished rhythms, of non-retrogradable rhythms. Music of stone, formidable granite sound; irresistible movement of steel, huge blocks of purple rage, icy drunkenness.  Hear especially all the terrible ''fortissimo'' of the augmentation of the theme and changes of register of its different notes, towards the end of the piece.}}\nToward the end of the movement the theme returns, ''fortissimo'', in augmentation and with wide changes of register.\n\n===Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps===\nMessiaen writes of this quartet movement:\n\n{{quote|Recurring here are certain passages from the second movement. The angel appears in full force, especially the rainbow that covers him (the rainbow, symbol of peace, wisdom, and all luminescent and sonorous vibration). \u2013 In my dreams, I hear and see ordered chords and melodies, known colors and shapes; then, after this transitional stage, I pass through the unreal and suffer, with ecstasy, a tournament; a roundabout compenetration of superhuman sounds and colors. These swords of fire, this blue-orange lava, these sudden stars: there is the tangle, there are the rainbows!}}\n===Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Large violin solo, counterpart to the violoncello solo of the 5th movement. Why this second eulogy? It is especially aimed at the second aspect of Jesus, Jesus the Man, the Word made flesh, immortally risen for our communication of his life. It is all love. Its slow ascent to the acutely extreme is the ascent of man to his god, the child of God to his Father, the being made divine towards Paradise.}}\nA duet for violin and piano, the music is an arrangement of the second part of his earlier [[Organ (music)|organ]] piece \"Diptyque\", transposed up a major third from C to E.\n\n==Derivative works==\nThe piece is the inspiration for ''[[Quartet for the End of Time (novel)|Quartet for the End of Time]]'', a 2014 novel by [[Johanna Skibsrud]] that borrows its title and structure from the piece.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Olivier Messiaen, ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps'' (score) (Paris: Durand)\n* Anthony Pople, ''Messiaen:  Quatuor pour la fin du temps'', Cambridge Music Handbooks (Cambridge University Press, 2003)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.philharmonia.co.uk/messiaen/music/quatuor.html Nigel Simeone on Quatuor pour la fin du temps]\n* [http://www.entretemps.asso.fr/Nicolas/Textes/Messiaen.htm \"Sur le ''Quatuor pour la fin du temps''\"] \u2013 extensive analysis by Fran\u00e7ois Nicolas (in French).\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216122341/http://www.oliviermessiaen.net/ Boston University Messiaen Project: performances, studies and information]\n* [http://www2.lawrence.edu/dept/it/musicguides/mq/ \"Quatuor pour la fin du temps\"] \u2013 Musical and Biblical Analysis from Lawrence University Freshman Studies curriculum\n* [http://issuu.com/cmac13/docs/music_for_the_end_of_time \"Music for the End of Time\"] \u2013 an appreciation by Michael R.
