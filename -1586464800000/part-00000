The album features production by Bad Boy founder [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]], [[Easy Mo Bee]], [[Chucky Thompson]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Lord Finesse]], among others. It was recorded from 1993 to 1994 at [[The Hit Factory]] and [[D&D Studios]] in [[New York City]]. The partly autobiographical album tells the story of the rapper's experiences as a young criminal, and was the only studio album released during his lifetime, as he was murdered sixteen days before the release of his second album ''[[Life After Death]]'' in 1997.\n\n''Ready to Die'' peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was subject to critical acclaim and soon a commercial success. Three singles were released from the album: \"[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]\", \"[[Big Poppa]]\", \"[[One More Chance (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|One More Chance]]\" and a promotional track of Biggie: \"[[Warning (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Warning]]\". \"Juicy\", the lead single, peaked at number 27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 14 on [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] and reached number 3 on the [[Hot Rap Singles]].<ref name=\"AMG-Singles\" /> \"Big Poppa\" was a hit on multiple charts, peaking at number six on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and also being nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance]] at the [[1996 Grammy Awards]]. The Notorious B.I.G.'s lyrics on the album were generally praised by critics, with many praising his story-telling ability.\n\nIn April 2018, ''Ready to Die'' was certified [[RIAA certification|6 \u00d7 Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album was significant for revitalizing the [[East Coast hip hop]] scene, amid [[West Coast hip hop]]'s commercial dominance,<ref name=\"AMG-Bio\">Steve Huey.

In 1994, Biggie was 21 years old when he recorded the album. In 1992, Biggie was signed to the [[Uptown Records]] label by [[A&R]] [[Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]. Biggie started recording his debut album in 1993 in New York, after making numerous guest appearances among his label-mates' singles around that time. The first tracks recorded include the album's darker, less radio-friendly content (including \"Ready to Die,\" \"Gimme the Loot\" and \"Things Done Changed\"). In these sessions, ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' magazine describe an \"inexperienced, higher-pitched\" Biggie sounding \"hungry and paranoid\".<ref name=xxl />\n\nWhen executive producer [[Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]] was fired from Uptown, Biggie's career hung in limbo, as the album was only partially completed.

The album features production by Bad Boy founder [[Sean Combs|Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]], [[Easy Mo Bee]], [[Chucky Thompson]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Lord Finesse]], among others. It was recorded from 1993 to 1994 at [[The Hit Factory]] and [[D&D Studios]] in [[New York City]]. The partly autobiographical album tells the story of the rapper's experiences as a young criminal, and was the only studio album released during his lifetime, as he was murdered sixteen days before the release of his second album ''[[Life After Death]]'' in 1997.\n\n''Ready to Die'' peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was subject to critical acclaim and soon a commercial success. Three singles were released from the album: \"[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]\", \"[[Big Poppa]]\", \"[[One More Chance (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|One More Chance]]\" and a promotional track of Biggie: \"[[Warning (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Warning]]\". \"Juicy\", the lead single, peaked at number 27 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 14 on [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks]] and reached number 3 on the [[Hot Rap Singles]].<ref name=\"AMG-Singles\" /> \"Big Poppa\" was a hit on multiple charts, peaking at number six on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and also being nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance]] at the [[1996 Grammy Awards]]. The Notorious B.I.G.'s lyrics on the album were generally praised by critics, with many praising his story-telling ability.\n\nIn April 2018, ''Ready to Die'' was certified [[RIAA certification|6x Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album was significant for revitalizing the [[East Coast hip hop]] scene, amid [[West Coast hip hop]]'s commercial dominance,<ref name=\"AMG-Bio\">Steve Huey. [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p44889|pure_url=yes}} The Notorious B.I.G. > Biography]. AllMusic. Retrieved March 17, 2007</ref> and has been ranked by many critics as one of the greatest hip hop albums, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it number 134 on its list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref name=\":0\" /> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included it on its list of the All-TIME 100 Albums.\n\n==Background and recording==\nThe album was recorded in [[New York City]] (mainly at [[The Hit Factory]]) in two stages between 1993 and 1994. In 1994, Biggie was 21 years old when he recorded the album. In 1992, Biggie was signed to the [[Uptown Records]] label by [[A&R]] [[Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]]. Biggie started recording his debut album in 1993 in New York, after making numerous guest appearances among his label-mates' singles around that time. The first tracks recorded include the album's darker, less radio-friendly content (including \"Ready to Die,\" \"Gimme the Loot\" and \"Things Done Changed\"). In these sessions, ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' magazine describe an \"inexperienced, higher-pitched\" Biggie sounding \"hungry and paranoid\".<ref name=xxl />\n\nWhen executive producer [[Sean \"Puffy\" Combs]] was fired from Uptown, Biggie's career hung in limbo, as the album was only partially completed. After a brief period [[Illicit drug trade|dealing drugs]] in [[North Carolina]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menconi |first1=David |title=Notorious B.I.G.'s Raleigh days, revisited |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/on-the-beat-blog/article137454708.html |website=newsobserver |language=en |date=January 25, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423173943/http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/on-the-beat-blog/article137454708.html |archivedate=April 23, 2017 }}</ref> Biggie returned to the studio the following year on Combs' new [[Bad Boy Records]] label possessing \"a smoother, more confident vocal tone\" and completed the album.

A typical introduction to his videos is \"Greetings, children, Captain Disillusion here.\" Secondly, he goes on to show a popular video, often a paranormal or viral video which is 'too good to be true.' (He sometimes even uses humorous topics at the beginning of his videos to get people into the mood and then uses his wristband to lead him to talk about the real topic.) Thirdly, he reviews the footage, utilizing his expertise in digital editing, to 'break down' the video and show how the end result was accomplished. He also likes to recreate effects from the videos he debunks, often incorporating this into episodes.<ref name=skepticzone2017>{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |title=The Skeptic Zone #477 |publisher=[[The Skeptic Zone]] |date=10 December 2017 |host=Richard Saunders |accessdate=1 February 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131428/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |archivedate=17 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nHe ends each video with his motto: \"Love with your heart.

He notes that [[Penn & Teller]] were instrumental to his current interest and eventually found the skeptical movement involved in similar work. He finds that his followers like to learn about the illusions. It is not his intent to spoil legitimate entertainment or spoil a current performers work. His intent in showing how video illusions are created is to clear up misconceptions. Melikdjanian describes the basis for Openfilm.com briefly, saying it \"was formed for film makers. The goal is to provide higher quality product and a group of serious content creators.\"\n\nDuring an interview for ''[[The Skeptic Zone]]'', in 2010, he describes Captain Disillusion as a superhero.<ref name=\"Skeptic Zone 2010\"/> and in a following 2011 interview, he describes his work as Captain Disillusion is done \"in the maximum fun way possible\".<ref>{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-146-29-aug-2011 |title=The Skeptic Zone #146 |publisher=[[The Skeptic Zone]] |date=August 6, 2011 |host=Richard Saunders |accessdate=January 24, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220124427/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-146-29-aug-2011 |archivedate=February 20, 2014 }}</ref> He describes his work with [[James Randi]], Randi calling him to participate in The Amaz!ng Meeting and his video work with Randi in a later project.

I'm sure that can be done with many other fields in different ways.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_man_behind_the_makeup_an_interview_with_captain_disillusion|title=The Man Behind the Makeup: An Interview with Captain Disillusion \u2013 CSI|last=Gerbic|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|date=July 18, 2016|website=www.csicop.org|publisher=Skeptical Inquirer|access-date=July 20, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719140429/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_man_behind_the_makeup_an_interview_with_captain_disillusion|archivedate=July 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2017 interview with [[Richard Saunders (skeptic)|Richard Saunders]] from The Skeptic Zone, he said, when talking about the video effects editing process that \"You know, the tools change but the methods really don't. It's all about making things look questionable and kinda crappy and low quality and then you can pretty much get away with anything\". In replying to a follow up question regarding believing what you see on the internet he said \"When I started out, people just kinda believed everything, it was like shooting fish in a barrel, but these days people are just really asking me \"is this fake?\", \"is this fake?\", \"is this fake?\" and half the stuff they show me is just you know, a juggler juggling a lot of balls. They can't conceive that that could be real, people just don't believe anything anymore. I guess that's good for me because I get to explain lots of stuff but I wish people could finally strike that balance where they're not too credulous but they also know not to just dismiss everything out of hand\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Saunders|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Saunders (skeptic)|title=The Skeptic Zone #477 - 10.Dec.2017|url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017|publisher=The Skeptic Zone|format=Podcast|accessdate=17 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417062715/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017|archivedate=17 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Credits==\n\n===Filmography===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1984\n| ''Shutki v storonu''\n| actor\n| Russian for ''Jokes Aside'' (scenes deleted)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 2001\n| ''The Realm''\n| director, composer\n| \n|-\n| ''The Monster Man''\n| editor\n|\n|-\n| ''Zelimo''\n| animator\n| Directed by Aleks Rosenberg,<br>Won\u2014WorldFest-Houston Gold Special Jury Award for Best Feature\n|-\n| 2002\n| ''Sin neudachnika''\n| editor<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Cast & Crew of Sin neudachnika|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791647/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|website=IMDB|accessdate=February 18, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706145526/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791647/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|archivedate=July 6, 2018}}</ref>\n| Russian for ''Son of a Loser'' (Television film)\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Citizen Mavzik]]''\n| director, writer, editor, composer\n| (DVD) Co-written with father, Vilen.

A typical introduction to his videos is \"Greetings, children, Captain Disillusion here.\" Secondly, he goes on to show a popular video, often a paranormal or viral video which is 'too good to be true.' (He sometimes even uses humorous topics at the beginning of his videos to get people into the mood and then uses his wristband to lead him to talk about the real topic.) Thirdly, he reviews the footage, utilizing his expertise in digital editing, to 'break down' the video and show how the end result was accomplished. He also likes to recreate effects from the videos he debunks, often incorporating this into episodes.<ref name=skepticzone2017>{{cite podcast |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |title=The Skeptic Zone #477 |publisher=[[The Skeptic Zone]] |date=10 December 2017 |host=Richard Saunders |accessdate=1 February 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131428/http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the-skeptic-zone-477-10dec2017 |archivedate=17 January 2018 }}</ref>\n\nHe ends each video with his motto: \"Love with your heart.

Written while her husband was terminally ill, and partly for his benefit, the novel offers a satirical version of the [[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972\u20131981)|''1972 Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition'']] at the [[British Museum]], and pokes fun at museum politics, academic scholars, and Cold War spying.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn January 1973,{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=240}} London, the Museum is exhibiting for the first time anywhere the golden [[Garamantes|Garamantian]] treasures, on loan from the Garamantian government, that had been discovered years earlier by the eminent archaeologist Sir William Simpkin. Sir William, wealthy and now elderly, is retained by the Museum as a figurehead, largely because the Museum\u2019s director, Sir John Allison, expects to receive a large bequest on the old man's death. Huge crowds queue for hours for a brief glimpse under poor lighting of the two most famous exhibits: the Golden Child and the Ball of Golden Twine. Rumours circulate that the Child is cursed.\n\nSir William shows little interest in the exhibition, but he does ask to take a closer look at one of the many [[clay tablet]]s that accompany the treasures. Late at night, while returning the tablet to its case at Sir William\u2019s request, a Junior Exhibition Officer, Waring Smith, is attacked and partly strangled, apparently with the Golden Twine.\n\nWhen the German Garamantologist Professor Untermensch tells the Director that all the artefacts in the exhibition are fakes, Sir John decides that a second opinion is needed.&nbsp; This has to be obtained covertly because of the political sensitivities of the government loan, and he dispatches Smith to Moscow, along with one of the lesser treasures, to get the opinion of the word-famous Russian Garamantologist Professor Semyonov. The Director expects that no one will be suspicious of Smith because of his lowly position. Untermensch, however, thinks that the Soviets will assume he is a spy, and he shadows him. The Soviets do indeed make that assumption and - to show that they know the game the British are playing - they allow Smith and Untermensch into the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] to view the real Garamantian treasure. Smith discovers that there is no such person as Semyonov.\n\nSmith returns, demoralised, and is temporarily detained on his arrival by a man from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] who wants to know what his business was in Russia. Trying to explain himself, he invokes Sir William whom he expects will clarify his trip - only to learn that Sir William has been found dead, trapped between two sliding steel shelf units in the Museum library. A warder, Jones, is also later found dead: he has fallen from a fifth story window.\n\nLen Coker, a Museum technician, reveals that the tablet Smith took back to its case was a fake that he had made himself on Sir William\u2019s instructions. Untermensch decodes the Garamantian characters to reveal Sir William\u2019s message: that he revokes his bequest to Sir John Allison. Accused of murder, Sir John pulls a gun and flees. Cornered, he shoots himself and crashes down on the exhibits, revealing them for the fakes they truly are. The staff patch up the exhibits so that they look convincing in the dim light, just in time for the evening opening.\n\n== Principal characters ==\n\n* Sir William Simpkin: elderly archaeologist, discoverer of the Golden Child\n* Sir John Allison: Museum Director\n* Marcus Hawthorne-Mannering: Keeper of Funerary Art\n* Waring Smith: Junior Exhibition Officer\n* Professor Heinrich Untermensch: German Garamantologist\n* Dr Tite-Live Rochegrosse-Bergson (Schwarz): French cultural anthropologist\n* Professor Cyril Ivanovitch Semyonov: Supposed Russian Garamantologist\n* Jones Jones: Warder, unofficial retainer to Sir William\n* Len Coker: Technician, Conservation and Technical Services Department.\n* Dousha Vartarian: Secretary to Sir William Simpkin\n* Miss Rank: Secretary to Sir John Allison.\n\n== Background ==\n\nFitzgerald wrote the novel to amuse her husband, who was terminally ill with [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]].{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=235}} She had also wanted to deal with the annoyance she had felt when visiting [[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972\u20131981)|''The Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition'']] at the [[British Museum]] in 1972 (having speculated that everything in it was a forgery), and also to write about someone who had been unpleasant to her when she was visiting museums to research her book on [[Edward Burne-Jones|Burne-Jones]].{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=235}}\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s original manuscript for the novel - to be called ''The Golden Opinion'' - was much longer than the published version.{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=240}} It included chapters on the continuing cover-up of the fraud, as well as scenes in which the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]] discusses the possibility of public disorder sparked by the fake exhibition. The publisher told her that they needed to be cut, along with the entirety of a sub-plot and several additional characters.{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | pp=240, 244-247}}\n \nFitzgerald's publisher suggested that she should write more novels featuring Professor Untermensch as a recurring detective.{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=250}} She did indeed start work on two Untermensch thrillers{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=250}} but in the end thought it best not to be typecast.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=Penelope|date=September 24, 1994|title=Second Thoughts: Art critic without a clue: Penelope Fitzgerald on the brush with crime that made her decide to go straight|page=Books 27|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n[[H.

Written while her husband was terminally ill, and partly for his benefit, the novel offers a satirical version of the [[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972\u20131981)|''1972 Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition'']] at the [[British Museum]], and pokes fun at museum politics, academic scholars, and Cold War spying.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn January 1973,{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=240}} London, the Museum is exhibiting for the first time anywhere the golden [[Garamantes|Garamantian]] treasures, on loan from the Garamantian government, that had been discovered years earlier by the eminent archaeologist Sir William Simpkin. Sir William, wealthy and now elderly, is retained by the Museum as a figurehead, largely because the Museum\u2019s director, Sir John Allison, expects to receive a large bequest on the old man's death. Huge crowds queue for hours for a brief glimpse under poor lighting of the two most famous exhibits: the Golden Child and the Ball of Golden Twine. Rumours circulate that the Child is cursed.\n\nSir William shows little interest in the exhibition, but he does ask to take a closer look at one of the many [[clay tablet]]s that accompany the treasures. Late at night, while returning the tablet to its case at Sir William\u2019s request, a Junior Exhibition Officer, Waring Smith, is attacked and partly strangled, apparently with the Golden Twine.\n\nWhen the German Garamantologist Professor Untermensch tells the Director that all the artefacts in the exhibition are fakes, Sir John decides that a second opinion is needed.&nbsp; This has to be obtained covertly because of the political sensitivities of the government loan, and he dispatches Smith to Moscow, along with one of the lesser treasures, to get the opinion of the word-famous Russian Garamantologist Professor Semyonov. The Director expects that no one will be suspicious of Smith because of his lowly position. Untermensch, however, thinks that the Soviets will assume he is a spy, and he shadows him. The Soviets do indeed make that assumption and - to show that they know the game the British are playing - they allow Smith and Untermensch into the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] to view the real Garamantian treasure. Smith discovers that there is no such person as Semyonov.\n\nSmith returns, demoralised, and is temporarily detained on his arrival by a man from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] who wants to know what his business was in Russia. Trying to explain himself, he invokes Sir William whom he expects will clarify his trip - only to learn that Sir William has been found dead, trapped between two sliding steel shelf units in the Museum library. A warder, Jones, is also later found dead: he has fallen from a fifth story window.\n\nLen Coker, a Museum technician, reveals that the tablet Smith took back to its case was a fake that he had made himself on Sir William\u2019s instructions. Untermensch decodes the Garamantian characters to reveal Sir William\u2019s message: that he revokes his bequest to Sir John Allison. Accused of murder, Sir John pulls a gun and flees. Cornered, he shoots himself and crashes down on the exhibits, revealing them for the fakes they truly are. The staff patch up the exhibits so that they look convincing in the dim light, just in time for the evening opening.\n\n== Principal characters ==\n\n* Sir William Simpkin: elderly archaeologist, discoverer of the Golden Child\n* Sir John Allison: Museum Director\n* Marcus Hawthorne-Mannering: Keeper of Funerary Art\n* Waring Smith: Junior Exhibition Officer\n* Professor Heinrich Untermensch: German Garamantologist\n* Dr Tite-Live Rochegrosse-Bergson (Schwarz): French cultural anthropologist\n* Professor Cyril Ivanovitch Semyonov: Supposed Russian Garamantologist\n* Jones Jones: Warder, unofficial retainer to Sir William\n* Len Coker: Technician, Conservation and Technical Services Department.\n* Dousha Vartarian: Secretary to Sir William Simpkin\n* Miss Rank: Secretary to Sir John Allison.\n\n== Background ==\n\nFitzgerald wrote the novel to amuse her husband, who was terminally ill with [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]].{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=235}} She had also wanted to deal with the annoyance she had felt when visiting [[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972\u20131981)|''The Treasures of Tutankhamun exhibition'']] at the [[British Museum]] in 1972 (having speculated that everything in it was a forgery), and also to write about someone who had been unpleasant to her when she was visiting museums to research her book on [[Edward Burne-Jones|Burne-Jones]].{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=235}}\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s original manuscript for the novel - to be called ''The Golden Opinion'' - was much longer than the published version.{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=240}} It included chapters on the continuing cover-up of the fraud, as well as scenes in which the [[Cabinet Secretary (United Kingdom)|Cabinet Secretary]] discusses the possibility of public disorder sparked by the fake exhibition. The publisher told her that they needed to be cut, along with the entirety of an sub-plot and several additional characters.{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | pp=240, 244-247}}\n \nFitzgerald's publisher suggested that she should write more novels featuring Professor Untermensch as a recurring detective.{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=250}} She did indeed start work on two Untermensch thrillers{{sfn | Lee | 2013 | p=250}} but in the end thought it best not to be typecast.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=Penelope|date=September 24, 1994|title=Second Thoughts: Art critic without a clue: Penelope Fitzgerald on the brush with crime that made her decide to go straight|page=Books 27|work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n[[H.

He landed his first film role in a bit part in ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Paul Newman]]. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films ''[[Never Love a Stranger]]'', ''[[The Blob]]'' (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and ''[[The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery]]''.\n\nMcQueen's first breakout role came on television. He appeared on [[Dale Robertson]]'s [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'' as Bill Longley. Elkins, then McQueen's manager, successfully lobbied [[Vincent M. Fennelly]], producer of the western series ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', to have McQueen read for the part of [[bounty hunter]] Josh Randall in a ''Trackdown'' episode. McQueen appeared as Randall in the episode, cast opposite series lead and old New York motorcycle racing buddy [[Robert Culp]]. McQueen then filmed the pilot episode, which became the series titled ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', which aired on [[CBS]] in September 1958.\n\n===The 1960s===\n[[File:Steve McQueen Virginia Gregg Wanted Dead or Alive 1959.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Virginia Gregg]] with McQueen in ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', 1959]]\n\nIn the interviews in the DVD release of ''Wanted'', ''Trackdown'' star Robert Culp claims credit for bringing McQueen to Hollywood and landing him the part of Randall. He said he taught McQueen the \"art of the fast-draw,\u201d adding that, on the second day of filming, McQueen beat him. McQueen became a household name as a result of this series.<ref name=\"terrillx1x\"/> Randall's special holster held a [[Sawed-off shotgun|sawed-off]] .44\u201340 [[Winchester rifle]] nicknamed the \"[[Mare's Leg]]\" instead of the [[Six Gun|six-gun]] carried by the typical Western character, although the cartridges in the gunbelt were dummy .45\u201370, chosen because they \"looked tougher,\" Coupled with the generally negative image of the bounty hunter (noted in the three-part DVD special on the background of the series) this added to the [[anti-hero]] image infused with mystery and detachment that made this show stand out from the typical TV Western. The 94 episodes that ran from 1958 until early 1961 kept McQueen steadily employed, and he became a fixture at the renowned [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]], where much of the outdoor action for ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'' was shot.\n\nAt 29, McQueen got a significant break when [[Frank Sinatra]] removed [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], from the film ''[[Never So Few]]'' after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor got plenty of closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen's character, Bill Ringa, was never more comfortable than when driving at high speed \u2014in this case in a [[jeep]]\u2014 or handling a [[switchblade]] or a [[Thompson submachine gun|tommy gun]].\n\nAfter ''Never So Few'', the film's director [[John Sturges]] cast McQueen in his next movie, promising to \"give him the camera.\u201d ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' ([[1960 in film|1960]]), in which he played Vin Tanner and co-starred with [[Yul Brynner]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[James Coburn]], became McQueen's first major hit and led to his withdrawal from ''Wanted: Dead or Alive''. McQueen's focused portrayal of the taciturn second lead catapulted his career. His added touches in many of the shots, such as shaking a shotgun round before loading it, repeatedly checking his gun while in the background of a shot, and wiping his hat rim, annoyed costar Brynner, who protested that McQueen was trying to steal scenes.<ref name=\"terrillx1x\"/> (In his autobiography,<ref name=\"Wallach\">{{cite book|last=Wallach|first=Eli|title=The Good, the Bad and Me: my anecdotage|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-101189-6|url=https://archive.org/details/goodbadmeinmyane00wall}}</ref> [[Eli Wallach]] reports struggling to conceal his amusement while watching the filming of the funeral-procession scene where Brynner's and McQueen's characters first meet: Brynner was furious at McQueen's shotgun-round-shake, which effectively diverted the viewer's attention to McQueen.)

He later appeared as the titular ''[[Nevada Smith]]'', a character from [[Harold Robbins]]' novel, ''[[The Carpetbaggers]]'', portrayed by [[Alan Ladd]] two years earlier in a [[The Carpetbaggers (film)|movie version]] of that novel. ''Nevada Smith'' was an enormously successful [[Western (genre)|Western]] action adventure film that also featured [[Karl Malden]] and [[Suzanne Pleshette]]. After starring in [[1965 in film|1965]]'s ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' as a poker player, McQueen earned his only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination in [[1966 in film|1966]] for his role as an engine-room sailor in ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'', in which he stars opposite [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Richard Attenborough]] (with whom he had previously worked in ''The Great Escape'').<ref name=Nolan />\n\nHe followed his Oscar nomination with [[1968 in film|1968]]'s ''[[Bullitt]]'', one of his best-known films, which co-starred [[Jacqueline Bisset]], [[Robert Vaughn]] and [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]]. It featured an unprecedented (and endlessly imitated) auto chase through [[San Francisco]]. Although McQueen did do the driving that appeared in closeup, this was about 10% of what is seen in the film's car chase.

For this film, McQueen went for a change of image, playing a debonair role as a wealthy executive in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' with [[Faye Dunaway]] in 1968. The following year, he made the Southern [[period piece]] ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]''.\n\n===The 1970s===\nIn [[1971 in film|1971]], McQueen starred in the poorly received auto-racing drama ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'', followed by ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' in [[1972 in film|1972]], a story of an aging rodeo rider. He worked for director [[Sam Peckinpah]] again with the leading role in ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'', where he met future wife [[Ali MacGraw]]. He followed this with a physically demanding role as a [[Devil's Island]] prisoner in [[1973 in film|1973]]'s ''[[Papillon (1973 film)|Papillon]]'', featuring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as his character's tragic [[sidekick]].\n\nIn 1973, [[The Rolling Stones]] referred to McQueen in the song \"[[Star Star]]\" from the album ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' for which an amused McQueen reportedly gave personal permission.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Tony|title=The Rolling Stones: an illustrated record|year=1976|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=978-0-517-52641-5|page=77}}</ref> The lines were \"Star f***er, star f***er, star f***er, star f***er star /\nYes you are, yes you are, yes you are / Yeah, Ali MacGraw got mad with you / For givin' head to Steve McQueen\".\n\nBy the time of ''The Getaway'', McQueen was the world's highest-paid actor,<ref name=\"barger\">{{cite book | last=Barger | first=Ralph | authorlink= Ralph \"Sonny\" Barger |last2=Zimmerman | first2=Keith | last3=Zimmerman | first3=Kent | title=Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories | year=2003 | publisher=Harper Paperbacks | isbn=978-0-06-000603-7 |page=37}}</ref> but after [[1974 in film|1974]]'s ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'', co-starring with his long-time professional rival [[Paul Newman]] and reuniting him with Dunaway, became a tremendous box-office success, McQueen all but disappeared from the public eye, to focus on motorcycle racing and traveling around the country in a [[motor home]] and on his vintage [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] motorcycles. He did not return to acting until [[1978 in film|1978]] with ''[[An Enemy of the People (1978 film)|An Enemy of the People]]'', playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of a [[Henrik Ibsen]] play.

Frankenheimer was unable to meet with McQueen to offer him the role, so he sent [[Edward Lewis (producer)|Edward Lewis]], his business partner and the producer of ''Grand Prix''. McQueen and Lewis instantly clashed, the meeting was a disaster, and the role went to Garner.\n\nDirector [[Steven Spielberg]] said McQueen was his first choice for the character of Roy Neary in ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''. According to Spielberg, in a documentary on the ''Close Encounters'' DVD, Spielberg met him at a bar, where McQueen drank beer after beer.

''Sorcerer'' was to be filmed primarily on location in the Dominican Republic, but McQueen did not want to be separated from Ali MacGraw for the duration of the shoot. McQueen then asked Friedkin to let MacGraw act as a producer, so she could be present during principal photography. Friedkin would not agree to this condition, and cast [[Roy Scheider]] instead of McQueen. Friedkin later remarked that not casting McQueen hurt the film's performance at the box office.\n\nSpy novelist [[Jeremy Duns]] revealed that Steve McQueen was considered for the lead role in a film adaptation of ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]'', written by [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]]; McQueen would play John Blaize, a secret agent gone undercover to infiltrate a diamond-smuggling ring in South Africa.

He landed his first film role in a bit part in ''[[Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956 film)|Somebody Up There Likes Me]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Paul Newman]]. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films ''[[Never Love a Stranger]]'', ''[[The Blob]]'' (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and ''[[The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery]]''.\n\nMcQueen's first breakout role came on television. He appeared on [[Dale Robertson]]'s [[NBC]] [[Western (genre)|western]] series, ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'' as Bill Longley. Elkins, then McQueen's manager, successfully lobbied [[Vincent M. Fennelly]], producer of the western series ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'', to have McQueen read for the part of [[bounty hunter]] Josh Randall in a ''Trackdown'' episode. McQueen appeared as Randall in the episode, cast opposite series lead and old New York motorcycle racing buddy [[Robert Culp]]. McQueen then filmed the pilot episode, which became the series titled ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', which aired on [[CBS]] in September 1958.\n\n===The 1960s===\n[[File:Steve McQueen Virginia Gregg Wanted Dead or Alive 1959.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Virginia Gregg]] with McQueen in ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'', 1959]]\n\nIn the interviews in the DVD release of ''Wanted'', ''Trackdown'' star Robert Culp claims credit for bringing McQueen to Hollywood and landing him the part of Randall. He said he taught McQueen the \"art of the fast-draw,\u201d adding that, on the second day of filming, McQueen beat him. McQueen became a household name as a result of this series.<ref name=\"terrillx1x\"/> Randall's special holster held a [[Sawed-off shotgun|sawed-off]] .44\u201340 [[Winchester rifle]] nicknamed the \"[[Mare's Leg]]\" instead of the [[Six Gun|six-gun]] carried by the typical Western character, although the cartridges in the gunbelt were dummy .45\u201370, chosen because they \"looked tougher,\" Coupled with the generally negative image of the bounty hunter (noted in the three-part DVD special on the background of the series) this added to the [[anti-hero]] image infused with mystery and detachment that made this show stand out from the typical TV Western. The 94 episodes that ran from 1958 until early 1961 kept McQueen steadily employed, and he became a fixture at the renowned [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles|Chatsworth]], where much of the outdoor action for ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'' was shot.\n\nAt 29, McQueen got a significant break when [[Frank Sinatra]] removed [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], from the film ''[[Never So Few]]'' after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen. Sinatra saw something special in McQueen and ensured that the young actor got plenty of closeups in a role that earned McQueen favorable reviews. McQueen's character, Bill Ringa, was never more comfortable than when driving at high speed \u2014in this case in a [[jeep]]\u2014 or handling a [[switchblade]] or a [[Thompson submachine gun|tommy gun]].\n\nAfter ''Never So Few'', the film's director [[John Sturges]] cast McQueen in his next movie, promising to \"give him the camera.\u201d ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' ([[1960 in film|1960]]), in which he played Vin Tanner and co-starred with [[Yul Brynner]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Robert Vaughn]], [[Charles Bronson]] and [[James Coburn]], became McQueen's first major hit and led to his withdrawal from ''Wanted: Dead or Alive''. McQueen's focused portrayal of the taciturn second lead catapulted his career. His added touches in many of the shots, such as shaking a shotgun round before loading it, repeatedly checking his gun while in the background of a shot, and wiping his hat rim, annoyed costar Brynner, who protested that McQueen was trying to steal scenes.<ref name=\"terrillx1x\"/> (In his autobiography,<ref name=\"Wallach\">{{cite book|last=Wallach|first=Eli|title=The Good, the Bad and Me: my anecdotage|year=2005|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-101189-6|url=https://archive.org/details/goodbadmeinmyane00wall}}</ref> [[Eli Wallach]] reports struggling to conceal his amusement while watching the filming of the funeral-procession scene where Brynner's and McQueen's characters first meet: Brynner was furious at McQueen's shotgun-round-shake, which effectively diverted the viewer's attention to McQueen.)

He later appeared as the titular ''[[Nevada Smith]]'', a character from [[Harold Robbins]]' novel, ''[[The Carpetbaggers]]'', portrayed by [[Alan Ladd]] two years earlier in a [[The Carpetbaggers (film)|movie version]] of that novel. ''Nevada Smith'' was an enormously successful [[Western (genre)|Western]] action adventure film that also featured [[Karl Malden]] and [[Suzanne Pleshette]]. After starring in [[1965 in film|1965]]'s ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' as a poker player, McQueen earned his only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination in [[1966 in film|1966]] for his role as an engine-room sailor in ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'', in which he stars opposite [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Richard Attenborough]] (with whom he had previously worked in ''The Great Escape'').<ref name=Nolan />\n\nHe followed his Oscar nomination with [[1968 in film|1968]]'s ''[[Bullitt]]'', one of his best-known films, which co-starred [[Jacqueline Bisset]], [[Robert Vaughn]] and [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]]. It featured an unprecedented (and endlessly imitated) auto chase through [[San Francisco]]. Although McQueen did do the driving that appeared in closeup, this was about 10% of what is seen in the film's car chase.

For this film, McQueen went for a change of image, playing a debonair role as a wealthy executive in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' with [[Faye Dunaway]] in 1968. The following year, he made the Southern [[period piece]] ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]''.\n\n===The 1970s===\nIn [[1971 in film|1971]], McQueen starred in the poorly received auto-racing drama ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'', followed by ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' in [[1972 in film|1972]], a story of an aging rodeo rider. He worked for director [[Sam Peckinpah]] again with the leading role in ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]'', where he met future wife [[Ali MacGraw]]. He followed this with a physically demanding role as a [[Devil's Island]] prisoner in [[1973 in film|1973]]'s ''[[Papillon (1973 film)|Papillon]]'', featuring [[Dustin Hoffman]] as his character's tragic [[sidekick]].\n\nIn 1973, [[The Rolling Stones]] referred to McQueen in the song \"[[Star Star]]\" from the album ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'' for which an amused McQueen reportedly gave personal permission.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Tony|title=The Rolling Stones: an illustrated record|year=1976|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=978-0-517-52641-5|page=77}}</ref> The lines were \"Star f***er, star f***er, star f***er, star f***er star /\nYes you are, yes you are, yes you are / Yeah, Ali MacGraw got mad with you / For givin' head to Steve McQueen\".\n\nBy the time of ''The Getaway'', McQueen was the world's highest-paid actor,<ref name=\"barger\">{{cite book | last=Barger | first=Ralph | authorlink= Ralph \"Sonny\" Barger |last2=Zimmerman | first2=Keith | last3=Zimmerman | first3=Kent | title=Ridin' High, Livin' Free: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories | year=2003 | publisher=Harper Paperbacks | isbn=978-0-06-000603-7 |page=37}}</ref> but after [[1974 in film|1974]]'s ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'', co-starring with his long-time professional rival [[Paul Newman]] and reuniting him with Dunaway, became a tremendous box-office success, McQueen all but disappeared from the public eye, to focus on motorcycle racing and traveling around the country in a [[motor home]] and on his vintage [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]] motorcycles. He did not return to acting until [[1978 in film|1978]] with ''[[An Enemy of the People (1978 film)|An Enemy of the People]]'', playing against type as a bearded, bespectacled 19th-century doctor in this adaptation of a [[Henrik Ibsen]] play. The film was never properly released theatrically.\n\nHis last two films were loosely based on true stories: ''[[Tom Horn (film)|Tom Horn]]'', a Western adventure about a former Army scout-turned professional gunman who worked for the big cattle ranchers hunting down rustlers, and later hanged for murder in the shooting death of a sheepherder, and ''[[The Hunter (1980 film)|The Hunter]]'', an urban action movie about a modern-day [[bounty hunter]], both released in [[1980 in film|1980]].\n\n===Missed roles===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}\nMcQueen was offered the lead male role in ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', but was unable to accept due to his ''Wanted: Dead or Alive'' contract (the role went to [[George Peppard]]).<ref name=\"terrillx1x\"/><ref name=JonesM-MS-1994-03-19>Jones Meg. \u2013 \"McQueen biography is portrait of a rebel\". \u2013 ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]''. \u2013 March 19, 1994.</ref> He turned down parts in ''[[Ocean's 11]]'',<ref>Rahner, Mark. \u2013 \"Speeding \"Bullitt\" \u2013 New DVD collections remind us why McQueen was the King of Cool\". \u2013 ''[[The Seattle Times]]''. \u2013 June 12, 2005.</ref> ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (his attorneys and agents could not agree with Paul Newman's attorneys and agents on top billing),<ref name=\"terrillx1x\"/><ref name=JonesM-MS-1994-03-19/> ''[[The Driver]]'',<ref>Burger, Mark. \u2013 \"Walter Hill Crime Story from 1978 Led the Way in its Genre\". \u2013 ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]''. \u2013 June 9, 2005.</ref><ref>French, Philip. \u2013 Review: \"DVD club: No 44 The Driver\". \u2013 ''[[The Observer]]'' \u2013 November 5, 2006.</ref> ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'',<ref name=Nolan />{{rp|172}} ''[[California Split]]'',<ref>Shields, Mel. \u2013 \"Elliott Gould has had quite a career to joke about\". \u2013 ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]''. \u2013 October 27, 2002.</ref> ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (he did not want to do another cop film),<ref name=\"terrillx1x\"/><ref name=JonesM-MS-1994-03-19/> and ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.\n\nAccording to director [[John Frankenheimer]] and actor [[James Garner]] in bonus interviews for the DVD of the film ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'', McQueen was Frankenheimer's first choice for the lead role of American Formula One race car driver Pete Aron. Frankenheimer was unable to meet with McQueen to offer him the role, so he sent [[Edward Lewis (producer)|Edward Lewis]], his business partner and the producer of ''Grand Prix''. McQueen and Lewis instantly clashed, the meeting was a disaster, and the role went to Garner.\n\nDirector [[Steven Spielberg]] said McQueen was his first choice for the character of Roy Neary in ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''. According to Spielberg, in a documentary on the ''Close Encounters'' DVD, Spielberg met him at a bar, where McQueen drank beer after beer.

''Sorcerer'' was to be filmed primarily on location in the Dominican Republic, but McQueen did not want to be separated from Ali MacGraw for the duration of the shoot. McQueen then asked Friedkin to let MacGraw act as a producer, so she could be present during principal photography. Friedkin would not agree to this condition, and cast [[Roy Scheider]] instead of McQueen. Friedkin later remarked that not casting McQueen hurt the film's performance at the box office.\n\nSpy novelist [[Jeremy Duns]] revealed that Steve McQueen was considered for the lead role in a film adaptation of ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]'', written by [[James Bond]] creator [[Ian Fleming]]; McQueen would play John Blaize, a secret agent gone undercover to infiltrate a diamond-smuggling ring in South Africa.

It was outlined during the [[Finnish Civil War]], on 29 January 1918 by the [[Finnish People's Delegation]], the Reds and [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] of the [[Social Democratic Party (Finland)|Finnish Social Democratic Party]], after the socialist [[revolution]] in Finland on 26 January 1918.\n\nThe name \"Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic\" (''Suomen sosialistinen ty\u00f6v\u00e4entasavalta'') appeared only in the Treaty between Finnish People's Delegation and Russian [[Council of People's Commissars]], signed 1 March 1918. The People's Delegation had earlier used the name Republic of Finland (''Suomen tasavalta''), but Soviet leader [[V. I. Lenin]] proposed adding the attributes \"Socialist Workers' Republic\" into the name during negotiations. The People's Delegation later blamed its delegates for succumbing to Lenin's demand, since the official name of the state should have been decided by the Finns themselves.\n\n==Aims==\nRed Finland/FSWR was an attempt to establish a socialist nation, based on the legacy of Scandinavian-Finnish culture, socialist ideas originating from [[Central Europe]] and Finnish [[nationalism]], including plans to expand the Finnish territory. The political visions included principles of democracy, but as Red Finland was primarily the formation of revolution and civil war, the acts of violence and warfare were emphasized in the policy. The Red Guards included a minor faction of Finnish Bolsheviks who supported association of FSWR to Soviet Russia. FSWR/Red Finland never gained a true status and form of state and republic as the Reds lost the Civil War on 5 May 1918.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=73\u2013113, 417\u2013429}}, {{Harvnb|Klemettil\u00e4|1989|pp=163\u2013203}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=88, 106}}, {{Harvnb|Pieti\u00e4inen|1992|pp=252\u2013403}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21\u201332}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Jyr\u00e4nki|2014|pp=10\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Geographical area==\nThe [[geographical]] area of Red Finland as well as the [[front line]] between White and Red Finland took shape approximately between 28 January and 3 February 1918, and it remained largely unchanged until the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=88\u201390}}</ref>\n\n==Draft constitution==\nThe [[Finnish People's Delegation]], mainly [[Otto Ville Kuusinen]], formulated and set forth, on 23 February 1918, a draft for a [[constitution]] of Red Finland/FSWR, on the basis of the Finnish Social Democratic principles and mentality. The [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was absent from the program. Instead, it represented an idea of ''democratic socialism'' and it was influenced by the constitutions of [[Switzerland]] and [[United States]], and [[French Revolution]]. The constitution model included most of democratic [[civil rights]] for the Finnish [[citizens]], including an extensive use of [[referendum]] in political decision making, but [[private property rights]] were excluded and given to state and local administration. The draft was never finally formulated and approved in Red Finland, before the defeat of FSWR in the 1918 war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1973|pp=105\u2013142}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=19\u201324, 30\u201333, 497\u2013504}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=167\u2013176}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=88, 102}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009|pp=249\u2013269}}, {{Harvnb|Payne|2011|pp=25\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThe power political situation after the ''January Revolution'' in Finland raised a major question in terms of the constitution draft, among the Finnish (moderate) [[socialists]]: would the power gained via [[revolution]] allow [[democracy]] a true chance in Finnish [[society]]? Finally, [[Red Terror (Finland)|political terror]], carried out by the Red Guards during the Finnish civil war, led to marked controversy between the principles of democracy and the situation in the country.<ref>The relation between democracy and revolution was contradictory for the socialists, as the [[February revolution]] empowered the lamed Finnish Parliament, until July 1917; restoration of the socialists' power in the Parliament was among the main goals of the January Revolution 1918. The Finnish Red-White conflict of 1918 has been described as ''Class War'', ''Rebellion'', ''(Red) Revolt'' and ''Abortive (Red) Revolution'' by the Finnish Red [[veterans]], {{Harvnb|Kettunen|1986|pp=9\u201389}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=497\u2013504}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008|pp=31\u201344}}</ref>\n\n==Relations with Lenin==\nAlthough the Finnish Socialist Worker's Republic was supported by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the 1 March 1918 Red Treaty was signed between these two unstable [[socialist states]], an ideal level of co-operation and co-ordination was never achieved, due to both states being preoccupied with their own respective civil wars. The goal of the Finnish Reds' majority was a neutral and independent Finland, and some of them demanded annexation of [[Olonets|Aunus]], [[White Karelia|Viena Karelia]] and [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] areas of Russian Karelia to Finland. The Russian-Finnish Red treaty had only minor importance for the Bolsheviks as they carried out peace negotiations with the [[German Empire]]. In the end, the fate of the Finnish Reds and FSWR was determined through the power political decisions made between [[Russia]] and [[Germany]].<ref>[[Edvard Gylling]] was the prime mover at the start of the Finnish-Russian talks for the Red Treaty; among other things he aimed to work for peace talks between the Finnish Whites and Reds, by diminishing the Russian influence in Finland. The Finnish Bolsheviks, few in number, but influential and active in the Finnish Red Guards supported Lenin's Russian federalism. The Finns got Petsamo, but the question of Aunus and Viena remained open, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=262\u2013265}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=417\u2013429}}, {{Harvnb|Klemettil\u00e4|1989|pp=163\u2013203}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=106}}, {{Harvnb|Pieti\u00e4inen|1992|pp=252\u2013403}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21\u201332}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Jyr\u00e4nki|2014|pp=83\u201396}}</ref>\n\nLenin aimed to halt a complete collapse of [[Russia]] after the revolutionary year 1917. While in political opposition prior to the [[October Revolution]], Lenin emphasized the policy of nations' right to self-determination for the former parts of the [[Russian Empire]]. After the successful seizure of power in October 1917 and in January 1918, the Bolsheviks' power political strategy shifted gradually toward [[federalism]]. As for [[Finland]], Lenin plotted its annexation by Russia, but the [[Russian Civil War]], German-Russian [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], Finland-operation of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], the victory of the White Guards in the Finnish civil war and the marked [[nationalism]] among the Finnish socialists stalled his plan.<ref>In fact, Lenin's  \"socialist\"  power policy followed that of the former [[Romanov]] empire; the [[geopolitical]] position of a country determined the way it was treated by the Russian leadership (e.g. [[Poland]]-[[Ukraine]] vs. [[Finland]]), {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=24\u201328}}, {{Harvnb|Klemettil\u00e4|1989|pp=163\u2013203}}, {{Harvnb|Pipes|1996|pp=382\u2013406}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=282\u2013288}}</ref>\n\n==Civil war==\nThe warfare between the Reds and Whites took major attention and energy of the Red leadership. Therefore, formation of the local Red civil administration remained unfinished and waited for the result of the Civil War. The top and middle-rank civil servants of the pre-civil war administration refused to co-operate with the Reds, and a new leadership had to be chosen and trained from the lower rank servants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009|pp=249\u2013269}}</ref>\n\n==Defeat of the FSWR==\nThe Finnish Civil War ended with the German invasion of Finland and the consequent defeat of the Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and FSWR on 5 May 1918. After the war, the initially powerful and well-organized Finnish Social Democrats, born and bred in the relatively free and nationalistic social atmosphere, within the [[Scandinavia]]n and Russian culture, and affected primarily by socialist ideas of [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] (pre-World War I [[Austria-Hungary]]), were split in two. The moderate socialists continued their pre-1918 political culture, adhered to the society and political system of [[Finland]], while the far-left faction formed the [[Communist Party of Finland]] in August 1918 in [[Moscow]], with the main leaders living in exile in [[Russia]] and a marked part of the common supporters living in Finland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=19\u201322, 497\u2013504}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Finland|Communism}}\n* [[Finland|Republic of Finland]]\n* [[Finnish Democratic Republic]] - during World War II\n* [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n* [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)]]\n* [[Revolutions of 1917\u201323]]\n* [[Santeri Nuorteva]]\n\n==Citations and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation|last=Alapuro|first=Risto|author-link=|year=1988|title=State and Revolution in Finland.

It was outlined during the [[Finnish Civil War]], on 29 January 1918 by the [[Finnish People's Delegation]], the Reds and [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] of the [[Social Democratic Party (Finland)|Finnish Social Democratic Party]], after the socialist [[revolution]] in Finland on 26 January 1918.\n\nThe name \"Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic\" (''Suomen sosialistinen ty\u00f6v\u00e4entasavalta'') appeared only in the Treaty between Finnish People's Delegation and Russian [[Council of People's Commissars]], signed 1 March 1918. The People's Delegation had earlier used the name Republic of Finland (''Suomen tasavalta''), but Soviet leader [[V. I. Lenin]] proposed adding the attributes \"Socialist Workers' Republic\" into the name during negotiations. The People's Delegation later blamed its delegates for succumbing to Lenin's demand, since the official name of the state should have been decided by the Finns themselves.\n\n==Aims==\nRed Finland/FSWR was an attempt to establish a socialist nation, based on the legacy of Scandinavian-Finnish culture, socialist ideas originating from [[Central Europe]] and Finnish [[nationalism]], including plans to expand the Finnish territory. The political visions included principles of democracy, but as Red Finland was primarily the formation of revolution and civil war, the acts of violence and warfare were emphasized in the policy. The Red Guards included a minor faction of Finnish Bolsheviks who supported association of FSWR to Soviet Russia. FSWR/Red Finland never gained a true status and form of state and republic as the Reds lost the Civil War on 5 May 1918.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=73\u2013113, 417\u2013429}}, {{Harvnb|Klemettil\u00e4|1989|pp=163\u2013203}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=88, 106}}, {{Harvnb|Pieti\u00e4inen|1992|pp=252\u2013403}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21\u201332}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Jyr\u00e4nki|2014|pp=10\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Geographical area==\nThe [[geographical]] area of Red Finland as well as the [[front line]] between White and Red Finland took shape approximately between 28 January and 3 February 1918, and it remained largely unchanged until the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=88\u201390}}</ref>\n\n==Draft constitution==\nThe [[Finnish People's Delegation]], mainly [[Otto Ville Kuusinen]], formulated and set forth, on 23 February 1918, a draft for a [[constitution]] of Red Finland/FSWR, on the basis of the Finnish Social Democratic principles and mentality. The [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was absent from the program. Instead, it represented an idea of ''democratic socialism'' and it was influenced by the constitutions of [[Switzerland]] and [[United States]], and [[French Revolution]]. The constitution model included most of democratic [[civil rights]] for the Finnish [[citizens]], including an extensive use of [[referendum]] in political decision making, but [[private property rights]] were excluded and given to state and local administration. The draft was never finally formulated and approved in Red Finland, before the defeat of FSWR in the 1918 war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Upton|1973|pp=105\u2013142}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=19\u201324, 30\u201333, 497\u2013504}}, {{Harvnb|Alapuro|1988|pp=167\u2013176}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=88, 102}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009|pp=249\u2013269}}, {{Harvnb|Payne|2011|pp=25\u201332}}</ref>\n\nThe power political situation after the ''January Revolution'' in Finland raised a major question in terms of the constitution draft, among the Finnish (moderate) [[socialists]]: would the power gained via [[revolution]] allow [[democracy]] a true chance in Finnish [[society]]? Finally, [[Red Terror (Finland)|political terror]], carried out by the Red Guards during the Finnish civil war, led to marked controversy between the principles of democracy and the situation in the country.<ref>The relation between democracy and revolution was contradictory for the socialists, as the [[February revolution]] empowered the lamed Finnish Parliament, until July 1917; restoration of the socialists' power in the Parliament was among the main goals of the January Revolution 1918. The Finnish Red-White conflict of 1918 has been described as ''Class War'', ''Rebellion'', ''(Red) Revolt'' and ''Abortive (Red) Revolution'' by the Finnish Red [[veterans]], {{Harvnb|Kettunen|1986|pp=9\u201389}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=497\u2013504}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Kalela|2008|pp=31\u201344}}</ref>\n\n==Relations with Lenin==\nAlthough the Finnish Socialist Worker's Republic was supported by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], and the 1 March 1918 Red Treaty was signed between these two unstable [[socialist states]], an ideal level of co-operation and co-ordination was never achieved, due to both states being preoccupied with their own respective civil wars. The goal of the Finnish Reds' majority was a neutral and independent Finland, and some of them demanded annexation of [[Olonets|Aunus]], [[White Karelia|Viena Karelia]] and [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] areas of Russian Karelia to Finland. The Russian-Finnish Red treaty had only minor importance for the Bolsheviks as they carried out peace negotiations with the [[German Empire]]. In the end, the fate of the Finnish Reds and FSWR was determined through the power political decisions made between [[Russia]] and [[Germany]].<ref>[[Edvard Gylling]] was the prime mover at the start of the Finnish-Russian talks for the Red Treaty; among other things he aimed to work for peace talks between the Finnish Whites and Reds, by diminishing the Russian influence in Finland. The Finnish Bolsheviks, few in number, but influential and active in the Finnish Red Guards supported Lenin's Russian federalism. The Finns got Petsamo, but the question of Aunus and Viena remained open, {{Harvnb|Upton|1981|pp=262\u2013265}}, {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=417\u2013429}}, {{Harvnb|Klemettil\u00e4|1989|pp=163\u2013203}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen et. al|1992|pp=106}}, {{Harvnb|Pieti\u00e4inen|1992|pp=252\u2013403}}, {{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Manninen|1995|pp=21\u201332}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Jyr\u00e4nki|2014|pp=83\u201396}}</ref>\n\nLenin aimed to halt a complete collapse of [[Russia]] after the revolutionary year 1917. While in political opposition prior to the [[October Revolution]], Lenin emphasized the policy of nations' right to self-determination for the former parts of the [[Russian Empire]]. After the successful seizure of power in October 1917 and in January 1918, the Bolsheviks' power political strategy shifted gradually toward [[federalism]]. As for [[Finland]], Lenin plotted its annexation by Russia, but the [[Russian Civil War]], German-Russian [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], Finland-operation of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]], the victory of the White Guards in the Finnish civil war and the marked [[nationalism]] among the Finnish socialists stalled his plan.<ref>In fact, Lenin's  \"socialist\"  power policy followed that of the former [[Romanov]] empire; the [[geopolitical]] position of a country determined the way it was treated by the Russian leadership (e.g. [[Poland]]-[[Ukraine]] vs. [[Finland]]), {{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=24\u201328}}, {{Harvnb|Klemettil\u00e4|1989|pp=163\u2013203}}, {{Harvnb|Pipes|1996|pp=382\u2013406}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=282\u2013288}}</ref>\n\n==Civil war==\nThe warfare between the Reds and Whites took major attention and energy of the Red leadership. Therefore, formation of the local Red civil administration remained unfinished and waited for the result of the Civil War. The top and middle-rank civil servants of the pre-civil war administration refused to co-operate with the Reds, and a new leadership had to be chosen and trained from the lower rank servants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Piilonen|1993|pp=486\u2013627}}, {{Harvnb|Suodenjoki|2009|pp=249\u2013269}}</ref>\n\n==Defeat of the FSWR==\nThe Finnish Civil War ended with the German invasion of Finland and the consequent defeat of the Finnish [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and FSWR on 5 May 1918. After the war, the initially powerful and well-organized Finnish Social Democrats, born and bred in the relatively free and nationalistic social atmosphere, within the [[Scandinavia]]n and Russian culture, and affected primarily by socialist ideas of [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] (pre-World War I [[Austria-Hungary]]), were split in two. The moderate socialists continued their pre-1918 political culture, adhered to the society and political system of [[Finland]], while the far-left faction formed the [[Communist Party of Finland]] in August 1918 in [[Moscow]], with the main leaders living in exile in [[Russia]] and a marked part of the common supporters living in Finland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rinta-Tassi|1986|pp=19\u201322, 497\u2013504}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|2007|pp=287\u2013288}}, {{Harvnb|Haapala|2014|pp=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Finland|Communism}}\n* [[Finland|Republic of Finland]]\n* [[Finnish Democratic Republic]] - during World War II\n* [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n* [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)]]\n* [[Revolutions of 1917\u201323]]\n* [[Santeri Nuorteva]]\n\n==Citations and notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation|last=Alapuro|first=Risto|author-link=|year=1988|title=State and Revolution in Finland.

The title of the album is a [[portmanteau]] of the English words \"[[whore]]\" and \"[[oracle]]\". \n\nApart from \"[[Everything Counts]]\", which is a cover of a [[Depeche Mode]] song, all songs were composed and arranged by [[In Flames]]. The lyrics were translated by ''[[Dark Tranquillity]]'' guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], after [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] had written them in Swedish. \n\n''Whoracle'' is the final album to feature [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]] & [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]]. It is also the last ''In Flames'' release with [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] playing drums, as he permanently switched to lead guitar in future releases.

The title of the album is a [[portmanteau]] of the English words \"[[whore]]\" and \"[[oracle]]\". \n\nApart from \"[[Everything Counts]]\", which is a cover of a [[Depeche Mode]] song, all songs were composed and arranged by [[In Flames]]. The lyrics were translated by ''[[Dark Tranquillity]]'' guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], after [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] had written them in Swedish. \n\n''Whoracle'' is the final album to feature [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]] & [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]]. It is also the last ''In Flames'' release with [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] playing drums, as he permanently switched to lead guitar in future releases.
