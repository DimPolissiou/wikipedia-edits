In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and for tracking of the rate of infection.\n\nEarly leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Boeck]]. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary.

Isolation treatment methods were observed by Surgeon-Mayor [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] of the British Colony in India while visiting Norway, and these methods were applied in India with the financial and logistical assistance of religious missionaries.

Leprosy is most common amongst impoverished or marginalized populations where social stigma is likely to be compounded by other social inequities. Fears of ostracism, loss of employment, or expulsion from family and society may contribute to a delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n\nFolk beliefs, lack of education, and religious connotations of the disease continue to influence social perceptions of those afflicted in many parts of the world.

In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and for tracking of the rate of infection.\n\nEarly leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Boeck]]. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary. This stance was influential in advocating for the isolation of those infected by sex to prevent reproduction.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Genetic susceptibility to leprosy|last=Alter|first=Andrea|year=2010|isbn=978-0-494-72613-6|location=McGill University (Canada)|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Daniel_Cornelius_Danielssen|title=  Daniel Cornelius Danielssen|publisher=  Store norske leksikon|author=  Svein Atle Sk\u00e5lev\u00e5g|accessdate=  January 1, 2017|url-status=  live|archiveurl=  https://web.archive.org/web/20170113154202/https://snl.no/Daniel_Cornelius_Danielssen|archivedate=  January 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://snl.no/Carl_Wilhelm_Boeck|title= Carl Wilhelm Boeck|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author= Svein Atle Sk\u00e5lev\u00e5g|accessdate= January 1, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170113170144/https://snl.no/Carl_Wilhelm_Boeck|archivedate= January 13, 2017|date= 2014-09-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Colonialism and imperialism ====\n[[File:Father Damien on his deathbed.jpg|thumb|[[Father Damien]] on his deathbed in 1889]]\nThough leprosy in Europe was again on the decline by the 1860s, Western countries embraced isolation treatment out of fear of the spread of disease from developing countries, minimal understanding of bacteriology, lack of diagnostic ability or knowledge of how contagious the disease was, and missionary activity.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Leprosy, Racism, and Public Health|last=Gussow|first=Zachary|publisher=Westview Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-8133-0674-2|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=}}</ref>  Growing imperialism and pressures of the industrial revolution resulted in a Western presence in countries where leprosy was endemic, namely the British presence in India.  Isolation treatment methods were observed by Surgeon-Mayor [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] of the British Colony in India while visiting Norway, and these methods were applied in India with the financial and logistical assistance of religious missionaries.

Leprosy is most common amongst impoverished or marginalized populations where social stigma is likely to be compounded by other social inequities. Fears of ostracism, loss of employment, or expulsion from family and society may contribute to a delayed diagnosis and treatment.\n\nFolk beliefs, lack of education, and religious connotations of the disease continue to influence social perceptions of those afflicted in many parts of the world. In Brazil, for example, folklore holds that leprosy is transmitted by dogs, it is a disease associated with sexual promiscuity, and is sometimes thought to be punishment for sins or moral transgressions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Cassandra|date=2005|title=Explaining a Complex Disease Process: Talking to Patients about Hansen's Disease (Leprosy) in Brazil|jstor=3655365|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|issn=0745-5194|pmid=16222964|access-date=|volume=19|issue=3|pages=310\u2013330|doi=10.1525/maq.2005.19.3.310}}</ref> Socioeconomic factors also have a direct impact. Lower-class domestic workers who are often employed by those in a higher socioeconomic class may find their employment in jeopardy as physical manifestations of the disease become apparent.

Some excellent works of Hindu art such as the panels at the Dashavatara Temple in [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh|Deogarh]] serve to illustrate the magnificence of Gupta art. Above all, it was the synthesis of elements that gave Gupta art its distinctive flavour. During this period, the Guptas were supportive of thriving [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jain]] cultures as well, and for this reason, there is also a long history of non-Hindu [[Gupta period art]]. In particular, Gupta period Buddhist art was to be influential in most of East and Southeast Asia.

Both exported sculpture to other parts of northern India. \n\nThe most famous remaining monuments in a broadly Gupta style, the caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]], and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] (respectively Buddhist, Hindu, and mixed including Jain) were in fact produced under later dynasties, but primarily reflect the monumentality and balance of Guptan style. Ajanta contains by far the most significant survivals of painting from this and the surrounding periods, showing a mature form which had probably had a long development, mainly in painting palaces.{{sfn|J.C.

In the later period, the title ''Maharaja'' was used by feudatory rulers, which has led to suggestions that Gupta and Ghatotkacha were vassals (possibly of [[Kushan Empire]]).{{sfn|Ashvini Agrawal|1989|p=85}} However, there are several instances of paramount sovereigns using the title ''Maharaja'', in both pre-Gupta and post-Gupta periods, so this cannot be said with certainty.

Chandragupta II, ''Vikramaditya'' (the Sun of Power), ruled from 375 until 415. He married a Kadamba princess of Kuntala and of Naga lineage (''N\u0101gakulotpannn\u0101''), Kuberanaga. His daughter [[Prabhavatigupta]] from this Naga queen was married to [[Rudrasena II]], the [[Vakataka]] ruler of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]].{{sfn|H.C. Raychaudhuri|1923|p=489}} His son Kumaragupta I was married to a Kadamba princess of the Karnataka region. Chandragupta II expanded his realm westwards, defeating the [[Saka]] [[Western Kshatrapas]] of [[Malwa]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in a campaign lasting until 409. His main opponent [[Rudrasimha III]] was defeated by 395, and he crushed the Bengal chiefdoms. This extended his control from coast to coast, established a second capital at [[Ujjain]] and was the high point of the empire.\n\n[[Image:Two Gold coins of Chandragupta II.jpg|thumb|right|Gold coins of [[Chandragupta II]].]]\nDespite the creation of the empire through war, the reign is remembered for its very influential style of [[Hindu]] art, literature, culture and science, especially during the reign of Chandragupta II. Some excellent works of Hindu art such as the panels at the Dashavatara Temple in [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh|Deogarh]] serve to illustrate the magnificence of Gupta art. Above all, it was the synthesis of elements that gave Gupta art its distinctive flavour. During this period, the Guptas were supportive of thriving [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jain]] cultures as well, and for this reason, there is also a long history of non-Hindu [[Gupta period art]]. In particular, Gupta period Buddhist art was to be influential in most of East and Southeast Asia. Many advances were recorded by the Chinese scholar and traveller [[Faxian]] in his diary and published afterwards.\n\nThe court of Chandragupta was made even more illustrious by the fact that it was graced by the ''Navaratna'' (Nine Jewels), a group of nine who excelled in the literary arts. Amongst these men was [[K\u0101lid\u0101sa]], whose works dwarfed the works of many other literary geniuses, not only in his own age but in the years to come. Kalidasa was mainly known for his subtle exploitation of the ''shringara'' (romantic) element in his verse.\n\n====Chandragupta II's Campaigns against Foreign Tribes====\nThe 4th century [[Sanskrit]] poet [[Kalidasa]] credits Chandragupta Vikramaditya with conquering about twenty-one kingdoms, both in and outside India. After finishing his campaign in East and West India, Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) proceeded northwards, subjugated the [[Parasika]]s, then the [[Huna people|Hunas]] and the [[Kambojas]] tribes located in the west and east [[Oxus]] valleys respectively. Thereafter, the king proceeded into the [[Himalaya]] mountains to reduce the mountain tribes of the [[Kinnara Kingdom|Kinnaras]], [[Kiratas]], as well as India proper.<ref name=\"Raghu Vamsa v 4.60\u201375\" />{{npsn|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe ''Brihatkathamanjari'' of the [[Kashmir]]i writer [[Kshemendra]] states, King Vikramaditya (Chandragupta II) had \"unburdened the sacred earth of the [[Barbarian]]s like the [[Sakas]], [[Mleccha]]s, [[Kambojas]], [[Yavana]]s, [[Tushara Kingdom|Tusharas]], [[Parasika]]s, Hunas, and others, by annihilating these sinful Mlecchas completely\".<ref>ata shrivikramadityo helya nirjitakhilah Mlechchana Kamboja.

Faxian was pleased with the mildness of administration. The Penal Code was mild and offences were punished by fines only. From his accounts, the Gupta Empire was a prosperous period.

The empire was called by various names such as ''Rajya'', ''Rashtra'', ''Desha'', ''Mandala'', ''Prithvi'' and ''Avani''. It was divided into 26 provinces, which were styled as ''Bhukti'', ''Pradesha'' and ''Bhoga''. Provinces were also divided into ''Vishayas'' and put under the control of the ''Vishayapati''s. A ''Vishayapati'' administered the ''Vishaya'' with the help of the ''Adhikarana'' (council of representatives), which comprised four representatives: ''Nagarasreshesthi'', ''Sarthavaha'', ''Prathamakulika'' and ''Prathama Kayastha''. A part of the ''Vishaya'' was called ''Vithi''.{{sfn|Vidya Dhar Mahajan|1990|pp=530\u201331}} The Gupta also had trading links with the Byzantine Empire.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==<span id='Legacy of the Gupta Empire'>Legacy</span>==\n[[Image:Radha-Krishna chess.jpg|thumb|right|Later image of [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]] playing [[chaturanga]] on an 8 \u00d7 8 Asht\u0101pada]]\nScholars of this period include [[Varahamihira]] and [[Aryabhata]], who is believed to be the first to come up with the concept of [[zero]], postulated the theory that [[heliocentrism|the Earth moves round the Sun]], and studied [[Solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse|lunar]] [[eclipses]].

Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and [[Jain]] ''[[tirthankara]]'' figures, the latter often on a very large scale. The two great centres of sculpture were [[Mathura]] and [[Gandhara]], the latter the centre of [[Greco-Buddhist art]]. Both exported sculpture to other parts of northern India. \n\nThe most famous remaining monuments in a broadly Gupta style, the caves at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]], and [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] (respectively Buddhist, Hindu, and mixed including Jain) were in fact produced under later dynasties, but primarily reflect the monumentality and balance of Guptan style.

Peugeot Motocycles remains the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in the world.\n\nIn the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of [[bicycle]]s adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal-combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century the first major mass-production firms emerged. [[File:Fn-1913.jpg|thumb|A 1913 FN (Fabrique National), Belgium, 4 cylinders and shaft drive]]\nIn 1901 English quadricycle- and bicycle-maker [[Royal Enfield]] introduced its first motorcycle, with a 239&nbsp;cc engine mounted in the front and driving the rear wheel through a belt. In 1898 English bicycle-maker [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] decided to extend its focus to include motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle\u2014a bicycle fitted with a Belgian-built engine. A year later it was the largest motorcycle-manufacturer, with an annual production of over 500 units.

The role of the motorcycle shifted in the 1960s, from the tool of a life to a toy of a lifestyle. It became part of an image, of status, a cultural icon for individualism, a prop in Hollywood B-movies.<ref name=\"An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its colapse\" />\n\nThe motorcycle also became a recreational machine for sport and leisure, a vehicle for carefree youth, not essential transportation for the mature family man or woman, and the Japanese were able to produce modern designs more quickly, more cheaply, and of better quality than their competitors. Their motorbikes were more stylish and more reliable, so the British manufacturers fell behind as mass-market producers.\n\nHonda, which was officially founded in Japan on September 24, 1948, introduced their [[SOHC]] [[inline-four engine]] [[Honda CB750|CB750]] in 1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It established the across-the-frame-four engine configuration as a design with huge potential for power and performance. Shortly after the introduction of the SOHC, Kawasaki demonstrated the potential of the four-stroke four-cylinder engine with the introduction of the [[Kawasaki Z1|KZ900]].\n\n[[Suzuki]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]] and the [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] each started producing motorcycles in the 1950s. Meanwhile, the sun was setting on British dominion over the big-displacement motorbike market.\n\n===Japanese dominance===\n[[File:Honda CB750a.JPG|thumb|The [[Honda CB750]] revolutionized motorcycle marketing and was emblematic of Japanese dominance]]\nThe excellence of Japanese motorcycles caused similar effects in all Western markets: many Italian bike firms either went bust or only just managed to survive. As a result, BMW's worldwide sales sagged in the 1960s, but came back strongly with the introduction of a completely redesigned [[BMW R75/5|\"slash-5\"]] series for model year 1970.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of the pioneering work of the [[East German]] Daniel Zimmermann (rotary disc valve) and [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]]'s Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when [[Ernst Degner]], the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.\n\n[[Harley-Davidson]] in the US at the time suffered from the same problems as the European firms, but its unique product range, American tariff laws and nationalism-driven customer loyalty allowed it to survive. One alleged flaw, however, was retaining the characteristic Harley-Davidson 45\u00b0 [[V-twin|engine vee-angle]], which causes [[Engine balance|excess vibration]] as well as the loping Harley-Davidson sound.\n\nA factory full fairing was introduced by BMW motorcycle in the R100RS of 1977, the first factory fairing produced in quantity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2008-01-01/bmw-r100rs.aspx|title=1977 BMW R100RS |publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-10|date=January\u2013February 2008|author=Bill Stermer}}</ref> In 1980, BMW stimulated the \"adventure touring\" category of motorcycling with its [[dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] model, the [[BMW R80G/S|R80G/S]].

Peugeot Motocycles remains the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in the world.\n\nIn the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of [[bicycle]]s adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal-combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century the first major mass-production firms emerged.

Imports from the UK, Italy and Germany, thus found a niche in US markets that American bikes did not fill.\n\nThe [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA Group]] purchased Triumph Motorcycles in 1951 to become the largest producer of motorcycles in the world claiming \"one in four\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The German [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] was the largest manufacturer from 1955{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} until 1959 when [[Honda]] became the largest manufacturer.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cases in contemporary strategy analysis |first1= Robert M. |last1= Grant |first2= Kent E. |last2= Neupert |edition= 3rd |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-4051-1180-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XF7V9w8ByrcC&pg=PA172 |accessdate= 2010-11-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title= Six men who built the modern auto industry |first= Richard Alan |last= Johnson |publisher= [[MotorBooks International]] |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-7603-1958-8 |url= https://archive.org/details/sixmenwhobuiltmo00rich |url-access= registration |page= [https://archive.org/details/sixmenwhobuiltmo00rich/page/52 52] |accessdate= 2010-11-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:ZweiRadMuseumNSU Triumph Bonneville.JPG|thumb|A 1962 Triumph Bonneville represents the popularity of British motorcycles at that time]]\nBritish manufacturers Triumph, BSA, and [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]] retained a dominant position in some markets until the rise of the Japanese manufacturers, led by Honda, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The role of the motorcycle shifted in the 1960s, from the tool of a life to a toy of a lifestyle. It became part of an image, of status, a cultural icon for individualism, a prop in Hollywood B-movies.<ref name=\"An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its colapse\" />\n\nThe motorcycle also became a recreational machine for sport and leisure, a vehicle for carefree youth, not essential transportation for the mature family man or woman, and the Japanese were able to produce modern designs more quickly, more cheaply, and of better quality than their competitors. Their motorbikes were more stylish and more reliable, so the British manufacturers fell behind as mass-market producers.\n\nHonda, which was officially founded in Japan on September 24, 1948, introduced their [[SOHC]] [[inline-four engine]] [[Honda CB750|CB750]] in 1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It established the across-the-frame-four engine configuration as a design with huge potential for power and performance. Shortly after the introduction of the SOHC, Kawasaki demonstrated the potential of the four-stroke four-cylinder engine with the introduction of the [[Kawasaki Z1|KZ900]].\n\n[[Suzuki]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]] and the [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] each started producing motorcycles in the 1950s. Meanwhile, the sun was setting on British dominion over the big-displacement motorbike market.\n\n===Japanese dominance===\n[[File:Honda CB750a.JPG|thumb|The [[Honda CB750]] revolutionized motorcycle marketing and was emblematic of Japanese dominance]]\nThe excellence of Japanese motorcycles caused similar effects in all Western markets: many Italian bike firms either went bust or only just managed to survive. As a result, BMW's worldwide sales sagged in the 1960s, but came back strongly with the introduction of a completely redesigned [[BMW R75/5|\"slash-5\"]] series for model year 1970.\n\nFrom the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of the pioneering work of the [[East German]] Daniel Zimmermann (rotary disc valve) and [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]]'s Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when [[Ernst Degner]], the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.\n\n[[Harley-Davidson]] in the US at the time suffered from the same problems as the European firms, but its unique product range, American tariff laws and nationalism-driven customer loyalty allowed it to survive. One alleged flaw, however, was retaining the characteristic Harley-Davidson 45\u00b0 [[V-twin|engine vee-angle]], which causes [[Engine balance|excess vibration]] as well as the loping Harley-Davidson sound.\n\nA factory full fairing was introduced by BMW motorcycle in the R100RS of 1977, the first factory fairing produced in quantity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2008-01-01/bmw-r100rs.aspx|title=1977 BMW R100RS |publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-10|date=January\u2013February 2008|author=Bill Stermer}}</ref> In 1980, BMW stimulated the \"adventure touring\" category of motorcycling with its [[dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] model, the [[BMW R80G/S|R80G/S]]. In 1988, BMW was the first motorcycle manufacturer to introduce [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock-brakes (ABS)]] on its sporting K100RS-SE and K1 models.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==The present==\n[[File:ZX-7RR Wikepedia.jpg|thumb|left|A 2004 [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] ZX-7RR]]\nToday the Japanese manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha dominate the large motorcycle industry, although [[Harley-Davidson]] still maintains a high degree of popularity, particularly in the United States.\n\nRecent years have seen a resurgence in the popularity around the world of many other motorcycle brands, including BMW, Triumph and [[Ducati]], and the emergence of [[Victory Motorcycles|Victory]] as a second successful mass-builder of big-twin American cruisers.\n\nIn November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A.

The English lyrics (\"Blue, blue, my world is blue \u2026\") focus on colours only (blue, grey, red, green, and black), using them to describe components of lost love. The English version by Vicky Leandros also appeared as \"Colours of Love\" in some locations including the UK.\n\n== Eurovision Song Contest ==\nThe song was the second one performed during the 1967 Eurovision Song Contest. At the close of voting, it had received 17 points, placing fourth in a field of 17, behind \"[[Il doit faire beau l\u00e0-bas]]\" (France), \"[[If I Could Choose]]\" (Ireland) and the winning song, \"[[Puppet on a String]]\" (United Kingdom). Some forty years after its original release, \"L'amour est bleu\", along with [[Domenico Modugno]]'s \"[[Nel blu dipinto di blu]]\" (better known as \"Volare\") and [[Mocedades]]' \"[[Eres t\u00fa]]\", still counts as one of very few non-winning Eurovision entries ever to become a worldwide hit.\n\nGreek-born Leandros recorded the song both in French and English, and had a modest hit in Europe with it, but in Japan and Canada she had a big hit with this song. She also recorded it in German (as \"Blau wie das Meer\"), Italian (\"L'amore \u00e8 blu\") and Dutch (\"Liefde is zacht\") . The song has since become a favourite of Contest fans, most notably appearing as part of a medley introducing the semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]] in [[Athens]], one of only three non-winning songs to be involved (the others being \"[[Dschinghis Khan (song)|Dschinghis Khan]]\" and \"Nel blu dipinto di blu\").\n\nIt was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1968|1968 Contest]] by [[Chris Baldo]] & [[Sophie Garel]] with \"[[Nous vivrons d'amour]]\".

Early work involved the development and production of the [[Rolls-Royce BR700|BR700]] family of [[jet propulsion|jet engines]], launched in 1992. During 1999, it was announced that BMW was to discontinue direct involvement in the venture, leading to Rolls-Royce assuming full control in the following year and to the business being renamed ''Rolls-Royce Deutschland''. It has since became the hub for Rolls-Royce Group's two-shaft engines, including the [[Rolls-Royce Tay (turbofan)|Tay]], [[Rolls-Royce Spey|Spey]] and [[IAE V2500]], along with the [[Rolls-Royce Dart|Dart]] [[turboprop]] engine.\n\n==History==\nThe company was established during 1990 as a [[joint venture]], originally known as ''BMW Rolls-Royce'', between the [[Germany|German]] car manufacturer [[BMW]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[aircraft engine]] maker [[Rolls-Royce plc]].<ref name = \"fi2005 bmwexit\"/> The establishment of this venture marked the return of BWM to aero engine manufacturing after the firm had suspended its activities in the sector in the immediate aftermath of the [[World War II|Second World War]].<ref name = \"fi2005 bmwexit\"/>\n\nThe initial purpose of the venture was to develop and manufacture the [[Rolls-Royce BR700|BR700]] family of [[jet propulsion|jet engines]].
