The same document alleges serious policy failures of the Government of Tedros who was the Minister of Health until 2013.

The dam was expected to have a reservoir of around 70&nbsp;billion cubic meters, which was scheduled to start filling in 2014.

They were both students of [[George Ohsawa]], the founder of the modern macrobiotic movement, since after World War II. In the late 1960s, the Kushis began forming study groups in New York and later in Massachusetts in which they lectured on wide-ranging topics from philosophy and spiritualism, to healthy diet and disease prevention. Their following began to increase, and as word spread, they decided to open a store to meet the ever-growing demand for macrobiotic and [[whole foods]] products. On 9 April 1966, the Kushis founded Erewhon Natural Foods as a small macrobiotic and natural foods retail store at 303-B Newbury Street in [[Boston]].  Erewhon Market is considered among the first [[Health food store|natural food store]]s.<ref name=\"NYTimes2001\">{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Douglas|title=Aveline Kushi, 78, Advocate of Macrobiotic Diet for Health|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/23/us/aveline-kushi-78-advocate-of-macrobiotic-diet-for-health.html|accessdate=27 August 2016|work=The New York Times|date=23 July 2001}}</ref> Kushi promoted the macrobiotic philosophy and diet, a [[Taoism|Taoist]]-influenced spiritual practice emphasizing [[Organic food|organic]] and seasonal foods.<ref name=\"Kohn\">{{cite book|last1=Kohn|first1=Livia| url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/8315|title=Chinese healing exercises: the tradition of Daoyin|date=2008|publisher=University of Hawai\u02bbi Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824832346|page=226|url-access=subscription |via=[[Project MUSE]]|accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref> Aveline Kushi was the sole owner. Erewhon's first product line consisted of processed soy products, including [[miso]] and [[shoyu]] purchased from Howard Rower's Infinity Foods and Japan Foods Corp., both in New York.<ref name=\"history\" /> The Kushis soon realized that the quality of food needed was not available in the United States. When Michio Kushi discussed his difficulties with an old university friend, his friend remembered a former schoolmate who was now in the import and export business. He thought his business friend in Tokyo, Japan, might be able to help - Akiyoshi Kazama, the founder of Mitoku. In Japan, like other industrialized countries, many producers turned away from their traditional dietary roots in favor of mass-produced, highly processed foods with little of the integrity, flavor, or health promoting qualities of the original product. For example, just about all of Japan's important [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented foods]], such as [[shoyu]], [[Soy sauce#Japanese|tamari]], [[miso]], [[rice vinegar]] and [[mirin]] were being made by hurried, high temperature aging and contained highly processed ingredients. But Akiyoshi Kazama knew could find producers willing to meet Kushi's macrobiotic standards and was inspired by the idea of introducing Americans to the ancient culinary treasures of Japan. So Erewhon began importing food from Japan, as well as developing American organic farming. In August 1967, environmentalist and entrepreneur [[Paul Hawken]] took over the management of Erewhon, changed the name to Erewhon Trading Co., and began to expand the business. By the early 1970s, Erewhon began contracting with farmers to produce [[Organic food|organically]] grown crops, by 1973 it had established and contracted with 57 farms in 35 states. It also became one of the first companies to establish a \u201cCharter of Quality Standards for Natural Products\u201d for their product line.\n\nAccording to Erewhon, \u201c[[natural foods]]\u201d must adhere to the following guidelines:<ref>[https://www.erewhonmarket.com/standard/ The Standard] accessed 30 January 2020</ref><ref name=\"attune\">[http://www.attunefoods.com/erewhon-history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225155231/http://www.attunefoods.com/erewhon-history |date=2018-02-25 }}, History of Erewhon, Attune Foods website.</ref>\n\n*No synthetic additives or preservatives\n*No artificial colors or flavors\n*No hydrogenated or solvent extracted oils\n*No refined flour or sugar\n*Only natural sweeteners such as honey, maple syrup and molasses.\n\nErewhon was growing so fast that it was soon stretched to the limits of its cash flow and financing capacity and, in 1979, began experiencing financial difficulties. The business expanded until it included 4,000 products, servicing 2,000 customers by February 1981.<ref name=\"history\"/> As these troubles worsened, many supplier companies stopped shipping to the Boston firm.

In November 1940 Admirals [[Erich Raeder]] and [[Werner Fuchs]] (head of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''{{'}}s Construction Office) witnessed a demonstration of the ''V-80''; Raeder was impressed, but Fuchs was slow to approve further tests.\n\nFollowing the success of the ''V-80's'' trials, Walter contacted [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] in January 1942, who enthusiastically embraced the idea and requested that these submarines be developed as quickly as possible. An initial order was placed in summer 1942 for four Type XVIIA development submarines.\n\n==Construction==\nOf these, {{GS|U-792||2}} and {{GS |U-793||2}}, designated ''Wa 201'', were built by [[Blohm + Voss]], commissioned in October 1943, and achieved {{convert |20.25|kn| abbr = on}} submerged. The other pair of Type XVIIA submarines, {{GS|U-794||2}} and {{GS |U-795||2}}, designated ''Wk 202'', were constructed by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]], [[Kiel]], and commissioned in April 1944.\n\nThe ''U-793'' achieved a submerged speed of {{convert |22|kn| abbr= on}} in March 1944 with Admiral D\u00f6nitz aboard. In June 1944 ''U-792'' achieved {{convert|25|kn| abbr = on}} over a measured mile.<ref name = polmar33>Polmar, p. 33</ref>\n\nThe Type XVIIA submarines were found to be very hard to handle at high speed, and were plagued by numerous mechanical problems, low efficiency, and the fact that a significant amount of power was lost due to increased back pressure on the exhaust at depth. Also, the length to beam ratio was too low, resulting in an unnecessarily high drag.<ref name = polmar33 /><!-- Could this be explained? What does that ratio mean, the sub was too much like a square and not a rectangle? -->\n\nAdmiral Fuchs argued that introducing a new type of U-boat would hinder current production efforts, but D\u00f6nitz argued the case for them and on 4 January 1943 the ''Kriegsmarine'' ordered 24 Type XVII submarines.<ref name = grier>{{cite book | last = Grier | first = Howard D | authorlink = | title = Hitler, D\u00f6nitz, and the Baltic Sea | publisher = Naval Institute Press | year = 2007 | location =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-59114-345-4 | page = 174}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of operational Type XVII submarines \u2013 the Type XVIIB \u2013 was begun at the Blohm&nbsp;+ Voss yard in [[Hamburg]].

He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of [[Apple Inc.]], the chairman and majority shareholder of [[Pixar]], a member of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of [[NeXT]]. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the [[History of personal computers|personal computer revolution]] of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]].<!-- The lack of citations is purposeful because this is a summary of what is cited in the body. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations. -->\n\nJobs was born in [[San Francisco]], California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. He attended [[Reed College]] in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and [[Hippie trail|traveled through India]] in 1974 seeking enlightenment and [[Buddhism in the West#Emerging mainstream western Buddhism|studying Zen Buddhism]]. His declassified FBI report states that he used [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was \"one of the two or three most important things\" he had done in his life.\n\nJobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the [[Apple II]], one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputers]]. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the [[Xerox Alto]] in 1979, which was [[computer mouse|mouse]]-driven and had a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful [[Apple Lisa]] in 1983, followed by the breakthrough [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the [[desktop publishing]] industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple [[LaserWriter]], the first [[Laser printing|laser printer]] to feature [[vector graphics]]. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO [[John Sculley]]. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found [[NeXT]], a [[computer platform]] development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the [[visual effects]] industry when he funded the computer graphics division of [[George Lucas]]'s [[Lucasfilm]] in 1986. The new company was [[Pixar]], which produced the first 3D computer animated film ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995).\n\nApple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer [[Jony Ive]] to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the \"[[Think different]]\" advertising campaign and leading to the [[iMac]], [[iTunes]], [[iTunes Store]], [[Apple Store]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and the [[iPad]]. In 2001, the original [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] was replaced with a completely new [[macOS|Mac OS X]], based on NeXT's [[NeXTSTEP]] platform, giving the OS a modern [[Unix]]-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a [[pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]] in 2003. He died of [[respiratory arrest]] related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.\n\n== Background ==\n===Biological and adoptive families===\nSteven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs (n\u00e9e Hagopian).<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/8811345/Steve-Jobs-adopted-child-who-never-met-his-biological-father.html |title=Steve Jobs: adopted child who never met his biological father |date=2011-10-06 |work=Daily Telegraph |access-date=2018-09-18 |language=en-GB |issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nHis biological father, Abdulfattah \"John\" [[List of people from Homs#Families|(al-)Jandali]] ([[Arabic]]: \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u062f\u0644\u064a) (b. 1931), grew up in [[Homs]], Syria, and was born into an [[Arabs|Arab]] [[Muslim]] household.<ref name=\"sg\" /> While an undergraduate at the [[American University of Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], he was a student activist and spent time in prison for his political activities.<ref name=\"sg\" /> He pursued a PhD at the [[University of Wisconsin]], where he met Joanne Carole Schieble, a Catholic of Swiss and German descent.<ref name=\"sg\" /><ref name=\"graff\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Steve-Jobs-son-of-Syrian-refugee-6640925.php |title=Social media reminds us Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian migrant |last=Graff |first=Amy |date=November 18, 2015 |website=SFGate |publisher=Hearst Communications |access-date=May 19, 2016}}</ref> As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a [[Graduate teaching assistant|teaching assistant]] for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2015/11/16/steve-jobs-biological-father-syrian-migrant-some-note/75899450/|title=Steve Jobs' biological father was Syrian migrant, some note|last=Baig|first=Edward C.|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-14}}</ref> [[Mona Simpson]], Jobs's biological sister, notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating a Muslim.<ref name=\"conv\">{{Cite journal |last=Meer |first=Ameena |date=Summer 1987 |title=Artists in Conversation: Mona Simpson |url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/947/mona-simpson |journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]] |access-date=July 7, 2015 |number=20}}</ref> [[Walter Isaacson]], Steve Jobs's [[Steve Jobs (book)|official biographer]], additionally states that Schieble's father \"threatened to cut Joanne off completely\" if she continued the relationship.<ref name=\"graff\" />\n\nJobs's adoptive father, Paul Reinhold Jobs,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/steve-jobs-biography-a-wealth-of-detail/ |title='Steve Jobs' biography: A wealth of detail |last=Shankland |first=Stephen |website=CNET}}</ref> was a Coast Guard mechanic.

Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant.

She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=254}} Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers.

Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}}\n\nDuring this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=254}} Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that \"he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=255}} Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=255}} Jobs later told his biographer that \"Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . .

He never contacted Steve.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, ''[[The Lost Father]]''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} [[Malek Jandali]] is their cousin.<ref>[https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2012/07/malek-jandali-mona-simpson-james-gelvin Conversations: Malek Jandali, Mona Simpson, & James Gelvin] (UCLA Hammer Museum event).

This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularised among third-party peripheral makers\u2014as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.applegazette.com/imac/apple-history-evolution-of-the-imac/ |title=Apple History: Evolution of the iMac |last=Michael |date=August 7, 2007 |website=Apple Gazette |publisher=Apple Gazette |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68ebTSDay |archive-date=June 24, 2012 |access-date=March 28, 2012 |df=mdy}}</ref>\n\n===iTunes===\n{{Main|iTunes}}\niTunes is a [[media player (application software)|media player]], media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple.

He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of [[Apple Inc.]], the chairman and majority shareholder of [[Pixar]], a member of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and the founder, chairman, and CEO of [[NeXT]]. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the [[History of personal computers|personal computer revolution]] of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]].<!-- The lack of citations is purposeful because this is a summary of what is cited in the body. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations. -->\n\nJobs was born in [[San Francisco]], California, and put up for adoption. He was raised in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. He attended [[Reed College]] in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and [[Hippie trail|traveled through India]] in 1974 seeking enlightenment and [[Buddhism in the West#Emerging mainstream western Buddhism|studying Zen Buddhism]]. His declassified FBI report states that he used [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking LSD was \"one of the two or three most important things\" he had done in his life.\n\nJobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the [[Apple II]], one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputers]]. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the [[Xerox Alto]] in 1979, which was [[computer mouse|mouse]]-driven and had a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful [[Apple Lisa]] in 1983, followed by the breakthrough [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the [[desktop publishing]] industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple [[LaserWriter]], the first [[Laser printing|laser printer]] to feature [[vector graphics]]. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO [[John Sculley]]. That same year, Jobs took a few of Apple's members with him to found [[NeXT]], a [[computer platform]] development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the [[visual effects]] industry when he funded the computer graphics division of [[George Lucas]]'s [[Lucasfilm]] in 1986. The new company was [[Pixar]], which produced the first 3D computer animated film ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995).\n\nApple acquired NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with designer [[Jony Ive]] to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the \"[[Think different]]\" advertising campaign and leading to the [[iMac]], [[iTunes]], [[iTunes Store]], [[Apple Store]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and the [[iPad]].

Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant.

She was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=254}} Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers.

Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend Christmas together.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}}\n\nDuring this first visit, Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that she had a brother.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=254}} Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked. Her first impression of Jobs was that \"he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=255}} Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=255}} Jobs later told his biographer that \"Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . .

He never contacted Steve.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, ''[[The Lost Father]]''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|page=258}} [[Malek Jandali]] is their cousin.<ref>[https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2012/07/malek-jandali-mona-simpson-james-gelvin Conversations: Malek Jandali, Mona Simpson, & James Gelvin] (UCLA Hammer Museum event).

[[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963\u20131995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:\n{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful.

[[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963\u20131995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:\n{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful. Parents should exercise their judgment in bringing their children to the exhibition. One gallery will not be open to those under the age of 18.''<ref name=\"Dalry\"/>}}\n\n==London==\n[[File:Burlington House-Courtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Academy of Arts]], London|306x306px]]The opening of ''Sensation'' at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] caused a public furore and a media frenzy, with both [[broadsheet]] and [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] journalists falling over themselves to comment on the show's controversial images, and unprecedented crowds queuing up to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.  Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.\n\nHowever, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].<ref name=\"Dalry\">Dalrymple, Theodore.

It starred [[Nutan]] and Manish among others and was directed by Govind Saraiya.\n\nThe film was adapted into a modern-day TV series of the same name, [[Saraswatichandra (TV series)|Saraswatichandra]] by [[Bollywood]] director [[Sanjay Leela Bhansali]], and aired on [[Star Plus]] from 2013 till 2014.\n\nThe film was based on ''[[Saraswatichandra (novel)|Saraswatichandra]]'', a [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] novel, by [[Govardhanram Madhavram Tripathi]], set in 19th-century [[feudalism in India]]. It also won the [[National Film Award (India)|National Film Award]]s in the ''Best Cinematography'' and ''Best Music Director'' categories.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saraswatichandra (1968) |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article87279.ece |date=21 January 2010|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Story==\n''Saraswatichandra'' tells the story of a young aristocrat, Saraswatichandra, whose marriage has been fixed with Kumud (Nutan), an educated girl from a rich family. Saraswati decides to cancel the engagement and writes to Kumud to inform her. However, she replies and the two continue exchanging letters. Saraswati decides to defy customs and pays a visit to his fianc\u00e9e. A short-lived romance ensues. Saraswati returns home after promising Kumud and her family that he will return for her. However, a family feud takes place and Saraswati writes to Kumud that he will not able to marry her. This triggers a series of misunderstandings, ending up in Kumud's marriage to a rich but illiterate suitor named Pramad (Ramesh Deo). As soon as she joins her husband at his palace, he quickly disdains her for nautch girls, and hardly hides his double life, asking her not to comment on his \"weakness\".\n\nMeanwhile, Saraswati, having forsaken his home, has been roaming the country, and reaches Pramad's mansion. His presence is made known to Kumud's father in-law, who despises his son's cheap life, and adopts the well-educated Saraswati as his secretary. The two former lovers meet, but Kumud is adamant to perform the duties of a faithful wife. Saraswati witnesses her anguished life and tries to reach out to her, but she objects. Nevertheless, things change, because Pramad\u2019s behaviour grows more openly flirtatious. Kumud requests Saraswatichandra to stay away from her personal life and asks him to leave her in-laws' house. Determined to do whatever it takes to make her life easier, Saraswati decides to leave Kumud's life. On his way he is caught by dacoits and left for dead in the sun. A group of holy men spot him and take him away to their hermitage where he starts leading the life of a recluse.\n\nThings darken for Kumud. She's chased away from Pramad\u2019s mansion after he discovers one of Saraswati's letters. This gives Pramad the pretext he's been looking for: she must go back to her mother's house. Kumud's dignified attitude has earned her the friendship of women in her in-laws\u2019 household, and they reveal to Pramad\u2019s parents that he has chased his wife out of lust and selfishness. Pramad is thrown out of his house and he vows never to return. After leaving her in-laws' house, a disheartened Kumud tries to drown in the river but is retrieved by some holy women on the banks. They take her to the same temple where Saraswati is trying to atone for his sins. \n\nThe two lovers come face to face for one more time. Kumud submits to her fate and accepts the senior sister\u2019s advice that she must do something for Saraswati. The latter, on the other hand, has a mission to fulfill: told by the guru that Pramad is dead, he will have to break the news to Kumud. A (very static) meeting is organised: after having realised that their fate has again brought them together, they admit that they are made for each other, and love blossoms between them. But Kumud doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s a widow, and still hangs on to the hope that she might change her husband.\n\nWhen Saraswati reluctantly tells her, he faces a new Kumud, who must now embrace the widow\u2019s status. The film ends with Saraswati accepting Kumud's request of marrying her younger sister, Kusum.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nutan]] as Kumud Sundari\n* Manish as Saraswati Chandra / Navin Chander\n* Vijaya Choudhury as Kusum\n* [[Ramesh Deo]] as Pramad\n* [[Sulochana Latkar]] as Kumud's mother\n* [[B.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]] announcing in March that it would be the series finale. The season premiered on October 15, 2019 and featured the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series finale on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' follows billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William]] and [[Mia Smoak|Mia]], exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy.\n\nThe series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] had been featured in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' from 2006 to 2011, on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. ''Arrow'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. The series has received several awards and multiple nominations.\n\nIn October 2014, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series titled ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' premiered.<ref name=\"Season3Premiere\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |title=The CW Announces Fall Premiere Dates |work=TV by the Numbers |date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=June 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161634/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was the first extension of the shared universe that would be known as the \"Arrowverse\".

We're so excited to reach into [the DC comics] roster and take some of these lesser-known characters that are beloved by fans, and do our spin on the characters.\"<ref name=\"GKints\" />\n\nAhead of the 100th episode, Guggenheim talked about the commitment to quality the series strives for, stating, \"We never skimped on the writing, the production or in the post-process going, 'This is going to be one of those stinkers, we might as well cut our losses and move on.' We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling. We didn't do things as naturally and as elegantly as we should have.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |title=Arrow boss previews Matrix-esque 100th episode |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=November 29, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=November 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201064532/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |archive-date=December 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a [[Arrow (season 7)|seventh season]], which premiered on October 15, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |title='Riverdale,' 'Flash,' 'Supernatural' Among 10 CW Renewals |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 2, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=April 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402195748/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |archive-date=April 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |title=The CW Sets Fall Premiere Dates, Including New 'Super' Sunday |last=Swift |first=Andy |date=June 20, 2018 |work=TVLine |access-date=June 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620225706/https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |archive-date=June 20, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |title=CW Renews 'The Flash,' 'Charmed,' 'Riverdale,' 'Supernatural,' 6 More |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=January 31, 2019 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202015411/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |archive-date=February 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> On March 6, 2019, it was announced that it season would be the final season of the series, with an abbreviated ten-episode run.

As Oliver is embracing being a hero, being a hero means stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/>\n\nCostume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers. Kreisberg said, \"What's so wonderful about the design that Maya came up with is that it really is very simple, and it feels as if it's been part of his costume since the beginning ... once we finally had this mask and put it on Stephen [Amell], even Stephen was like, 'This is the right one.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> In the episode \"Three Ghosts\", Oliver receives the mask from [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]], who is able to create a mask that will help conceal his identity, while still being functional and allowing Oliver to see clearly.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Three Ghosts |series=Arrow |credits=John Behring (director), Andrew Kreisberg & Geoff Johns (writers) |network=The CW |airdate=December 11, 2013 |season=2 |episode=9 |minutes=42}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nTo compose the score for ''Arrow'', executive producer Greg Berlanti invited [[Blake Neely]], with whom he had first worked on ''[[Everwood]]''.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

Barrowman, who initially pitched the series to DC Comics as another with the ability to tell Merlyn's backstory, said he \"had a backstory in my head for Malcolm from the beginning and a lot of it has made its way into our comic and onto the screen. I think it's always been my job to help the audience relate to Malcolm in some way despite his questionable morals and evil ways.\" Executive producers Guggenheim and Kreisberg helped the Barrowmans ensure the story would fit within the continuity of the series.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]] announcing in March that it would be the series finale. The season premiered on October 15, 2019 and featured the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series finale on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' follows billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William]] and [[Mia Smoak|Mia]], exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy.\n\nThe series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] had been featured in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' from 2006 to 2011, on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. ''Arrow'' has received generally positive reviews from critics. The series has received several awards and multiple nominations.\n\nIn October 2014, a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series titled ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' premiered.<ref name=\"Season3Premiere\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |title=The CW Announces Fall Premiere Dates |work=TV by the Numbers |date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=June 26, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161634/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/06/25/the-cw-announces-fall-premiere-dates/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was the first extension of the shared universe that would be known as the \"Arrowverse\".

We're so excited to reach into [the DC comics] roster and take some of these lesser-known characters that are beloved by fans, and do our spin on the characters.\"<ref name=\"GKints\" />\n\nAhead of the 100th episode, Guggenheim talked about the commitment to quality the series strives for, stating, \"We never skimped on the writing, the production or in the post-process going, 'This is going to be one of those stinkers, we might as well cut our losses and move on.' We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling. We didn't do things as naturally and as elegantly as we should have.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |title=Arrow boss previews Matrix-esque 100th episode |last=Abrams |first=Natalie |date=November 29, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=November 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201064532/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/11/29/arrow-100-episode-spoilers |archive-date=December 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a [[Arrow (season 7)|seventh season]], which premiered on October 15, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |title='Riverdale,' 'Flash,' 'Supernatural' Among 10 CW Renewals |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=April 2, 2018 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=April 2, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402195748/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/riverdale-flash-supernatural-10-cw-renewals-1098997 |archive-date=April 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |title=The CW Sets Fall Premiere Dates, Including New 'Super' Sunday |last=Swift |first=Andy |date=June 20, 2018 |work=TVLine |access-date=June 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620225706/https://tvline.com/2018/06/20/cw-premiere-dates-fall-2018-flash-charmed-riverdale/ |archive-date=June 20, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> On January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |title=CW Renews 'The Flash,' 'Charmed,' 'Riverdale,' 'Supernatural,' 6 More |last=Goldberg |first=Lesley |date=January 31, 2019 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=January 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202015411/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cw-renews-flash-charmed-riverdale-supernatural-6-more-1181714 |archive-date=February 2, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> On March 6, 2019, it was announced that it season would be the final season of the series, with an abbreviated ten-episode run.

As Oliver is embracing being a hero, being a hero means stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\"/>\n\nCostume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers. Kreisberg said, \"What's so wonderful about the design that Maya came up with is that it really is very simple, and it feels as if it's been part of his costume since the beginning ... once we finally had this mask and put it on Stephen [Amell], even Stephen was like, 'This is the right one.{{' \"}}<ref name=\"S2mask\"/> In the episode \"Three Ghosts\", Oliver receives the mask from [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]], who is able to create a mask that will help conceal his identity, while still being functional and allowing Oliver to see clearly.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Three Ghosts |series=Arrow |credits=John Behring (director), Andrew Kreisberg & Geoff Johns (writers) |network=The CW |airdate=December 11, 2013 |season=2 |episode=9 |minutes=42}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nTo compose the score for ''Arrow'', executive producer Greg Berlanti invited [[Blake Neely]], with whom he had first worked on ''[[Everwood]]''.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

Barrowman, who initially pitched the series to DC Comics as another with the ability to tell Merlyn's backstory, said he \"had a backstory in my head for Malcolm from the beginning and a lot of it has made its way into our comic and onto the screen. I think it's always been my job to help the audience relate to Malcolm in some way despite his questionable morals and evil ways.\" Executive producers Guggenheim and Kreisberg helped the Barrowmans ensure the story would fit within the continuity of the series.
