Due to additional restrictions in movement and travel it has become very hard for students to return to their home country.\n\n==== Postgraduate education ====\n\n==== Vocational education ====\n\n== Recommended alternatives ==\n[[UNESCO]] is sharing 10 recommendations during this period:\n\n# '''Examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools:''' Decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies, internet connectivity, and digital skills of teachers and students. This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.\n# '''Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes:''' Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.\n# '''Protect data privacy and data security:''' Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students\u2019 data privacy.\n# '''Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching:''' Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.\n# '''Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes:''' Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students\u2019 knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.\n# '''Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools:''' Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.\n# '''Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms:''' Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.\n# '''Develop distance learning rules and monitor students\u2019 learning process:''' Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning. Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students\u2019 learning process. Try to use tools to support submission of students\u2019 feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students\u2019 feedback\n# '''Define the duration of distance learning units based on students\u2019 self-regulation skills:''' Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students\u2019 self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes. Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students. \n# '''Create communities and enhance connection:''' Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures|title=How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures|date=2020-03-06|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine|Education}}\n*[[List of major events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on science and technology]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on religion]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = 290 million students out of school due to COVID-19: UNESCO releases first global numbers and mobilizes response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence = \n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Adverse consequences of school closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures UNESCO - COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Impact of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic on education}}\n[[Category:2020 in education]]\n[[Category:Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Education]]\n[[Category:Education and health]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Impact of COVID-19 on education}}\n{{Current disaster|event=pandemic|date=March 2020}}\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic sidebar|expanded=issues}}\n{{EngvarB|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:COVID-19_school_closures.svg|right|thumb|450x450px|Learners affected by school closures caused by COVID-19 as of 23 March 2020<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures|title=COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref name=\"polandschools\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2020-03-11/poland-shuts-all-schools-museums-cinemas-for-two-weeks-due-to-coronavirus|title=Poland Shuts All Schools, Museums, Cinemas for Two Weeks Due to Coronavirus {{!}} World News {{!}} US News|author=U.S. News & World Report|author-link=U.S. News & World Report|date=11 March 2020|website=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|access-date=12 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{legend|#fdae6b|Localised school closures}}\n{{legend|#e6550d|Country-wide school closures}}]]\n\nThe  [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closures of schools and universities.\n\nAs of 28 March 2020, over 1.7 billion [[Learning|learners]] were out of school due to school closures in response to COVID-19.

Due to additional restrictions in movement and travel it has become very hard for students to return back to their home country.\n\n==== Postgraduate education ====\n\n==== Vocational education ====\n\n== Recommended alternatives ==\n[[UNESCO]] is sharing 10 recommendations during this period:\n\n# '''Examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools:''' Decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies, internet connectivity, and digital skills of teachers and students. This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.\n# '''Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes:''' Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices. Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.\n# '''Protect data privacy and data security:''' Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals. Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students\u2019 data privacy.\n# '''Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching:''' Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other. Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.\n# '''Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes:''' Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students\u2019 knowledge of prior lessons. Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents. Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines. Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.\n# '''Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools:''' Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed. Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.\n# '''Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms:''' Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning. Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.\n# '''Develop distance learning rules and monitor students\u2019 learning process:''' Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning. Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students\u2019 learning process. Try to use tools to support submission of students\u2019 feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students\u2019 feedback\n# '''Define the duration of distance learning units based on students\u2019 self-regulation skills:''' Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students\u2019 self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes. Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students. \n# '''Create communities and enhance connection:''' Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures|title=How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures|date=2020-03-06|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine|Education}}\n*[[List of major events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on science and technology]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on religion]]\n*[[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema]]\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = 290 million students out of school due to COVID-19: UNESCO releases first global numbers and mobilizes response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/290-million-students-out-school-due-covid-19-unesco-releases-first-global-numbers-and-mobilizes\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = How to plan distance learning solutions during temporary schools closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/news/how-plan-distance-learning-solutions-during-temporary-schools-closures\n| licence = \n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Adverse consequences of school closures\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = \n| documentURL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence statement URL = https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures/consequences\n| licence = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures UNESCO - COVID-19 Educational Disruption and Response]\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Impact of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic on education}}\n[[Category:2020 in education]]\n[[Category:Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Education]]\n[[Category:Education and health]]\n", "name_user": "Zarex", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: return back \u2192 return", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_on_education"}

It is the second major game in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' series and was released worldwide in March 2011. Set in the world of Thedas, introduced in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'', players assume the role of Hawke, a human mage, rogue, or warrior who arrives in the city of Kirkwall as a lowly refugee, and becomes its legendary champion over a turbulent decade of political and social conflict. In the game, players explore and engage in combat from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and gameplay. Depending on players' decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize Hawke as a friend or a rival.\n\nBioWare began the game's development during the production of ''Origins''{{'}}s [[expansion pack]] ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening|Awakening]]''. EA gave them only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, thus forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period and reuse assets. BioWare looked at players' feedback and reviews of ''Origins'', and decided to improve its gameplay, making it more action-oriented. They improved the [[Eclipse Engine]], renaming it Lycium, to enhance the game's visuals and [[lighting]], and accommodate a new art style inspired by movies like ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]''. Both [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]], who worked on ''Origins'', returned and served as lead writer and composer respectively.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics. They praised its gameplay, companions and writing, though they had mixed feelings about the storytelling structure, and the diminished focus on tactics and strategy. Employing reused assets, and setting the game entirely in one city, were widely criticized. It received a more polarized response from players, though more than one million copies were sold in less than two weeks, a faster sales pace than its predecessor. A sequel, ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'' was released in November 2014.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Dragon Age 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player character Hawke and his companions combat a dragon from a [[third-person perspective]].|alt=Screenshot photograph of gameplay]]\n\n''Dragon Age II'' is an action [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]].

This forms the background story of ''Dragon Age II''. The main story has a linear [[frame narrative]], unfolding through flashbacks from the perspective of [[Varric Tethras]] ([[Brian Bloom]]), a humorous though caring storyteller and dwarf rogue whose signature weapon is a custom-made repeating crossbow he named Bianca. The protagonist is Hawke (voiced by either Nicholas Boulton or [[Jo Wyatt]]), whose gender, first name, appearance, and class type is player-determined. During the events of ''Origins,'' Hawke fled the nation of Ferelden as a refugee to the city state of Kirkwall. There they eventually grew in power and influence to become the legendary \"Champion of Kirkwall\", and the center of events that change the course of history. Varric, Hawke's companion, relates the Champion's \"true story\" to his interrogator [[Cassandra Pentaghast]] ([[Miranda Raison]]), mainly based on the protagonist's choices. The story is told in three acts, with each act separated by a gap of almost three years. Although the story remains unaltered until the two endings, it is greatly influenced by the player's decisions.\n\nHawke can recruit up to eight companions, each of whom can be player-controlled. Along with Varric, mandatory companions include Anders ([[Adam Howden]]), a proud but mercurial mage and former Grey Warden determined to defend the mages in Kirkwall from the templars; Aveline Vallen ([[Joanna Roth]]), a pragmatic and strict warrior who rise up the ranks of the Kirkwall City Guard to become its leader; and Merrill ([[Eve Myles]]), a soft-hearted but socially awkward Dalish elven mage shunned by her clan due to her obsession with a dangerous ancient artifact as well as her use of blood magic. As well, one of Hawke's twin siblings serves as a companion for the story's first act: their sister Bethany ([[Rebekah Staton]]), a kind though timid mage who has a loving relationship with her sibling; or their brother Carver (Nico Lennon), a prideful though abrasive warrior who cares for his elder sibling but feels overshadowed by them.\n\nOptional companions include Fenris ([[Gideon Emery]]), a moody elven warrior who resents his former slaver, a Tevinter magister who wields great magical power; and Isabela (Victoria Kruger), a confident and promiscuous rogue pirate captain searching for a coveted relic. Sebastian Vael ([[Alec Newman]]), a pious human rogue archer and lay brother of the Kirkwall Chantry, can be recruited via the [[downloadable content]], ''The Exiled Prince.'' Anders, Fenris, Isabela and Merrill are romance options for Hawke of either gender, with Sebastian a chaste love interest for a female Hawke.\n\n===Plot===\nCassandra, a member of the Seekers of Truth which supervise the Templar Order, investigates whereabouts of Hawke, the \"Champion of Kirkwall\". She captures and interrogates Varric, demanding to know how Hawke started a war between the mages and templars. After he initially spun a fanciful version of Hawke's escape from the Blight which is quickly rejected by Cassandra, Varric cooperates and tells her how the Mage-Templar War really started. The story starts shortly after the [[Dragon Age: Origins#Plot|Battle of Ostagar]], with the Hawke family escaping their home village of Lothering in Ferelden with a darkspawn horde in pursuit. They are joined by Aveline, though her husband Wesley and either Bethany or Carver are killed in the process. Flemeth, a witch who can assume the form of a dragon, intervenes and helps the party escape to Kirkwall, a city across the sea, on the condition Hawke travels to a Dalish clan based in Sundermount, a mountain located near Kirkwall, and complete a task for her. Hawke enters the service of a mercenary band or smuggler group to enter Kirkwall, after which the family takes up residence in the city's Lowtown with their maternal uncle Gamlen.\n\nA year later, a prosperous opportunity presents itself to Hawke; Varric and his brother Bartrand are planning a risky but rewarding treasure hunting expedition into the perilous region of the Deep Roads. Varric partners with Hawke to acquire funding and knowledge of the region. Hawke enlists the aid of Anders, a former Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. The expedition proves both a financial success and a tragedy; the proceeds make Hawke famous and wealthy, enabling them to buy back their family mansion in Hightown. However, a very powerful magical idol made of red lyrium corrupts Bartrand's mind and causes him to betray Hawke and Varric. Additionally, Hawke's surviving sibling is either killed by the darkspawn taint, or conscripted into the Grey Wardens if they are brought along. If not, then they are conscripted either into the Circle of Mages or the Templar Order, depending on the sibling who survives.\n\nThree years later, the Viscount of Kirkwall summons Hawke to help resolve a political situation the foreign military forces of the Qunari have caused. The Qunari, who were shipwrecked in Kirkwall three years earlier, neither obey the laws of Kirkwall nor seem willing to leave in the foreseeable future, escalating tension between them and the inhabitants of Kirkwall. As well, Hawke's mother, Leandra, is murdered by a blood mage serial killer preying on Kirkwall's women. Hawke resolves to uncover \"O\", the identity of the serial killer's accomplice. Eventually, he discovers the reason the Qunari refuse to leave Kirkwall is because Isabela stole a coveted artifact from them. When she flees Kirkwall with the artifact, the Qunari leader, the Arishok, decides to attack Kirkwall and ultimately executes the Viscount. Hawke's party successfully retakes Kirkwall and, if Hawke chooses, eliminates the Arishok. For their actions, Hawke is declared the Champion of Kirkwall.\n\nOver the next three years, Kirkwall has been turned into a police state under the tyrannical rule of the Templar Order. Under the command of Knight-Commander Meredith, they aim to oppress mages for their alleged use of blood magic or any other forbidden techniques. Meredith is challenged by First Enchanter Orsino, the Circle of Magi leader in Kirkwall, who tries to topple her with public support. Constant violence between the two sides forces Hawke to intervene, during which a group of anti-Meredith rebels kidnap his surviving sibling/closest friend. Fearing for their loved ones' safety Hawke attempts to get away from the conflict. However, Anders orchestrates a massive explosion that levels the Chantry and kills Grand Cleric Elthina. This triggers a final decisive battle between the mages and templars across the city, as Meredith is determined proceed with a mass extermination of mages in Kirkwall as a result of Elthina's death, forcing Hawke to choose a side. They end up killing both Orsino, who is surmised to have been \"O\", and Meredith, who bought the lyrium idol from Bartrand and is driven mad by her paranoid delusions. Afterwards, Hawke either leaves Kirkwall as a hero to mages, or is elected Viscount of Kirkwall.\n\nVarric concludes the story, saying that Hawke's companions eventually drifted apart, and Hawke eventually left Kirkwall. The Circles of Magi all over Thedas have followed Kirkwall's example and rebelled, with the Templar Order breaking away from the Chantry to fight them. Satisfied with his story, Cassandra lets Varric go and leaves with Leliana and the reformed [[Dragon Age: Inquisition|Inquisition]], believing that since both Hawke and the Hero of Ferelden (if alive) have disappeared, they must be found to stop the war.\n\n==Development==\n[[BioWare]]'s [[Edmonton]] office began development of ''Dragon Age II'' during the production of ''[[Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening]]''. Publisher [[Electronic Arts]] gave BioWare only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period.<ref name=\"recycled asset\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-25-being-the-boss-of-dragon-age|title=Being the boss of Dragon Age|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 25, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Mike Laidlaw, [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]] returned to their roles as lead designer, writer and composer respectively. The game's development was completed on February 11, 2011, with BioWare confirming it had been declared [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|gold]], indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/02/11/dragon-age-ii-goes-gold-55-mins-of-footage/?|title=Dragon Age II Goes Gold, 55 Mins Of Footage|first=John|last=Walker|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of BioWare's core goals when creating the game was to improve the formula established in ''Origins''. According to Laidlaw, the team evaluated ''Origins'' different gameplay components, especially its overly complex mechanics, and studied players' feedback.<ref name=\"spartan\"/> After learning most players never finished the early hours of ''Origins'', the team's goal was to make ''Dragon Age II'' more accessible to new players, and appeal to more players. They decided to streamline some of the game's mechanics, while retaining many conventional elements of a role-playing game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2011/02/24/laidlaw-dragon-age-2-lowers-the-entry-barriers-to-rpgs/|title=Laidlaw: Dragon Age 2 lowers the entry barriers to RPGs|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG 247]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team also looked at reviews of ''Origins'', and realized that one of the common criticisms, especially of the console versions, focused on the game's slow combat. As a result, the team looked at gameplay of [[action game]]s and sped up its combat so it would be more responsive and give more immediate responses without latency. The game's combat [[animation]] was made to be more reactive and \"stylish\" to reflect this.<ref name=\"hit harder\"/> While it became more action-orientated, the team did not completely remove the tactical aspect of ''Origins'' as they felt that would alienate its fan base. Despite this, the [[bird's-eye view]] from ''Origins'' was removed as the team wanted to create more varied scenery for players without needing to \"slice off\" the top of a room.<ref name=\"console or pc\"/> Laidlaw added the gameplay is more tactical in nature as the team overhauled the combo system which prompts players to make use of all the classes' talents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/22/gamesblog-live-mike-laidlaw-dragon-age-2|title=Bioware's Mike Laidlaw talks narrative and games as art|first=Steve|last=Boxer|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> According to Robyn Theberge, the game's development manager, the team hoped players could \"think like a general\" using Tactic, and \"fight like a spartan\" with the game's faster combat.<ref name=\"spartan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/11/11/bioware-clarifies-differences-between-pc-and-console-versions-of-dragon-age-ii/|title=BioWare on Dragon Age II combat: \"think like a general but fight like a Spartan\"|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|work=[[VG 247]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nGaider and five other writers penned the game's narrative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/our-final-dragon-age-2-interview-before-launch/|title=Our final Dragon Age 2 interview before launch!|first=Dave|last=Bradley|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team hoped to move away from ''Origins''{{'}} narrative formula. It was criticized for being a predictable and formulaic hero journey. As a result, the team decided to make the narrative more \"personal\", focusing on one character over the course of several years with a framed structure that allows the story to skip periods that do not interest players. To offer a more focused experience, the team decided to ditch players' origin stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/08/29/dragon-age-2-a-lot-of-other-choices-make-up-for-single-player-race-says-dr-ray|title=Dragon Age 2: \"A lot of other choices\" make up for single player race, says Dr Ray|first=Patrick|last=Garett|work=[[VG 247]]|date=August 29, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Inspired by ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', Hawke is fully voiced as opposed to the Warden (the silent player character in ''Origins'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-old-school-dragon-age-ii-and-its-influences-194234.phtml|title=The old school: Dragon Age II and its influences|first=Joseph|last=Leray|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The story's tone was also considered darker than its predecessor. Gaider believed this approach introduced new opportunities for storytelling, as consequences of a player's decisions can be highlighted further, and the state of the game's world can be radically changed. Laidlaw added that with choices having more impact, ''Dragon Age II'' would be BioWare's \"most reactive game\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/12/08/dragon-age-ii-may-be-our-most-reactive-game-to-date-says-bioware/|title=Dragon Age II may be \"our most reactive game to date\", says BioWare|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> There were different types of choices in the game, namely flavors, local choices and global choices. Some have little effect on the game's narrative, while others may affect the story dramatically. As players have no knowledge of the extent of the impact a choice will bring, the team hoped they had created a more individualized experience.<ref name=\"writing\"/> Like its predecessor, the choices presented were not \"black or white\", so players are motivated to do what they deem is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/07/21/good-choice-morality-and-dragon-age-ii.aspx|title=Good Choice: Morality and Dragon Age II|first=Joe|last=Juba|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=July 21, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team used an approach called a \"one-pager\", where the general overview of the story was produced; then the writers expanded the smaller components. The team also used a [[wiki]] to store the game's [[Folklore|lore]] to keep it consistent. All story content was reviewed twice.

Laidlaw added the team drew inspiration from ''[[Eternal Darkness]]'' where players get to see the city evolve as time progresses. This meant the team only had to modify the assets and did not need to create new ones.<ref name=\"recycled asset\"/>\n\nWhile ''Origins'' was developed mainly for [[personal computer]]s, BioWare developed ''Dragon Age II'' for both PCs and consoles, hoping players of both machines could enjoy the same experience.

Laidlaw admitted the team never expected the game to perform as well as ''Origins'', but he thought the title would score higher.<ref name=\"a defence\"/>\n\nSeveral critics praised the game's combat noting it was faster than its predecessor.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/><ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joe Juba of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised it for being \"responsive\" and believed the new system suited the game.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> [[IGN]]'s Kristine Steimer praised the combat, which integrated action elements and tactical features together well, for being \"entertaining\" and \"versatile\". However, she found issues with the console controls' imprecision and AI weaknesses.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Mike Sharkey of [[GameSpy]] described the gameplay as \"smooth\". He noted its improved [[user interface]], and felt it was a \"great fusion\" of both action and strategic elements, though he remarked that deploying strategy is not as necessary as before.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> [[GamesRadar]]'s Eric Neigher was disappointed by the \"cumbersome\" strategy system, which made the combat excessively straightforward.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Rich McCormick of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' liked the game's talents and abilities, saying they are \"exciting\" to use.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> VanOrd appreciated its flexibility, though he thought it was streamlined, alongside the inventory management system. Both ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s VanOrd and Juba noted there were issues with the [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] gameplay in the PC version.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"GIPRev\"/>\n\nThe game's storytelling attracted mixed responses. The use of an [[unreliable narrator]] was applauded for holding the story together in a cohesive manner by McCormick,<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> and being entertaining by Steimer.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey liked the three-act structure, comparing it to \"historical fiction reads\" that explores a \"tumultuous period in a fully realized fantasy world\".<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher thought the three-act structure delivered a \"compelling\" story, and appreciated the game's writing, calling it a step-up from ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> VanOrd disliked the game's storytelling, however, calling it a \"downward turn\" from ''Origins'' as it lacked a central goal that engaged players, thus making the story less epic than it should be. However, he remarked that there were \"heartfelt moments\", mostly associated with the game's sidequests and companions.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Juba agreed with VanOrd on the story's shortcomings, saying that there was little tension or consequences in the main story, and it felt like several side-quests stitched together. However, he praised the scenarios for being creative and inventive.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Both VanOrd and ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead noted the game drew inspiration from real-life events when the writing team created the setting and its cultural and political conflicts. Whitehead called it \"a political game\".<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/>\n\nCritics had varied opinions on the game's dialogue system. McCormick felt the lack of a morality system enabled players to pick different dialogue stances depending on different circumstances, as opposed to being funneled to role-play a certain personality.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> He praised the game's three-act structure for making choices consequential. Decisions made earlier may result in a significant difference several years later in the game. McCormick called this \"impressive\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey and Whitehead liked the choices presented, and felt they were impactful and often morally ambiguous.<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> VanOrd agreed, and attributed it to the setting's unstable political climate. He was disappointed that some choices were merely illusions, but felt there were more impactful decisions in the game than in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> However, Steimer felt there were not a lot of impactful choices in the game, and criticized the [[cliffhanger]] ending.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joseph Leray of ''[[Destructoid]]'' commented on the game's pacing, saying that \"Act I is too long, Act III is too short, and Act II feels like the climax of the game but is largely tangential to the main plot\".<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\nCritics praised the companions featured in the game. Steimer liked the background banter between the companions, saying they are \"heartwarming\" and \"hilarious\".<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey felt the characters were exceptional, calling them BioWare's best, though he was disappointed by the fact their armor could not be customized.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher also liked the companions, saying they were more fleshed out and less \"expository\".<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Both Whitehead and VanOrd felt the companions were not as interesting as the original game, though VanOrd noted their personalities are \"vivid\" nonetheless, and all the companions were excellently voiced and their lines were well-written.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/> Juba, however, found the companions superior to those in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray liked the companion quests, singling out Merill's and Aveline's as two of the best. However, he lamented the game did not offer enough opportunities to interact with its cast of companions.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\nReused assets and the game being set entirely in Kirkwall were criticized. Some critics felt the game confined players to a very small city. Steimer felt the rich lore featured in the game was wasted.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> McCormick felt the small world helped players become more thoroughly engaged in it, able to understand its culture and politics due to its small scale.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey called certain areas in the game \"carbon-copy dungeon crawls\", and was disappointed by the excessive reuse of areas.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher added that the [[backtracking]] featured in the game gave the impression it was more linear than its predecessor.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Juba felt the game's locations were \"painfully limited\", and players would get tired of them after a while.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray criticized the assets for being \"bland\", saying that reusing them made the issue even worse. Like Juba, he felt that locations would became \"stale\" as players progress, and that the city has too few people of interest or missions for players to complete.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\n===Players reaction===\nBefore the game's release, players of the original game were worried the sequel would be streamlined like ''[[Mass Effect]]''.

The employee, Chris Hoban, gave the game score of 10/10.

Game's lead writer David Gaider answered the post by saying the game is designed for everyone, ending his note with saying that \"the person who says that the only way to please them is to restrict options for others is, if you ask me, the one who deserves it least.\" The response garnered positive attention from many media outlets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.queerty.com/straight-gamers-calls-for-no-homosexuality-option-in-dragon-age-2-game-maker-responds-shut-it-20110325|title=Straight Gamer Calls For \u2018No Homosexuality Option\u2019 In Dragon Age 2.

It is the second major game in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' series and was released worldwide in March 2011. Set in the world of Thedas, introduced in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'', players assume the role of Hawke, a human mage, rogue, or warrior who arrives in the city of Kirkwall as a lowly refugee, and becomes its legendary champion over a turbulent decade of political and social conflict. In the game, players explore and engage in combat from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and gameplay. Depending on players' decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize Hawke as a friend or a rival.\n\nBioWare began the game's development during the production of ''Origins''{{'}}s [[expansion pack]] ''[[Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening|Awakening]]''. EA gave them only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, thus forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period and reuse assets. BioWare looked at players' feedback and reviews of ''Origins'', and decided to improve its gameplay, making it more action-oriented. They improved the [[Eclipse Engine]], renaming it Lycium, to enhance the game's visuals and [[lighting]], and accommodate a new art style inspired by movies like ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' and ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan]]''. Both [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]], who worked on ''Origins'', returned and served as lead writer and composer respectively.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews from critics. They praised its gameplay, companions and writing, though they had mixed feelings about the storytelling structure, and the diminished focus on tactics and strategy. Employing reused assets, and setting the game entirely in one city, were widely criticized. It received a more polarized response from players, though more than one million copies were sold in less than two weeks, a faster sales pace than its predecessor. A sequel, ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'' was released in November 2014.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Dragon Age 2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|250px|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player character Hawke and his companions combat a dragon from a [[third-person perspective]].|alt=Screenshot photograph of gameplay]]\n\n''Dragon Age II'' is an action [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]].

This forms the background story of ''Dragon Age II''. The main story has a linear [[frame narrative]], unfolding through flashbacks from the perspective of [[Varric Tethras]] ([[Brian Bloom]]), a humorous though caring storyteller and dwarf rogue whose signature weapon is a custom-made repeating crossbow he named Bianca. The protagonist is Hawke (voiced by either Nicholas Boulton or [[Jo Wyatt]]), whose gender, first name, appearance, and class type is player-determined. During the events of ''Origins,'' Hawke fled the nation of Ferelden as a refugee to the city state of Kirkwall. There they eventually grew in power and influence to become the legendary \"Champion of Kirkwall\", and the center of events that change the course of history. Varric, Hawke's companion, relates the Champion's \"true story\" to his interrogator [[Cassandra Pentaghast]] ([[Miranda Raison]]), mainly based on the protagonist's choices. The story is told in three acts, with each act separated by a gap of almost three years. Although the story remains unaltered until the two endings, it is greatly influenced by the player's decisions.\n\nHawke can recruit up to eight companions, each of whom can be player-controlled. Along with Varric, mandatory companions include Anders ([[Adam Howden]]), a proud but mercurial mage and former Grey Warden determined to defend the mages in Kirkwall from the templars; Aveline Vallen ([[Joanna Roth]]), a pragmatic and strict warrior who rise up the ranks of the Kirkwall City Guard to become its leader; and Merrill ([[Eve Myles]]), a soft-hearted but socially awkward Dalish elven mage shunned by her clan due to her obsession with a dangerous ancient artifact as well as her use of blood magic. As well, one of Hawke's twin siblings serves as a companion for the story's first act: their sister Bethany ([[Rebekah Staton]]), a kind though timid mage who has a loving relationship with her sibling; or their brother Carver (Nico Lennon), a prideful though abrasive warrior who cares for his elder sibling but feels overshadowed by them.\n\nOptional companions include Fenris ([[Gideon Emery]]), a moody elven warrior who resents his former slaver, a Tevinter magister who wields great magical power; and Isabela (Victoria Kruger), a confident and promiscuous rogue pirate captain searching for a coveted relic. Sebastian Vael ([[Alec Newman]]), a pious human rogue archer and lay brother of the Kirkwall Chantry, can be recruited via the [[downloadable content]], ''The Exiled Prince.'' Anders, Fenris, Isabela and Merrill are romance options for Hawke of either gender, with Sebastian a chaste love interest for a female Hawke.\n\n===Plot===\nCassandra, a member of the Seekers of Truth which supervise the Templar Order, investigates whereabouts of Hawke, the \"Champion of Kirkwall\". She captures and interrogates Varric, demanding to know how Hawke started a war between the mages and templars. After he initially spun a fanciful version of Hawke's escape from the Blight which is quickly rejected by Cassandra, Varric cooperates and tells her how the Mage-Templar War really started. The story starts shortly after the [[Dragon Age: Origins#Plot|Battle of Ostagar]], with the Hawke family escaping their home village of Lothering in Ferelden with a darkspawn horde in pursuit. They are joined by Aveline, though her husband Wesley and either Bethany or Carver are killed in the process. Flemeth, a witch who can assume the form of a dragon, intervenes and helps the party escape to Kirkwall, a city across the sea, on the condition Hawke travels to a Dalish clan based in Sundermount, a mountain located near Kirkwall, and complete a task for her. Hawke enters the service of a mercenary band or smuggler group to enter Kirkwall, after which the family takes up residence in the city's Lowtown with their maternal uncle Gamlen.\n\nA year later, a prosperous opportunity presents itself to Hawke; Varric and his brother Bartrand are planning a risky but rewarding treasure hunting expedition into the perilous region of the Deep Roads. Varric partners with Hawke to acquire funding and knowledge of the region. Hawke enlists the aid of Anders, a former Grey Warden who possesses knowledge of the Deep Roads. The expedition proves both a financial success and a tragedy; the proceeds make Hawke famous and wealthy, enabling them to buy back their family mansion in Hightown. However, a very powerful magical idol made of red lyrium corrupts Bartrand's mind and causes him to betray Hawke and Varric. Additionally, Hawke's surviving sibling is either killed by the darkspawn taint, or conscripted into the Grey Wardens if they are brought along. If not, then they are conscripted either into the Circle of Mages or the Templar Order, depending on the sibling who survives.\n\nThree years later, the Viscount of Kirkwall summons Hawke to help resolve a political situation the foreign military forces of the Qunari have caused. The Qunari, who were shipwrecked in Kirkwall three years earlier, neither obey the laws of Kirkwall nor seem willing to leave in the foreseeable future, escalating tension between them and the inhabitants of Kirkwall. As well, Hawke's mother, Leandra, is murdered by a blood mage serial killer preying on Kirkwall's women. Hawke resolves to uncover \"O\", the identity of the serial killer's accomplice. Eventually, he discovers the reason the Qunari refuse to leave Kirkwall is because Isabela stole a coveted artifact from them. When she flees Kirkwall with the artifact, the Qunari leader, the Arishok, decides to attack Kirkwall and ultimately executes the Viscount. Hawke's party successfully retakes Kirkwall and, if Hawke chooses, eliminates the Arishok. For their actions, Hawke is declared the Champion of Kirkwall.\n\nOver the next three years, Kirkwall has been turned into a police state under the tyrannical rule of the Templar Order. Under the command of Knight-Commander Meredith, they aim to oppress mages for their alleged use of blood magic or any other forbidden techniques. Meredith is challenged by First Enchanter Orsino, the Circle of Magi leader in Kirkwall, who tries to topple her with public support. Constant violence between the two sides forces Hawke to intervene, during which a group of anti-Meredith rebels kidnap his surviving sibling/closest friend. Fearing for their loved ones' safety Hawke attempts to get away from the conflict. However, Anders orchestrates a massive explosion that levels the Chantry and kills Grand Cleric Elthina. This triggers a final decisive battle between the mages and templars across the city, as Meredith is determined proceed with a mass extermination of mages in Kirkwall as a result of Elthina's death, forcing Hawke to choose a side. They end up killing both Orsino, who is surmised to have been \"O\", and Meredith, who bought the lyrium idol from Bartrand and is driven mad by her paranoid delusions. Afterwards, Hawke either leaves Kirkwall as a hero to mages, or is elected Viscount of Kirkwall.\n\nVarric concludes the story, saying that Hawke's companions eventually drifted apart, and Hawke eventually left Kirkwall. The Circles of Magi all over Thedas have followed Kirkwall's example and rebelled, with the Templar Order breaking away from the Chantry to fight them. Satisfied with his story, Cassandra lets Varric go and leaves with Leliana and the reformed [[Dragon Age: Inquisition|Inquisition]], believing that since both Hawke and the Hero of Ferelden (if alive) have disappeared, they must be found to stop the war.\n\n==Development==\n[[BioWare]]'s [[Edmonton]] office began development of ''Dragon Age II'' during the production of ''[[Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening]]''. Publisher [[Electronic Arts]] gave BioWare only 14 to 16 months to finish the game's development, forcing the team to [[Video game developer#Crunch time|crunch]] for an extended period.<ref name=\"recycled asset\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-25-being-the-boss-of-dragon-age|title=Being the boss of Dragon Age|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 25, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Mike Laidlaw, [[David Gaider]] and [[Inon Zur]] returned to their roles as lead designer, writer and composer respectively. The game's development was completed on February 11, 2011, with BioWare confirming it had been declared [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|gold]], indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/02/11/dragon-age-ii-goes-gold-55-mins-of-footage/?|title=Dragon Age II Goes Gold, 55 Mins Of Footage|first=John|last=Walker|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=February 11, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of BioWare's core goals when creating the game was to improve the formula established in ''Origins''. According to Laidlaw, the team evaluated ''Origins'' different gameplay components, especially its overly complex mechanics, and studied players' feedback.<ref name=\"spartan\"/> After learning most players never finished the early hours of ''Origins'', the team's goal was to make ''Dragon Age II'' more accessible to new players, and appeal to more players. They decided to streamline some of the game's mechanics, while retaining many conventional elements of a role-playing game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2011/02/24/laidlaw-dragon-age-2-lowers-the-entry-barriers-to-rpgs/|title=Laidlaw: Dragon Age 2 lowers the entry barriers to RPGs|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG 247]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team also looked at reviews of ''Origins'', and realized that one of the common criticisms, especially of the console versions, focused on the game's slow combat. As a result, the team looked at gameplay of [[action game]]s and sped up its combat so it would be more responsive and give more immediate responses without latency. The game's combat [[animation]] was made to be more reactive and \"stylish\" to reflect this.<ref name=\"hit harder\"/> While it became more action-orientated, the team did not completely remove the tactical aspect of ''Origins'' as they felt that would alienate its fan base. Despite this, the [[bird's-eye view]] from ''Origins'' was removed as the team wanted to create more varied scenery for players without needing to \"slice off\" the top of a room.<ref name=\"console or pc\"/> Laidlaw added the gameplay is more tactical in nature as the team overhauled the combo system which prompts players to make use of all the classes' talents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/22/gamesblog-live-mike-laidlaw-dragon-age-2|title=Bioware's Mike Laidlaw talks narrative and games as art|first=Steve|last=Boxer|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 22, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> According to Robyn Theberge, the game's development manager, the team hoped players could \"think like a general\" using Tactic, and \"fight like a spartan\" with the game's faster combat.<ref name=\"spartan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/11/11/bioware-clarifies-differences-between-pc-and-console-versions-of-dragon-age-ii/|title=BioWare on Dragon Age II combat: \"think like a general but fight like a Spartan\"|first=Nathan|last=Grayson|work=[[VG 247]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nGaider and five other writers penned the game's narrative.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/our-final-dragon-age-2-interview-before-launch/|title=Our final Dragon Age 2 interview before launch!|first=Dave|last=Bradley|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team hoped to move away from ''Origins''{{'}} narrative formula. It was criticized for being a predictable and formulaic hero journey. As a result, the team decided to make the narrative more \"personal\", focusing on one character over the course of several years with a framed structure that allows the story to skip periods that do not interest players. To offer a more focused experience, the team decided to ditch players' origin stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/08/29/dragon-age-2-a-lot-of-other-choices-make-up-for-single-player-race-says-dr-ray|title=Dragon Age 2: \"A lot of other choices\" make up for single player race, says Dr Ray|first=Patrick|last=Garett|work=[[VG 247]]|date=August 29, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Inspired by ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', Hawke is fully voiced as opposed to the Warden (the silent player character in ''Origins'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/the-old-school-dragon-age-ii-and-its-influences-194234.phtml|title=The old school: Dragon Age II and its influences|first=Joseph|last=Leray|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The story's tone was also considered darker than its predecessor. Gaider believed this approach introduced new opportunities for storytelling, as consequences of a player's decisions can be highlighted further, and the state of the game's world can be radically changed. Laidlaw added that with choices having more impact, ''Dragon Age II'' would be BioWare's \"most reactive game\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2010/12/08/dragon-age-ii-may-be-our-most-reactive-game-to-date-says-bioware/|title=Dragon Age II may be \"our most reactive game to date\", says BioWare|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> There were different types of choices in the game, namely flavors, local choices and global choices.

As players have no knowledge of the extent of the impact a choice will bring, the team hoped they had created a more individualized experience.<ref name=\"writing\"/> Like its predecessor, the choices presented were not \"black or white\", so players are motivated to do what they deem is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/07/21/good-choice-morality-and-dragon-age-ii.aspx|title=Good Choice: Morality and Dragon Age II|first=Joe|last=Juba|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=July 21, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> The team used an approach called a \"one-pager\", where the general overview of the story was produced; then the writers expanded the smaller components.

Laidlaw admitted the team never expected the game to perform as well as ''Origins'', but he thought the title would score higher.<ref name=\"a defence\"/>\n\nSeveral critics praised the game's combat noting it was faster than its predecessor.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/><ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joe Juba of ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised it for being \"responsive\" and believed the new system suited the game.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> [[IGN]]'s Kristine Steimer praised the combat, which integrated action elements and tactical features together well, for being \"entertaining\" and \"versatile\". However, she found issues with the console controls' imprecision and AI weaknesses.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Mike Sharkey of [[GameSpy]] described the gameplay as \"smooth\". He noted its improved [[user interface]], and felt it was a \"great fusion\" of both action and strategic elements, though he remarked that deploying strategy is not as necessary as before.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> [[GamesRadar]]'s Eric Neigher was disappointed by the \"cumbersome\" strategy system, which made the combat excessively straightforward.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Rich McCormick of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' liked the game's talents and abilities, saying they are \"exciting\" to use.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> VanOrd appreciated its flexibility, though he thought it was streamlined, alongside the inventory management system. Both ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s VanOrd and Juba noted there were issues with the [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] gameplay in the PC version.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"GIPRev\"/>\n\nThe game's storytelling attracted mixed responses. The use of an [[unreliable narrator]] was applauded for holding the story together in a cohesive manner by McCormick,<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> and being entertaining by Steimer.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey liked the three-act structure, comparing it to \"historical fiction reads\" that explores a \"tumultuous period in a fully realized fantasy world\".<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher thought the three-act structure delivered a \"compelling\" story, and appreciated the game's writing, calling it a step-up from ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> VanOrd disliked the game's storytelling, however, calling it a \"downward turn\" from ''Origins'' as it lacked a central goal that engaged players, thus making the story less epic than it should be. However, he remarked that there were \"heartfelt moments\", mostly associated with the game's sidequests and companions.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Juba agreed with VanOrd on the story's shortcomings, saying that there was little tension or consequences in the main story, and it felt like several side-quests stitched together. However, he praised the scenarios for being creative and inventive.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Both VanOrd and ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Dan Whitehead noted the game drew inspiration from real-life events when the writing team created the setting and its cultural and political conflicts. Whitehead called it \"a political game\".<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/>\n\nCritics had varied opinions on the game's dialogue system. McCormick felt the lack of a morality system enabled players to pick different dialogue stances depending on different circumstances, as opposed to being funneled to role-play a certain personality.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> He praised the game's three-act structure for making choices consequential. Decisions made earlier may result in a significant difference several years later in the game. McCormick called this \"impressive\".<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey and Whitehead liked the choices presented, and felt they were impactful and often morally ambiguous.<ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/><ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> VanOrd agreed, and attributed it to the setting's unstable political climate. He was disappointed that some choices were merely illusions, but felt there were more impactful decisions in the game than in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> However, Steimer felt there were not a lot of impactful choices in the game, and criticized the [[cliffhanger]] ending.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Joseph Leray of ''[[Destructoid]]'' commented on the game's pacing, saying that \"Act I is too long, Act III is too short, and Act II feels like the climax of the game but is largely tangential to the main plot\".<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\nCritics praised the companions featured in the game. Steimer liked the background banter between the companions, saying they are \"heartwarming\" and \"hilarious\".<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> Sharkey felt the characters were exceptional, calling them BioWare's best, though he was disappointed by the fact their armor could not be customized.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher also liked the companions, saying they were more fleshed out and less \"expository\".<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Both Whitehead and VanOrd felt the companions were not as interesting as the original game, though VanOrd noted their personalities are \"vivid\" nonetheless, and all the companions were excellently voiced and their lines were well-written.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/><ref name=\"EuroGRev\"/> Juba, however, found the companions superior to those in ''Origins''.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray liked the companion quests, singling out Merill's and Aveline's as two of the best. However, he lamented the game did not offer enough opportunities to interact with its cast of companions.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\nReused assets and the game being set entirely in Kirkwall were criticized. Some critics felt the game confined players to a very small city. Steimer felt the rich lore featured in the game was wasted.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/> McCormick felt the small world helped players become more thoroughly engaged in it, able to understand its culture and politics due to its small scale.<ref name=\"PCGUS\"/> Sharkey called certain areas in the game \"carbon-copy dungeon crawls\", and was disappointed by the excessive reuse of areas.<ref name=\"GSpyRev\"/> Neigher added that the [[backtracking]] featured in the game gave the impression it was more linear than its predecessor.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Juba felt the game's locations were \"painfully limited\", and players would get tired of them after a while.<ref name=\"GICRev\"/> Leray criticized the assets for being \"bland\", saying that reusing them made the issue even worse. Like Juba, he felt that locations would became \"stale\" as players progress, and that the city has too few people of interest or missions for players to complete.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/>\n\n===Players reaction===\nBefore the game's release, players of the original game were worried the sequel would be streamlined like ''[[Mass Effect]]''.

The company is best known for its line of interchangeable-barrel, single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson/Center also manufactures [[muzzle-loading]] rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol in his basement workshop that later became known as the Contender. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters.<ref name=\"Zwoll\">{{cite book | last = Van Zwoll | first = Wayne| title = Hunter's Guide to Long-Range Shooting | publisher = Stackpole Books| year = 2006| location = | page = 332 | isbn = }}</ref> As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle.<ref name=\"CS1\">{{cite book | last = Stephens | first = Charles| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Thompson/Center Contender Pistol: How To Tune, Time, Load, And Shoot For Accuracy | publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1996| location = Boulder, CO | pages = 64 | isbn = 978-0-87364-885-1 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Thompson/Center was purchased by [[Smith & Wesson]].<ref>[http://ir.smith-wesson.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=90977&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=942841&highlight 13009 - Smith&Wesson: Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Smith & Wesson announced that the original Rochester, New Hampshire plant would be closed and manufacturing was transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101210/GJNEWS_01/712109872/0/SEARCH|title=In Rochester: Thompson/Center Arms plant to close|first=Jake| last=O'Donnell|date= December 10, 2010|publisher=Fosters Daily Democrat}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Thompson/Center arms in Rochester, New Hampshire, Thompson Investment Casting opened in the same town continuing production of metal products for various companies including Smith & Wesson.\n\n==Break-action pistols==\nThompson/Center's success came with the emergence of long range [[handgun hunting]], target shooting, and, especially, [[metallic silhouette shooting]].<ref name=\"Layne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |last=Simpson |first=Layne |title=The Contender's Magnificent 7 |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2009 |issue=2 |date=January 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160921095258/http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Their [[break-action]], [[single-shot]] design brought [[rifle]]-like accuracy and power in a handgun, which was a new concept at the time. Originally designed only for interchangeable barrels in [[.38 Special]] and [[.22 LR]], subsequent handgun developments by Thompson/Center led to a wider range of interchangeable barrels for use with many more cartridges. Opening and closing the break-open action is accomplished by squeezing the outside bottom of the trigger guard toward the grip/buttstock, at which time the action opens, and an extractor manually extracts the cartridge.\n\n===Contender===\n{{Main|Thompson/Center Contender}}\n[[File:TC-Contender.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Contender in 45 Colt/.410 with ventilated rib]]\nThe Contender, first introduced in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle with a number of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.<ref name=\"Ayoob2012\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYmgHFwqT2gC&pg=PA266 |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=F+W Media |isbn=978-1-4402-2877-3 |pages=241\u2013266 |chapter=Thompson Center Single Shots}}</ref>\n\n===The Encore===\nThe Encore was released in 1983. The Encore uses a different trigger mechanism, designed to be stronger than the original Contender's and to make the break-action easier to open. The Encore uses a considerably larger and stronger frame than the Contender, and accordingly, is found in over 86 cartridges - ranging from [[.22 Hornet]] to the huge [[.416 Rigby]]. There has even been one pistol-length stainless barrel made in .600 Nitro Express. The Encore barrel list also includes shotgun barrels in 28, 20, and 12 gauge, and muzzleloading barrels in .45, .50 caliber, and 12 gauge using #209 shotgun primers. In 2007, Encore rimfire barrels became available in 22 LR and 17 HMR, featuring a unique monoblock design that required no alteration to the frame assembly.\n\nAn upgraded Encore is called the Pro Hunter which generally includes stocks with rubber \"Flex Tech\" inserts and are stainless or carbon steel with weather shielding. There are other slight differences among the rifles including the breech plug on muzzleloader versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |publisher=T/C Arms |title=Interchangeable Platforms |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131213062307/http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The Contender G2===\nThe original Contender, now known as the generation one (G1) Contender, was replaced by the G2 Contender soon after the Encore came out. The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2, though, uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}<!-- Dead link, no archive, no alternate source found beyond the other cited source <ref>http://tcarms.com/TC_IMAGES/TC_Catalog_2006/TC2006_Pg46-47.pdf</ref>--> and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.<ref name=\"Potts\">{{cite journal |last=Potts |first=Bruce |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Thompson Center G2 Contender Rifle Review |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2008 |issue=10 |pages= |publisher= |date=October 1, 2008 |url= | doi= |id= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the original Contender, dry-firing of the G2 Contender is possible only in the center (safe) hammer position, located on the hammer between the centerfire and rimfire positions. Also, unlike the original Contender, the break-action does not need to be opened/closed (cycled) to practice dry-firing, provided the hammer is lowered between dry firing \"shots\". The adjustability of G2 Contender triggers is also slightly different from the original G1 Contender.\n\n===General legalities===\n\nThe receiver on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is the portion of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron or telescopic sights, and even the hinge pin, are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.\n\nIt is possible to fit a shoulder stock on a pistol frame in place of a pistol grip, and, when combined with a 16\" or longer barrel (see \"Thompson Center Arms and the Supreme Court\" below), a Contender may be legally converted from a pistol to a rifle or reversed. Although it is technically possible to fit a pistol grip on an original Contender rifle frame, and use a pistol barrel to convert it from being a rifle to a pistol, this is not legal in the USA, being an illegal creation of a pistol from a rifle. In order to be able to go back and forth, the receiver must have been originally sold as a pistol, per [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] rules.\n\n====California Legalities====\n\nSee [[Gun laws in California]]\n*Possession of a Thompson Center Arms .45/.410 pistol barrel is illegal in California, for both dealers and individuals, and such a barrel may not legally be shipped into the state, or even taken into California for a hunting trip, by reason of it being classified as a short barreled shotgun (SBSG) when used with a Contender receiver.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Dangerous Weapons Control Law ARTICLE 2.

Some of the better-known models are the Renegade, the [[Hawken rifle|Hawken]], the Big Boar, and the White Mountain.\n\nThe traditional Thompson Center muzzleloaders are largely responsible for the resurgence of black powder hunting that began in the U.S. in 1970 when Warren Center designed the firm's Hawken-styled rifle. Thompson Center's reintroduced Hawken-styled rifle with solid brass hardware and an American walnut stock, styled in large part on \"plains rifles\" made by Hawken in the 1800s, has become one of the most-copied firearms designs in history.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Towsley | first = Bryce| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Mighty Hawken| journal = Hunting Magazine| volume = 15| issue = 6| pages = | publisher =Petersen | year = 2003| url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref> Thompson Center produced these rifles in the following models and calibers:\n\n'''Cherokee:'''\nBarrel: 24\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:30 (32) & 1:48 (36 & 45),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 32, 36 & 45,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued 1994,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Seneca:'''\nBarrel: 27\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:30 (32) & 1:48 (36 & 45),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 32, 36 & 45,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued 1987,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Hawken:'''\nBarrel: 28\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:48, except 1:66 on 50 cal deep button rifling,\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 45, 50 & 54,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: 45 & 54 discontinued, 50 in production, many special editions,\nIgnition: flint & percussion\n\n'''Cougar:'''\nSpecial edition of the '''Hawken''', satin finish barrel, stainless furniture, highly figured wood\n\n'''Renegade:'''\nBarrel: 26\u201d octagonal, 1:38 (50), 1:48 (50 & 54), 1: 66 (50 deep button rifling), smoothbore (56),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 50, 54 & 56, \nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued,\nIgnition: flintlock & percussion\n\n'''Big Boar:'''\nBarrel: 26\u201d octagonal, 1:48,\nTrigger: single,\nCaliber: 58,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Encore 209x50''' \nA modern design muzzleloader that can interchange with centerfire barrels.

The company is best known for its line of interchangeable-barrel, single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson/Center also manufactures [[muzzle-loading]] rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol in his basement workshop that later became known as the Contender. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters.<ref name=\"Zwoll\">{{cite book | last = Van Zwoll | first = Wayne| title = Hunter's Guide to Long-Range Shooting | publisher = Stackpole Books| year = 2006| location = | page = 332 | isbn = }}</ref> As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle.<ref name=\"CS1\">{{cite book | last = Stephens | first = Charles| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Thompson/Center Contender Pistol: How To Tune, Time, Load, And Shoot For Accuracy | publisher = Paladin Press| year = 1996| location = Boulder, CO | pages = 64 | isbn = 978-0-87364-885-1 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2007, Thompson/Center was purchased by [[Smith & Wesson]].<ref>[http://ir.smith-wesson.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=90977&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=942841&highlight 13009 - Smith&Wesson: Press Releases<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 2010, Smith & Wesson announced that the original Rochester, New Hampshire plant would be closed and manufacturing was transferred to Springfield, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20101210/GJNEWS_01/712109872/0/SEARCH|title=In Rochester: Thompson/Center Arms plant to close|first=Jake| last=O'Donnell|date= December 10, 2010|publisher=Fosters Daily Democrat}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Thompson/Center arms in Rochester, New Hampshire, Thompson Investment Casting opened in the same town continuing production of metal products for various companies including Smith & Wesson.\n\n==Break-action pistols==\nThompson/Center's success came with the emergence of long range [[handgun hunting]], target shooting, and, especially, [[metallic silhouette shooting]].<ref name=\"Layne\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |last=Simpson |first=Layne |title=The Contender's Magnificent 7 |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2009 |issue=2 |date=January 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20160921095258/http://www.shootingtimes.com/ammo/ammunition_st_magseven_200902/ |archivedate=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Their [[break-action]], [[single-shot]] design brought [[rifle]]-like accuracy and power in a handgun, which was a new concept at the time. Originally designed only for interchangeable barrels in [[.38 Special]] and [[.22 LR]], subsequent handgun developments by Thompson/Center led to a wider range of interchangeable barrels for use with many more cartridges. Opening and closing the break-open action is accomplished by squeezing the outside bottom of the trigger guard toward the grip/buttstock, at which time the action opens, and an extractor manually extracts the cartridge.\n\n===Contender===\n{{Main|Thompson/Center Contender}}\n[[File:TC-Contender.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Contender in 45 Colt/.410 with ventilated rib]]\nThe Contender, first introduced in 1967, is a break-action, single-shot pistol or rifle with a number of unique features. The first unique feature is the way the barrel is attached to the frame. By removing the fore-end, a large hinge pin is exposed; by pushing this hinge pin out, the barrel can be removed. Since the sights and extractor remain attached to the barrel in the Contender design, the frame itself contains no cartridge-specific features. A barrel of another caliber can be installed and pinned in place, the fore-end replaced, and the pistol is ready to shoot with a different barrel and pre-aligned sights. This allowed easy changes of calibers, sights, and barrel lengths, with only a flat screwdriver being required for change-out.<ref name=\"Ayoob2012\">{{cite book |last=Ayoob |first=Massad |authorlink=Massad Ayoob |title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYmgHFwqT2gC&pg=PA266 |date=May 29, 2012 |publisher=F+W Media |isbn=978-1-4402-2877-3 |pages=241\u2013266 |chapter=Thompson Center Single Shots}}</ref>\n\n===The Encore===\nThe Encore was released in 1983. The Encore uses a different trigger mechanism, designed to be stronger than the original Contender's and to make the break-action easier to open. The Encore uses a considerably larger and stronger frame than the Contender, and accordingly, is found in over 86 cartridges - ranging from [[.22 Hornet]] to the huge [[.416 Rigby]]. There has even been one pistol-length stainless barrel made in .600 Nitro Express. The Encore barrel list also includes shotgun barrels in 28, 20, and 12 gauge, and muzzleloading barrels in .45, .50 caliber, and 12 gauge using #209 shotgun primers. In 2007, Encore rimfire barrels became available in 22 LR and 17 HMR, featuring a unique monoblock design that required no alteration to the frame assembly.\n\nAn upgraded Encore is called the Pro Hunter which generally includes stocks with rubber \"Flex Tech\" inserts and are stainless or carbon steel with weather shielding. There are other slight differences among the rifles including the breech plug on muzzleloader versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |publisher=T/C Arms |title=Interchangeable Platforms |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20131213062307/http://www.tcarms.com/firearms/interchangeable-platforms/encore-pro-hunter/platform |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The Contender G2===\nThe original Contender, now known as the generation one (G1) Contender, was replaced by the G2 Contender soon after the Encore came out. The G2 Contender is essentially dimensionally the same as the original Contender, but uses an Encore style trigger group. Due to the changes in the trigger mechanism, and to differences in the angle of the grip relative to the boreline of the gun, the buttstocks and pistol grips are different between the G1 and G2 Contenders and will not interchange. The G2, though, uses essentially the same barrels and fore-ends as the original Contender{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}<!-- Dead link, no archive, no alternate source found beyond the other cited source <ref>http://tcarms.com/TC_IMAGES/TC_Catalog_2006/TC2006_Pg46-47.pdf</ref>--> and barrels will interchange, with the only two exceptions being the G2 muzzleloading barrels, which will only fit the G2 frame, and the Herrett barrels/fore-ends, which are specific for use only on a G1 frame.<ref name=\"Potts\">{{cite journal |last=Potts |first=Bruce |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Thompson Center G2 Contender Rifle Review |journal=Shooting Times |volume=2008 |issue=10 |pages= |publisher= |date=October 1, 2008 |url= | doi= |id= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nUnlike the original Contender, dry-firing of the G2 Contender is possible only in the center (safe) hammer position, located on the hammer between the centerfire and rimfire positions. Also, unlike the original Contender, the break-action does not need to be opened/closed (cycled) to practice dry-firing, provided the hammer is lowered between dry firing \"shots\". The adjustability of G2 Contender triggers is also slightly different from the original G1 Contender.\n\n===General legalities===\n\nThe receiver on a Contender, whether G1 or G2, is the portion of the combined grip/buttstock assembly containing the trigger mechanism, and this is legally considered the serial-numbered gun. Hence, barrels with iron sights, barrels with telescopic sights, and even the hinge pin, are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.\n\nIt is possible to fit a shoulder stock on a pistol frame in place of a pistol grip, and, when combined with a 16\" or longer barrel (see \"Thompson Center Arms and the Supreme Court\" below), a Contender may be legally converted from a pistol to a rifle or reversed. Although it is technically possible to fit a pistol grip on an original Contender rifle frame, and use a pistol barrel to convert it from being a rifle to a pistol, this is not legal in the USA, being an illegal creation of a pistol from a rifle. In order to be able to go back and forth, the receiver must have been originally sold as a pistol, per [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] rules.\n\n====California Legalities====\n\nSee [[Gun laws in California]]\n*Possession of a Thompson Center Arms .45/.410 pistol barrel is illegal in California, for both dealers and individuals, and such a barrel may not legally be shipped into the state, or even taken into California for a hunting trip, by reason of it being classified as a short barreled shotgun (SBSG) when used with a Contender receiver.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Dangerous Weapons Control Law ARTICLE 2.

Some of the better-known models are the Renegade, the [[Hawken rifle|Hawken]], the Big Boar, and the White Mountain.\n\nThe traditional Thompson Center muzzleloaders are largely responsible for the resurgence of black powder hunting that began in the U.S. in 1970 when Warren Center designed the firm's Hawken-styled rifle. Thompson Center's reintroduced Hawken-styled rifle with solid brass hardware and an American walnut stock, styled in large part on \"plains rifles\" made by Hawken in the 1800s, has become one of the most-copied firearms designs in history.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Towsley | first = Bryce| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Mighty Hawken| journal = Hunting Magazine| volume = 15| issue = 6| pages = | publisher =Petersen | year = 2003| url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref> Thompson Center produced these rifles in the following models and calibers:\n\n'''Cherokee:'''\nBarrel: 24\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:30 (32) & 1:48 (36 & 45),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 32, 36 & 45,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued 1994,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Seneca:'''\nBarrel: 27\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:30 (32) & 1:48 (36 & 45),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 32, 36 & 45,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued 1987,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Hawken:'''\nBarrel: 28\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:48, except 1:66 on 50 cal deep button rifling,\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 45, 50 & 54,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: 45 & 54 discontinued, 50 in production, many special editions,\nIgnition: flint & percussion\n\n'''Cougar:'''\nSpecial edition of the '''Hawken''', satin finish barrel, stainless furniture, highly figured wood\n\n'''Renegade:'''\nBarrel: 26\u201d octagonal, 1:38 (50), 1:48 (50 & 54), 1: 66 (50 deep button rifling), smoothbore (56),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 50, 54 & 56, \nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued,\nIgnition: flintlock & percussion\n\n'''Big Boar:'''\nBarrel: 26\u201d octagonal, 1:48,\nTrigger: single,\nCaliber: 58,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Encore 209x50''' \nA modern design muzzleloader that can interchange with centerfire barrels.

Malthus is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the limits to growth. Later, more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by [[Benjamin Gompertz]] and [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst|Verhulst]].\n\nIn 1855, a Belgian scholar Achille Guillard defined demography as the natural and social history of human species or the mathematical knowledge of populations, of their general changes, and of their physical, civil, intellectual and moral condition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.\n\nA [[census]] is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the [[sex ratio]]s from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.\n\nCensuses do more than just count people. They  typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital  status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship.  In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example the censuses of the [[People's Republic of China]] gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.\n[[File:World population.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of [[Country|countries]] by population]]\n[[File:World population growth - time between each billion-person growth.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rate of human population growth showing projections for later this century]]\n\n=== Indirect methods ===\nIndirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of [[historical demography]]. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.\n\nThere are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include [[models of mortality]] (including the [[life table]], [[Gompertz curve|Gompertz models]], [[Proportional hazards models|hazards models]], [[Proportional hazards models|Cox proportional hazards models]], [[Decrement table|multiple decrement life tables]], [[Brass relational logits]]), [[fertility]] ([[Hernes model]], [[Ansley J.

These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.<ref>The last three are run by the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies]</ref>\n\n== Common rates and ratios==\n\n* The '''crude [[birth rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 people.\n* The '''general [[fertility rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44).\n* The '''age-specific fertility''' rates, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.)\n* The '''crude [[death rate]]''', the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people.\n* The '''[[infant mortality rate]]''', the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1,000 live births.\n* The '''expectation of life''' (or [[life expectancy]]), the number of years that an individual at a given age could expect to live at present mortality levels.\n* The '''[[total fertility rate]]''', the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life, if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates.\n* The '''replacement level fertility''', the average number of children women must have in order to replace the population for the next generation. For example, the replacement level fertility in the US is 2.11.<ref name=\"Ela 2008\">Introduction to environmental engineering and science by Masters and Ela, 2008, Pearson Education, chapter 3</ref>\n* The '''[[gross reproduction rate]]''', the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates.\n* The '''net reproduction ratio''' is the expected number of daughters, per newborn prospective mother, who may or may not survive to and through the ages of childbearing.\n* A '''stable population''', one that has had constant crude birth and death rates for such a long period of time that the percentage of people in every age class remains constant, or equivalently, the population pyramid has an unchanging structure.<ref name=\"Ela 2008\"/>\n* A '''stationary population''', one that is both stable and unchanging in size (the difference between crude birth rate and crude death rate is zero).<ref name=\"Ela 2008\"/>\n\nA stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.<ref name=\"Ela 2008\"/>\n\nNote that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[life table]], which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.\n\n==Basic equation==\nSuppose that a country (or other entity) contains ''Population<sub>t</sub>'' persons at time ''t''.\nWhat is the size of the population at time ''t'' + 1 ?\n\n:<math>\\text{Population}_{t+1} = \\text{Population}_t + \\text{Natural Increase}_t + \\text{Net Migration}_t</math>\n\nNatural increase from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:\n\n:<math>\\text{Natural Increase}_t = \\text{Births}_t - \\text{Deaths}_t</math>\n\nNet migration from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:\n\n:<math>\\text{Net Migration}_t = \\text{Immigration}_t - \\text{Emigration}_t</math>\n\nThis basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations.  For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change.  When dealing with ethnic groups, however, \"net migration\" might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification ([[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]).  Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.<ref>See, for example, Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, \"Estimating Russification of Ethnic Identity Among Non-Russians in the USSR,\" ''Demography'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Nov., 1983): 461-489.</ref>\n\nMore generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.\n\nThe figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN \"medium\" projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |first=Wolfgang |last=Lutz |author2=Sanderson, Warren |author3=Scherbov, Sergei |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803\u2013805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559 |issue=6635 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230409/http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.\n\n===Science of population===\nPopulations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration.

Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent.  Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.<ref>Donald T.

In developed countries with good registration systems (such as the United States and much of Europe), registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths.\n\nA [[census]] is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data. A census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country. In contrast to vital statistics data, which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis, censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so, and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths. Analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place. These compare the [[sex ratio]]s from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data.\n\nCensuses do more than just count people. They  typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age, sex, marital  status, literacy/education, employment status, and occupation, and geographical location. They may also collect data on migration (or place of birth or of previous residence), language, religion, nationality (or ethnicity or race), and citizenship.  In countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete, the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality; for example the censuses of the [[People's Republic of China]] gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census.\n[[File:World population.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of [[Country|countries]] by population]]\n[[File:World population growth - time between each billion-person growth.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rate of human population growth showing projections for later this century]]\n\n=== Indirect methods ===\nIndirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available, such as is the case in much of the developing world, and most of [[historical demography]]. One of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method, where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age. With these surveys, researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population. Other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings, parents, and children. Other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography.\n\nThere are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes. They include [[models of mortality]] (including the [[life table]], [[Gompertz curve|Gompertz models]], [[Proportional hazards models|hazards models]], [[Proportional hazards models|Cox proportional hazards models]], [[Decrement table|multiple decrement life tables]], [[Brass relational logits]]), [[fertility]] ([[Hernes model]], [[Ansley J. Coale|Coale]]-Trussell models, [[parity progression ratios]]), marriage (Singulate Mean at Marriage, [[Page model]]), disability ([[Sullivan's method]], [[multistate life tables]]), [[population projections]] ([[Lee\u2013Carter model|Lee-Carter model]], the [[Leslie matrix|Leslie Matrix]]), and [[population momentum]] ([[Nathan Keyfitz|Keyfitz]]).\n\nThe United Kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies, the first three spaced apart by 12 years: the 1946 National Survey of Health and Development, the 1958 [[National Child Development Study]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Power C and Elliott J |title=Cohort profile: 1958 British Cohort Study |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=34\u201341 |year=2006 |pmid=16155052 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyi183}}</ref> the [[1970 British Cohort Study]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Elliott J and Shepherd P|title=Cohort profile: 1970 British Birth Cohort (BCS70)|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=836\u201343|year=2006 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl174 |pmid=16931528}}</ref> and the [[Millennium Cohort Study]], begun much more recently in 2000. These have followed the lives of samples of people (typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study) for many years, and are still continuing. As the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way, inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of British people in terms of their health, education, attitudes, childbearing and employment patterns.<ref>The last three are run by the [http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk Centre for Longitudinal Studies]</ref>\n\n== Common rates and ratios==\n\n* The '''crude [[birth rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 people.\n* The '''general [[fertility rate]]''', the annual number of live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44).\n* The '''age-specific fertility''' rates, the annual number of live births per 1,000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.)\n* The '''crude [[death rate]]''', the annual number of deaths per 1,000 people.\n* The '''[[infant mortality rate]]''', the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per 1,000 live births.\n* The '''expectation of life''' (or [[life expectancy]]), the number of years that an individual at a given age could expect to live at present mortality levels.\n* The '''[[total fertility rate]]''', the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life, if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates.\n* The '''replacement level fertility''', the average number of children women must have in order to replace the population for the next generation. For example, the replacement level fertility in the US is 2.11.<ref name=\"Ela 2008\">Introduction to environmental engineering and science by Masters and Ela, 2008, Pearson Education, chapter 3</ref>\n* The '''[[gross reproduction rate]]''', the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates.\n* The '''net reproduction ratio''' is the expected number of daughters, per newborn prospective mother, who may or may not survive to and through the ages of childbearing.\n* A '''stable population''', one that has had constant crude birth and death rates for such a long period of time that the percentage of people in every age class remains constant, or equivalently, the population pyramid has an unchanging structure.<ref name=\"Ela 2008\"/>\n* A '''stationary population''', one that is both stable and unchanging in size (the difference between crude birth rate and crude death rate is zero).<ref name=\"Ela 2008\"/>\n\nA stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size. It can be expanding or shrinking.<ref name=\"Ela 2008\"/>\n\nNote that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have proportionally more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[life table]], which summarizes mortality separately at each age. A life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy.\n\n==Basic equation==\nSuppose that a country (or other entity) contains ''Population<sub>t</sub>'' persons at time ''t''.\nWhat is the size of the population at time ''t'' + 1 ?\n\n:<math>\\text{Population}_{t+1} = \\text{Population}_t + \\text{Natural Increase}_t + \\text{Net Migration}_t</math>\n\nNatural increase from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:\n\n:<math>\\text{Natural Increase}_t = \\text{Births}_t - \\text{Deaths}_t</math>\n\nNet migration from time ''t'' to ''t'' + 1:\n\n:<math>\\text{Net Migration}_t = \\text{Immigration}_t - \\text{Emigration}_t</math>\n\nThis basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations.  For example, the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change.  When dealing with ethnic groups, however, \"net migration\" might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification ([[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]]).  Individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another.<ref>See, for example, Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, \"Estimating Russification of Ethnic Identity Among Non-Russians in the USSR,\" ''Demography'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Nov., 1983): 461-489.</ref>\n\nMore generally, while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition, in practice the recording and counting of events (births, deaths, immigration, emigration) and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error. So allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made.\n\nThe figure in this section shows the latest (2004) UN projections of world population out to the year 2150 (red = high, orange = medium, green = low). The UN \"medium\" projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075. Working independently, demographers at the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] in Austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |title=Doubling of world population unlikely |first=Wolfgang |last=Lutz |author2=Sanderson, Warren |author3=Scherbov, Sergei |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=803\u2013805 |date=1997-06-19 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |format=PDF |doi=10.1038/42935 |pmid=9194559 |issue=6635 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216230409/http://ace1.ma.utexas.edu/users/davis/375/reading/worldbirthrate.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> Throughout the 21st century, the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise.\n\n===Science of population===\nPopulations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality, and migration.  Fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential).<ref>[[John Bongaarts]]. The Fertility-Inhibiting Effects of the Intermediate Fertility Variables. Studies in Family Planning, Vol. 13, No. 6/7. (Jun. - Jul., 1982), pp. 179-189.</ref> Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences, and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population.  Demographers most commonly study mortality using the [[Life Table]], a statistical device that provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/pubs/pubd/lftbls/lftbls.htm N C H S - Life Tables<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nMigration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some predefined, political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements 'migrations' unless they are somewhat permanent.  Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important.<ref>Donald T. Rowland ''Demographic Methods and Concepts'' Ch. 11 {{ISBN|0-19-875263-6}}</ref>\n\nDemography is today w Great Depressionn many universities across the world, attracting students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies. Being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[economics]], [[epidemiology]], [[geography]], [[anthropology]] and [[history]], demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences. Demographic research is conducted in universities, in research institutes as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies. Population institutions are part of the [[Cicred]] (International Committee for Coordination of Demographic Research) network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the [[International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]],<ref>[http://www.iussp.org International Union for the Scientific Study of Population]</ref> or a national association such as the [[Population Association of America]] in the United States,<ref>[http://www.populationassociation.org Population Association of America]</ref> or affiliates of the Federation of Canadian Demographers in Canada.<ref>[http://www.canpopsoc.org Canadian Population Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626005822/http://www.canpopsoc.org/ |date=26 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Biodemography]]\n* [[Biodemography of human longevity]]\n* [[Demographics of the world]]\n* [[Demographic economics]]\n* [[Linguistic demography]]\n* [[Religious demography]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n* [[Gompertz\u2013Makeham law of mortality]]\n* [[List of demographics articles]]\n* [[Medieval demography]]\n* [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]] of 1974\n* [[NRS social grade]]\n* [[Population biology]]\n* [[Population geography]]\n* [[Population reconstruction]]\n* [[Population statistics]]\n* [[Replacement migration]]\n* [[Reproductive health]]\n* [[Population dynamics]]\n\n{{col-2}}\nSocial surveys:\n* [[Current Population Survey]] (CPS)\n* [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS)\n* [[European Social Survey]] (ESS)\n* [http://www.unece.org/pau/ffs/ffs.htm Family and Fertility Surveys] (FFS)\n* [[General Social Survey]] (GSS)\n* [[German General Social Survey]] ([[ALLBUS]])\n* ''German'' [[Socio-Economic Panel]] (SOEP)\n* [[National Longitudinal Survey]] (NLS)\n* [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]] (PSID)\n* [[PMA2020|Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020]] (PMA2020)\n* [[World Values Survey]] (WVS)\n* [[Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys]] (MICS)\n\nOrganizations:\n* [http://www.unpopulation.org Population Division] (DESA) (United Nations)\n* [[Office of Population Research]] (Princeton University) (United States)\n* [[Population Reference Bureau]] (United States)\n* \"[[Population Council]]\" (United States)\n* [[Population Studies Center at the University of Michigan]] (United States)\n* [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA) non-governmental research institution\n* [[Institut national d'\u00e9tudes d\u00e9mographiques]] (INED) (France)\n* [[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]] (Germany)\n* [[Vienna Institute of Demography]] (VID) (Austria)\n* [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]] (Austria)\n* [[Global Social Change Research Project]] (United States)\n\nScientific journals:\n* ''[[Brazilian Journal of Population Studies]]''\n* ''[[Demography (journal)|Demography]]''\n* \"[[Population and Development Review]]\"\n* ''[[Cahiers qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de d\u00e9mographie]]'' (''Quebec Notebooks of Demography''){{Col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Josef Ehmer]], Jens Ehrhardt, Martin Kohli (Eds.): [https://web.archive.org/web/20130527141349/http://www.gesis.org/en/hsr/current-issues/current-issues-2010-2012/362-fertility/ ''Fertility in the History of the 20th Century: Trends, Theories, Policies, Discourses''].

masterclass are deception. Achim Holub promises to give conductors: 60-90 minutes of podium time with orchestra, including 1-2 concert performances, personalized multi-angle videos, and a professional sound recording. Participants will not get anything of this. The maximum conductors can get 20 minutes of podium time, 1-2 concerts without audience and posters, and one camera video with bad quality. There are times that Achim Holub does not send the videos at all and conductors are left without videos. Achim Holub also promises to give recommendations for promoting a career.  He recommends the book 'Be Your Own Agent' by Bernhard Kerres and nothing else. Many participants think that this masterclass is also a competition. There is no competition and there is no orchestra voting. Achim Holub imitates the voting and he himself fills out all the voting sheets.\n\n== Private life & Controversy ==\nAchim Holub got married at [[Copenhagen City Hall]] in 2015 and is dividing his time between London and the family home at the [[Costa Blanca]] in Spain.  At a recent Conducting Masterclass session in London the police were called in to investigate his financial activities after complaints from the orchestra members.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the Styrian capital of [[Graz]], his first musical experiences came at an early age through his mother's, Sofia Holub's, Jazz band. His father [[Ignaz Eduard Holub]] was a highly successful, internationally active architect who had close family relations to the famous American writer [[Arthur Miller]] (Achim Holub's half-sister Doris stayed for one year with the Miller's at their home in New York State during the 1960s.)\n\nHe received his first piano tuition at the age of six, and decided, after initially being extremely attached to Jazz, to become a professional conductor at the age of twelve.

Starting from 26 February, following outbreaks [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy|in Italy]] and [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iran|in Iran]], multiple travel-related clusters appeared in Sweden. [[Transmission (medicine)#Definition and related terms|Community transmission]] was confirmed on 9 March in the [[Stockholm Regional Council|Stockholm region]].

On agency recommendation: the government has limited [[freedom of assembly]], temporarily banning gatherings of over 50 individuals and physically closed [[secondary school]]s and [[University|universities]].

Those with even minimal symptoms which could be COVID-19 are recommended to stay home. The '[[Sick leave#Sweden|''karensdag'']]' or initial day without paid [[Sick leave|sick-leave]] has been removed by the government and the length of time one can stay home without a doctor's note has been raised from 7 to 14 days.<!-- References in main text, not lead-->\n\n<!-- Case number-->\n{{As of|2020|3|30|df=EU}} 11:30 am, there were '''4028''' confirmed cases, of which '''306''' had received intensive care, and '''146''' deaths related to the newly found virus in Sweden, with [[Stockholms L\u00e4n (County)]] the most affected.<ref name=\"FHM_Official_stats\">{{Cite web|url=https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa|title=Antal fall av covid-19 i Sverige - data uppdateras dagligen kl 11.30|last=|first=|date=2020-03-30|website=Public Health Agency of Sweden \u2014 Official statistics at arcgis|publisher=[[Public Health Agency of Sweden]] (Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30|layurl=https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/aktuellt-epidemiologiskt-lage/|laysource=Antal fall av covid-19 \u2014 Statistik \u2013 antal fall covid-19|language=Swedish|quote=\"Data updated daily at 11:30 [CET]\"}}</ref><!-- Reference added for statement that is subject to frequent change-->\n\n==History==\n<!-- NOTICE -->\n<!--                          -->\n<!-- Keep this section short! -->\n<!-- Sections below are       -->\n<!-- more detailed.           -->\n<!-- Minor details can        -->\n<!-- be added to the          -->\n<!-- timeline below!          -->\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, which the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) declared a pandemic on 11 March,<ref name=\"nyt sports\">{{Cite news|last=Deb|first=Sopan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/sports/basketball/warriors-coronavirus-fans.html|title=Sports Leagues Bar Fans and Cancel Games Amid Coronavirus Outbreak|date=11 March 2020|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=12 March 2020|last2=Cacciola|first2=Scott|issn=0362-4331|last3=Stein|first3=Marc}}</ref> has had a disparate impact on different areas of Sweden.

As a political radical in the 1890s, he moved steadily to the right. In literature he attempted to define the eternal qualities of Spanish life. His essays and criticism are written in a simple, compact style. Particularly notable are his impressionistic descriptions of Castilian towns and landscape.\n\n==Early life and education==\nJos\u00e9 (\"Pepe\") Mart\u00ednez Ruiz was born in [[Monovar]], a village in the province of [[Alicante]] on 8 June 1873. Known as Pepe, he was the oldest of nine children but a lonely child who loved reading. His father, a middle-class lawyer, was an active conservative politician and later became a representative and mayor, and a follower of [[Romero Robledo]]. His mother, a landowner, was born in nearby [[Petrer]].\n\nFrom the age of eight, until he was 16, he attended a boarding school run by the Escolapius Fathers ([[Piarists]]) in his father's home town of [[Yecla]] in the province of [[Murcia]], a time he recalled as opposed to \u201ctruth, rebelliousness, and freedom\u201d in ''Memorias inmemoriales'', but also nostalgically in ''Las confesiones de un peque\u00f1o fil\u00f3sofo''.\n\nFrom 1888 to 1896 he studied law at the [[University of Valencia]], but did not complete his studies. Instead, he began to write, publishing a [[monograph]] on [[literary criticism]] in 1893. Here he began to write for local newspapers, contributing articles to the radical journal ''El pueblo'', edited by [[Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez]]. He became interested in the ideas of [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause|Karl Krause]], who argued that man could be reformed through education, and that openness to other nation's cultures could overcome national conservatism (see [[:es:Krausismo espa\u00f1ol#Objetivos|Spanish Krausism]] [in Spanish]).[[File:Ramon Casas - MNAC- Azor\u00edn- 027587-D 006575.jpg|thumb|Azor\u00edn seen by [[Ramon Casas]] ([[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]]).|alt=|left]]In 1895, Ruiz published ''Anarquistas literarios'' and ''Notas sociales'', in which he presented the main [[anarchist]] theories of the time. During this time he was a political [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]]. Ruiz became an admirer of the liberal Prime Minister [[Antonio Maura]], who fought the culture of \"[[cacique]]s\" (local political bosses), and who had become the figurehead of a youth movement, the [[Mauristas]], who wanted him as a new head of state{{cn|date=November 2016}} of Spain at a time of substantial resentment of [[King Alfonso XIII]].\n\n==Career, writing and political evolution==\nRuiz\u2019s journalism developed on moving to Madrid in 1896. He wrote for the republican newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' until he was dismissed  due to his radicalism in February 1897. He also wrote for the Paris-based anarchist magazine ''La Campa\u00f1a'', and other Spanish journals including ''El Progreso'' (\"Progress\"), and ''El Imparcial'' (\"The impartial\"). His output during this period displayed anti-establishment views, including [[anarchist]] ideas, seeing writing as a catalyst for change, and depreciating [[aesthetics]] and [[faith]].\n[[File:1922, Azor\u00edn, Juan de Echevarr\u00eda.jpg|thumb|Azor\u00edn in [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] by [[Juan de Echevarr\u00eda]] ([[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda|MNCARS]])]]\nHowever, by 1899 his outlook was beginning to change. His work began to display a new philosophical and artistic consciousness, and an interest in the past. His book ''El alma castellana'' (The Castilian Soul), and his essay collections, ''La ruta de Don Quijote'' (The Route of Don Quixote) and, much later, ''Una hora de Espa\u00f1a 1560\u20131590'' (Spain's Hour, 1560\u20131590) capture the essence of being Spanish.  He was abandoning revolutionary ideas, but becoming more [[Nihilism|nihilist]], though respecting the dignity of human beings, and using [[irony]] to stand at arm's length from the world. This pessimism would eventually lead him to a period of political [[conservatism]].\n\nIn 1902 he published the first of three intensely biographical novels, ''La voluntad'' (Volition), followed by ''Antonio Azor\u00edn'', and ''Las confesiones de un peque\u00f1o fil\u00f3sofo'' (The Confessions of a Minor Philosopher). Early in his career, Ruiz had used pen names, such as ''C\u00e1ndido'' (in honor of Voltaire) and ''Ahrim\u00e1n'' (the Persian god of destruction), and in 1904 he discarded his own name and began to use the surname of one of his characters, \"Azor\u00edn\". Using mostly short sentences, in both his fiction and his essays he emphasized the small but enduring elements and events in history and in one's life. In his view, time consisted of a series of repetitions, a notion of time described as \"timeless\".\n\nHe married Julia Guinda Urzanqui in 1908; she was to remain beside him for the rest of life and outlive him. She died in 1974 aged 98. They had no children.\n\nBy 1913 he was writing for ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', the popular pro-monarchy, conservative newspaper, including a series of articles on \u201cLa generaci\u00f3n de 1898\u201d ([[Generation of 98]]), a literary and artistic group to which he belonged.\n{{ external media | align = right | width = 258px |image1 = [http://modernismo98y14.com/images/stories/carrusel/Azorin%20por%20Zuloaga.jpg Portrait of Azor\u00edn by Zuloaga]}}\n\nRuiz served as a conservative deputy in the [[Spanish Parliament|Cortes Generales]]  from 1907 to 1919, eventually becoming an under-secretary for the Ministry of Public Instruction. He gave up politics in opposition to the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Gen. Primo de Rivera]], though he never opposed him publicly.\n\nHe had by now become noted as a drama critic and essayist. His literary criticism, such as ''Al margen de los cl\u00e1sicos'' (Marginal Notes to the Classics), ''Don Juan'' and ''Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s'', helped to open up new avenues of literary taste and to arouse a new enthusiasm for the Spanish classics at a time when a large portion of Spanish literature was virtually unavailable to the public.  In 1924, he was elected to the [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]].\n\nHis first of a dozen plays, ''Old Spain'', appeared in 1926, followed by ''Brandy mucho brandy'' and ''La comedia del arte'', but had difficulty in adapting his slow and meticulous style to the dynamics and rhythm of drama. A wry comedy about journalists increasing newspaper sales by inventing stories, ''El Clamor'' (The Cry), led to the leadership of the ''Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa'' expelling him, an act which Azor\u00edn likened to that of the [[Inquisition]]. He began to be influenced by the [[avant-garde]] movement, experimenting in a personal version of [[surrealism]] in a short trilogy, ''Lo invisible'' (The Invisible).\n[[File:El escritor Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz 'Azor\u00edn' sentado junto a un piano (1 de 1) - Fondo Mar\u00edn-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Azor\u00edn in 1928]]\nThe outbreak of the Republic saw him re-adopt his old progressive political ideals. He abandoned ''ABC'' to write for the republican newspapers ''[[El Sol (Madrid)|El Sol]]'', ''La Libertad'' and ''Ahora''). He edited ''Revista de Occidente'', founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]], a journal promoting European philosophy, from 1923 to 1936.<ref>{{cite book |title= Encyclopaedia of the Essay |editor1-last=Chevalier |editor1-first=Tracy |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |location=London |isbn= 1884964303 |page=47 |url=}}</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Spanish Civil War]], in 1936, Azor\u00edn fled to [[Paris]], where he continued his literary career writing for the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]''. A book reflecting on this period of exile, ''Espa\u00f1oles en Par\u00eds'', was published in 1939.\n\nWhen he returned to Spain on 23 August 1939, he found himself in \"inner exile\", along with other intellectuals who had not overtly supported the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime during the conflict. He was at first denied a press identification card (''tarjeta de periodista''), but was supported by [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er]], at that time Franco's Interior Minister and president of the [[Falange]]. Accepting Franco\u2019s regime was the price he had to pay in order to be admitted back, and he aligned with the dictatorship in a noted article in the right-wing journal ''V\u00e9rtice''.<ref>{{cite book |title=In Pursuit of the Natural Sign: Azor\u00edn and the Poetics of Ekphrasis |last=Jurkevich |first=Gayana |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Associated University Presses, Inc. |location=Cranbury, NJ |isbn= 0838754139 |page=162 |pages= |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV6wNgmwT4C&lpg=PP1&ots=ioFv9otW8W&dq=azorin&pg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> He contributed again to ''ABC'' from 1941 to 1962. He published numerous new works which were redolent of his earlier literary successes, including 'Pensando en Espa\u00f1a'' and ''Sintiendo Espa\u00f1a''.\n\nIn his old age, Azor\u00edn became a film enthusiast, writing numerous articles, some of which are reprinted in ''El cine y el momento'', and claiming that \"Cinema is the greatest form of art\".\n\nHe died in Madrid on March 2, 1967, at the age of 93, the longest-lived of the Generation of 98.\n\nThe political evolution that transformed Ruiz, a committed journalist as well as a revolutionary anarchist, into Azor\u00edn, a conservative member of parliament, as well as a sceptic and indulgent writer intimidated by Franco's regime, is key to understanding the division of his critics. Two different images of him were sustained, successive and irreconcilable personalities that cannot be studied at the same time without understanding the contradictions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azor\u00edn (Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz) Biographical data and intellectual evolution|url=https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25047|work=Literatur im Kontext|publisher=Universit\u00e4t Wien|accessdate=29 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121127125259/https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25047|archivedate=27 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\n* 1917, Hijo Predilecto de Mon\u00f3var.\n*1924, Elected to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]]\n* 1946, Grand Cross of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]]\n* 1956, Grand Cross of the [[Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise]].\n* 1969, His home in Mon\u00f3ver established as a museum, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205203252/http://www.obrasocial.cam.es/casamuseoazorin/ ''Casa-Museo Azor\u00edn'']\n\n== Publications<ref>{{cite web|title=Azor\u00edn (Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz) Primary bibliography|url=https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25053|work=Literatur im Kontext|publisher=Universit\u00e4t Wien|accessdate=29 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121127140144/https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25053|archivedate=27 November 2012}}</ref>  ==\n\n(Published under the pseudonym Azor\u00edn, unless otherwise indicated.)\n\n* {{cite book |title=La cr\u00edtica literaria in Espa\u00f1a |year=1893 |location=Valencia |publisher=Imprenta de Francisco Vives Mora |last=C\u00e1ndido}}\n* {{cite book |title=Morat\u00edn |year= 1893|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=C\u00e1ndido}}\n* {{cite book |title=Buscapi\u00e9s |year= 1894|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Arhim\u00e1n}}\n* {{cite book |title=Anarquistas literarios |year= 1895|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |title=Notas sociales |year= 1895|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |title=Literatura |year= 1896|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |title=Charivari |year= 1897|publisher=Imprenta Plaza del Dos de Mayo |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |year=1897 |title=Bohemia |location=Madrid |publisher= V.

As a political radical in the 1890s, he moved steadily to the right. In literature he attempted to define the eternal qualities of Spanish life. His essays and criticism are written in a simple, compact style. Particularly notable are his impressionistic descriptions of Castilian towns and landscape.\n\n==Early life and education==\nJos\u00e9 (\"Pepe\") Mart\u00ednez Ruiz was born in [[Monovar]], a village in the province of [[Alicante]] on 8 June 1873. Known as Pepe, he was the oldest of nine children but a lonely child who loved reading. His father, a middle-class lawyer, was an active conservative politician and later became a representative and mayor, and a follower of [[Romero Robledo]]. His mother, a landowner, was born in nearby [[Petrer]].\n\nFrom the age of eight, until he was 16, he attended a boarding school run by the Escolapius Fathers ([[Piarists]]) in his father's home town of [[Yecla]] in the province of [[Murcia]], a time he recalled as opposed to \u201ctruth, rebelliousness, and freedom\u201d in ''Memorias inmemoriales'', but also nostalgically in ''Las confesiones de un peque\u00f1o fil\u00f3sofo''.\n\nFrom 1888 to 1896 he studied law at the [[University of Valencia]], but did not complete his studies. Instead, he began to write, publishing a [[monograph]] on [[literary criticism]] in 1893. Here he began to write for local newspapers, contributing articles to the radical journal ''El pueblo'', edited by [[Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez]]. He became interested in the ideas of [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause|Karl Krause]], who argued that man could be reformed through education, and that openness to other nation's cultures could overcome national conservatism (see [[:es:Krausismo espa\u00f1ol#Objetivos|Spanish Krausism]] [in Spanish]).[[File:Ramon Casas - MNAC- Azor\u00edn- 027587-D 006575.jpg|thumb|Azor\u00edn seen by [[Ramon Casas]] ([[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]]).|alt=|left]]In 1895, Ruiz published ''Anarquistas literarios'' and ''Notas sociales'', in which he presented the main [[anarchist]] theories of the time. During this time he was a political [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]]. Ruiz became an admirer of the liberal Prime Minister [[Antonio Maura]], who fought the culture of \"[[cacique]]s\" (local political bosses), and who had become the figurehead of a youth movement, the [[Mauristas]], who wanted him as a new head of state{{cn|date=November 2016}} of Spain at a time of substantial resentment of [[King Alfonso XIII]].\n\n==Career, writing and political evolution==\nRuiz\u2019s journalism developed on moving to Madrid in 1896. He wrote for the republican newspaper ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'' until he was dismissed  due to his radicalism in February 1897. He also wrote for the Paris-based anarchist magazine ''La Campa\u00f1a'', and other Spanish journals including ''El Progreso'' (\"Progress\"), and ''El Imparcial'' (\"The impartial\"). His output during this period displayed anti-establishment views, including [[anarchist]] ideas, seeing writing as a catalyst for change, and depreciating [[aesthetics]] and [[faith]].\n[[File:1922, Azor\u00edn, Juan de Echevarr\u00eda.jpg|thumb|Azor\u00edn in [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] by [[Juan de Echevarr\u00eda]] ([[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda|MNCARS]])]]\nHowever, by 1899 his outlook was beginning to change. His work began to display a new philosophical and artistic consciousness, and an interest in the past. His book ''El alma castellana'' (The Castilian Soul), and his essay collections, ''La ruta de Don Quijote'' (The Route of Don Quixote) and, much later, ''Una hora de Espa\u00f1a 1560\u20131590'' (Spain's Hour, 1560\u20131590) capture the essence of being Spanish.  He was abandoning revolutionary ideas, but becoming more [[Nihilism|nihilist]], though respecting the dignity of human beings, and using [[irony]] to stand at arm's length from the world. This pessimism would eventually lead him to a period of political [[conservatism]].\n\nIn 1902 he published the first of three intensely biographical novels, ''La voluntad'' (Volition), followed by ''Antonio Azor\u00edn'', and ''Las confesiones de un peque\u00f1o fil\u00f3sofo'' (The Confessions of a Minor Philosopher). Early in his career, Ruiz had used pen names, such as ''C\u00e1ndido'' (in honor of Voltaire) and ''Ahrim\u00e1n'' (the Persian god of destruction), and in 1904 he discarded his own name and began to use the surname of one of his characters, \"Azor\u00edn\". Using mostly short sentences, in both his fiction and his essays he emphasized the small but enduring elements and events in history and in one's life. In his view, time consisted of a series of repetitions, a notion of time described as \"timeless\".\n\nHe married Julia Guinda Urzanqui in 1908; she was to remain beside him for the rest of life and outlive him. She died in 1974 aged 98. They had no children.\n\nBy 1913 he was writing for ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'', the popular pro-monarchy, conservative newspaper, including a series of articles on \u201cLa generaci\u00f3n de 1898\u201d ([[Generation of 98]]), a literary and artistic group to which he belonged.\n{{ external media | align = right | width = 258px |image1 = [http://modernismo98y14.com/images/stories/carrusel/Azorin%20por%20Zuloaga.jpg Portrait of Azor\u00edn by Zuloaga]}}\n\nRuiz served as a conservative deputy in the [[Spanish Parliament|Cortes Generales]]  from 1907 to 1919, eventually becoming an under-secretary for the Ministry of Public Instruction. He gave up politics in opposition to the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella|Gen. Primo de Rivera]], though he never opposed him publicly.\n\nHe had by now become noted as a drama critic and essayist. His literary criticism, such as ''Al margen de los cl\u00e1sicos'' (Marginal Notes to the Classics), ''Don Juan'' and ''Do\u00f1a In\u00e9s'', helped to open up new avenues of literary taste and to arouse a new enthusiasm for the Spanish classics at a time when a large portion of Spanish literature was virtually unavailable to the public.  In 1924, he was elected to the [[Royal Spanish Academy|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]].\n\nHis first of a dozen plays, ''Old Spain'', appeared in 1926, followed by ''Brandy mucho brandy'' and ''La comedia del arte'', but had difficulty in adapting his slow and meticulous style to the dynamics and rhythm of drama. A wry comedy about journalists increasing newspaper sales by inventing stories, ''El Clamor'' (The Cry), led to the leadership of the ''Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa'' expelling him, an act which Azor\u00edn likened to that of the [[Inquisition]]. He began to be influenced by the [[avant-garde]] movement, experimenting in a personal version of [[surrealism]] in a short trilogy, ''Lo invisible'' (The Invisible).\n[[File:El escritor Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz 'Azor\u00edn' sentado junto a un piano (1 de 1) - Fondo Mar\u00edn-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Azor\u00edn in 1928]]\nThe outbreak of the Republic saw him re-adopt his old progressive political ideals. He abandoned ''ABC'' to write for the republican newspapers ''[[El Sol (Madrid)|El Sol]]'', ''La Libertad'' and ''Ahora''). He edited ''Revista de Occidente'', founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]], a journal promoting European philosophy, from 1923 to 1936.<ref>{{cite book |title= Encyclopaedia of the Essay |editor1-last=Chevalier |editor1-first=Tracy |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher= Taylor & Francis |location=London |isbn= 1884964303 |page=47 |url=}}</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the [[Spanish Civil War]], in 1936, Azor\u00edn fled to [[Paris]], where he continued his literary career writing for the Argentine newspaper ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]''. A book reflecting on this period of exile, ''Espa\u00f1oles en Par\u00eds'', was published in 1939.\n\nWhen he returned to Spain on 23 August 1939, he found himself in \"inner exile\", along with other intellectuals who had not overtly supported the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime during the conflict. He was at first denied a press identification card (''tarjeta de periodista''), but was supported by [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er]], at that time Franco's Interior Minister and president of the [[Falange]]. Accepting Franco\u2019s regime was the price he had to pay in order to be admitted back, and he aligned with the dictatorship in a noted article in the right-wing journal ''V\u00e9rtice''.<ref>{{cite book |title=In Pursuit of the Natural Sign: Azor\u00edn and the Poetics of Ekphrasis |last=Jurkevich |first=Gayana |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Associated University Presses, Inc. |location=Cranbury, NJ |isbn= 0838754139 |page=162 |pages= |accessdate=September 28, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mV6wNgmwT4C&lpg=PP1&ots=ioFv9otW8W&dq=azorin&pg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> He contributed again to ''ABC'' from 1941 to 1962. He published numerous new works which were redolent of his earlier literary successes, including 'Pensando en Espa\u00f1a'' and ''Sintiendo Espa\u00f1a''.\n\nIn his old age, Azor\u00edn became a film enthusiast, writing numerous articles, some of which are reprinted in ''El cine y el momento'', and claiming that \"Cinema is the greatest form of art\".\n\nHe died in Madrid on March 2, 1967, at the age of 93, the longest-lived of the Generation of 98.\n\nThe political evolution that transformed Ruiz, a committed journalist as well as a revolutionary anarchist, into Azor\u00edn, a conservative member of parliament, as well as a sceptic and indulgent writer intimidated by Franco's regime, is key to understanding the division of his critics. Two different images of him were sustained, successive and irreconcilable personalities that cannot be studied at the same time without understanding the contradictions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Azor\u00edn (Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz) Biographical data and intellectual evolution|url=https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25047|work=Literatur im Kontext|publisher=Universit\u00e4t Wien|accessdate=29 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121127125259/https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25047|archivedate=27 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\n* 1924, Elected to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]]\n* 1946, Grand Cross of the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]]\n* 1956, Grand Cross of the [[Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise]].\n* 1969, His home in Mon\u00f3ver established as a museum, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205203252/http://www.obrasocial.cam.es/casamuseoazorin/ ''Casa-Museo Azor\u00edn'']\n\n== Publications<ref>{{cite web|title=Azor\u00edn (Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz) Primary bibliography|url=https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25053|work=Literatur im Kontext|publisher=Universit\u00e4t Wien|accessdate=29 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121127140144/https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/25053|archivedate=27 November 2012}}</ref>  ==\n\n(Published under the pseudonym Azor\u00edn, unless otherwise indicated.)\n\n* {{cite book |title=La cr\u00edtica literaria in Espa\u00f1a |year=1893 |location=Valencia |publisher=Imprenta de Francisco Vives Mora |last=C\u00e1ndido}}\n* {{cite book |title=Morat\u00edn |year= 1893|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=C\u00e1ndido}}\n* {{cite book |title=Buscapi\u00e9s |year= 1894|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Arhim\u00e1n}}\n* {{cite book |title=Anarquistas literarios |year= 1895|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |title=Notas sociales |year= 1895|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |title=Literatura |year= 1896|publisher=Librer\u00eda de Fernando F\u00e9 |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |title=Charivari |year= 1897|publisher=Imprenta Plaza del Dos de Mayo |location=Madrid |last=Ruiz}}\n* {{cite book |year=1897 |title=Bohemia |location=Madrid |publisher= V.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Fletcher|James Fletcher]] in January 1972]]\n\nIn September 1966, NASA and the Air Force released a joint study concluding that a new vehicle was required to satisfy their respective future demands, and that a partially reusable system would be the most cost-effective solution.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|164}} The head of the NASA Office of Manned Space Flight, [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]], announced the plan for a reusable shuttle on August 10, 1968. NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to [[North American Rockwell]], the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell also constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was later fit with RS-25 engines and tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]]. Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank. Subsequent missions did not use the latex coating to reduce the mass, and the external tank appeared orange.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48}}}}]]\n\nAfter it arrived at Edwards AFB, ''Enterprise'' underwent flight testing with the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a Boeing 747 that had been modified to carry the orbiter. In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built. Following the construction of ''Columbia'' (OV-102) and the conversion of ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) to a flyable spacecraft, ''Discovery'' (OV-103) and ''Atlantis'' (OV-104) were ordered in January 1979. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, NASA ordered a fifth OV, ''Endeavour'' (OV-105) in July 1987. ''Endeavour'' was primarily built from structural spares that were created during the construction of ''Discovery'' and ''Atlantis''.<ref name=challenger_report_ch3 /><ref name=\"endeavour_replacing\">{{cite web |last= Ryba |first= Jeanne |title= Endeavour |publisher= NASA |date= February 24, 2008 |url= https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/orbitersend.html |accessdate= May 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"endeavour_parts\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Endeavour: NASA's Youngest Shuttle |publisher= NASA |date= December 11, 2017 |url= https://www.space.com/18123-space-shuttle-endeavour.html |accessdate= May 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name=jenkins />{{rp|242\u2013243}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use stage-and-a-half staging, and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to [[North American Rockwell]], the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell also constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was later fit with RS-25 engines and tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]]. Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built. Following the construction of ''Columbia'' (OV-102) and the conversion of ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) to a flyable spacecraft, ''Discovery'' (OV-103) and ''Atlantis'' (OV-104) were ordered in January 1979. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, NASA ordered a fifth OV, ''Endeavour'' (OV-105) in July 1987.

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]].
