After studying at the [[Amherst College#Amherst Academy|Amherst Academy]] for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] before returning to her family's house in Amherst.\n\nEvidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/emily-dickinson-9274190|title=Emily Dickinson biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography.com |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile Dickinson was a prolific poet, only 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emily Dickinson Museum indicates only one letter and ten poems were published before her death|url=https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|website=Emilydickinson,useum.org|accessdate=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807012709/http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|archive-date=August 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique to her era. They contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use [[Half rhyme|slant rhyme]] as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.<ref name=\"Mc2\">McNeil (1986), 2.</ref> Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\n\nAlthough Dickinson's acquaintances were likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\u2014that the breadth of her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] and [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], though both heavily edited the content. A 1998 ''[[New York Times]]'' article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name \"Susan\" was often deliberately removed. At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to sister-in-law [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson]], though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/magazine/beethoven-s-hair-tells-all.html|title=Beethoven's Hair Tells All!|website=The New York Times|date=November 29, 1998}}</ref> A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H.

On an extended visit to Monson when she was two, Emily's Aunt Lavinia described Emily as \"perfectly well & contented\u2014She is a very good child & but little trouble.\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 324.</ref> Emily's aunt also noted the girl's affinity for music and her particular talent for the piano, which she called \"the ''moosic''\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 85.</ref>\n\nDickinson attended primary school in a two-story building on Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Sew337\" /> Her education was \"ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl\".<ref>Farr (2005), 1.</ref> Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to \"keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned\".<ref>Sewall (1974), 335.</ref> While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests that her mother was regularly cold and aloof.

He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none.\"<ref>Wolff (1986), 45.</ref>\n\nOn September 7, 1840, Dickinson and her sister Lavinia started together at Amherst Academy, a former boys' school that had opened to female students just two years earlier.<ref name=\"Sew337\">Sewall (1974), 337.</ref> At about the same time, her father purchased a house on North Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Hab129\">Habegger (2001), 129.</ref> Emily's brother Austin later described this large new home as the \"mansion\" over which he and Emily presided as \"lord and lady\" while their parents were absent.<ref>Sewall (1974) 322.</ref> The house overlooked Amherst's burial ground, described by one local minister as treeless and \"forbidding\".<ref name=\"Hab129\" />\n\n=== Teenage years ===\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=30%|quote=\n<poem>\nThey shut me up in Prose&nbsp;\u2013\nAs when a little Girl\nThey put me in the Closet&nbsp;\u2013\nBecause they liked me \"still\"&nbsp;\u2013\n\nStill!

When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from [[typhus]] and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized.<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that \"it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 172.</ref> She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in [[Boston]] to recover.<ref name=\"wolff77\">Wolff (1986), 77.</ref> With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies.<ref>Ford (1966), 55.</ref> During this period, she met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Huntington Gilbert]] (who later married Emily's brother Austin).\n\nIn 1845, a [[Second Great Awakening|religious revival]] took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers.<ref name=\"ford47to48\">Ford (1966), 47\u201348.</ref> Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: \"I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my Savior.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\">Habegger (2001), 168.</ref> She went on to say it was her \"greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\" /> The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years.<ref>Ford (1966), 37.</ref> After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: \"Some keep the Sabbath going to Church&nbsp;\u2013 / I keep it, staying at Home\".<ref>Johnson (1960), 153.</ref>\n\nDuring the last year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending [[Mary Lyon]]'s [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] (which later became [[Mount Holyoke College]]) in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) from Amherst.<ref>Ford (1966), 46.</ref> She stayed at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there.<ref>Sewall (1974), 368.</ref> The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick.<ref>Sewall (1974), 358.</ref> Whatever the reasons for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to \"bring [her] home at all events\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 211.</ref> Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities.<ref name=\"Pic19\">Pickard (1967), 19.</ref> She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.<ref>Habegger (2001), 213.</ref>\n\n=== Early influences and writing ===\nWhen she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester&nbsp;\u2013 in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 216.</ref> Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.<ref>Sewall (1974), 401.</ref>\n\nNewton likely introduced her to the writings of [[William Wordsworth]], and his gift to her of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\".<ref name=\"Hab221\">Habegger (2001), 221.</ref> Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of [[tuberculosis]], he wrote to her, saying he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.<ref name=\"Hab221\" /> Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862\u2014\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality&nbsp;\u2013 but venturing too near, himself&nbsp;\u2013 he never returned\"\u2014refers to Newton.<ref>Habegger (2001), 218.</ref>\n\nDickinson was familiar not only with the [[Bible]] but also with contemporary popular literature.<ref>Knapp (1989), 59.</ref> She was probably influenced by [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s ''Letters from New York'', another gift from Newton<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> (after reading it, she gushed \"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\"<ref name=\"Ford18\">Ford (1966), 18.</ref>). Her brother smuggled a copy of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[Kavanagh (novel)|Kavanagh]]'' into the house for her (because her father might disapprove)<ref>Sewall (1974), 683.</ref> and a friend lent her [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in late 1849.<ref name=\"Hab226\">Habegger (2001), 226.</ref> ''Jane Eyre''{{'}}s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], she named him \"Carlo\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog.<ref name=\"Hab226\" /> [[William Shakespeare]] was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \"Why clasp any hand but this?\" and to another, \"Why is any other book needed?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 700\u2013701.</ref>\n\n=== Adulthood and seclusion ===\nIn early 1850, Dickinson wrote that \"Amherst is alive with fun this winter&nbsp;... Oh, a very great town this is!\"<ref name=\"Pic19\" /> Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of \"brain congestion\" at age 25.<ref>Sewall (1974), 340.</ref> Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:<blockquote>some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping&nbsp;\u2013 sleeping the churchyard sleep&nbsp;\u2013 the hour of evening is sad&nbsp;\u2013 it was once my study hour&nbsp;\u2013 my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school ''alone'', make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.<ref>Sewall (1974), 341.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Homestead, Amherst, Massachusetts (from left).JPG|thumb|left|The Evergreens, built by Edward Dickinson, was the home of Austin and Susan's family.]]\nDuring the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Gilbert]]. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of \"most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser\" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed.<ref>Martin (2002), 53.</ref> In an 1882 letter to Susan, Emily said, \"With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living.\"\n\nThe importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife.<ref>Pickard (1967), 21.</ref> However, the notion of a \"cruel\" Susan\u2014as promoted by her romantic rival\u2014has been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close.<ref>Longenbach, James. (June 16, 2010.) \"[http://www.thenation.com/article/ardor-and-abyss?page=full Ardor and the Abyss]\". ''The Nation''. Retrieved June 29, 2010.</ref> Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'' Lena Koski wrote, \"Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings.\"<ref>Koski (1996), 26-31.</ref> She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, \"Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me&nbsp;... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you\u2014that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast&nbsp;... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language.\" The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film ''[[Wild Nights with Emily]]'' and explored in the TV series ''[[Dickinson (TV series)|Dickinson]]''.\n\nSue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it [[Emily Dickinson Museum#The Evergreens|the Evergreens]], a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead.<ref>Habegger (2001), 338.</ref>\n\nUntil 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home.<ref>Sewall (1974), 444.</ref> First, they spent three weeks in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where her father was representing [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district|Massachusetts]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Then they went to [[Philadelphia]] for two weeks to visit family. In Philadelphia, she met Charles Wadsworth, a famous minister of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church, with whom she forged a strong friendship which lasted until his death in 1882.<ref>Sewall (1974), 447.</ref> Despite seeing him only twice after 1855 (he moved to [[San Francisco]] in 1862), she variously referred to him as \"my Philadelphia\", \"my Clergyman\", \"my dearest earthly friend\" and \"my Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 330.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dickinson and Turner 1859 (cleaned).jpg|thumb|In September 2012, the Amherst College Archives and Special Collections unveiled this daguerreotype, proposing it to be Dickinson (left) and her friend [[Kate Scott Turner]] (ca.&nbsp;1859); it has not been authenticated.<ref>[https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/holdings/edickinson/new_daguerreotype 'The World Is Not Acquainted With Us': A New Dickinson Daguerreotype?]\" Amherst College Archives and Special Collections Website.

I Know not what to hope of her\".<ref name=\"Hab342\">Habegger (2001). 342.</ref> As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia said that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her.<ref name=\"Hab342\" /> Emily took this role as her own, and \"finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it\".<ref name=\"Hab342\" />\n\nWithdrawing more and more from the outside world, Emily began in the summer of 1858 what would be her lasting legacy. Reviewing poems she had written previously, she began making clean copies of her work, assembling carefully pieced-together manuscript books.<ref name=\"Hab353\">Habegger (2001), 353.</ref> The forty [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] she created from 1858 through 1865 eventually held nearly eight hundred poems.<ref name=\"Hab353\" /> No one was aware of the existence of these books until after her death.\n\nIn the late 1850s, the Dickinsons befriended [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles]], the owner and editor-in-chief of the ''[[Springfield Republican]]'', and his wife, Mary.<ref>Sewall (1974), 463.</ref> They visited the Dickinsons regularly for years to come. During this time Emily sent him over three dozen letters and nearly fifty poems.<ref>Sewall (1974), 473.</ref> Their friendship brought out some of her most intense writing and Bowles published a few of her poems in his journal.<ref>Habegger (2001), 376; McNeil (1986), 33.</ref> It was from 1858 to 1861 that Dickinson is believed to have written a trio of letters that have been called \"The Master Letters\".

She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not \"care for Thought\", her father bought her books, but begged her \"not to read them&nbsp;\u2013 because he fears they joggle the Mind\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 456.</ref>\n\nDickinson valued his advice, going from calling him \"Mr. Higginson\" to \"Dear friend\" as well as signing her letters, \"Your Gnome\" and \"Your Scholar\".<ref>Sewall (1974), 554\u2013555.</ref> His interest in her work certainly provided great moral support; many years later, Dickinson told Higginson that he had saved her life in 1862.<ref>Wolff (1986), 254.</ref> They corresponded until her death, but her difficulty in expressing her literary needs and a reluctance to enter into a cooperative exchange left Higginson nonplussed; he did not press her to publish in subsequent correspondence.<ref>Wolff (1986), 188.</ref> Dickinson's own ambivalence on the matter militated against the likelihood of publication.<ref>Wolff (1986), 188, 258.</ref> Literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]], in his review of Civil War literature, surmised that \"with encouragement, she would certainly have published\".<ref>Wilson (1986), 491.</ref>\n\n=== The woman in white ===\nIn direct opposition to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866.<ref>Habegger (2001), 498; Murray (1996), 286\u2013287; Murray (1999), 724-725.</ref> Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson may have been too overcome to keep up her previous level of writing.<ref>Habegger (2001), 501; Murray (1996) 286\u2013287; Murray (2010) 81-83.</ref> Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret \u00d3 Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that the Dickinsons brought in a permanent household servant, [[Margaret Maher]], to replace their former maid-of-all-work.<ref>Habegger (2001), 502; Murray (1996) 287; Murray (1999) 724-725.</ref> Emily once again was responsible for the kitchen, including cooking and cleaning up, as well as the baking at which she excelled.<ref>86.

She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face.<ref>Habegger (2001), 517.</ref> She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878\u20131882.<ref name=\"Hab516\">Habegger (2001), 516.</ref> Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person.<ref>Habegger (2001), 540.</ref> Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders.<ref>Habegger (2001), 548.</ref> Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 541.</ref> Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that \"Aunt Emily stood for ''indulgence.''\"<ref name=\"Hab547\">Habegger (2001), 547.</ref> MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called \"A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson\", thought of her as always offering support{{clarify|date=March 2019}} to the neighborhood children.<ref name=\"Hab547\" />\n\nWhen Higginson urged her to come to Boston in 1868 so they could formally meet for the first time, she declined, writing: \"Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 521.</ref> It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as \"a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair&nbsp;... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqu\u00e9 & a blue net worsted shawl.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 523.</ref> He also felt that he never was \"with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 524.</ref>\n\n=== Posies and poesies ===\nScholar Judith Farr notes that Dickinson, during her lifetime, \"was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, than as a poet\".<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> Dickinson studied botany from the age of nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> During her lifetime, she assembled a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound [[herbarium]]. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] system.<ref>Habegger (2001), 154.</ref> The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/science/emily-dickinson-lost-gardens.html|title=The Lost Gardens of Emily Dickinson|date=May 17, 2016|website=The New York Times}}</ref> Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered \"carpets of [[Lily of the Valley|lily-of-the-valley]] and [[Pansy|pansies]], platoons of [[Sweet pea|sweetpeas]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinths]], enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia.

Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but \"they valued the posy more than the poetry\".<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nOn June 16, 1874, while in Boston, Edward Dickinson suffered a stroke and died. When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28.<ref>Habegger (2001), 562.</ref> She wrote to Higginson that her father's \"Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 566.</ref> A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral [[paralysis]] and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that \"Home is so far from Home\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 569.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=25%|quote=\n<poem>\nThough the great Waters sleep,\nThat they are still the Deep,\nWe cannot doubt&nbsp;\u2013\nNo vacillating God\nIgnited this Abode\nTo put it out&nbsp;\u2013\n</poem>|source=Emily Dickinson, c. 1884<ref>Johnson (1960), 661.</ref>}}\n[[Otis Phillips Lord]], an elderly judge on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] from [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], in 1872 or 1873 became an acquaintance of Dickinson's.

In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's ''Complete Concordance to Shakespeare'' (1877).<ref>Sewall (1974), 651.</ref> Dickinson wrote that \"While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 652.</ref> She referred to him as \"My lovely Salem\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 592; Sewall (1974), 653.</ref> and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that \"Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 591.</ref>\n\nAfter being critically ill for several years, Judge Lord died in March 1884. Dickinson referred to him as \"our latest Lost\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 597.</ref> Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson's \"Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\", Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.\n\n=== Decline and death ===\nAlthough she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 604.</ref> Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.\n\n[[File:EmilyDickinsonGrave-color.jpg|thumb|left|Emily Dickinson's tombstone in the family plot]]\nThe 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as \"a lady whom the people call the ''Myth''\".<ref>Walsh (1971), 26.</ref> Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief.<ref>Habegger (2001), 612.</ref> Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote \"We were never intimate&nbsp;... while she was our Mother&nbsp;\u2013 but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 607.</ref> The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert\u2014Emily's favorite\u2014died of [[typhoid fever]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 615.</ref>\n\nAs death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote,  \"The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 623.</ref> That summer she had seen \"a great darkness coming\" and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston.<ref>Habegger (2001), 625.</ref> She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: \"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily\".<ref>Wolff (1986), 534.</ref> On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that \"the day was awful&nbsp;... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six.\"<ref name=\"Hab627\">Habegger (2001), 627.</ref> Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as [[Bright's disease]] and its duration as two and a half years.<ref>Habegger (2001), 622.</ref>\n\nLavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Emily's body upon her death. Susan also wrote Emily's obituary for the ''Springfield Republican'', ending it with four lines from one of Emily's poems: \"Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose.\" Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Sue should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly.<ref>Nell Smith (1998), 265.</ref> Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with [[Heliotropium arborescens|vanilla-scented heliotrope]], a [[lady's slipper]] [[Orchidaceae|orchid]], and a \"knot of blue field [[Viola (plant)|violets]]\" placed about it.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\">Wolff (1986), 535.</ref> The funeral service, held in the Homestead's library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", a poem by [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] that had been a favorite of Dickinson's.<ref name=\"Hab627\" /> At Dickinson's request, her \"coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups\" for burial in the family plot at [[Amherst West Cemetery|West Cemetery]] on Triangle Street.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\">Farr (2005), 3\u20136.</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\nDespite Dickinson's prolific writing, fewer than a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's ''Complete Poems'' in 1955,<ref>Ford (1966), 122</ref> Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n[[File:Emilyrepublican.jpg|thumb|right|\"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013,\" titled \"The Sleeping,\" as it was published in the ''Springfield Republican'' in 1862.]]\nA few of Dickinson's poems appeared in [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles']] ''Springfield Republican'' between 1858 and 1868.

It was the last poem published during Dickinson's lifetime.\n\n=== Posthumous ===\nAfter Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest.<ref name=\"Farr3\">Farr (1996), 3.</ref> Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published.<ref>Pickard (1967), xv.</ref> She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.<ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\" /> A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.<ref>Wolff (1986), 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Poems.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Poems'', published in 1890]]\nThe first volume of Dickinson's ''Poems,'' edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890.<ref name=\"Wol537\">Wolff (1986), 537.</ref> Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity.<ref>McNeil (1986), 34; Blake (1964), 42.</ref> The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years.<ref name=\"Wol537\" /> ''Poems: Second Series'' followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: \"The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published\".<ref>Buckingham (1989), 194.</ref>\n\nNearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson's poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;243</ref> Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.<ref>Mitchell (2009), p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n\nThe first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a complete new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson's [[variorum]] brought all of Dickinson's known poems together for the first time.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;122</ref> Johnson's goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts.<ref name=\"Martin\">Martin (2002), 17.</ref> They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely [[wikt:elliptical|elliptical]] in their language.<ref>McNeil (1986), 35.</ref> Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson's letters, also presented in three volumes.\n\nIn 1981, ''The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson'' was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.\n\nDickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in ''My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson'' (2001) that \"The consequences of the poet's failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 628.</ref>\n\n== Poetry ==\n{{Main|List of Emily Dickinson poems}}\n\nDickinson's poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.\n* '''Pre-1861'''. These are often conventional and [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimental]] in nature.<ref>Ford (1966), 68.</ref> Thomas H. Johnson, who later published ''The Poems of Emily Dickinson'', was able to date only five of Dickinson's poems before 1858.<ref name=\"Pic20\">Pickard (1967), 20.</ref> Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, one of which is about missing her brother Austin. The fifth poem, which begins \"I have a Bird in spring\", conveys her grief over the feared loss of friendship and was sent to her friend Sue Gilbert.<ref name=\"Pic20\" />\n* '''1861\u20131865'''. This was her most creative period\u2014these poems represent her most vigorous and creative work. Johnson estimated that she composed 86 poems in 1861, 366 in 1862, 141 in 1863, and 174 in 1864. He also believed that during this period, she fully developed her themes of life and mortality.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\">Johnson (1960), viii.</ref>\n* '''Post-1866'''. It is estimated that two-thirds of the entire body of her poetry was written before this year.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\" />\n\n=== Structure and syntax ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson \"Wild nights\" manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|Dickinson's handwritten manuscript of her poem \"Wild Nights&nbsp;\u2013 Wild Nights!\"]]\nThe extensive use of [[dash]]es and unconventional [[capitalization]] in Dickinson's manuscripts, and the [[idiosyncratic]] vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is \"far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed\".<ref name=\"Mc2\" /><ref name=\"Hecht153\">Hecht (1996), 153\u2013155.</ref> Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the [[ballad stanza]], a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of [[half rhyme|slant rhyme]].<ref name=\"For63\">Ford (1966), 63.</ref> In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four, while only using tetrameter for line three.\n\nSince many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the [[common meter]], employing alternating lines of [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 186.</ref> Familiar examples of such songs are \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" and \"[[Amazing Grace]]'\".\n\nDickinson scholar and poet [[Anthony Hecht]] finds resonances in Dickinson's poetry not only with hymns and song-forms but also with [[psalms]] and [[riddle]]s, citing the following example: \"Who is the East?&nbsp;/ The Yellow Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Purple if he can&nbsp;/ That carries in the Sun.&nbsp;/ Who is the West?&nbsp;/ The Purple Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Yellow if He can&nbsp;/ That lets Him out again.\"<ref name=\"Hecht153\" />\n\nLate 20th-century scholars are \"deeply interested\" by Dickinson's highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks).<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime&nbsp;\u2013 \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\", published as \"The Snake\" in the ''Republican''&nbsp;\u2013 Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:20em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not<br />\nHis notice sudden is&nbsp;\u2013\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<ref name=\"For32\">Ford (1966), 32.</ref><br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not,<br />\nHis notice sudden is.\n|\n|}\n\nAs Farr points out, \"snakes instantly notice you\"; Dickinson's version captures the \"breathless immediacy\" of the encounter; and ''The Republican''{{'}}s punctuation renders \"her lines more commonplace\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson's structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are \"aesthetically based\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page.<ref>Crumbley (1997), 14.</ref> Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n=== Major themes ===\nDickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]].<ref>Bloom (1998), 18.</ref> However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's \"relentlessly measuring mind&nbsp;... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental\".<ref>Farr (1996), 13.</ref> Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, [[irony]] and [[satire]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 171.</ref>\n\n'''Flowers and gardens''': Farr notes that Dickinson's \"poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers\" and that allusions to gardens often refer to an \"imaginative realm&nbsp;... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\">Farr (2005), 1\u20137.</ref> She associates some flowers, like [[gentian]]s and [[anemone]]s, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and [[nosegay]]s.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Farr notes that one of Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to \"conflate her poetry itself with the posies\": \"My nosegays are for Captives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Dim&nbsp;\u2013 long expectant eyes&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Fingers denied the plucking,&nbsp;/ Patient till Paradise&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To such, if they sh'd whisper&nbsp;/ Of morning and the moor&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ They bear no other errand,&nbsp;/ And I, no other prayer\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" />\n\n'''The Master poems''': Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to \"Signor\", \"Sir\" and \"Master\", who is characterized as Dickinson's \"lover for all eternity\".<ref name=\"Farr7\">Farr (1996), 7\u20138.</ref> These confessional poems are often \"searing in their self-inquiry\" and \"harrowing to the reader\" and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson's day.<ref name=\"Farr7\" /> The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals but this view is frequently rejected by scholars. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, \"human, with specific characteristics, but godlike\" and speculates that Master may be a \"kind of Christian muse\".<ref name=\"Farr7\" />\n\n'''Morbidity''': Dickinson's poems reflect her \"early and lifelong fascination\" with illness, dying and death.<ref name=\"Pollak62\">Pollak (1996), 62\u201365.</ref> Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: \"crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> She reserved her sharpest insights into the \"death blow aimed by God\" and the \"funeral in the brain\", often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar Vivian Pollak considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson's \"thirsting-starving persona\", an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail.<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> Dickinson's most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at \"the interface of murder and suicide\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" />\n\n'''Gospel poems''': Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him.<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\">Oberhaus (1996), 105\u2013119</ref> She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with \"wit and American colloquial language\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the \"salient feature uniting Christian poets&nbsp;... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ\" and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the \"poetic tradition of Christian devotion\" alongside [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]].<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: \"The Savior must have been&nbsp;/ A docile Gentleman&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To come so far so cold a Day&nbsp;/ For little Fellowmen&nbsp;/ The Road to Bethlehem&nbsp;/ Since He and I were Boys&nbsp;/ Was leveled, but for that twould be&nbsp;/ A rugged billion Miles&nbsp;\u2013\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" />\n\n'''The Undiscovered Continent''': Academic Suzanne Juhasz considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\">Juhasz (1996), 130\u2013140.</ref> Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the \"undiscovered continent\" and the \"landscape of the spirit\" and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding\u2014castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms\u2014to create a dwelling place of \"oneself\" where one resides with one's other selves.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" /> An example that brings together many of these ideas is: \"Me from Myself&nbsp;\u2013 to banish&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Had I Art&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Impregnable my Fortress&nbsp;/ Unto All Heart&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ But since myself\u2014assault Me&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ How have I peace&nbsp;/ Except by subjugating&nbsp;/ Consciousness.&nbsp;/ And since We're mutual Monarch&nbsp;/ How this be&nbsp;/ Except by Abdication&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Me&nbsp;\u2013 of Me?\".<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" />\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson\u00b4s (1830-1886) manuscript of \"A route of evanescence\" (1880).jpg|thumb|left|Dickinson wrote and sent this poem (\"A Route of Evanescence\") to Thomas Higginson in 1880.]]\nThe surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson's poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from [[William Dean Howells]], an editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality \"is that of extraordinary grasp and insight\",<ref>Blake (1964), 12.</ref> albeit \"without the proper control and chastening\" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred.<ref>Wolff (1986), 175.</ref> His judgment that her opus was \"incomplete and unsatisfactory\" would be echoed in the essays of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Maurice Thompson]], who was literary editor of ''The Independent'' for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had \"a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality\".<ref>Blake (1964), 28.</ref> Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. [[Andrew Lang]], a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that \"if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much\".<ref>Blake (1964), 37.</ref> [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in January 1892: \"It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and [[grotesque]] fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of [[William Blake|Blake]], and strongly influenced by the mannerism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]&nbsp;... But the incoherence and formlessness of her&nbsp;\u2014 versicles are fatal&nbsp;... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar\".<ref>Blake (1964), 55.</ref>\n\nCritical attention to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s.<ref>Blake (1964), vi.</ref> By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially [[modernism|modern]]. Rather than seeing Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic.<ref>Wells (1929), 243\u2013259.</ref> In a 1915 essay, [[Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant]] called the poet's inspiration \"daring\" and named her \"one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore\".<ref>Blake (1964), 89.</ref> With the growing popularity of [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poetry]] in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a [[cult following]] began to form.<ref>Blake (1964), 202.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, a number of the New Critics&nbsp;\u2013 among them [[R. P. Blackmur]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Yvor Winters]]&nbsp;\u2013 appraised the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenb\u00fcchle pointed out, their \"affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship\".<ref>Grabher (1998), 358\u2013359.</ref> Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: \"...&nbsp;she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of [[antimacassar]]s&nbsp;... She came&nbsp;... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 223.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of [[feminism]] created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 1.</ref> Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book ''This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson'', \"Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman.\" Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 9.</ref> [[Adrienne Rich]] theorized in ''Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson'' (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: \"[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed&nbsp;... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time&nbsp;... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics.\"<ref>Juhasz (1983), 10.</ref>\n\nSome scholars question the poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry.<ref>Martin (2002), 58</ref> Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and [[Martha Nell Smith]] have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.<ref>Comment (2001), 167.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as ''Emily Dickinson Face to Face'' and ''Letters of Emily Dickinson'', which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.<ref>Grabher (1998), p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nEmily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture.<ref>Martin (2002), 1.</ref> Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet.<ref>Martin (2002), 2.</ref> As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that \"If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 24.</ref> Critic [[Harold Bloom]] has placed her alongside [[Walt Whitman]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Robert Frost]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Hart Crane]] as a major American poet,<ref name=\"Bloo9\">Bloom (1999), 9</ref> and [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|in 1994]] listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.<ref>Bloom (1994), 226</ref>\n\nDickinson is taught in [[American literature]] and [[Poetry of the United States|poetry]] classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as text for art songs by composers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Nick Peros]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[Michael Tilson Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_author_texts.html?AuthorId=697 |title=Vocal music set to texts by Emily Dickinson |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |accessdate=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in [[Bozeman, Montana]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml |title=Mission Statement|publisher=Emily Dickinson School website, Bozeman, Montana |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002033911/http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml|archivedate=October 2, 2007}}</ref>[[Redmond, Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |title=The Real Emily Dickinson |publisher=Emily Dickinson Elementary School website, Redmond, Washington |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094624/http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}</ref> and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/03/M075/default.htm|title=Find a School|website=Schools.nyc.gov|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> A few literary journals\u2014including ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'', the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society\u2014have been founded to examine her work.<ref name=\"journal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/ |title=The Emily Dickinson Journal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press website, Baltimore |accessdate=December 18, 2007}}</ref> An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson was issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] on August 28, 1971 as the second stamp in the \"American Poet\" series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |title=Emily Dickinson commemorative stamps and ephemera |publisher=Harvard University Library |accessdate=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712192306/http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |archive-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dickinson was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1973.<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/emily-dickinson/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Emily Dickinson]</ref> A one-woman play titled ''[[The Belle of Amherst]]'' appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.<ref>\"[http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 Belle of Amherst] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011951/http://emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 |date=November 24, 2010 }}\".

After studying at the [[Amherst College#Amherst Academy|Amherst Academy]] for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] before returning to her family's house in Amherst.\n\nEvidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/emily-dickinson-9274190|title=Emily Dickinson biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Biography.com |access-date=August 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile Dickinson was a prolific poet, only 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emily Dickinson Museum indicates only one letter and ten poems were published before her death|url=https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|website=Emilydickinson,useum.org|accessdate=August 25, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807012709/http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/publications_lifetime|archive-date=August 7, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique to her era. They contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use [[Half rhyme|slant rhyme]] as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation.<ref name=\"Mc2\">McNeil (1986), 2.</ref> Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\n\nAlthough Dickinson's acquaintances were likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\u2014that the breadth of her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] and [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], though both heavily edited the content. A 1998 ''[[New York Times]]'' article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name \"Susan\" was often deliberately removed. At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to sister-in-law [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson]], though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/magazine/beethoven-s-hair-tells-all.html|title=Beethoven's Hair Tells All!|website=The New York Times|date=November 29, 1998}}</ref> A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H.

On an extended visit to Monson when she was two, Emily's Aunt Lavinia described Emily as \"perfectly well & contented\u2014She is a very good child & but little trouble.\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 324.</ref> Emily's aunt also noted the girl's affinity for music and her particular talent for the piano, which she called \"the ''moosic''\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 85.</ref>\n\nDickinson attended primary school in a two-story building on Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Sew337\" /> Her education was \"ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl\".<ref>Farr (2005), 1.</ref> Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to \"keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned\".<ref>Sewall (1974), 335.</ref> While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests that her mother was regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she \"always ran Home to Awe [Austin] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none.\"<ref>Wolff (1986), 45.</ref>\n\nOn September 7, 1840, Dickinson and her sister Lavinia started together at Amherst Academy, a former boys' school that had opened to female students just two years earlier.<ref name=\"Sew337\">Sewall (1974), 337.</ref> At about the same time, her father purchased a house on North Pleasant Street.<ref name=\"Hab129\">Habegger (2001), 129.</ref> Emily's brother Austin later described this large new home as the \"mansion\" over which he and Emily presided as \"lord and lady\" while their parents were absent.<ref>Sewall (1974) 322.</ref> The house overlooked Amherst's burial ground, described by one local minister as treeless and \"forbidding\".<ref name=\"Hab129\" />\n\n=== Teenage years ===\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=30%|quote=\n<poem>\nThey shut me up in Prose&nbsp;\u2013\nAs when a little Girl\nThey put me in the Closet&nbsp;\u2013\nBecause they liked me \"still\"&nbsp;\u2013\n\nStill!

When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from [[typhus]] and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized.<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that \"it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 172.</ref> She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in [[Boston]] to recover.<ref name=\"wolff77\">Wolff (1986), 77.</ref> With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies.<ref>Ford (1966), 55.</ref> During this period, she met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Huntington Gilbert]] (who later married Emily's brother Austin).\n\nIn 1845, a [[Second Great Awakening|religious revival]] took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers.<ref name=\"ford47to48\">Ford (1966), 47\u201348.</ref> Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: \"I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my Savior.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\">Habegger (2001), 168.</ref> She went on to say it was her \"greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers.\"<ref name=\"Habegger168\" /> The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years.<ref>Ford (1966), 37.</ref> After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: \"Some keep the Sabbath going to Church&nbsp;\u2013 / I keep it, staying at Home\".<ref>Johnson (1960), 153.</ref>\n\nDuring the last year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending [[Mary Lyon]]'s [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]] (which later became [[Mount Holyoke College]]) in [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], about ten miles (16&nbsp;km) from Amherst.<ref>Ford (1966), 46.</ref> She stayed at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there.<ref>Sewall (1974), 368.</ref> The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick.<ref>Sewall (1974), 358.</ref> Whatever the reasons for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to \"bring [her] home at all events\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 211.</ref> Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities.<ref name=\"Pic19\">Pickard (1967), 19.</ref> She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.<ref>Habegger (2001), 213.</ref>\n\n=== Early influences and writing ===\nWhen she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been \"with my Father two years, before going to Worcester&nbsp;\u2013 in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 216.</ref> Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.<ref>Sewall (1974), 401.</ref>\n\nNewton likely introduced her to the writings of [[William Wordsworth]], and his gift to her of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, \"whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring\".<ref name=\"Hab221\">Habegger (2001), 221.</ref> Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of [[tuberculosis]], he wrote to her, saying he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw.<ref name=\"Hab221\" /> Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862\u2014\"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality&nbsp;\u2013 but venturing too near, himself&nbsp;\u2013 he never returned\"\u2014refers to Newton.<ref>Habegger (2001), 218.</ref>\n\nDickinson was familiar not only with the [[Bible]] but also with contemporary popular literature.<ref>Knapp (1989), 59.</ref> She was probably influenced by [[Lydia Maria Child]]'s ''Letters from New York'', another gift from Newton<ref name=\"Ford18\" /> (after reading it, she gushed \"This then is a book! And there are more of them!\"<ref name=\"Ford18\">Ford (1966), 18.</ref>). Her brother smuggled a copy of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s ''[[Kavanagh (novel)|Kavanagh]]'' into the house for her (because her father might disapprove)<ref>Sewall (1974), 683.</ref> and a friend lent her [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' in late 1849.<ref name=\"Hab226\">Habegger (2001), 226.</ref> ''Jane Eyre''{{'}}s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a [[Newfoundland (dog)|Newfoundland]], she named him \"Carlo\" after the character St. John Rivers' dog.<ref name=\"Hab226\" /> [[William Shakespeare]] was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, \"Why clasp any hand but this?\" and to another, \"Why is any other book needed?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 700\u2013701.</ref>\n\n=== Adulthood and seclusion ===\nIn early 1850, Dickinson wrote that \"Amherst is alive with fun this winter&nbsp;... Oh, a very great town this is!\"<ref name=\"Pic19\" /> Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of \"brain congestion\" at age 25.<ref>Sewall (1974), 340.</ref> Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:<blockquote>some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping&nbsp;\u2013 sleeping the churchyard sleep&nbsp;\u2013 the hour of evening is sad&nbsp;\u2013 it was once my study hour&nbsp;\u2013 my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school ''alone'', make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.<ref>Sewall (1974), 341.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Homestead, Amherst, Massachusetts (from left).JPG|thumb|left|The Evergreens, built by Edward Dickinson, was the home of Austin and Susan's family.]]\nDuring the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, [[Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson|Susan Gilbert]]. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of \"most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser\" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed.<ref>Martin (2002), 53.</ref> In an 1882 letter to Susan, Emily said, \"With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living.\"\n\nThe importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife.<ref>Pickard (1967), 21.</ref> However, the notion of a \"cruel\" Susan\u2014as promoted by her romantic rival\u2014has been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close.<ref>Longenbach, James. (June 16, 2010.) \"[http://www.thenation.com/article/ardor-and-abyss?page=full Ardor and the Abyss]\". ''The Nation''. Retrieved June 29, 2010.</ref> Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'' Lena Koski wrote, \"Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings.\"<ref>Koski (1996), 26-31.</ref> She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, \"Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me&nbsp;... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you\u2014that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast&nbsp;... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language.\" The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film ''[[Wild Nights with Emily]]'' and explored in the TV series ''[[Dickinson (TV series)|Dickinson]]''.\n\nSue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it [[Emily Dickinson Museum#The Evergreens|the Evergreens]], a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead.<ref>Habegger (2001), 338.</ref>\n\nUntil 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home.<ref>Sewall (1974), 444.</ref> First, they spent three weeks in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where her father was representing [[Massachusetts's 10th congressional district|Massachusetts]] in [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret \u00d3 Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that the Dickinsons brought in a permanent household servant, [[Margaret Maher]], to replace their former maid-of-all-work.<ref>Habegger (2001), 502; Murray (1996) 287; Murray (1999) 724-725.</ref> Emily once again was responsible for the kitchen, including cooking and cleaning up, as well as the baking at which she excelled.<ref>86.

She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face.<ref>Habegger (2001), 517.</ref> She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878\u20131882.<ref name=\"Hab516\">Habegger (2001), 516.</ref> Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person.<ref>Habegger (2001), 540.</ref> Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders.<ref>Habegger (2001), 548.</ref> Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 541.</ref> Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that \"Aunt Emily stood for ''indulgence.''\"<ref name=\"Hab547\">Habegger (2001), 547.</ref> MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called \"A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson\", thought of her as always offering support{{clarify|date=March 2019}} to the neighborhood children.<ref name=\"Hab547\" />\n\nWhen Higginson urged her to come to Boston in 1868 so they could formally meet for the first time, she declined, writing: \"Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 521.</ref> It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as \"a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair&nbsp;... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqu\u00e9 & a blue net worsted shawl.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 523.</ref> He also felt that he never was \"with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 524.</ref>\n\n=== Posies and poesies ===\nScholar Judith Farr notes that Dickinson, during her lifetime, \"was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, than as a poet\".<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> Dickinson studied botany from the age of nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\" /> During her lifetime, she assembled a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound [[herbarium]]. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean]] system.<ref>Habegger (2001), 154.</ref> The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/17/science/emily-dickinson-lost-gardens.html|title=The Lost Gardens of Emily Dickinson|date=May 17, 2016|website=The New York Times}}</ref> Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered \"carpets of [[Lily of the Valley|lily-of-the-valley]] and [[Pansy|pansies]], platoons of [[Sweet pea|sweetpeas]], [[Hyacinth (plant)|hyacinths]], enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were ribbons of [[peony]] hedges and drifts of [[Narcissus (genus)|daffodils]] in season, [[Calendula|marigolds]] to distraction\u2014a butterfly utopia\".<ref name=\"Parker\">Parker, G9.</ref> In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she \"could inhabit the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Isles]] merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets\". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but \"they valued the posy more than the poetry\".<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\n=== Later life ===\nOn June 16, 1874, while in Boston, Edward Dickinson suffered a stroke and died. When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28.<ref>Habegger (2001), 562.</ref> She wrote to Higginson that her father's \"Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 566.</ref> A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral [[paralysis]] and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that \"Home is so far from Home\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 569.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=25%|quote=\n<poem>\nThough the great Waters sleep,\nThat they are still the Deep,\nWe cannot doubt&nbsp;\u2013\nNo vacillating God\nIgnited this Abode\nTo put it out&nbsp;\u2013\n</poem>|source=Emily Dickinson, c. 1884<ref>Johnson (1960), 661.</ref>}}\n[[Otis Phillips Lord]], an elderly judge on the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] from [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], in 1872 or 1873 became an acquaintance of Dickinson's.

In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's ''Complete Concordance to Shakespeare'' (1877).<ref>Sewall (1974), 651.</ref> Dickinson wrote that \"While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?\"<ref>Sewall (1974), 652.</ref> She referred to him as \"My lovely Salem\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 592; Sewall (1974), 653.</ref> and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that \"Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 591.</ref>\n\nAfter being critically ill for several years, Judge Lord died in March 1884. Dickinson referred to him as \"our latest Lost\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 597.</ref> Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson's \"Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood\", Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.\n\n=== Decline and death ===\nAlthough she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers.<ref>Habegger (2001), 604.</ref> Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.\n\n[[File:EmilyDickinsonGrave-color.jpg|thumb|left|Emily Dickinson's tombstone in the family plot]]\nThe 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with [[Mabel Loomis Todd]], an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as \"a lady whom the people call the ''Myth''\".<ref>Walsh (1971), 26.</ref> Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief.<ref>Habegger (2001), 612.</ref> Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote \"We were never intimate&nbsp;... while she was our Mother&nbsp;\u2013 but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 607.</ref> The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert\u2014Emily's favorite\u2014died of [[typhoid fever]].<ref>Habegger (2001), 615.</ref>\n\nAs death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote,  \"The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come.\"<ref>Habegger (2001), 623.</ref> That summer she had seen \"a great darkness coming\" and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston.<ref>Habegger (2001), 625.</ref> She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: \"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily\".<ref>Wolff (1986), 534.</ref> On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that \"the day was awful&nbsp;... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six.\"<ref name=\"Hab627\">Habegger (2001), 627.</ref> Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as [[Bright's disease]] and its duration as two and a half years.<ref>Habegger (2001), 622.</ref>\n\nLavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Emily's body upon her death. Susan also wrote Emily's obituary for the ''Springfield Republican'', ending it with four lines from one of Emily's poems: \"Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose.\" Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Sue should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly.<ref>Nell Smith (1998), 265.</ref> Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with [[Heliotropium arborescens|vanilla-scented heliotrope]], a [[lady's slipper]] [[Orchidaceae|orchid]], and a \"knot of blue field [[Viola (plant)|violets]]\" placed about it.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\">Wolff (1986), 535.</ref> The funeral service, held in the Homestead's library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", a poem by [[Emily Bront\u00eb]] that had been a favorite of Dickinson's.<ref name=\"Hab627\" /> At Dickinson's request, her \"coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups\" for burial in the family plot at [[Amherst West Cemetery|West Cemetery]] on Triangle Street.<ref name=\"Farr3to6\">Farr (2005), 3\u20136.</ref>\n\n== Publication ==\nDespite Dickinson's prolific writing, fewer than a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's ''Complete Poems'' in 1955,<ref>Ford (1966), 122</ref> Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.\n\n=== Contemporary ===\n[[File:Emilyrepublican.jpg|thumb|right|\"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers&nbsp;\u2013,\" titled \"The Sleeping,\" as it was published in the ''Springfield Republican'' in 1862.]]\nA few of Dickinson's poems appeared in [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles']] ''Springfield Republican'' between 1858 and 1868.

It was the last poem published during Dickinson's lifetime.\n\n=== Posthumous ===\nAfter Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest.<ref name=\"Farr3\">Farr (1996), 3.</ref> Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published.<ref>Pickard (1967), xv.</ref> She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance.<ref name=\"Wolff 1986, 535\" /> A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.<ref>Wolff (1986), 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Emily Dickinson Poems.jpg|thumb|Cover of the first edition of ''Poems'', published in 1890]]\nThe first volume of Dickinson's ''Poems,'' edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890.<ref name=\"Wol537\">Wolff (1986), 537.</ref> Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity.<ref>McNeil (1986), 34; Blake (1964), 42.</ref> The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years.<ref name=\"Wol537\" /> ''Poems: Second Series'' followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: \"The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published\".<ref>Buckingham (1989), 194.</ref>\n\nNearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson's poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;243</ref> Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.<ref>Mitchell (2009), p.&nbsp;75</ref>\n\nThe first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a complete new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson's [[variorum]] brought all of Dickinson's known poems together for the first time.<ref>Grabher (1988), p.&nbsp;122</ref> Johnson's goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts.<ref name=\"Martin\">Martin (2002), 17.</ref> They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely [[wikt:elliptical|elliptical]] in their language.<ref>McNeil (1986), 35.</ref> Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson's letters, also presented in three volumes.\n\nIn 1981, ''The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson'' was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets.<ref name=\"Martin\" /> Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.\n\nDickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in ''My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson'' (2001) that \"The consequences of the poet's failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us\".<ref>Habegger (2001), 628.</ref>\n\n== Poetry ==\n{{Main|List of Emily Dickinson poems}}\n\nDickinson's poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.\n* '''Pre-1861'''. These are often conventional and [[Sentimentalism (literature)|sentimental]] in nature.<ref>Ford (1966), 68.</ref> Thomas H. Johnson, who later published ''The Poems of Emily Dickinson'', was able to date only five of Dickinson's poems before 1858.<ref name=\"Pic20\">Pickard (1967), 20.</ref> Two of these are mock valentines done in an ornate and humorous style, and two others are conventional lyrics, one of which is about missing her brother Austin. The fifth poem, which begins \"I have a Bird in spring\", conveys her grief over the feared loss of friendship and was sent to her friend Sue Gilbert.<ref name=\"Pic20\" />\n* '''1861\u20131865'''. This was her most creative period\u2014these poems represent her most vigorous and creative work. Johnson estimated that she composed 86 poems in 1861, 366 in 1862, 141 in 1863, and 174 in 1864. He also believed that during this period, she fully developed her themes of life and mortality.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\">Johnson (1960), viii.</ref>\n* '''Post-1866'''. It is estimated that two-thirds of the entire body of her poetry was written before this year.<ref name=\"Johnsonviii\" />\n\n=== Structure and syntax ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson \"Wild nights\" manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|Dickinson's handwritten manuscript of her poem \"Wild Nights&nbsp;\u2013 Wild Nights!\"]]\nThe extensive use of [[dash]]es and unconventional [[capitalization]] in Dickinson's manuscripts, and the [[idiosyncratic]] vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is \"far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed\".<ref name=\"Mc2\" /><ref name=\"Hecht153\">Hecht (1996), 153\u2013155.</ref> Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the [[ballad stanza]], a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of [[half rhyme|slant rhyme]].<ref name=\"For63\">Ford (1966), 63.</ref> In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four, while only using tetrameter for line three.\n\nSince many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the [[common meter]], employing alternating lines of [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 186.</ref> Familiar examples of such songs are \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" and \"[[Amazing Grace]]'\".\n\nDickinson scholar and poet [[Anthony Hecht]] finds resonances in Dickinson's poetry not only with hymns and song-forms but also with [[psalms]] and [[riddle]]s, citing the following example: \"Who is the East?&nbsp;/ The Yellow Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Purple if he can&nbsp;/ That carries in the Sun.&nbsp;/ Who is the West?&nbsp;/ The Purple Man&nbsp;/ Who may be Yellow if He can&nbsp;/ That lets Him out again.\"<ref name=\"Hecht153\" />\n\nLate 20th-century scholars are \"deeply interested\" by Dickinson's highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks).<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime&nbsp;\u2013 \"A narrow Fellow in the Grass\", published as \"The Snake\" in the ''Republican''&nbsp;\u2013 Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.<ref name=\"For32\" />\n\n:{|\n| style=\"width:20em; vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap\"|\n'''Original wording'''<br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not<br />\nHis notice sudden is&nbsp;\u2013\n|\n'''''Republican'' version'''<ref name=\"For32\">Ford (1966), 32.</ref><br />\nA narrow Fellow in the Grass<br />\nOccasionally rides&nbsp;\u2013<br />\nYou may have met Him&nbsp;\u2013 did you not,<br />\nHis notice sudden is.\n|\n|}\n\nAs Farr points out, \"snakes instantly notice you\"; Dickinson's version captures the \"breathless immediacy\" of the encounter; and ''The Republican''{{'}}s punctuation renders \"her lines more commonplace\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson's structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are \"aesthetically based\".<ref name=\"Farr3\" /> Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page.<ref>Crumbley (1997), 14.</ref> Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.<ref name=\"Martin\" />\n\n=== Major themes ===\nDickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]].<ref>Bloom (1998), 18.</ref> However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's \"relentlessly measuring mind&nbsp;... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental\".<ref>Farr (1996), 13.</ref> Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, [[irony]] and [[satire]].<ref>Wolff (1986), 171.</ref>\n\n'''Flowers and gardens''': Farr notes that Dickinson's \"poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers\" and that allusions to gardens often refer to an \"imaginative realm&nbsp;... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\">Farr (2005), 1\u20137.</ref> She associates some flowers, like [[gentian]]s and [[anemone]]s, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and [[nosegay]]s.<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" /> Farr notes that one of Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to \"conflate her poetry itself with the posies\": \"My nosegays are for Captives&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Dim&nbsp;\u2013 long expectant eyes&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Fingers denied the plucking,&nbsp;/ Patient till Paradise&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To such, if they sh'd whisper&nbsp;/ Of morning and the moor&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ They bear no other errand,&nbsp;/ And I, no other prayer\".<ref name=\"Farr1to7\" />\n\n'''The Master poems''': Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to \"Signor\", \"Sir\" and \"Master\", who is characterized as Dickinson's \"lover for all eternity\".<ref name=\"Farr7\">Farr (1996), 7\u20138.</ref> These confessional poems are often \"searing in their self-inquiry\" and \"harrowing to the reader\" and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson's day.<ref name=\"Farr7\" /> The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals but this view is frequently rejected by scholars. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, \"human, with specific characteristics, but godlike\" and speculates that Master may be a \"kind of Christian muse\".<ref name=\"Farr7\" />\n\n'''Morbidity''': Dickinson's poems reflect her \"early and lifelong fascination\" with illness, dying and death.<ref name=\"Pollak62\">Pollak (1996), 62\u201365.</ref> Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: \"crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> She reserved her sharpest insights into the \"death blow aimed by God\" and the \"funeral in the brain\", often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar Vivian Pollak considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson's \"thirsting-starving persona\", an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail.<ref name=\"Pollak62\" /> Dickinson's most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at \"the interface of murder and suicide\".<ref name=\"Pollak62\" />\n\n'''Gospel poems''': Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him.<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\">Oberhaus (1996), 105\u2013119</ref> She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with \"wit and American colloquial language\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the \"salient feature uniting Christian poets&nbsp;... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ\" and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the \"poetic tradition of Christian devotion\" alongside [[Gerard Manley Hopkins|Hopkins]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]] and [[W. H. Auden|Auden]].<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" /> In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: \"The Savior must have been&nbsp;/ A docile Gentleman&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ To come so far so cold a Day&nbsp;/ For little Fellowmen&nbsp;/ The Road to Bethlehem&nbsp;/ Since He and I were Boys&nbsp;/ Was leveled, but for that twould be&nbsp;/ A rugged billion Miles&nbsp;\u2013\".<ref name=\"Oberhaus105\" />\n\n'''The Undiscovered Continent''': Academic Suzanne Juhasz considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\">Juhasz (1996), 130\u2013140.</ref> Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the \"undiscovered continent\" and the \"landscape of the spirit\" and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding\u2014castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms\u2014to create a dwelling place of \"oneself\" where one resides with one's other selves.<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" /> An example that brings together many of these ideas is: \"Me from Myself&nbsp;\u2013 to banish&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Had I Art&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Impregnable my Fortress&nbsp;/ Unto All Heart&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ But since myself\u2014assault Me&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ How have I peace&nbsp;/ Except by subjugating&nbsp;/ Consciousness.&nbsp;/ And since We're mutual Monarch&nbsp;/ How this be&nbsp;/ Except by Abdication&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;/ Me&nbsp;\u2013 of Me?\".<ref name=\"Juhasz132\" />\n\n=== Reception ===\n[[File:Emily Dickinson\u00b4s (1830-1886) manuscript of \"A route of evanescence\" (1880).jpg|thumb|left|Dickinson wrote and sent this poem (\"A Route of Evanescence\") to Thomas Higginson in 1880.]]\nThe surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson's poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from [[William Dean Howells]], an editor of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality \"is that of extraordinary grasp and insight\",<ref>Blake (1964), 12.</ref> albeit \"without the proper control and chastening\" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred.<ref>Wolff (1986), 175.</ref> His judgment that her opus was \"incomplete and unsatisfactory\" would be echoed in the essays of the [[New Criticism|New Critics]] in the 1930s.\n\n[[Maurice Thompson]], who was literary editor of ''The Independent'' for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had \"a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality\".<ref>Blake (1964), 28.</ref> Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. [[Andrew Lang]], a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that \"if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much\".<ref>Blake (1964), 37.</ref> [[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]], a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in January 1892: \"It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and [[grotesque]] fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of [[William Blake|Blake]], and strongly influenced by the mannerism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]&nbsp;... But the incoherence and formlessness of her&nbsp;\u2014 versicles are fatal&nbsp;... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar\".<ref>Blake (1964), 55.</ref>\n\nCritical attention to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s.<ref>Blake (1964), vi.</ref> By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially [[modernism|modern]]. Rather than seeing Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic.<ref>Wells (1929), 243\u2013259.</ref> In a 1915 essay, [[Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant]] called the poet's inspiration \"daring\" and named her \"one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore\".<ref>Blake (1964), 89.</ref> With the growing popularity of [[Modernist poetry in English|modernist poetry]] in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a [[cult following]] began to form.<ref>Blake (1964), 202.</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, a number of the New Critics&nbsp;\u2013 among them [[R. P. Blackmur]], [[Allen Tate]], [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Yvor Winters]]&nbsp;\u2013 appraised the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenb\u00fcchle pointed out, their \"affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship\".<ref>Grabher (1998), 358\u2013359.</ref> Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: \"...&nbsp;she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of [[antimacassar]]s&nbsp;... She came&nbsp;... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 223.</ref>\n\nThe [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] of [[feminism]] created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 1.</ref> Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book ''This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson'', \"Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman.\" Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet.<ref>Juhasz (1983), 9.</ref> [[Adrienne Rich]] theorized in ''Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson'' (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: \"[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed&nbsp;... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time&nbsp;... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics.\"<ref>Juhasz (1983), 10.</ref>\n\nSome scholars question the poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry.<ref>Martin (2002), 58</ref> Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and [[Martha Nell Smith]] have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.<ref>Comment (2001), 167.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\nIn the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as ''Emily Dickinson Face to Face'' and ''Letters of Emily Dickinson'', which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.<ref>Grabher (1998), p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nEmily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture.<ref>Martin (2002), 1.</ref> Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet.<ref>Martin (2002), 2.</ref> As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that \"If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it.\"<ref>Blake (1964), 24.</ref> Critic [[Harold Bloom]] has placed her alongside [[Walt Whitman]], [[Wallace Stevens]], [[Robert Frost]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Hart Crane]] as a major American poet,<ref name=\"Bloo9\">Bloom (1999), 9</ref> and [[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages|in 1994]] listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.<ref>Bloom (1994), 226</ref>\n\nDickinson is taught in [[American literature]] and [[Poetry of the United States|poetry]] classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as text for art songs by composers such as [[Aaron Copland]], [[Nick Peros]], [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[Michael Tilson Thomas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lieder.net/lieder/get_author_texts.html?AuthorId=697 |title=Vocal music set to texts by Emily Dickinson |publisher=The LiederNet Archive |accessdate=March 8, 2017 }}</ref> Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in [[Bozeman, Montana]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml |title=Mission Statement|publisher=Emily Dickinson School website, Bozeman, Montana |accessdate=January 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002033911/http://www.bozeman.k12.mt.us/emilyd/aboutus.lhtml|archivedate=October 2, 2007}}</ref>[[Redmond, Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |title=The Real Emily Dickinson |publisher=Emily Dickinson Elementary School website, Redmond, Washington |accessdate=July 24, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220094624/http://schools.lwsd.org/dickinson/webpages/realemily.htm |archivedate=December 20, 2008 }}</ref> and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://schools.nyc.gov/SchoolPortals/03/M075/default.htm|title=Find a School|website=Schools.nyc.gov|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}</ref> A few literary journals\u2014including ''[[The Emily Dickinson Journal]]'', the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society\u2014have been founded to examine her work.<ref name=\"journal\">{{cite web |url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/ |title=The Emily Dickinson Journal|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press website, Baltimore |accessdate=December 18, 2007}}</ref> An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson was issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] on August 28, 1971 as the second stamp in the \"American Poet\" series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |title=Emily Dickinson commemorative stamps and ephemera |publisher=Harvard University Library |accessdate=June 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712192306/http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hou01931 |archive-date=July 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dickinson was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1973.<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/emily-dickinson/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Emily Dickinson]</ref> A one-woman play titled ''[[The Belle of Amherst]]'' appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.<ref>\"[http://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 Belle of Amherst] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124011951/http://emilydickinsonmuseum.org/node/250 |date=November 24, 2010 }}\".

He managed to sprint past security over the next barrier and beyond before being tackled.  On the second lap, he managed to get free again for a few moments before finally being dragged away.\n{{quote|\"They've got all sorts of security at these games, designed to prevent anything from nuclear attack to germ warfare.

[[Henry Marsh (athlete)|Henry Marsh]] was typically as much as 20 metres back off the pace.  Renner opened up several metres on the Kenyans but with two laps to go, the field began bunching behind Renner with [[Brian Diemer]], [[Joseph Mahmoud]], [[Colin Reitz]] and Marsh back in the fold, all getting ready to pounce.  Just before the bell, Renner started to fall back.  Korir accelerated and Marsh was the first to follow, Diemer was next to catch up, followed by Mahmoud.  Through the final turn, Marsh looked like the only one still with any shot at Korir, but he was still losing ground.  Marsh was unable to make any headway as Mahmoud passed in on the outside, with Korir taking the final barrier as a hurdler and sprinting to victory.  Mahmoud sprinted away to the silver medal while Diemer challenged Marsh on the outside.  Diemer got the edge on Marsh with 10 metres to go, with the beaten Marsh just striding the final few steps over the line.\n\n==Medalists==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; font-size:110%;\" width=\"35%\"\n|- \n|{{OlympicGoldMedalist|[[Julius Korir]]|KEN|1984 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicSilverMedalist|[[Joseph Mahmoud]]|FRA|1984 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicBronzeMedalist|[[Brian Diemer]]|USA|1984 Summer}}\n|}\n\n==Abbreviations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; font-size:110%;\" width=\"35%\"\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"ccffcc\"| '''Q''' || automatic qualification\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"ddffdd\"| '''q''' || qualification by rank\n|-\n|'''DNS''' || did not start\n|-\n|'''NM''' || no mark\n|-\n|'''OR''' || olympic record\n|-\n|'''WR''' || world record\n|-\n|'''AR''' || area record\n|-\n|'''NR''' || national record\n|-\n|'''PB''' || personal best\n|-\n|'''SB''' || season best\n|}\n\n==Records==\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

He managed to sprint past security over the next barrier and beyond before being tackled.  On the second lap, he managed to get free again for a few moments before finally being dragged away.\n{{quote|\"They've got all sorts of security at these games, designed to prevent anything from nuclear attack to germ warfare.

[[Henry Marsh (athlete)|Henry Marsh]] was typically as much as 20 metres back off the pace.  Renner opened up several metres on the Kenyans but with two laps to go, the field began bunching behind Renner with [[Brian Diemer]], [[Joseph Mahmoud]], [[Colin Reitz]] and Marsh back in the fold, all getting ready to pounce.  Just before the bell, Renner started to fall back.  Korir accelerated and Marsh was the first to follow, Diemer was next to catch up, followed by Mahmoud.  Through the final turn, Marsh looked like the only one still with any shot at Korir, but he was still losing ground.  Marsh was unable to make any headway as Mahmoud passed in on the outside, with Korir taking the final barrier as a hurdler and sprinting to victory.  Mahmoud sprinted away to the silver medal while Diemer challenged Marsh on the outside.  Diemer got the edge on Marsh with 10 metres to go, with the beaten Marsh just striding the final few steps over the line.\n\n==Medalists==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; font-size:110%;\" width=\"35%\"\n|- \n|{{OlympicGoldMedalist|[[Julius Korir]]|KEN|1984 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicSilverMedalist|[[Joseph Mahmoud]]|FRA|1984 Summer}}\n|-\n|{{OlympicBronzeMedalist|[[Brian Diemer]]|USA|1984 Summer}}\n|}\n\n==Abbreviations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; font-size:110%;\" width=\"35%\"\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"ccffcc\"| '''Q''' || automatic qualification\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"ddffdd\"| '''q''' || qualification by rank\n|-\n|'''DNS''' || did not start\n|-\n|'''NM''' || no mark\n|-\n|'''OR''' || olympic record\n|-\n|'''WR''' || world record\n|-\n|'''AR''' || area record\n|-\n|'''NR''' || national record\n|-\n|'''PB''' || personal best\n|-\n|'''SB''' || season best\n|}\n\n==Records==\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

According to the professor, the surname Roslin originated from Henry Sinclair of the [[Clan Sinclair]], baron of [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] who accompanied [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] in the 1096 [[First Crusade|Crusade]] to [[Jerusalem]]. Chookaszian\u2019s hypothesis is based on the assumption that like most prominent Crusaders of the time,<ref>Godfrey\u2019s brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] married [[Arda of Armenia]], his successor [[Baldwin of Bourcq]] married [[Morphia of Melitene]], [[Joscelin I, Count of Edessa|Joscelin I]] married Beatrice etc. See: {{cite book\n  | last = Sirarpie\n  | first = Der Nersessian\n  | title =  L'Art Armenien des origines au XVIIe siecle \n  | publisher = Arts et Methiers Graphiques\n  | location=Paris\n  | year = 1977\n  | page = 135|language=fr}}</ref> Sinclair married an Armenian.<ref name=\"Chookbio\"/>\n\nThe approximate dates of Roslin's birth and death can be determined using the dates of his manuscripts. Based on the following it can be assumed that Roslin was at least 30 in 1260.<ref name=\"Azarian2\"/> At the time one could only achieve the level of mastery displayed in the ''Zeytun Gospel of 1256'' no earlier than in their mid twenties. In the colophon of the ''Gospel of 1260'', Roslin mentions that he has a son, indicating that he was likely a priest since a monk would have no children while a member of the laity would likely not have been an illuminated manuscript painter. By the time of the ''Gospel of 1265'', Roslin already had his own apprentices. Roslin painted two portraits of prince Levon, the earliest of which was executed in 1250<ref>The miniature decorates a parchment folio currently within MS No. 8321 in Matenadaran.

The manuscript was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for the young prince and future king [[Hethum II, King of Armenia|Hethum]].<ref>Der Nersessian, 53-54</ref> In the colophons of the manuscript Roslin describes the brutal sack of the [[Principality of Antioch]] by the [[Mamluk]] Sultan [[Baibars]]: \"...at this time great Antioch was captured by the wicked king of Egypt, and many were killed and became his prisoners, and a cause of anguish to the holy and famous temples, houses of God, which are in it; the wonderful elegance of the beauty of those which were destroyed by fire is beyond the power of words.\"<ref>Hazard, 137</ref>\n\n===Canon tables and ornaments===\nThe principal innovation of Roslin in regards to ornaments within [[canon tables]] is the addition of bust portraits.<ref name=\"DN\">Der Nersessian, 75</ref> In the Gospel of 1262 (MS No. 2660), [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] and Carpianus are represented as full figures standing in the outer margins of the Letter of Eusebius. Roslin also represented prophets such as [[David]], [[Moses]] and [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Der Nersessian, 64</ref> This system was highly unusual for canon table decoration, for although portraits of prophets had been represented next to canon tables as early as the 6th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], their relationship to the gospels was not made explicit through the quotation of their messianic prophecies.<ref>Der Nersessian, 65</ref> New [[zoomorphic]] creatures are also added to the usual repertoire of winged sphinxes and sirens such as dog or goat headed men carrying branches of flowers along with various quadrupeds and birds.<ref name=\"DN\"/> On the first page of each gospel and the beginning of [[pericopes]] floral as well as zoomorphic letters are formed utilizing peacocks or other creatures.<ref>Der Nersessian, 76</ref>\n\n===Attributions===\n[[File:Leo III of Armenia.jpeg|thumb|left|The Portrait of Prince Levon, Yerevan, Matenadaran, No. 8321]]\nSeveral contemporary manuscripts from the 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes been attributed to Roslin.<ref name=\"Sir1\"/> MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at [[Nor Nakhichevan]] and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions [[Attitude (heraldry)|passant]] in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are much closer to the ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s.<ref>Der Nersessian, 54</ref> Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty-eight vellum leaves from the [[Gospel of John]] have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in [[Vaspurakan]].\n\nThe priest Hovhannes who salvaged the remains of the old manuscript reports in one of the colophons that he had suffered seeing the old manuscript fall into the hands of the \"infidels\" like \"a lamb delivered to wolves\" and that he renovated it so that the \"royal memorial written in it might not be lost\". Part of the original colophons, the \"royal memorial\" reports that the manuscript was written in the see of Hromkla in 1266 for the king Hethum. The uncials are identical to that of MS 539 and similar marginal ornaments adorn both.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55</ref> Yet another manuscript attributed to Roslin and his assistants is MS 32.18 currently located at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The colophons are lost but the name of the sponsor, Prince Vassak (brother of king Hethum I) is written on the marginal medallion on page 52: \"Lord bless the baron Vassak\" and again on the upper band of the frame around the [[Raising of Lazarus]]: \"Lord have mercy on Vassak, Thy servant, the owner of this, Thy holy Gospel\". The uncials and the ornaments match those of MS 539 and MS 5458.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55-56</ref> Prince Vassak was sent to [[Cairo]] by his brother in 1268 to pay ransom and obtain the release of prince Levon and thousands of other hostages captured after the disastrous [[Battle of Mari]]. They returned home on June 24, 1268. At this time Roslin had already completed the copy and illustrations of MS 10675 and his chief patron, Catholicos Constantine I having died, Roslin would have been free to work for another patron such as prince Vassak who had a reason to celebrate.<ref>Der Nersessian, 56</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\nAmong Roslin's various miniatures on the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|theme of the Nativity]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] scene of the Gospel of 1260 (MS No. 251) stands out the most. Mary and the Child are presented seated on the throne near a grotto combined with in the lower angle with the portrait of [[Matthew the Evangelist]], in reverse proportional correlation. The combination of the two scenes was originally developed in [[Constantinople]] during the [[Komnenos dynasty|Comnenian era]] and reinterpreted by Roslin.<ref name=\"ChookNat\">{{cite web\n |last        = Chookaszian\n |first       = Levon\n |title       = Toros Roslin: Iconography - Nativity\n |publisher   = Armenian Studies Program, California State University\n |url         = http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/ArmeniaDigitalProject/iconography/nativity/Nativity.html#3\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-27\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081006142516/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/ArmeniaDigitalProject/iconography/nativity/Nativity.html#3\n |archivedate = 2008-10-06\n}}</ref> Another unique attribute of this composition is seen in the top right corner where the bodyguards of the [[Magi]], who are mentioned in [[apocryphal]] gospel accounts as soldiers who accompanied the Magi, are represented as [[Mongols]].

According to the professor, the surname Roslin originated from Henry Sinclair of the [[Clan Sinclair]], baron of [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] who accompanied [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] in the 1096 [[First Crusade|Crusade]] to [[Jerusalem]].

In the colophon of the ''Gospel of 1260'', Roslin mentions that he has a son, indicating that he was likely a priest since a monk would have no children while a member of the laity would likely not have been an illuminated manuscript painter. By the time of the ''Gospel of 1265'', Roslin already had his own apprentices. Roslin painted two portraits of prince Levon, the earliest of which was executed in 1250<ref>The miniature decorates a parchment folio currently within MS No. 8321 in Matenadaran.

Roslin also represented prophets such as [[David]], [[Moses]] and [[John the Baptist]].<ref>Der Nersessian, 64</ref> This system was highly unusual for canon table decoration, for although portraits of prophets had been represented next to canon tables as early as the 6th-century [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Rabbula Gospels]], their relationship to the gospels was not made explicit through the quotation of their messianic prophecies.<ref>Der Nersessian, 65</ref> New [[zoomorphic]] creatures are also added to the usual repertoire of winged sphinxes and sirens such as dog or goat headed men carrying branches of flowers along with various quadrupeds and birds.<ref name=\"DN\"/> On the first page of each gospel and the beginning of [[pericopes]] floral as well as zoomorphic letters are formed utilizing peacocks or other creatures.<ref>Der Nersessian, 76</ref>\n\n===Attributions===\n[[File:Leo III of Armenia.jpeg|thumb|left|The Portrait of Prince Levon, Yerevan, Matenadaran, No. 8321]]\nSeveral contemporary manuscripts from the 13th century, devoid of colophons have sometimes been attributed to Roslin.<ref name=\"Sir1\"/> MS 8321, the mutilated remains of which were formerly at [[Nor Nakhichevan]] and now in Yerevan, was commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a present for his godchild prince Levon. Prince Levon's portrait was bound by mistake in MS 7690 and was returned to its original place. A dedicatory inscription which faced the portrait has been lost. The portrait shows the prince in his teens wearing a blue tunic decorated with lions [[Attitude (heraldry)|passant]] in gold roundels with a jeweled gold band at the hem. Two angels, in light blue and pink draperies, hold their rhipidia (liturgical fans) above the prince's head. Stylistically these pieces are much closer to the ones painted by Roslin than those of other artists at Hromkla who were still active in the 1250s.<ref>Der Nersessian, 54</ref> Another mutilated manuscript, MS 5458 located in Yerevan is often assigned to Roslin. Thirty-eight vellum leaves from the [[Gospel of John]] have been incorporated into the manuscript in the late 14th or early 15th century in [[Vaspurakan]].\n\nThe priest Hovhannes who salvaged the remains of the old manuscript reports in one of the colophons that he had suffered seeing the old manuscript fall into the hands of the \"infidels\" like \"a lamb delivered to wolves\" and that he renovated it so that the \"royal memorial written in it might not be lost\". Part of the original colophons, the \"royal memorial\" reports that the manuscript was written in the see of Hromkla in 1266 for the king Hethum. The uncials are identical to that of MS 539 and similar marginal ornaments adorn both.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55</ref> Yet another manuscript attributed to Roslin and his assistants is MS 32.18 currently located at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The colophons are lost but the name of the sponsor, Prince Vassak (brother of king Hethum I) is written on the marginal medallion on page 52: \"Lord bless the baron Vassak\" and again on the upper band of the frame around the [[Raising of Lazarus]]: \"Lord have mercy on Vassak, Thy servant, the owner of this, Thy holy Gospel\". The uncials and the ornaments match those of MS 539 and MS 5458.<ref>Der Nersessian, 55-56</ref> Prince Vassak was sent to [[Cairo]] by his brother in 1268 to pay ransom and obtain the release of prince Levon and thousands of other hostages captured after the disastrous [[Battle of Mari]]. They returned home on June 24, 1268.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lap, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} A purchaser could not separate the woman he bought from her child until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines.

The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers.

This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} Aurangzeb would enslave rebellious peasants.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=91}} [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2,2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs. In the region of modern day [[Chad]], Muslim women and children from [[Sultanate of Bagirmi|Bagirmi]] were enslaved by the ruler of Wadai around 1800.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=44}} \n\n==Abolition==\nMarriage was not the only legal way to have sex in Muslim societies prior to the end of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=50}} Colonial governments and independent Muslim states restricted slave raids and the slave trade in response to pressure from Western liberals and nascent Muslim abolitionist movements. Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n===Attitude of traditional ulama to abolition===\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}}  In the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} \n\nIn 1911 one Qadi ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J. Spencer Trimingham|Spencer Trimingham]] observed that masters continued to take concubines from slave families because the descendants of slaves are still enslaved under religious law even if they have been freed according to secular law.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}  [[Armenians]] and other Christian rebels who had been enslaved in [[World War I]] were considered to be \"people of the book\" who had violated their contract. Hence, one [[Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy those Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}} \n\nA conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} After 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16. It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} Kidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markers were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n===South Asia===\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[What your right hands possess]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lap, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears. She turns to her loved ones, milk pouring forth from her breast: \"Go in peace, my darlings, and may God accompany you.\"|[[Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey and Evaluation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian Writings on Early Islam]], [[Robert G. Hoyland]]{{sfn|Hoyland|1997|p=262}}}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} A purchaser could not separate the woman he bought from her child until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them.

Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished.

Hence, one [[Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy those Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}} \n\nA conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} After 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} \n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran...

The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the [[Popular Defense Forces]], consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families. Slave raids continued every year after 1985.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=26}} Dinka girls kept in Arab households were used as sex-slaves.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=35}} Some of them were sold to Arab men in [[Libya]], It has been alleged that slave markets were set up in Sudan. Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam.

He had represented the constituency since its creation at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].

next-most-marginal victory again with the Labour Party as runner-up, in 1950, of 14.4%.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1983, much of the South Downs area was part of the [[Shoreham (UK Parliament

constituencies|constituency]]{{refn|A [[county constituency]] (for the purposes of election expenses and type of returning officer)|group= n}} created in 1997, represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 2019 by [[Andrew Griffith]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].{{refn|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe constituency contains the town of [[Arundel]] and villages and [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s within the [[South Downs]] national park boundaries or encircled by the park, the largest of which are [[Hassocks]], [[Hurstpierpoint]], [[Petworth]], [[Pulborough]], [[Steyning]] ({{IPAc-en|s|t|\u025b|n|\u026a|\u014b}}) and Storrington.\n\n;2010 \u2013 reviewed boundaries adopted\nFollowing their [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|review of parliamentary boundaries]] in West Sussex which Parliament approved in 2007, the [[Boundary Commission for England]] formed new constituencies.  First contested in 2010 the seat was constituted as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Wards of the United Kingdom!! In district/borough of:\n|-\n| [[Angmering]], [[Arundel]], [[Barnham, West Sussex|Barnham]], [[Findon, West Sussex|Findon]], and [[Walberton]] ||[[Arun District|Arun]] \n|-\n| Bury, [[Petworth]], and Wisborough Green||[[Chichester (district)|Chichester]]\n|-\n| [[Bramber]], [[Upper Beeding]] and Woodmancote, Chanctonbury, Chantry, Cowfold,Partridge Green, Shermanbury and West Grinstead, [[Henfield]], Pulborough and Coldwaltham, and Steyning || [[Horsham (district)|Horsham]]\n|-\n|[[Hassocks]], and [[Hurstpierpoint]] and Downs.||[[Mid Sussex]]\n|}\n\nIn their recommendations, the Boundary Commission for England mooted the name ''Chanctonbury'' after uninhabited [[Chanctonbury Ring]], an ancient hill fort at its centre. This name was rejected during the local inquiry process at which the current name was chosen.<ref>Boundary Commission for England, fourth periodic report, 1995</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Results and EU referendum stance===\nThe 2017 result saw the sixth Conservative win.  \n\nSecond-place runners-up have been, listed in order, four times a Liberal Democrat, once the UKIP candidate and once the Labour candidate.  In line with regional trends, the highest percentage of the vote among these was the Liberal Democrat in 2010, with 27.9% of the vote.\n\nIn June 2016, an estimated [[Results_of_the_2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum#List_of_constituency_results|50.3% of local adults voting in the EU membership referendum]] chose to remain in the European Union instead of to leave. This was defied in two January 2018 votes in Parliament by its MP, in line with his governing party's promise to adhere to the overall result of that referendum.<ref>https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11377/nick_herbert/arundel_and_south_downs/divisions?policy=1065</ref> \n\nThe 2015-2017 status was as the 8th safest of the Conservative Party's 331 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukpolitical.info/conservative-mps-elected-2015.htm |title=List of Conservative MPs elected in 2015 by % majority |publisher=UK Political.info |accessdate=29 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===De-selection of incumbent seeking re-election in 2005===\nThe incumbent [[Howard Flight]] MP had national media coverage in the run-up to the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] due to his deselection requested by the party leader for membership of [[Conservative Way Forward]], lobbying for spending cuts to be more severe than set out in the small cuts in the 2005 manifesto. Flight hinted his preferred cuts would be as implemented by a Conservative government in his view.  He had represented the constituency since its creation at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. Anne Marie Morris, [[Laura Sandys]] and Nick Herbert put themselves forward for nomination as replacement candidates.  The chosen candidate, [[Nick Herbert]], won the seat at the election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4407361.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Politics - Tory shortlist to replace Flight|website=newsrss.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Morris and Sandys became MPs elsewhere in 2010.\n\n===Predecessor seats===\nThe seat and its predecessors have in the 20th century been a Conservative Party [[safe seat|stronghold]] save that the minor contributory Horsham seat to the area's electorate saw victory by 8.6% of the vote over the Labour Party in 1966, followed statistically by a next-most-marginal victory again with the Labour Party as runner-up, in 1950, of 14.4%.\n\nBetween 1974 and 1983, much of the South Downs area was part of the [[Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency)|Shoreham]] constituency, with the town of Arundel remaining in the Arundel constituency.\n\nPrior to 1974, the seat was largely part of the [[Arundel and Shoreham (UK Parliament constituency)|Arundel and Shoreham]] constituency.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{Rayment-hc|a|3|date=March
