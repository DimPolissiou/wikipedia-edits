Blackwell was responsible for letters seven to nineteen. Their content was as bold and original as the book on Homer had been.  Classical mythology had been discussed throughout the Christian era from a variety of unsympathetic standpoints: firstly by [[Euhemeristic]] critics who saw it as a fanciful form of history; next by Christian commentators who treated the classical gods as thinly-disguised [[demon]]s; and finally by modern rationalists who saw the system as ultimately irrational and meaningless.  Blackwell took a radically different view. He saw mythology as a deeply civilising influence, which, if its allegorical intention were interpreted sympathetically, was an important key to the world-view of classical antiquity.\n\nOrdinary people may have accepted the stories of the gods at face value, but the intelligentsia had regarded 'the old Divinity' as conveying profound insights into the nature of reality but doing so in symbolic terms,<ref>\"The Gods of the Ancients, you see, appear in a double Light; as the Parts and Powers of Nature to the Philosophers, as real Persons to the Vulgar; the former understood and admired them with a decent Veneration; the latter dreaded and adored them with a blind Devotion,\" and he added, \"Has not the same thing happened in modern religious Matters?\" (8th Letter, p. 62f).</ref> and these Blackwell set himself to interpret, beginning in earnest with his Ninth Letter, of mythology as \"Instruction conveyed in a Tale\".<ref>Ninth Letter, p. 60.</ref> He drew on a wide range of evidence from a variety of sources including not only the literary myths in Greek and Latin and the [[Orphic Hymns]], but French, Spanish, Italian, Hebrew and Arabic<ref>Tenth Letter.</ref> texts, attempting to isolate the surviving original mythic strain from layers of later accretions.\n\nBlackwell compared the early Jewish world view with contemporary Near Eastern cosmographies, analysing the account of creation in the [[Book of Genesis]] along with ancient Phoenician texts transmitted through [[Sanchuniathon]] to trace the transformation of [[Chaldea]]n monotheism into polytheism as the stars began to be worshiped as lesser deities.  Throughout this wide-ranging study Blackwell insisted that the past was not a foreign country but perfectly coherent and intelligible when viewed in its own terms.\n\n===''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'' (1753\u201363)===\n[[File:Memoirs of the Court of Augustus, Vol. 3, 1763.jpg|thumb|250px|upright|''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus,'' Vol. 3, 1763]]\nIn ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'' (3 vols., 1753\u201363), Blackwell approached his subject as a practitioner of intellectual history, calling it 'This difficult Science of Men'. (p.&nbsp;5) He showed how individuals were defined by society, and went on to trace the causes of Rome's developing from an obscure hamlet into a great imperial power. Rome's ethos had originally been austere and military and its original institutions democratic ones.\n\nBut insufficient separation of powers meant that if the republican impulse faltered there was little to prevent a slide into tyranny. A balanced constitution was therefore essential to enduring political success, a lesson reinforced by his comparative studies of later great powers including France, Venice and the Spanish Empire. Politics and empire formed only a part of this wide-ranging study. The ability of power to mould behaviour patterns fascinated Blackwell, and his study of [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]] demonstrated the responsiveness of the arts to their political context and explored how they might influence it in turn.\n\nAfter Blackwell's death [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] continued and completed the third volume of ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', which was published in 1763.<ref>''The Critical Review: Or, Annals of Literature'', Vol. 15, W.

This work [''Enquiry''] follows the same mental scheme used by Taine, except for the naturalistic technique.

It does not have its meteorological denotation; instead, Johnson defines it as 'A space upon the surface of the Earth, measured from the Equator to the polar circles in each of which spaces the longest day is half-an-hour longer' (Dictionary, 10th E.

Good sense is indeed said to be a product of every country, and I believe it is; but the richest growths, and fairest shoots of it, spring, like other plants, from the happiest exposition and most friendly soil.\u201d \u2014 Blackwell (1735), p. 5.</ref> greatly impressed and influenced [[Johann Gottfried Herder]],<ref>Norton, Robert Edward (1991).

(p.&nbsp;5) He showed how individuals were defined by society, and went on to trace the causes of Rome's developing from an obscure hamlet into a great imperial power. Rome's ethos had originally been austere and military and its original institutions democratic ones.\n\nBut insufficient separation of powers meant that if the republican impulse faltered there was little to prevent a slide into tyranny. A balanced constitution was therefore essential to enduring political success, a lesson reinforced by his comparative studies of later great powers including France, Venice and the Spanish Empire. Politics and empire formed only a part of this wide-ranging study. The ability of power to mould behaviour patterns fascinated Blackwell, and his study of [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]] demonstrated the responsiveness of the arts to their political context and explored how they might influence it in turn.\n\nAfter Blackwell's death [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] continued and completed the third volume of ''Memoirs of the Court of Augustus'', which was published in 1763.<ref>''The Critical Review: Or, Annals of Literature'', Vol. 15, W. Simpkin and R. Marshall, 1763.</ref>\n\n==Comparison with Hippolyte Taine==\nIn a set of articles, published in 1897 by distinguished Brazilian scholar [[Araripe J\u00fanior|Trist\u00e3o de Alencar Araripe J\u00fanior]],<ref>The first article was originally published in ''Revista do Brasil'', Ano I, No. 3, September 1897, pp. 73\u201376; the conclusion, in the following issue of the magazine, No. 4, 31 October 1897, pp. 94\u201398.</ref> Blackwell was credited with being a precursor of [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]]'s ideas concerning the contextual study of works of art.<ref>Araripe J\u00fanior (1963). \"Um Precursor de Taine.\" In: ''Obra Cr\u00edtica de Araripe J\u00fanior'', Vol. III, 1895\u20131900. Rio de Janeiro: Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura/Casa de Rui Barbosa, pp. 249\u2013256.</ref> \"There was,... in the last century, a Scottish critic who innovatively applied to Homer the same processes of the master of modern criticism,\" [[Araripe J\u00fanior]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>And what is more surprising, he did it before Montesquieu<ref>Montesquieu (1748). ''De l'Esprit des Loix ou du Rapport que les Loix Doivent Avoir avec la Constitution de Chaque Gouvernement, les Moeurs, le Climat, la Religion, le Commerce''. Geneve: Barrillot & Fils.</ref> had put into circulation his theory on the influence of climate upon the laws and, therefore, upon all human social relations... This work [''Enquiry''] follows the same mental scheme used by Taine, except for the naturalistic technique. Blackwell does not speak of mesology; but, as the book goes on, we see that none of the factors identified by the French critic escaped his observation and analysis.</blockquote>\n\nBlackwell's theory of the formative effects of climate<ref>\"It's essential at the outset to understand the meaning of climate in the eighteenth century. It does not have its meteorological denotation; instead, Johnson defines it as 'A space upon the surface of the Earth, measured from the Equator to the polar circles in each of which spaces the longest day is half-an-hour longer' (Dictionary, 10th E. [London, 1792]). Cf. the 1771 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: climate is \"a space upon the terrestrial globe.\" \u2014 Berry, Christopher J. (1974). \"'Climate' in the Eighteenth Century: James Dunbar and the Scottish Case,\" ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language'' '''16''', No. 2, p. 281.</ref> on our character and culture<ref>\"In the division, commonly made of climates, the rough and cold are observed to produce the strongest bodies, and most martial spirits; the hotter, lazy bodies with cunning and obstinate passions; but the temperate regions, lying under the benign influences of a genial sky, have the best chance for a fine perception, and a proportioned eloquence. Good sense is indeed said to be a product of every country, and I believe it is; but the richest growths, and fairest shoots of it, spring, like other plants, from the happiest exposition and most friendly soil.\u201d \u2014 Blackwell (1735), p. 5.</ref> greatly impressed and influenced [[Johann Gottfried Herder]],<ref>Norton, Robert Edward (1991).

But his Scottish Whig politics attracted bitterly hostile criticism from conservatively-minded English critics like [[Samuel Johnson]],<ref>Greene, Donald (2009). ''The Politics of Samuel Johnson''.
