The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania. [[Mojo Rawley]] then joined Gronkowski to continue the hype.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions with the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]]. In the end, as Corbin attempted a pin on Elias with his legs on the rope, the referee noticed it and voided the pin. Elias then performed a roll-up on Corbin to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show featured a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

Charlotte won by submission with the Figure-8 Leglock.\n\n====Main event====\nThe main event of the entire two-night WrestleMania was Brock Lesnar (with [[Paul Heyman]]) vs. Drew McIntyre for the WWE Championship. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===Raw===\n===SmackDown===\n\n== Results ==\n\n=== <!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 1<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network--> ===\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|times  = <ref name=\"preWM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Show results: Powell's live review of the night one pre-show featuring Drew Gulak vs. Cesaro|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-kickoff-show-results-powells-live-review-of-the-night-one-pre-show/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WM36Part1\">{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=WrestleMania 36 results: Powell's live review of night one featuring Goldberg vs. Braun Strowman for the WWE Universal Championship, Undertaker vs. AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, Becky Lynch vs. Shayna Baszler for the Raw Women's Championship, Seth Rollins vs. Kevin Owens|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/04/04/wrestlemania-36-results-powells-live-review-of-night-one-featuring-goldberg-vs-braun-strowman-for-the-wwe-universal-championship-undertaker-vs-aj-styles-in-a-boneyard-match-becky-lynch-vs-shay/|work=Pro Wreslting Dot Net|date=April 4, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n|future = no\n|match1 = [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] defeated [[Drew Gulak]]\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powers|first1=Kevin|title=Cesaro def.

The climax saw Cesaro perform a U.F.O. on Gulak, followed by a pin to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 1 opened with host Rob Gronkowski hyping WrestleMania. [[Mojo Rawley]] then joined Gronkowski to continue the hype.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the first match, The Kabuki Warriors ([[Asuka (wrestler)|Asuka]] and [[Kairi Sane]]) defended the [[WWE Women's Tag Team Championship]] against [[Alexa Bliss]] and [[Nikki Cross]]. In the end, Cross performed The Purge on Sane followed by Bliss performing a Twisted Bliss to win and become the first two-time champions with the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] faced [[Baron Corbin|King Corbin]].

Elias then performed a roll-up on Corbin to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Shayna Baszler. In the closing moments, as Baszler applied the Kirifuda Clutch on Lynch, Lynch countered into a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Sami Zayn]] (accompanied by Cesaro and [[Shinsuke Nakamura]]) defended the Intercontinental Championship against [[Daniel Bryan]] (accompanied by Drew Gulak). In the first half of the match, Zayn refused to face Bryan and continuously scurried away from him. Bryan would run after Zayn only for Cesaro and Nakamura to get in his way. This led to Gulak getting involved and temporarily taking out Cesaro and Nakamura. As Zayn wanted a countout victory, Bryan brought Zayn back into the ring and eventually started to perform his offensive attacks on him. In the end, Cesaro and Nakamura recovered and attacked Gulak. As Bryan attempted a slam on Zayn, Zayn performed a Helluva Kick in mid-air to retain the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nNext, the SmackDown Tag Team Championship was defended in a triple threat ladder match. The match was originally scheduled as a triple threat tag team ladder match in which The Miz and John Morrison were to defend the title against [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] ([[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and Kofi Kingston) and [[The Usos]] (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), but due to The Miz becoming ill, the match was contested between Morrison, Jimmy, and Kingston, each representing their respective team. In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder. As Morrison fell, he grasped the titles, unhooking them as he fell, thus Morrison retained the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nAfter that, Kevin Owens faced Seth Rollins. The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted. During the match, Owens attacked Rollins with the ring bell and performed a diving elbow drop off the WrestleMania sign. In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nThe WrestleMania 36 Part 2 Kickoff pre-show featured a match between [[Liv Morgan]] and [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]].

McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one.

During World War II, he served with the [[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment]], then with the [[Royal Engineers]], where he used his skills as a fitter.  In 1945, he was hospitalised in [[South Africa]] with [[tuberculosis]], and there began reading material from the [[Communist Party of South Africa]].  He also met Jack Rae, a fellow patient who was a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB), and the two put together a hospital newsletter based largely on communist sources.  He began assisting the [[African Mine Workers' Union]] and the [[Springbok Legion]].  He married a nurse, but the marriage rapidly fell apart, and the British Army decided to repatriate him to England in 1947.<ref name=\"dlb\">Robert H. Fryer and Stephen Williams, \"Dix, Bernard Hubert\", ''Dictionary of Labour Biography'', vol.XIII, pp.88-108</ref>\n\nIn England, Dix joined the [[Young Communist League (UK)|Young Communist League]].  He remarried, and began working, initially as a building labourer, then in a clerical post for the Soviet Embassy.  In 1949, he was finally admitted onto a training scheme for engineering draughtspeople.  He drifted away from the CPGB, joining the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and began devoting much of his time to the [[Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen]] (AESD).  He won a scholarship to the [[London School of Economics]], where he completed a one-year course in trade unionism, and also began writing for ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', the left-wing Labour-supporting newspaper.<ref name=\"dlb\" />\n\nIn 1951, Dix met [[Jock Haston]], a formerly prominent [[Trotskyist]], and through him, he became interested in the work of [[Max Shachtman]] and his [[Third Camp]] theory.  By 1955, Dix was writing for Shachtman's ''Labor Action'' newspaper as its \"London Correspondent\", while he and a small group of co-thinkers, including [[Stanley Newens]], joined [[Tony Cliff]]'s [[Socialist Review Group]].  Dix edited ''Socialist Review'' for short periods in 1955 and 1957.  Also in 1955, he began working in the Editorial Department of the [[Trades Union Congress]], and in order to avoid difficulties, he began using the pseudonym \"Owen Roberts\" for his socialist activities.<ref name=\"dlb\" />\n\nIn 1959, Dix left Socialist Review Group after Cliff won a majority for a position arguing that the Labour Party did not have revolutionary potential.  Shachtman had also wound up his political organisation, although Dix remained close to [[Hal Draper]], a former supporter of Shachtman in the U.S.  He himself left Labour in 1961, disappointed with [[Hugh Gaitskell]]'s leadership, and developed an interest in [[anarchism]], but he rejoined Labour in 1963, and also began working as the publicity and research officer of the [[National Union of Public Employees]] (NUPE).  Although he was able to reinvent the union's newspaper, he had a poor working relationship with [[Sydney Hill]], the union's general secretary, and only remained in the post after [[Vic Feather]] personally persuaded him that he would find Dix a more senior position once Hill retired.  With this backing, and that of [[Alan Fisher (trade unionist)|Alan Fisher]], who succeeded Hill, Dix was able to create a [[shop steward]] system in the union, and developing a novel strategy of rolling industrial action.<ref name=\"dlb\" />\n\nDix was promoted to become NUPE's first Assistant General Secretary in 1975, and immediately secured the restructure of the union's decision making bodies, giving shop stewards a stronger role, and reserving places on key bodies for women.  Working closely with Fisher, NUPE became one of the most active unions in the late 1970s, and grew rapidly.<ref name=\"dlb\" />\n\nDix stood repeatedly for the [[National Executive Committee]] (NEC) of the Labour Party.  Although never elected, he was co-opted to its social policy group, and after taking the runner-up spot for the NEC in 1980, he was the automatic replacement for [[Tom Bradley (British politician)|Tom Bradley]] when he defected to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]].  However, Dix was again defeated in the 1981 election for the NEC.  He retired in 1981, and left the Labour Party in 1981, concerned about its direction after the editorial board of ''[[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]]'' was expelled.<ref name=\"dlb\" />\n\nIn 1982, Dix moved to [[Mynyddcerrig]], where he organised a community bus and became chairman of the community council.  He learned Welsh in order to conduct business on the council in that language, and in 1983 joined [[Plaid Cymru]].  Within the party, he campaigned in support of the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|UK miners' strike]], but he soon became disillusioned with Plaid, and instead focused his time on writing on the early history of NUPE.

Anchored by [[Mike Enriquez]], Melo del Prado and [[Joel Reyes Zobel]], it premiered on February 7, 2000.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:saksi_dzbb.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Mike Enriquez]] anchors his radio program ''Saksi sa Dobol B''.]]\nThe program premiered on February 7, 2000 as a spin-off of ''[[Saksi]]'', a television newscast that Enriquez also hosted at the time. It replaced ''[[Tapatan with Jay Sonza]]'' after [[Jay Sonza]] transferred to DZRH. This also marked Enriquez return to radio. The program during 7:00 am to 8:00 am timeslot, was on the break as it was occupied by the newscast, ''[[Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/radio-die-hards-embrace-tv/323157/|author=Tessa Mauricio-Arriola|title=Radio die-hards embrace TV|date=April 20, 2017|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2011, the program began its [[simulcast]] on [[GMA News TV]] along with ''Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide'' under the ''[[Dobol B sa News TV]]'' block upon the christening of the said network. However, the simulcast ended on September 7, 2012, instead News TV aired reruns of ''Front Row'' and ''Reel Time'' on the timeslot formerly occupied by ''Dobol B'' as it would make way for a new morning show ''[[Kape at Balita]]'' in the following month.\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, whenever Enriquez is not available, the news program was anchored by Melo del Prado on the first hour, then del Prado together with Joel Reyes Zobel would anchor ''Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide'' at 7 am. After the newscast, either of del Prado or Reyes Zobel will solo-anchor the program up to 9 am.\n\nOn April 24, 2017, ''Dobol B sa News TV'' returned to GMA News TV, marking the news channel's return to simulcast radio on television after its 4-year long hiatus, with ''Saksi sa Dobol B'' returning on the said block. The block airs from 6:00 am until 11:00 am.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv8DdbFWGK8|title=Abangan ngayong Abril!|date=March 28, 2017|publisher=Youtube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/gma-news-tv-to-simulcast-dzbbs-morning.html?m=1|title=GMA News TV to simulcast DZBB's morning programs|date=April 18, 2017|website=Media Newser Philippines|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===9:00 am slot from 2014 to 2019===\nSince 2014, at 9am the final hour had featured Arnold Clavio's blind item, ''Jeng-Jeng,'' and occasionally'', Balitawit.'' Clavio and Ali Sotto joined Enriquez in ''Saksi''<nowiki/>'s final hour.\n\nIn 2017, due to ''Dobol B sa News TV'' the final hour was started to be branded on television as ''Sino?'', but on radio was still branded as part of ''Saksi''. After this, ''[[Dobol A sa Dobol B]]'' will start at 10am.\n\nThe third hour segments would often start 30 minutes later (at 9:30), with ''Dobol A'' being sometimes pushed to as far as 10:30. This has become a running joke in the show.\n\nIn Enriquez's absence, the ''Sino? and'' ''Jeng-Jeng'' segments were anchored by Clavio, Sotto and Reyes Zobel. When one of these three were also absent, [[Susan Enriquez]], the host of DZBB's 11am program ''Easy Easy Lang!'', has also substituted for them.\n\nAlso in Enriquez's absence, ''[[Dobol A sa Dobol B]]''  began at 9am, an hour earlier, instead of being branded as the third hour of ''Saksi''. This was because prior to ''Dobol A''<nowiki/>'s return in 2014, most of the segments that aired on the final hour of ''Saksi'' were mainly part of ''Dobol A''.\n\n===2019 revamp===\nFollowing the revamp of Dobol B sa News TV block, ''Saksi'''s airtime has officially been reduced to only one hour starting June 3, 2019, but the presenters and segments that occupied the affected hours remained the same. Mike Enriquez returned to hosting the radio show after being on medical leave since August 2018 (Enriquez only anchored [[Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide]] and [[24 Oras]] since November of the same year). Melo del Prado, who served as substitute anchor in ''Saksi'', has started hosting his own program ''Melo del Prado sa Super Radyo DZBB'' on the 6:00am timeslot, while the 9:00am half-hour timeslot was filled by a new show ''Ano'ng Say N'yo?'' hosted by Joel Reyes-Zobel.\n\nOn March 23, 2020 Saksi sa Dobol B aired at a 8-8:45am timeslot on [[GMA-7]] temporarily replacing [[Knockout]] and [[Dragon Ball Super]] as provisional programming due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Hosts==\n* [[Mike Enriquez]] (2000\u2013present)\n* Melo del Prado (substitute for Enriquez; 2012\u2013present)\n* Joel Reyes Zobel (substitute for Enriquez; 2012\u2013present)\n* Orly Trinidad (substitute for Enriquez, del Prado or Reyes Zobel; 2012\u2013present)\n* Rowena Salvacion (substitute for Enriquez; 2018\u2013present)\n* Susan Enriquez (substitute for Enriquez; 2018\u2013present)\n* Carlo Mateo (substitute for Enriquez; 2012\u2013present)\n\n==Segments==\n===Current segments===\n*''Bantay Panahon'' \u2013 The weather segment and radio counterpart of ''IM Ready: GMA Weather'' segment of GMA news programs on TV.

The program during 7:00 am to 8:00 am timeslot, was on the break as it was occupied by the newscast, ''[[Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/radio-die-hards-embrace-tv/323157/|author=Tessa Mauricio-Arriola|title=Radio die-hards embrace TV|date=April 20, 2017|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn February 28, 2011, the program began its [[simulcast]] on [[GMA News TV]] along with ''Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide'' under the ''[[Dobol B sa News TV]]'' block upon the christening of the said network. However, the simulcast ended on September 7, 2012, instead News TV aired reruns of ''Front Row'' and ''Reel Time'' on the timeslot formerly occupied by ''Dobol B'' as it would make way for a new morning show ''[[Kape at Balita]]'' in the following month.\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, whenever Enriquez is not available, the news program was anchored by Melo del Prado on the first hour, then del Prado together with Joel Reyes Zobel would anchor ''Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide'' at 7 am. After the newscast, either of del Prado or Reyes Zobel will solo-anchor the program up to 9 am.\n\nOn April 24, 2017, ''Dobol B sa News TV'' returned to GMA News TV, marking the news channel's return to simulcast radio on television after its 4-year long hiatus, with ''Saksi sa Dobol B'' returning on the said block. The block airs from 6:00 am until 11:00 am.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv8DdbFWGK8|title=Abangan ngayong Abril!|date=March 28, 2017|publisher=Youtube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/04/gma-news-tv-to-simulcast-dzbbs-morning.html?m=1|title=GMA News TV to simulcast DZBB's morning programs|date=April 18, 2017|website=Media Newser Philippines|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===9:00 am slot from 2014 to 2019===\nSince 2014, at 9am the final hour had featured Arnold Clavio's blind item, ''Jeng-Jeng,'' and occasionally'', Balitawit.'' Clavio and Ali Sotto joined Enriquez in ''Saksi''<nowiki/>'s final hour.\n\nIn 2017, due to ''Dobol B sa News TV'' the final hour was started to be branded on television as ''Sino?'', but on radio was still branded as part of ''Saksi''. After this, ''[[Dobol A sa Dobol B]]'' will start at 10am.\n\nThe third hour segments would often start 30 minutes later (at 9:30), with ''Dobol A'' being sometimes pushed to as far as 10:30. This has become a running joke in the show.\n\nIn Enriquez's absence, the ''Sino? and'' ''Jeng-Jeng'' segments were anchored by Clavio, Sotto and Reyes Zobel. When one of these three were also absent, [[Susan Enriquez]], the host of DZBB's 11am program ''Easy Easy Lang!'', has also substituted for them.\n\nAlso in Enriquez's absence, ''[[Dobol A sa Dobol B]]''  began at 9am, an hour earlier, instead of being branded as the third hour of ''Saksi''. This was because prior to ''Dobol A''<nowiki/>'s return in 2014, most of the segments that aired on the final hour of ''Saksi'' were mainly part of ''Dobol A''.\n\n===2019 revamp===\nFollowing the revamp of Dobol B sa News TV block, ''Saksi'''s airtime has officially been reduced to only one hour starting June 3, 2019, but the presenters and segments that occupied the affected hours remained the same. Mike Enriquez returned to hosting the radio show after being on medical leave since August 2018 (Enriquez only anchored [[Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide]] and [[24 Oras]] since November of the same year). Melo del Prado, who served as substitute anchor in ''Saksi'', has started hosting his own program ''Melo del Prado sa Super Radyo DZBB'' on the 6:00am timeslot, while the 9:00am half-hour timeslot was filled by a new show ''Ano'ng Say N'yo?'' hosted by Joel Reyes-Zobel. \n\n==Hosts==\n* [[Mike Enriquez]] (2000\u2013present)\n* Melo del Prado (substitute for Enriquez; 2012\u2013present)\n* Joel Reyes Zobel (substitute for Enriquez; 2012\u2013present)\n* Orly Trinidad (substitute for Enriquez, del Prado or Reyes Zobel; 2012\u2013present)\n* Rowena Salvacion (substitute for Enriquez; 2018\u2013present)\n* Susan Enriquez (substitute for Enriquez; 2018\u2013present)\n* Carlo Mateo (substitute for Enriquez; 2012\u2013present)\n\n==Segments==\n===Current segments===\n*''Bantay Panahon'' \u2013 The weather segment and radio counterpart of ''IM Ready: GMA Weather'' segment of GMA news programs on TV. Usually after this, an interview with GMA resident meteorologist Nathaniel Cruz is aired. Sometimes, it is also broadcast as part of ''Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide''\n*''Sports Saksi'' \u2013 Sports segment hosted by Chino Trinidad, which later on became part of ''[[Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide]]'' until June 2018 when it returned as a regular segment.\n*''Alam N'yo Ba?'' \u2013 Infotainment segment of [[Dobol B sa News TV]]\n\n===Discontinued segments===\n*''Bara-Bara'' \u2013 It is now known as ''Sino?''\n*''Imbestigador sa Dobol B'' \u2013 A radio version of the popular investigative TV show on GMA Network, ''[[Imbestigador]]''.\n*''Showbiz Saksi'' \u2013 Showbiz segment hosted by Eagle Riggs.\n*''Sino?'' \u2013 This segment features the trio of Mike Enriquez, Ali Sotto, and [[Arnold Clavio]] discussing [[blind item]]s in politics or showbiz, which later switched its format from segment to program in 2018.\n*''Jeng-Jeng''/''Balitawit'' \u2013 It is a musical and often comedic commentary on the day's news by Clavio, Sotto and Enriquez. The segment is now part of ''Sino?'', former segment which switched its format to program in 2018.\n*''Ano'ng Say N'yo?'' \u2013 Question and Answer segment hosted by Joel Reyes Zobel.

It was hosted by Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, Leila Benitez, and Bobby de Veyra. The pioneer noontime show ended in 1965 when Ilarde went to politics. It was succeeded by several noontime shows until its comeback in 1975.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successors (1965\u20131975) ===\n''Magandang Tanghali'', a musical variety show hosted by [[Pancho Magalona]], and ''Stop Look and Listen'', a former noontime variety show hosted by [[Eddie Mesa]] took over Student Canteen's timeslot in 1965. After Eddie left for the US, ''Twelve O'Clock High'', a show hosted by [[Ariel Ureta]] and Tina Revilla-Valencia), premiered and aired until 1972 when [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] was declared. ABS-CBN and other TV stations were shut down by the Marcos regime. The show moved to RBS (now GMA Network) as ''Ariel con Tina'', a blocktimer by a company headed by Romy Jalosjos from 1972 to 1974. ''Lunch Break'' also gained ground on the same channel before ''Student Canteen'' was eventually revived.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s revival and the birth of ''Eat Bulaga!'' (1975\u2013present) ===\n''Student Canteen'' was revived in 1975 by main host Eddie Ilarde, who produced the program under his production company Program Philippines, Inc. after accepting an offer from [[GMA Network]] executives. He was joined by Bobby Ledesma and Pepe Pimentel with new co-hosts Helen Vela and Coney Reyes.  \n\n''Student Canteen'' soon became the most-watched noontime program in the '70s and Program Philippines soon branched out to producing other TV shows also on GMA-7.  The famous comic trio of [[Tito Sotto]], [[Vic Sotto]], and [[Joey de Leon]] (collectively known as TVJ) became pinch hitters on ''Student Canteen'' when some of the main hosts were on leave. ''Student Canteen'' is the only noontime variety show on Philippine television from 1975 to 1979. Production Specialists, Inc. offered TVJ to host a new noontime show for RPN in 1979. After some misunderstandings with the ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s main hosts, they decided to accept the offer and ''Eat Bulaga!'' aired its first episode on July 30, 1979. Tito, Vic, and Joey were accompanied by Richie D' Horsie and Chiqui Hollmann.\n\n==== Competition ====\nTwo-way competition between noontime shows started in 1979 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' (first aired in RPN 9) was pitted against ''Student Canteen'' (aired on GMA 7). Since then, ''Eat Bulaga!'' has faced several rivalries with other noontime shows through the years.\n\n===== ''Student Canteen'' (1979\u20131986) =====\n''Eat... Bulaga!'' struggled on its ratings due to lack of advertisers on its first year of airing due to ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s stronghold on television. ''EB'' was in danger of cancellation until \"Mr. Macho\" was launched in 1980, which made ''Bulaga'' surpass the ratings of its rival. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' was aired nationwide in 1982 with the launch of RPN's domestic satellite, which also coincided with Coney Reyes' transfer to ''EB'' and Chiqui Hollman to ''Student Canteen''. Other fresh faces were introduced in ''Student Canteen'' but the show was eventually canceled by the GMA management in March 1986, days after the People Power Revolution. ''Student Canteen'' was again revived in 1989, this time on RPN-9 but it was canceled again in 1990 after a misunderstanding occurred between the show's producers and the RPN management.\n\n===== ''[[Lunch Date]]'' (1986\u20131993) =====\n''Lunch Date'' became ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successor in 1986 and was GMA Network's first station-produced noontime variety show. Its original hosts were Orly Mercado, Rico J. Puno, Toni Rose Gayda and Chiqui Hollmann. When the show was reformatted after a year, it only retained both Gayda and Hollman and brought in a mix of old and new faces to host the show, including Randy Santiago, Keno, Lito Pimentel, Tina Revilla, Pilita Corrales, Louie Heredia, Sheryl Cruz, Jon Santos, Dennis Padilla, Fe Delos Reyes, Manilyn Reynes, Willie Revillame and Ai Ai de las Alas. The show introduced new segments that will challenge ''EB''<nowiki/>'s reign in the noontime slot.\n\nIn 1987, \"Eat Bulaga\"'s ratings tilted in their favor when Aiza Seguerra, a Little Miss Philippines winner, joined the show and became an instant hit to viewers. In 1989, changes were in store for both noontime shows.  Former RPN-9 executive Wilma Galvante joined \"Lunch Date\" as overall-in-charge of the show.  Joining her was former \"Eat Bulaga\" writer Vincent Dy Buncio who became the show's director.  Meanwhile, ''Eat... Bulaga!'' moved to ABS-CBN due to RPN's sequestration under the Cory Aquino administration. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' (together with other new shows launched) helped ABS-CBN to attain its status as the No. 1 TV network from being No. 4. It also started the rivalry of GMA Network and ABS-CBN in the noontime slot that still exists until today. In 1993, GMA Network's management decided to reformat their own noontime show and replaced it by ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]''. According to Joey de Leon, ''Lunch Date'' was their toughest opponent ever because it was pitted against ''EB'' for more than 6 years, the longest compared to other noontime shows.\n\n===== ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]'' (1993\u20131995) =====\n''SST'' was first aired on March 20, 1993, as a replacement for ''[[Lunch Date]]'', hosted by [[Randy Santiago]], [[Dennis Padilla]], and Smokey Manaloto with [[Liezl Martinez]], Anjanette Abayari, Joy Ortega and Giselle Sanchez as co-hosts. In less than six months after it aired, SST started to take over ''[[Eat Bulaga!|Eat... Bulaga!]]'' in the ratings by providing fresh interactive segments. Comedians Ai-Ai delas Alas and Bayani Agbayani also became co-hosts of ''SST''.\n\nIt started as a [[blind item]] as 1994 was about to end until showbiz news had leaked out that ''SST'' was going to go off the air to give way to ''Eat... Bulaga!'' at the 12 pm slot, after ''EB'' itself had decided to move to GMA Network following their contract with ABS-CBN was bogged down. During ''SST''<nowiki/>'s New Year episode on December 31, 1994, the announcement of the new variety show's move to GMA was officially made by main hosts Randy Santiago and Dennis Padilla. The hosts and talents were sad because they felt the GMA Network management did not give them a chance to prove that they could carry the noontime show to new heights. But at the same time, they felt happy because the management decided to keep the show after they decided to move ''SST'' to an earlier time slot, as a pre-programming to ''Eat... Bulaga!''. SST made its last noontime episode on January 27, 1995. In June 1995, ''SST'' was permanently canceled.\n\n===== [['Sang Linggo nAPO Sila|''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'']] (1995\u20131998) =====\nDue to ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s moved to rival GMA Network, ABS-CBN decided to make ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' a weeklong noontime show as ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO SIla''. It aired its pilot episode on February 4, 1995 led by the famous APO Hiking Society, TVJ's former co-stars in ''OK Lang,'' a defunct TV show on IBC 13. During its first year, ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo'' was winning the ratings game in the provinces and cities where ABS-CBN have stronger signal. But the real challenge to the show was to deviate its content from the usual noontime variety show that ''Eat... Bulaga!'' presented to the viewers for almost two decades. Meanwhile, ''Bulaga'' had presented new faces like Allan K., Jose Manalo, and Donna Cruz, and new segments such as Super SiReyna and Philippine Bulaga Association. Calendar Girl was introduced by ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'' in 1998 with John Estrada, Randy Santiago, and Willie Revillame handling the segment by delivering naughtier jokes on TV.\n\nThe rating for ''SLNS'' had improved but the main hosts did not sit well with the changes on their show. Eventually, ABS-CBN had ended again its own noontime show (due to criticisms that the show was too intelligent for an average Filipino) on November 28, 1998, with ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' taking place with its main hosts: Randy, John, and Willie.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Magandang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (1998\u20132003) =====\nAfter the APO had failed to beat the continuing supremacy of ''EB'', the new triumvirate of Randy, John, and Willie was pitted to the established trio of Tito, Vic, and Joey as ABS-CBN launched its new noontime show on November 30, 1998, with the title ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan''. Its highlight segment, ''Pera O Bayong'', made ''MTB'' overtook ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s ratings for years. Due to the growing popularity of the show, ''EB'' gave its first millions on television through its new segments ''Meron O Wala'' and the all-time popular segment ''Laban O Bawi'' which featured the phenomenal all-female dance group ''Sexbomb Girls''. Meanwhile, ''MTB'' had faced numerous controversies and suspensions including the one-week suspension of the show in August 1999 due to the notorious green jokes of the main hosts. During that week, a placeholder show entitled ''Esep-Esep'' filled in the timeslot. In 2001, Willie Revillame was axed on the show which resulted in major changes in the set of new hosts and segments.\n\nAnother triumvirate was introduced on ''MTB'' when matinee idols Rico Yan, Dominic Ochoa, and Marvin Agustin joined the show after Willie's exit. Their inclusion resulted in the show bringing in a younger crowd and a more wholesome approach to noontime viewing. However, on March 29, 2002, Rico died during his Lenten vacation in Palawan and ''MTB'' later on reformatted on November 23, 2002, after it had lost its victory in terms of ratings to ''EB''.  The reformat, however, failed to stop the management in deciding to bring back Willie Revillame effective February 22, 2003, which lead to its second incarnation, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan''.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Masayang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (2003\u20132004) =====\n''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' aired its last episode on February 21, 2003 and was replaced by ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' as ABS-CBN's response to the noontime competition against ''Eat... Bulaga!''. The new MTB premiered on February 22, 2003 with Willie reunited with Randy Santiago and John Estrada together with other co-hosts Dennis Padilla, Aiai delas Alas, Bayani Agbayani, Mickey Ferriols, Aubrey Miles, Tado, and Bentong. The show had given out more cash prizes than its predecessor through the segments ''Super Jack En Poy'' and ''Urong Sulong'', that gave away 2 million pesos as a jackpot prize.\n\nBefore the end of 2003, Willie Revillame resigned from the show in the midst of controversy regarding his derogatory joke against their co-host Mahal. The show continued to air until February 2004 with comedian Vhong Navarro and actor-host Edu Manzano taking over Willie's place. However, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' failed to sustain viewership and was given the axe on February 20, 2004, two days before their first anniversary on television.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|MTB: Ang Saya Saya]]'' (2004\u20132005) =====\nThe third incarnation of ''MTB'', entitled ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' premiered on February 21, 2004 with Ai ai delas Alas, Edu Manzano, and Arnell Ignacio as its main hosts. The show also introduced new set of co-hosts and segments, especially reality talent-based search segments. However, these efforts were overshadowed by the spectacular ''Silver Anniversary Special'' of ''Eat Bulaga!'' which got the all-time highest rating of a noontime show exceeding to 30%. On November 15, 2004, ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' lost its 12:00pm slot to Kris Aquino's ''[[Pilipinas, Game KNB?]]'' and started airing as an afternoon variety show on a 1:00pm time slot as the network's strategic move against the anniversary special, but it had failed. After months of low ratings, the management decided to permanently cancelled the third incarnation of ''MTB'' on February 4, 2005 and launched a new noontime show under its new main host Willie Revillame.\n\n===== ''[[Wowowee]]'' (2005\u20132010) =====\nDue to public clamor, former ''MTB'' main host Willie Revillame made his comeback on the noontime slot with the new noontime show entitled ''Wowowee'' on February 5, 2005. ABS-CBN's strong reach in the Philippines and worldwide through TFC had helped ''Wowowee'' to lead the noontime race for years. Willie's novelty songs became popular because of ''Wowowee'' and it became an instant hit to the Filipino masses.\n\n''Wowowee'' also faced different controversies on its five-year run on television. The ULTRA Stampede which happened during the first anniversary of the show, lead to the death of 71 people. The [[Guinness World Records]] cited the incident as \"the greatest death toll in a game show\". Another controversy was the Hello Papi Scandal, wherein Revillame allegedly cheated a contestant during the jackpot round on one of the ''Wowowee''<nowiki/>'s game segments. The scandal also lead to a word war on-air between Willie and one of the ''EB''<nowiki/>'s main hosts Joey de Leon.\n\nThe competition became harder for ''Eat Bulaga!'' so they decided to have a different approach on celebrating their 30th anniversary in 2009 by honoring different people from different fields, giving scholarships to honor students, and constructing classrooms for public schools in different provinces. ''EB'' also renovated their studio to accommodate more studio audience, install LED screens, and to commemorate the first death anniversary of Francis Magalona on March 6, 2010. ''Eat Bulaga!'' also launched its widely popular segment ''Juan for All, All for Juan: Bayanihan of D' Pipol'' (a regular segment which broadcasts from different barangays).\n\nIn 2010, Willie challenged the ABS-CBN management to remove Jobert Sucaldito (radio/TV host) or he will resign from the noontime show due to Sucaldito's criticisms against Revillame and the show itself. SInce May 5, Willie did not appeared on ''Wowowee'' and it became an indefinite leave after numerous days. After negotiations between Revillame and the network, the network decided that ''Wowowee'' will air its final episode on July 30, 2010 (coinciding with ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s 31st anniversary). The show was replaced by ''Pilipinas Win Na Win''. ''Wowowee'' become the ABS-CBN's longest-running noontime show that was pitted against ''Eat Bulaga!''. Willie is currently on GMA Network, hosting ''Wowowin'', a primetime variety game show with the same format with ''Wowowee''.\n\n===== ''[[Pilipinas Win Na Win]]'' (2010) =====\nAfter the cancellation of ''Wowowee'', ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' premiered on July 31, 2010 with Kris Aquino and Robin Padilla as its main hosts, together with other co-hosts from ''Wowowee''. Some of the shows staff left the show to join Willie's comeback on TV5 In 2010. Suffering a plague of low ratings since launch, ABS-CBN asked Kris mid-September for her to leave the show, and so she quietly left the show without any goodbyes on September 2010. Two days later on October 2, ABS-CBN officially announced four new hosts and two new co-hosts. The four hosts tagged as the \"hitmakers\" include [[Rico J. Puno]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Marco Sison]], and [[Nonoy Zuniga]].\n\nAfter a battle of constant low ratings and many alternate time slots, ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' ended on December 31, 2010 during the New Year celebration. The cancellation was announced by [[Rico J. Puno]] several times during the December 20 episode. Rumors of this issue were around entertainment websites from interviews of a fellow co-host, [[Valerie Concepcion]] before the network announced its cancellation. Its time slot was temporarily occupied by [[Showtime (Philippines)|''Showtime'']]. On February 12, 2011, a new noontime show was aired entitled ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]''. The show was ABS-CBN's shortest-lived noontime show.\n\n===== ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]'' (2011\u20132012) =====\nThe unsuccessful stint of ''PWNW'' was immediately replaced by ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' which premiered on February 12, 2011. Before its premiere, Willie Revillame (at that time, he was hosting ''Willing Willie'' on TV5) challenged its upcoming host John Estrada that the ''HYY'' will not reach its success in terms of ratings and Revillame will promote ''Eat Bulaga!'' constantly on his show. ''HYY'' was hosted by former ''MTB'' hosts John Estrada and Randy Santiago, Toni Gonzaga, Rico J. Puno, Pokwang, and others. The new noontime show introduced segments similar to its predecessors like ''Pera O Bayong'', ''My Girl'', ''Miss Kasamabahay'', etc.\n\nRevillame's prediction came to reality. ''HYY'' constantly got low ratings because of ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s stronghold to its noontime viewership. On January 2012, ''Showtime'' was cancelled on its late morning slot and it was later revealed that ''Showtime'' will be formatted into a new noontime variety show, replacing ''HYY''. ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' aired its final episode on February 4, 2012 to give way to ABS-CBN's new noontime show, ''It's Showtime''.\n\n===== [[It's Showtime (TV program)|''It's Showtime'']] (2009\u2013present) =====\n''<nowiki/>Showtime'', a morning talent show that existed since October 24, 2009 as a lead-in program to ''Wowowee'', was a big hit among the viewers that it even eclipsed the ratings of both ''Wowowee'' and ''Eat Bulaga''.  The show tested the noontime waters in January 2011 as a temporary replacement for ''Pilipinas Win na Win'' before going back to the morning slot in February 2011 to give way to ''Happy Yipee Yehey!''.  \n\nThe solid performance of ''Showtime'' as the top morning variety show prompted ABS-CBN management to transfer it to the noontime slot as ''It's Showtime'' on February 6, 2012. The new noontime show introduced segments from the ''Showtime'' series and new segments like ''Sine Mo 'To'', ''AdVice Ganda'', ''That's My Tomboy'', ''I Am PoGay'', and ''Magpasikat''. The show is currently hosted by Vice Ganda, Anne Curtis, Vhong Navarro, Jhong Hilario, Karylle, Ryan Bang, Mariel Rodriguez, Amy Perez, Jugs and Teddy. Currently, they feature the segments Tawag ng Tanghalan and Ms. Q&A. All of these segments were hits and caused them to fare well with''Eat Bulaga'' in the ratings game since 2016, with EB leading in NUTAM and IS leading in KANTAR.\n\n== Sunday noontime shows ==\nCurrently, ABS-CBN's ''ASAP'' now holds the record of being the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show which was first aired in 1995 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' moved to GMA Network and the Sunday noontime show ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' became a weeklong noontime show. During its 22nd anniversary, ''ASAP'' already surpassed the record of ''[[GMA Supershow]]'' as the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show.\n\nIts current rival program is ''All-Out Sundays'' aired on GMA Network. ''AOS'' aired its pilot episode in January 2020 as a replacement to ''Sunday PinaSaya''.\n\nOther popular defunct Sunday noontime variety shows are the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[GMA Network]]\n![[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]]\n|-\n|''[[GMA Supershow]]'' (May 7, 1978 - January 26, 1997)\n[[SOP (TV program)|''SOP'']] (February 2, 1997 - February 28, 2010)\n\n''[[Party Pilipinas]]'' (March 28, 2010 - May 19, 2013)\n\n''[[Sunday All Stars]]'' (June 16, 2013 - August 2, 2015)\n\n''[[Sunday PinaSaya]]'' (August 9, 2015 \u2013 December 29, 2019)\n\n'''[[All-Out Sundays|''All-Out Sundays'']] (January 5, 2020 \u2013 present)'''\n|''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' (January 28, 1990 - January 29, 1995)\n'''[[ASAP (TV program)|''ASAP'']] (February 5, 1995 \u2013 present)'''\n|-\n![[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|''[[P.O.5]]'' (April 11, 2010 - February 20, 2011)\n''[[Fan*tastik]]'' (February 27 - May 22, 2011)\n\n[[Sunday Funday (variety show)|''Sunday Funday'']] (April 8 - June 10, 2012)\n\n''[[Game 'N Go]]'' (June 17, 2012 - February 3, 2013)\n\n''[[Happy Truck ng Bayan]]'' (June 14, 2015 - February 7, 2016)\n\n''[[Happy Truck HAPPinas]]'' (March 6 - May 1, 2016) \n|}\n\n\n== List of weeklong noontime variety shows aired from 1958-present ==\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray; background: #CFECEC\"\n|Series shaded in light blue are currently in production.\n|}\nLength of current noontime shows are as of February 6, 2018.

It was hosted by Eddie Ilarde, Bobby Ledesma, Leila Benitez, and Bobby de Veyra. The pioneer noontime show ended in 1965 when Ilarde went to politics. It was succeeded by several noontime shows until its comeback in 1975.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successors (1965\u20131975) ===\n''Magandang Tanghali'', a musical variety show hosted by [[Pancho Magalona]], and ''Stop Look and Listen'', a former noontime variety show hosted by [[Eddie Mesa]] took over Student Canteen's timeslot in 1965. After Eddie left for the US, ''Twelve O'Clock High'', a show hosted by [[Ariel Ureta]] and Tina Revilla-Valencia), premiered and aired until 1972 when [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial Law]] was declared. ABS-CBN and other TV stations were shut down by the Marcos regime. The show moved to RBS (now GMA Network) as ''Ariel con Tina'', a blocktimer by a company headed by Romy Jalosjos from 1972 to 1974. ''Lunch Break'' also gained ground on the same channel before ''Student Canteen'' was eventually revived.\n\n=== ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s revival and the birth of ''Eat Bulaga!'' (1975\u2013present) ===\n''Student Canteen'' was revived in 1975 by main host Eddie Ilarde, who produced the program under his production company Program Philippines, Inc. after accepting an offer from [[GMA Network]] executives. He was joined by Bobby Ledesma and Pepe Pimentel with new co-hosts Helen Vela and Coney Reyes.  \n\n''Student Canteen'' soon became the most-watched noontime program in the '70s and Program Philippines soon branched out to producing other TV shows also on GMA-7.  The famous comic trio of [[Tito Sotto]], [[Vic Sotto]], and [[Joey de Leon]] (collectively known as TVJ) became pinch hitters on ''Student Canteen'' when some of the main hosts were on leave. ''Student Canteen'' is the only noontime variety show on Philippine television from 1975 to 1979. Production Specialists, Inc. offered TVJ to host a new noontime show for RPN in 1979. After some misunderstandings with the ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s main hosts, they decided to accept the offer and ''Eat Bulaga!'' aired its first episode on July 30, 1979. Tito, Vic, and Joey were accompanied by Richie D' Horsie and Chiqui Hollmann.\n\n==== Competition ====\nTwo-way competition between noontime shows started in 1979 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' (first aired in RPN 9) was pitted against ''Student Canteen'' (aired on GMA 7). Since then, ''Eat Bulaga!'' has faced several rivalries with other noontime shows through the years.\n\n===== ''Student Canteen'' (1979\u20131986) =====\n''Eat... Bulaga!'' struggled on its ratings due to lack of advertisers on its first year of airing due to ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s stronghold on television. ''EB'' was in danger of cancellation until \"Mr. Macho\" was launched in 1980, which made ''Bulaga'' surpass the ratings of its rival. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' was aired nationwide in 1982 with the launch of RPN's domestic satellite, which also coincided with Coney Reyes' transfer to ''EB'' and Chiqui Hollman to ''Student Canteen''. Other fresh faces were introduced in ''Student Canteen'' but the show was eventually canceled by the GMA management in March 1986, days after the People Power Revolution. ''Student Canteen'' was again revived in 1989, this time on RPN-9 but it was canceled again in 1990 after a misunderstanding occurred between the show's producers and the RPN management.\n\n===== ''[[Lunch Date]]'' (1986\u20131993) =====\n''Lunch Date'' became ''Student Canteen''<nowiki/>'s successor in 1986 and was GMA Network's first station-produced noontime variety show. Its original hosts were Orly Mercado, Rico J. Puno, Toni Rose Gayda and Chiqui Hollmann. When the show was reformatted after a year, it only retained both Gayda and Hollman and brought in a mix of old and new faces to host the show, including Randy Santiago, Keno, Lito Pimentel, Tina Revilla, Pilita Corrales, Louie Heredia, Sheryl Cruz, Jon Santos, Dennis Padilla, Fe Delos Reyes, Manilyn Reynes, Willie Revillame and Ai Ai de las Alas. The show introduced new segments that will challenge ''EB''<nowiki/>'s reign in the noontime slot.\n\nIn 1987, \"Eat Bulaga\"'s ratings tilted in their favor when Aiza Seguerra, a Little Miss Philippines winner, joined the show and became an instant hit to viewers. In 1989, changes were in store for both noontime shows.  Former RPN-9 executive Wilma Galvante joined \"Lunch Date\" as overall-in-charge of the show.  Joining her was former \"Eat Bulaga\" writer Vincent Dy Buncio who became the show's director.  Meanwhile, ''Eat... Bulaga!'' moved to ABS-CBN due to RPN's sequestration under the Cory Aquino administration. ''Eat... Bulaga!'' (together with other new shows launched) helped ABS-CBN to attain its status as the No. 1 TV network from being No. 4. It also started the rivalry of GMA Network and ABS-CBN in the noontime slot that still exists until today. In 1993, GMA Network's management decided to reformat their own noontime show and replaced it by ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]''. According to Joey de Leon, ''Lunch Date'' was their toughest opponent ever because it was pitted against ''EB'' for more than 6 years, the longest compared to other noontime shows.\n\n===== ''[[SST: Salo-Salo Together]]'' (1993\u20131995) =====\n''SST'' was first aired on March 20, 1993, as a replacement for ''[[Lunch Date]]'', hosted by [[Randy Santiago]], [[Dennis Padilla]], and Smokey Manaloto with [[Liezl Martinez]], Anjanette Abayari, Joy Ortega and Giselle Sanchez as co-hosts. In less than six months after it aired, SST started to take over ''[[Eat Bulaga!|Eat... Bulaga!]]'' in the ratings by providing fresh interactive segments. Comedians Ai-Ai delas Alas and Bayani Agbayani also became co-hosts of ''SST''.\n\nIt started as a [[blind item]] as 1994 was about to end until showbiz news had leaked out that ''SST'' was going to go off the air to give way to ''Eat... Bulaga!'' at the 12 pm slot, after ''EB'' itself had decided to move to GMA Network following their contract with ABS-CBN was bogged down. During ''SST''<nowiki/>'s New Year episode on December 31, 1994, the announcement of the new variety show's move to GMA was officially made by main hosts Randy Santiago and Dennis Padilla. The hosts and talents were sad because they felt the GMA Network management did not give them a chance to prove that they could carry the noontime show to new heights. But at the same time, they felt happy because the management decided to keep the show after they decided to move ''SST'' to an earlier time slot, as a pre-programming to ''Eat... Bulaga!''. SST made its last noontime episode on January 27, 1995. In June 1995, ''SST'' was permanently canceled.\n\n===== [['Sang Linggo nAPO Sila|''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'']] (1995\u20131998) =====\nDue to ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s moved to rival GMA Network, ABS-CBN decided to make ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' a weeklong noontime show as ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO SIla''. It aired its pilot episode on February 4, 1995 led by the famous APO Hiking Society, TVJ's former co-stars in ''OK Lang,'' a defunct TV show on IBC 13. During its first year, ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo'' was winning the ratings game in the provinces and cities where ABS-CBN have stronger signal. But the real challenge to the show was to deviate its content from the usual noontime variety show that ''Eat... Bulaga!'' presented to the viewers for almost two decades. Meanwhile, ''Bulaga'' had presented new faces like Allan K., Jose Manalo, and Donna Cruz, and new segments such as Super SiReyna and Philippine Bulaga Association. Calendar Girl was introduced by ''<nowiki/>'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila'' in 1998 with John Estrada, Randy Santiago, and Willie Revillame handling the segment by delivering naughtier jokes on TV.\n\nThe rating for ''SLNS'' had improved but the main hosts did not sit well with the changes on their show. Eventually, ABS-CBN had ended again its own noontime show (due to criticisms that the show was too intelligent for an average Filipino) on November 28, 1998, with ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' taking place with its main hosts: Randy, John, and Willie.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Magandang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (1998\u20132003) =====\nAfter the APO had failed to beat the continuing supremacy of ''EB'', the new triumvirate of Randy, John, and Willie was pitted to the established trio of Tito, Vic, and Joey as ABS-CBN launched its new noontime show on November 30, 1998, with the title ''Magandang Tanghali Bayan''. Its highlight segment, ''Pera O Bayong'', made ''MTB'' overtook ''Eat... Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s ratings for years. Due to the growing popularity of the show, ''EB'' gave its first millions on television through its new segments ''Meron O Wala'' and the all-time popular segment ''Laban O Bawi'' which featured the phenomenal all-female dance group ''Sexbomb Girls''. Meanwhile, ''MTB'' had faced numerous controversies and suspensions including the one-week suspension of the show in August 1999 due to the notorious green jokes of the main hosts. During that week, a placeholder show entitled ''Esep-Esep'' filled in the timeslot. In 2001, Willie Revillame was axed on the show which resulted in major changes in the set of new hosts and segments.\n\nAnother triumvirate was introduced on ''MTB'' when matinee idols Rico Yan, Dominic Ochoa, and Marvin Agustin joined the show after Willie's exit. Their inclusion resulted in the show bringing in a younger crowd and a more wholesome approach to noontime viewing. However, on March 29, 2002, Rico died during his Lenten vacation in Palawan and ''MTB'' later on reformatted on November 23, 2002, after it had lost its victory in terms of ratings to ''EB''.  The reformat, however, failed to stop the management in deciding to bring back Willie Revillame effective February 22, 2003, which lead to its second incarnation, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan''.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|Masayang Tanghali Bayan]]'' (2003\u20132004) =====\n''Magandang Tanghali Bayan'' aired its last episode on February 21, 2003 and was replaced by ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' as ABS-CBN's response to the noontime competition against ''Eat... Bulaga!''. The new MTB premiered on February 22, 2003 with Willie reunited with Randy Santiago and John Estrada together with other co-hosts Dennis Padilla, Aiai delas Alas, Bayani Agbayani, Mickey Ferriols, Aubrey Miles, Tado, and Bentong. The show had given out more cash prizes than its predecessor through the segments ''Super Jack En Poy'' and ''Urong Sulong'', that gave away 2 million pesos as a jackpot prize.\n\nBefore the end of 2003, Willie Revillame resigned from the show in the midst of controversy regarding his derogatory joke against their co-host Mahal. The show continued to air until February 2004 with comedian Vhong Navarro and actor-host Edu Manzano taking over Willie's place. However, ''Masayang Tanghali Bayan'' failed to sustain viewership and was given the axe on February 20, 2004, two days before their first anniversary on television.\n\n===== ''[[MTB (Philippine variety show)|MTB: Ang Saya Saya]]'' (2004\u20132005) =====\nThe third incarnation of ''MTB'', entitled ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' premiered on February 21, 2004 with Ai ai delas Alas, Edu Manzano, and Arnell Ignacio as its main hosts. The show also introduced new set of co-hosts and segments, especially reality talent-based search segments. However, these efforts were overshadowed by the spectacular ''Silver Anniversary Special'' of ''Eat Bulaga!'' which got the all-time highest rating of a noontime show exceeding to 30%. On November 15, 2004, ''MTB: Ang Saya Saya'' lost its 12:00pm slot to Kris Aquino's ''[[Pilipinas, Game KNB?]]'' and started airing as an afternoon variety show on a 1:00pm time slot as the network's strategic move against the anniversary special, but it had failed. After months of low ratings, the management decided to permanently cancelled the third incarnation of ''MTB'' on February 4, 2005 and launched a new noontime show under its new main host Willie Revillame.\n\n===== ''[[Wowowee]]'' (2005\u20132010) =====\nDue to public clamor, former ''MTB'' main host Willie Revillame made his comeback on the noontime slot with the new noontime show entitled ''Wowowee'' on February 5, 2005. ABS-CBN's strong reach in the Philippines and worldwide through TFC had helped ''Wowowee'' to lead the noontime race for years. Willie's novelty songs became popular because of ''Wowowee'' and it became an instant hit to the Filipino masses.\n\n''Wowowee'' also faced different controversies on its five-year run on television. The ULTRA Stampede which happened during the first anniversary of the show, lead to the death of 71 people. The [[Guinness World Records]] cited the incident as \"the greatest death toll in a game show\". Another controversy was the Hello Papi Scandal, wherein Revillame allegedly cheated a contestant during the jackpot round on one of the ''Wowowee''<nowiki/>'s game segments. The scandal also lead to a word war on-air between Willie and one of the ''EB''<nowiki/>'s main hosts Joey de Leon.\n\nThe competition became harder for ''Eat Bulaga!'' so they decided to have a different approach on celebrating their 30th anniversary in 2009 by honoring different people from different fields, giving scholarships to honor students, and constructing classrooms for public schools in different provinces. ''EB'' also renovated their studio to accommodate more studio audience, install LED screens, and to commemorate the first death anniversary of Francis Magalona on March 6, 2010. ''Eat Bulaga!'' also launched its widely popular segment ''Juan for All, All for Juan: Bayanihan of D' Pipol'' (a regular segment which broadcasts from different barangays).\n\nIn 2010, Willie challenged the ABS-CBN management to remove Jobert Sucaldito (radio/TV host) or he will resign from the noontime show due to Sucaldito's criticisms against Revillame and the show itself. SInce May 5, Willie did not appeared on ''Wowowee'' and it became an indefinite leave after numerous days. After negotiations between Revillame and the network, the network decided that ''Wowowee'' will air its final episode on July 30, 2010 (coinciding with ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s 31st anniversary). The show was replaced by ''Pilipinas Win Na Win''. ''Wowowee'' become the ABS-CBN's longest-running noontime show that was pitted against ''Eat Bulaga!''. Willie is currently on GMA Network, hosting ''Wowowin'', a primetime variety game show with the same format with ''Wowowee''.\n\n===== ''[[Pilipinas Win Na Win]]'' (2010) =====\nAfter the cancellation of ''Wowowee'', ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' premiered on July 31, 2010 with Kris Aquino and Robin Padilla as its main hosts, together with other co-hosts from ''Wowowee''. Some of the shows staff left the show to join Willie's comeback on TV5 In 2010. Suffering a plague of low ratings since launch, ABS-CBN asked Kris mid-September for her to leave the show, and so she quietly left the show without any goodbyes on September 2010. Two days later on October 2, ABS-CBN officially announced four new hosts and two new co-hosts. The four hosts tagged as the \"hitmakers\" include [[Rico J. Puno]], [[Rey Valera]], [[Marco Sison]], and [[Nonoy Zuniga]].\n\nAfter a battle of constant low ratings and many alternate time slots, ''Pilipinas Win Na Win'' ended on December 31, 2010 during the New Year celebration. The cancellation was announced by [[Rico J. Puno]] several times during the December 20 episode. Rumors of this issue were around entertainment websites from interviews of a fellow co-host, [[Valerie Concepcion]] before the network announced its cancellation. Its time slot was temporarily occupied by [[Showtime (Philippines)|''Showtime'']]. On February 12, 2011, a new noontime show was aired entitled ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]''. The show was ABS-CBN's shortest-lived noontime show.\n\n===== ''[[Happy Yipee Yehey!]]'' (2011\u20132012) =====\nThe unsuccessful stint of ''PWNW'' was immediately replaced by ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' which premiered on February 12, 2011. Before its premiere, Willie Revillame (at that time, he was hosting ''Willing Willie'' on TV5) challenged its upcoming host John Estrada that the ''HYY'' will not reach its success in terms of ratings and Revillame will promote ''Eat Bulaga!'' constantly on his show. ''HYY'' was hosted by former ''MTB'' hosts John Estrada and Randy Santiago, Toni Gonzaga, Rico J. Puno, Pokwang, and others. The new noontime show introduced segments similar to its predecessors like ''Pera O Bayong'', ''My Girl'', ''Miss Kasamabahay'', etc.\n\nRevillame's prediction came to reality. ''HYY'' constantly got low ratings because of ''Eat Bulaga!''<nowiki/>'s stronghold to its noontime viewership. On January 2012, ''Showtime'' was cancelled on its late morning slot and it was later revealed that ''Showtime'' will be formatted into a new noontime variety show, replacing ''HYY''. ''Happy Yipee Yehey'' aired its final episode on February 4, 2012 to give way to ABS-CBN's new noontime show, ''It's Showtime''.\n\n===== [[It's Showtime (TV program)|''It's Showtime'']] (2009\u2013present) =====\n''<nowiki/>Showtime'', a morning talent show that existed since October 24, 2009 as a lead-in program to ''Wowowee'', was a big hit among the viewers that it even eclipsed the ratings of both ''Wowowee'' and ''Eat Bulaga''.  The show tested the noontime waters in January 2011 as a temporary replacement for ''Pilipinas Win na Win'' before going back to the morning slot in February 2011 to give way to ''Happy Yipee Yehey!''.  \n\nThe solid performance of ''Showtime'' as the top morning variety show prompted ABS-CBN management to transfer it to the noontime slot as ''It's Showtime'' on February 6, 2012. The new noontime show introduced segments from the ''Showtime'' series and new segments like ''Sine Mo 'To'', ''AdVice Ganda'', ''That's My Tomboy'', ''I Am PoGay'', and ''Magpasikat''. The show is currently hosted by Vice Ganda, Anne Curtis, Vhong Navarro, Jhong Hilario, Karylle, Ryan Bang, Mariel Rodriguez, Amy Perez, Jugs and Teddy. Currently, they feature the segments Tawag ng Tanghalan and Ms. Q&A. All of these segments were hits and caused them to fare well with''Eat Bulaga'' in the ratings game since 2016, with EB leading in NUTAM and IS leading in KANTAR.\n\n== Sunday noontime shows ==\nCurrently, ABS-CBN's ''ASAP'' now holds the record of being the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show which was first aired in 1995 when ''Eat Bulaga!'' moved to GMA Network and the Sunday noontime show ''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' became a weeklong noontime show. During its 22nd anniversary, ''ASAP'' already surpassed the record of ''[[GMA Supershow]]'' as the longest-running Sunday noontime variety show.\n\nIts current rival program is ''All-Out Sundays'' aired on GMA Network. ''AOS'' aired its pilot episode in January 2020 as a replacement to ''Sunday PinaSaya''.\n\nOther popular defunct Sunday noontime variety shows are the following:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[GMA Network]]\n![[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]]\n|-\n|''[[GMA Supershow]]'' (May 7, 1978 - January 26, 1997)\n[[SOP (TV program)|''SOP'']] (February 2, 1997 - February 28, 2010)\n\n''[[Party Pilipinas]]'' (March 28, 2010 - May 19, 2013)\n\n''[[Sunday All Stars]]'' (June 16, 2013 - August 2, 2015)\n\n''[[Sunday PinaSaya]]'' (August 9, 2015 \u2013 December 29, 2019)\n\n'''[[All-Out Sundays|''All-Out Sundays'']] (January 5, 2020 \u2013 present)'''\n|''[[Sa Linggo nAPO Sila]]'' (January 28, 1990 - January 29, 1995)\n'''[[ASAP (TV program)|''ASAP'']] (February 5, 1995 \u2013 present)'''\n|-\n![[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n|-\n|''[[P.O.5]]'' (April 11, 2010 - February 20, 2011)\n''[[Fan*tastik]]'' (February 27 - May 22, 2011)\n\n[[Sunday Funday (variety show)|''Sunday Funday'']] (April 8 - June 10, 2012)\n\n''[[Game 'N Go]]'' (June 17, 2012 - February 3, 2013)\n\n''[[Happy Truck ng Bayan]]'' (June 14, 2015 - February 7, 2016)\n\n''[[Happy Truck HAPPinas]]'' (March 6 - May 1, 2016) \n|}\n\n\n== List of weeklong noontime variety shows aired from 1958-present ==\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray; background: #CFECEC\"\n|Series shaded in light blue are currently in production.\n|}\nLength of current noontime shows are as of February 6, 2018.

Some of them fall off, but others cling on desperately and yell at the people nestling deep in the snug softness, stuffing themselves with delicious food and drink. 'Ladies and Gentlemen,' they yell, 'we are floating in space!' But none of the people down there care.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theotherside1.co.uk/spiritualized_discography.htm |title=Spiritualized Discography |access-date=21 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701164932/http://www.theotherside1.co.uk/spiritualized_discography.htm |archive-date=1 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nThe album itself was recorded shortly after the break-up of Spiritualized's [[Jason Pierce]] and [[Kate Radley]], the band's keyboard player. Radley had secretly married [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[The Verve]] in 1995.<ref>[http://altmusic.about.com/od/1990s/fr/spiritualized.htm Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space; \"Little J Is Sad and F**ked\" section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125185324/http://altmusic.about.com/od/1990s/fr/spiritualized.htm |date=25 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1479214/bio Richard Ashcroft biography on IMDb]</ref> Pierce, however, maintains that much of the album, including \"Broken Heart\" and \"Cool Waves\", had been written before the breakup.<ref name=\"Uncut\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/spiritualized-ladies-and-gentlemen-we-are-floating-in-space |title=Spiritualized \u2013 ''Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space'' |work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=7 December 2009 |accessdate=14 June 2015 |last=Martin |first=Piers}}</ref> \"If you write a song like ''[Broken Heart]'', you have to make it feel like what it's like to have a broken heart,\" he said. \"That's what making albums is all about.

Elvis mix]</ref> The Presley estate initially objected to this, and a remixed version appeared on the commercial release, with new lyrics. However, Spiritualized continue to use both sets of lyrics in live performances. By 2009, they were allowed to use the version with the Presley lyrics on the reissued edition of the album, with the proviso that the song be titled \"Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space (I Can't Help Falling in Love).\"\n\nAlbum closer \"Cop Shoot Cop...\" references lyrics from [[John Prine]]'s \"[[Sam Stone (song)|Sam Stone]]\", incorporating variations on a key line from that song's chorus.\n\n==Recording==\nIn the summer of 1995 Jason Pierce and Sean Cook entered Moles Studio in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], to start work on demo recordings with resident engineer Trevor Curwen. Pierce would develop his ideas into complete songs during this period.<ref name=\"the mix\">Kempster, Chris \"Studio secrets of the stars \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen-we are floating in Space\" The Mix , Issue 54, Future Publishing, October 1998, p.70</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, recording of the album proper began in earnest, with all of the band members present. Working on 24 track tape synchronised to an Atari [[Music sequencer|sequencer]] allowed Pierce to build up sequenced tracks from [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of live playing, coupled with some parts gleaned from the demo sessions. The full band line-up, including John Coxon on guitar, performed live over this sequenced backbone.<ref name=\"the mix\" />\n\nWith the basic framework intact, Pierce moved the project to London to work with producer/engineer [[Darren Allison]] ([[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]) on the recording of vocals, guitars, keyboards, gospel choir and brass section at The Church Studios. The pair worked on further vocal recording at Rooster Studios, before moving on to recording Strings with the [[Balanescu Quartet]] at London's legendary [[Olympic Studios]]. At this point, Pierce made a trip to the USA to record Dr John's Piano and vocal parts on the track \"Cop Shoot Cop\".<ref name=\"the mix\" />\n\nThe mixing process involved various studios and personnel. Beginning at [[House of Blues]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Pierce returned to work again with [[Darren Allison]] at The Strongroom Studios, [[John Leckie]], and Trevor Curwen at Moles Studio.<ref name=\"the mix\" />\n\nWith the mixing phase complete, Pierce concentrated on post-production and editing with Mads Bjerke, and [[Ray Staff]] at Whitfield Street Studios took charge of the mastering process.\n\n==Special editions==\nThe artwork was designed by Pierce in collaboration with [[Mark Farrow]]. A special edition of the album was packaged in a box designed to resemble prescription medicine, complete with \"dosage advice\" and a foil blister pack containing the CD.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1346994 Images for Spiritualized  \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space]</ref> A limited edition was also released, featuring each of the 12 songs in its own individually wrapped 3-inch CD, inside a large blister pack and box.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=607356 Images for Spiritualized  \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space box set]</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ladies-and-gentlemen-we-are-floating-in-space-mw0000023701 |title=''Ladies and Gentlemen...

But none of the people down there care.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.theotherside1.co.uk/spiritualized_discography.htm |title=Spiritualized Discography |access-date=21 March 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701164932/http://www.theotherside1.co.uk/spiritualized_discography.htm |archive-date=1 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\nThe album itself was recorded shortly after the break-up of Spiritualized's [[Jason Pierce]] and [[Kate Radley]], the band's keyboard player. Radley had secretly married [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[The Verve]] in 1995.<ref>[http://altmusic.about.com/od/1990s/fr/spiritualized.htm Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space; \"Little J Is Sad and F**ked\" section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125185324/http://altmusic.about.com/od/1990s/fr/spiritualized.htm |date=25 November 2009 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1479214/bio Richard Ashcroft biography on IMDb]</ref> Pierce, however, maintains that much of the album, including \"Broken Heart\" and \"Cool Waves\", had been written before the breakup.<ref name=\"Uncut\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/spiritualized-ladies-and-gentlemen-we-are-floating-in-space |title=Spiritualized \u2013 ''Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space'' |work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=7 December 2009 |accessdate=14 June 2015 |last=Martin |first=Piers}}</ref> \"If you write a song like ''[Broken Heart]'', you have to make it feel like what it's like to have a broken heart,\" he said. \"That's what making albums is all about.

Elvis mix]</ref> The Presley estate initially objected to this, and a remixed version appeared on the commercial release, with new lyrics. However, Spiritualized continue to use both sets of lyrics in live performances. By 2009, they were allowed to use the version with the Presley lyrics on the reissued edition of the album, with the proviso that the song be titled \"Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space (I Can't Help Falling in Love).\"\n\nAlbum closer \"Cop Shoot Cop...\" references lyrics from [[John Prine]]'s \"[[Sam Stone (song)|Sam Stone]]\", incorporating variations on a key line from that song's chorus.\n\n==Recording==\nIn the summer of 1995 Jason Pierce and Sean Cook entered Moles Studio in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], to start work on demo recordings with resident engineer Trevor Curwen. Pierce would develop his ideas into complete songs during this period.<ref name=\"the mix\">Kempster, Chris \"Studio secrets of the stars \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen-we are floating in Space\" The Mix , Issue 54, Future Publishing, October 1998, p.70</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, recording of the album proper began in earnest, with all of the band members present. Working on 24 track tape synchronised to an Atari [[Music sequencer|sequencer]] allowed Pierce to build up sequenced tracks from [[Sampling (music)|samples]] of live playing, coupled with some parts gleaned from the demo sessions. The full band line-up, including John Coxon on guitar, performed live over this sequenced backbone.<ref name=\"the mix\" />\n\nWith the basic framework intact, Pierce moved the project to London to work with producer/engineer [[Darren Allison]] ([[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]) on the recording of vocals, guitars, keyboards, gospel choir and brass section at The Church Studios. The pair worked on further vocal recording at Rooster Studios, before moving on to recording Strings with the [[Balanescu Quartet]] at London's legendary [[Olympic Studios]]. At this point, Pierce made a trip to the USA to record Dr John's Piano and vocal parts on the track \"Cop Shoot Cop\".<ref name=\"the mix\" />\n\nThe mixing process involved various studios and personnel. Beginning at [[House of Blues]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Pierce returned to work again with [[Darren Allison]] at The Strongroom Studios, [[John Leckie]], and Trevor Curwen at Moles Studio.<ref name=\"the mix\" />\n\nWith the mixing phase complete, Pierce concentrated on post-production and editing with Mads Bjerke, and [[Ray Staff]] at Whitfield Street Studios took charge of the mastering process.\n\n==Special editions==\nThe artwork was designed by Pierce in collaboration with [[Mark Farrow]]. A special edition of the album was packaged in a box designed to resemble prescription medicine, complete with \"dosage advice\" and a foil blister pack containing the CD.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1346994 Images for Spiritualized  \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space]</ref> A limited edition was also released, featuring each of the 12 songs in its own individually wrapped 3-inch CD, inside a large blister pack and box.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=607356 Images for Spiritualized  \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space box set]</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"AllMusic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/ladies-and-gentlemen-we-are-floating-in-space-mw0000023701 |title=''Ladies and Gentlemen...
