It is bordered to the east by the [[Central African Republic]], to the south by [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], to the north by the [[Adamawa Region]], and to the west by the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre]] and [[South Region (Cameroon)|South Region]]s. With 109,002&nbsp;km\u00b2 of territory, it is the largest region in the nation as well as the most sparsely populated. Historically, the peoples of the East have been settled in Cameroonian territory for longer than any other of the country's many ethnic groups, the first inhabitants being the [[Baka (nomadic Central African people)|Baka]] (or Babinga) [[pygmy|pygmies]].\n\nThe East Region has very little [[industry]], its main commerce consisting of [[logging]], [[timber]], and [[mining]]. Instead, the bulk of its inhabitants are [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]]. The region is thus of little political import and is often ignored by Cameroonian politicians. This coupled with the low level of development in the province have led to its being dubbed \"the forgotten province\".\n\n==2008 presidential decree on abolition of provinces==\n\nIn 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, [[Paul Biya|President Paul Biya]] signed decrees abolishing \"Provinces\" and replacing them with \"Regions\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Land===\n\nThe [[soil]] of the East is predominantly [[ferrallitic]], rich with [[iron]] and red in colour. The southern three quarters of the region consists of [[metamorphic rock]] such as [[gneiss]], [[schist]], [[mica]], and [[migmatite]]. Starting at about the level of [[Bertoua]] and going north, however, [[granite]] becomes the dominate soil component. While the region supports an abundance of plant life, it is not particularly fertile due to leaching caused by the humid environment. Eastern dirt hardens quickly in the sun, and it is often used as a building material by poorer inhabitants.\n\n===Drainage===\n\nThe region contains several river systems: the [[Nyong River|Nyong]], which drains the central-western area, the [[Dja River|Dja]] in the southwest, the [[Lom River|Lom]] in the northeast, the [[Kad\u00e9\u00ef River|Kad\u00e9\u00ef]], which drains the northwest, the [[Boumba River|Boumba]] in the centre and southeast, and the [[Sangha River|Sangha]] and [[Ngoko River|Ngoko]], which drain portions of the southeast and form the border with the Central African Republic and Congo respectively. Many of these rivers have carved out valleys that surround them. The rivers of the territory have only slight gradients, and floods can occur along them during the rainy season. The Lom and Nyong rivers eventually empty into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. All other rivers in the East form part of the [[Congo River basin]].\n\n===Relief===\n\nAlmost the entire territory of the East Region lies on the [[South Cameroon Plateau]] that forms the southeastern half of the country. The elevation thus varies between 500 and 1000 metres above sea level except for lower-lying [[plain]]s of 200 to 500 metres in the extreme southeast centered on the Dja, Boumba, Sangha, and Ngoko Rivers. The land consists largely of monotonous, gently undulating hills known as \"half-oranges\" due to their resemblance to that fruit.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe East has a [[Type A climate|Type A]] [[wet equatorial climate]] (also known as a [[Guinea type climate]]), meaning that it experiences high temperatures (24\u02da C on average) and a lack of traditional [[season]]s. Instead, there is a long dry season from December to May, a light wet season from May to June, a short dry season from July to October, and a heavy wet season from October to November. Humidity and cloud cover are relatively high, and precipitation averages 1500\u20132000&nbsp;mm per year except in the extreme eastern and northern portions, where it is slightly less.\n\n[[File:East - Guinean Savanna 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Guinean savanna near Bertoua]]\n\n===Plant and animal life===\n\nApproximately the lower two thirds of the region is covered in [[rain forest]], which grows progressively thicker as one travels south. The forests are composed of hardwood evergreens of species such as [[dibetu]], [[ebony]], [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]], [[mahogany]], [[obeche]], and [[Sapele|sapelli]], some of which grow to heights of 70 metres or more. There are also numerous [[fern]]s and [[orchid]]s. This forest is stratified into several levels. The first is composed of straight, thick-rooted trees averaging about 40-metres tall. After this grow shorter, thinner trees with highly placed clusters of leaves. Sparse grasses and other plants make up the ground layer. In areas closer to settlements and roads, human groups have harvested the larger trees, thus exposing the forest floor to more direct sunlight and allowing thick vegetation to thrive. The upper third of the province (beginning at about the latitude of Bertoua and [[Batouri]]) is dominated by humid, wooded [[savanna]]. Trees here are sparser, but still may grow to be as tall as 20 metres.\n\nThe government of Cameroon has established four forest and game reserves in the East: the [[Dja Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve du Biosph\u00e8re de Dja'') in the southwest of the province and extending into the South Province, [[Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 Park]] (''Parc National de la Lob\u00e9k\u00e9''), the [[Boumba-Bek Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve de Boumba-Bek'') and the [[Nki Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve de Nki'') in the southeast. The [[Pangar Dj\u00e9rem Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve Pangar Djerem'') protects one of the more heavily wooded parts of the Guinean savanna in the region's northwest and extends into the Adamawa Region.\n\nAnimal life is abundant and diverse. The forests are inhabited by numerous species of [[monkey]], as well as some of the last populations of [[gorilla]]s and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s in Cameroon. [[Bat]]s and [[bird]]s of various species are also common, as are various [[rodent]]s. A few [[forest elephant]]s still live in the region, as well. Many of these animals are currently under threat of [[extinction]] due to [[deforestation]] and the [[bushmeat]] trade.\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations|1976|366,235|1987|517,198|2005|771,755|2015|835,642|align=none|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/Cameroon-Cities.html Cameroon: Administrative Division population statistics]</ref>}}\n[[File:Njem house in Cameroon.jpg|thumb|278px|right|Typical Bantu house in the village of Ngoila]]\n\n===Settlement patterns===\n\nThe East had 517,198 inhabitants in 1987, and it remains the most sparsely populated of [[Provinces of Cameroon|Cameroon's ten regions]]. The bulk of the territory has a [[population density]] of less than five persons/km\u00b2. This is mostly a result of the area's thick forests, which inhibit settlement and support disease-carrying insects such as [[mosquito]]es and [[black fly|blackflies]]. These factors also make the East an unattractive target for development by both [[non-governmental organisation]]s and the Cameroonian government, a fact that has only further prevented larger numbers of people from settling in the region.\n\nThe majority of the population is thus primarily situated in [[village]]s and [[town]]s along the few major roads that traverse the region. Along these routes, population density jumps to as high as 20/km\u00b2 and to 20-60/km\u00b2 on the Bertoua-Batouri corridor. The traditional Bantu dwelling is a rectangular house made of [[mudbrick|sun-dried bricks]] placed in a wooden frame. [[Raffia]] palm fronds are a common covering, though metal roofing has become more common.\n\n===People===\n\n[[File:East Province ethnic groups.png|thumb|300px|right|Ethnic groups of the East Province]]\n\nThe majority of the inhabitants of the South are members of various Bantu tribes that are collectively known as the Beti-Pahuin (B\u00e9ti-Pahouin), the Fang-Beti, or simply the Fang. All of these groups speak various dialects of the Beti language. Most East Region peoples are considered [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] in origin. The second most numerous are the various [[Adamawa\u2013Ubangi]] (Sudanese) tribes that inhabit much of the northern portions of the territory. A third important group are the [[Fula people|Fulbe]] (Fula), who have immigrated into the area in great numbers over the past few decades. Finally, the [[Baka pygmie|pygmies]] comprise another significant population.\n\nMost eastern peoples speak their own distinctive languages, though educated individuals usually also know [[French language|French]]. Minor languages spoken include [[Bomwali language|Bomwali]], [[Bulu language|Bulu]], [[Kol language (Cameroon)|Kol]], [[Mbonga language|Mbonga]], and [[Vute language|Vute]].\n\nThe people of the East are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Presbyterianism]] and [[Catholicism]] claim the most members. [[Animism|Animist]] beliefs are also followed by much of the population, often in conjunction with Christianity. The East also has a significant percentage of [[Islam|Muslims]], particularly in the areas closer to the Adamawa Province.\n\n[[File:Maka woman going to fields.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Maka woman on the way to her fields near Abong-Mbang]]\n\n====Bantu====\n\nThe speakers of [[Makaa\u2013Njem languages]] are the largest group of Bantu peoples in the region. The [[Maka people|Maka]] form the majority of this group and occupy much of the western territories on the border with the Centre Region, including the towns of [[Abong-Mbang]], [[Nguelemendouka]], and [[Doum\u00e9]]. The Bajwe inhabit the territory immediately south of this, centred at [[Messam\u00e9na]]. The [[Nzime]] live at [[Mindourou]] and its surroundings on the road that runs south from Abong-Mbang. Further south on this road are the [[Njem]], whose territory includes the settlements of [[Lomi\u00e9]], [[Zoulabot]], [[Zwadiba]], and [[Ngoila]]. The [[Mpo]] occupy most of the territory surrounding the Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9-Yokadouma road and the side-roads off of it, as well as much of the border with the Congo. The [[Mpoman]] have a small enclave at [[Lokomo]] south of Yokadouma, and the Kunbabeeg live west of this Mpo-Mpoman territory. All of these groups speak distinct, but closely related, languages.\n\nThough the capital, Bertoua, is a traditional Gbaya settlement, the region is today a melange of several tribes, including the [[Baki people|Baki]], [[Pori people|Pori]], [[Bajem]], and [[Kwa people|Kwa]]. The southwestern portion of the Lom and Djerem division, just west of this, is peopled by the Eki, who have more extensive territories in the Centre Region. Small areas on the road from Doum\u00e9 to [[Gonga, Cameroon|Gonga]] belong to the [[Kwakum]] and Pori. The [[Kaka (people)|Kaka]] live to the south and the west of the Kadey River and have high centres at Batouri and Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9. The [[Bageto]] have lands south of Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9.\n\n====Adamawa\u2013Ubangi====\n\nThe [[Gbaya people|Gbaya]] are the most populous Ubangi group in the East, and they inhabit most of the Lom and Djerem division (including Bertoua) and the northernmost third of the Kadey division along the Kadey River. They also have smaller population centres, including the village of [[Gari-Gombo]] and [[Djampiel]]. The [[Kuo people|Kuo]] occupy the extreme northeastern corner of the region, including [[Wendoka]]. The [[Gbete]] (Kepere) live northwest of Bertoua, including the territory from [[B\u00e9labo]] west to [[Yangamo]]. The [[Bangantu]] people live east of the Yokadouma-[[Moloundou]] road in the region's southeastern corner.\n\n====Baka pygmies====\n\n[[File:Baka dancers June 2006.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Baka dancers]]\nThe rest of the region, that which is covered by thick forests and not serviced by roads, is inhabited by the Baka, Babaya, or Babinga pygmies. Though traditionally [[hunter-gatherer]]s, in recent times, the Baka have established trade with their Bantu neighbours, exchanging wild game for crops or metal tools. This relationship is not always equal, however, and Bantu sometimes take advantage of the Baka, exploiting them for labour or ceding their territory to logging companies without compensation.\n\nThe Cameroonian government has tried to encourage the Baka to establish permanent settlements, and some pygmy villages exist in the territory. Most of the Baka remain nomadic, however, living in temporary shelters of leaves and sticks. A much greater force acting to end the Baka's traditional lifestyle is intermarriage and assimilation into neighbouring tribes.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nThe vast majority of the inhabitants of the region are [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]]. Major crops are [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s south of Bertoua and Batouri and [[maize]] north of there. Farmers also raise many other crops in smaller quantities, including [[banana]]s, [[peanut|groundnut]]s, [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[manioc]], [[pineapple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[mango]]es, and [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. The dense forest and presence of the [[tsetse fly]] prohibits much [[cattle]] raising, but various [[livestock]] are raised for subsistence purposes, including [[pig]]s, [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[duck]]s, and [[chicken]]s, as well as [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s in the extreme northeast. The [[Livestock Development Exploitation Organisation]] also runs a modern cattle ranch at [[Ndokayo]] in the province's northeast.\n\nFarms are mostly small-scale affairs planted in clearings in the forest. Farmers clear an area during the dry season using traditional implements such as axes and machetes. The area is then burned, with care taken to preserve fruit trees such as mangoes or [[plum]]s. At the start of the wet season, spices and common vegetables are planted close to the home and tubers, such as cocoyams and manioc, are placed with plantains in larger plots farther afield. Farmyard manure is used as fertiliser. Crops are then harvested at the beginning of the next dry season.\n\nThis method of [[slash-and-burn agriculture]] allows for high yields in the short term, but quickly exhausts the soil. Farms are thus moved every two to three years, and land must remain fallow for up to ten years once it has been drained in this way. With the East's low population density, however, this generally presents little problem.\n\nCommercial crops also exist. [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] and [[coffee]] are raised for profit in the areas of Abong-Mbang, Bertoua, and Yokadouma, as well as in the heavy forests south of these areas. [[Tobacco]] is grown in the plains north of Batouri. No large-scale commercial livestock exists in the East, though cattle from the northern regions of Cameroon are herded through the province on their way to market in [[Yaound\u00e9]].\n\n====Hunting and gathering====\n\nCrop growing is often supplemented by [[hunting]] and [[Hunter-gatherer|gathering]], particularly in more rural areas. In fact, among the province's pygmies, these activities are carried out almost exclusively. While gathering of various wild plant species is primarily a female occupation, hunting is conducted by men with traditional implements such as [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]], [[spear]]s, [[blowgun]]s, and [[Animal trapping|trap]]s. In addition, [[firearm]]s are becoming much more common in modern times. Though most hunting is done on a small scale, larger-scale techniques are sometimes employed. In these bigger hunts, people set fire to areas of forest or grassland in order to flush out prey. Other hunters or dogs frighten the animals into running toward armed men who then kill them.\n\n===Industry===\n\nThe major industry of the East is [[forestry]]. The region has vast tracts of forest, and African and European companies have exploited these heavily. Because of the rapid rate of exploitation, however, lumber companies have been forced to push further and further into [[Central Africa]] to find suitable trees. As a result, much of the logging that once took place in Cameroon has been relocated to neighbouring countries such as Congo and the Central African Republic. The massive logging vehicles still travel through the East on their way to Cameroon's ports, and it is possible that without the logging industry, the East might never have got the little transportation network that exists there now. The East is also the home of several [[timber]] processing centres with major operations located around [[B\u00e9labo]], [[Dimako]], and [[Mindourou]].\n\nIn recent years, speculators have found deposits of [[gold]] near [[Batar\u00e9-Oya]], [[cobalt]] near Lomi\u00e9, and [[iron]] and [[aluminium]] in other areas. Companies have since moved in to exploit these resources as well. Other industries have a much smaller presence, such as a [[peanut oil|groundnut-oil]] mill located in Bertoua.\n\n===Transportation===\n\nFor its vast size, the East has very little transportation infrastructure. With the exception of a few private logging roads, travel through the province is only feasible along the three main roads that cover the territory. The first of these, National Road #10, heads east from Yaound\u00e9, passes through [[Ayos]] on the border with the Centre Province, then continues on through the towns of Abong-Mbang, [[Doum\u00e9]], Dimako, Bertoua, and Batouri before turning south at Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 near the Central African Republic border to pass through [[Gari-Goumbo]] and Yokadouma before terminating at [[Moloundou]] on the Congo border. Another major road begins in Abong-Mbang and heads south through Mindourou to Lomi\u00e9. Neither of these roads is paved, causing travel conditions in most of the province to fluctuate with the seasons. The third major route through the province is a road from Bertoua to [[Garoua-Boula\u00ef]] on the border with Central African Republic. This road was paved in 1997 with funds from the [[European Union]]. The only [[public transport]] that covers these routes is privately owned [[bush taxi]]s or mini-buses run by private groups known as GICs (French acronym meaning \"group d'initiative commune\").\n\nThe East is accessible via [[railroad]], as well, through [[Camrail]], the state-owned train system. The train comes from [[Douala]] and Yaound\u00e9 and passes through B\u00e9labo before heading north to [[Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9]] in the Adamawa Province. There is a regional [[airport]] in Bertoua that is officially part of state-owned [[Camair]]'s network, but it has been out of service since 2003. In addition, the Nyong River is navigable from Abong-Mbang to the Centre Province town of [[Mbalmayo]] during the rainy season.\n\n===Tourism===\nDue to the remoteness of the region and the difficulty of travel within it, the East sees very few tourists. The area boasts huge tracts of relatively untouched rain forest, however, and non-governmental organisations such as [[Ecofac]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] have in recent years endeavored to make the area a viable destination for [[eco-tourism]]. Their efforts have centered on the East's national parks and forest reserves, particularly the Dja Reserve. In 2003, for example, [[CIAD]] and other NGOs began a gorilla [[habituation]] project to pave the way for camera-toting tourists to come within a few metres of the animals to see them in their natural environment. However, government [[political corruption|corruption]] led to the cancellation of the initiative. [[Big-game hunting|Hunter]]s may also pursue game through these reserves.\n\n==Administration and social conditions==\n===Government===\n[[File:East Cameroon divisions.png|thumb|right|Departments of East Cameroon]]\nA presidentially appointed [[governor]] heads the administration of the province from the capital city of Bertoua.\n\nThe East is divided into four departments (''departements''), each headed by a presidentially appointed senior divisional officer or prefect (''prefet''):\n# [[Boumba-et-Ngoko]] (Boumba and Ngoko) takes up the southeast and has its centre in [[Yokadouma]].\n# [[Haut-Nyong]] (Upper Nyong) occupies the southwestern portion and is centred on [[Abong-Mbang]].\n# [[Kadey]] (also spelled Kad\u00e9\u00ef or Kadei) forms the central-eastern portion of the territory and is governed from [[Batouri]].\n# [[Lom-et-Dj\u00e9rem]] (Lom and Dj\u00e9rem) consists of the north of the province and has its capital in [[Bertoua]].\n\nEach of these divisions is further divided into sub-divisions, each headed by a sub-divisional officer or sub-prefect (''sous-prefet''). Individual towns usually have a [[mayor]], and some villages have a traditional [[Tribal chief|chief]], though this person usually holds little actual authority.\n\nCameroonian politicians have traditionally ignored the East. The region is simply too underpopulated to have much influence in countrywide elections. Eastern residents have in recent years called for more infrastructure improvements from the government, especially the paving of roads. Candidates for office and government officials do occasionally make stops in the region to address such issues, but their message is often simply an excuse for why such improvements would be detrimental to the region. For example, they often argue that paved roads would only allow the forests upon which the region depends to be cut down at an even faster rate.\n\n===Education===\n\nSchool attendance rates are difficult to determine for the East, but are generally higher in the towns than in the villages. [[Primary school]]s are fairly widely distributed, but most of the region's [[secondary school]]s are located in larger villages or in towns, meaning that students from more remote areas must walk long distances, stay with relatives, or rent rooms during the school year. In addition, school fees keep many families from sending their children for an education.\n\n===Health===\n\nDue to its thick forests and equatorial climate, the East is home to a host of tropical diseases. Chief among these is [[malaria]], which remains a major cause of death in the region. [[Dengue fever]], [[filariasis]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[tuberculosis]] are also endemic. In 1997 and 1998, health professionals recorded outbreaks of what may have been the [[Ebola]] virus in the southwest near Ngoila. The [[World Health Organization]] today doubts that this \"bloody [[diarrhea]]\" was in fact that virus, however.\n\nAs with most of sub-Saharan Africa, poor [[sanitation]] is a major source of illness for people in the East. Diseases spread this way include [[schistosomiasis]], [[brucellosis]], [[hepatitis A]], [[amoebic dysentery]], [[bacterial dysentery]], and [[giardia]].\n\nIn recent years, the East has come into focus for its role in the [[AIDS]] epidemic. This largely stems from the region's position as a transportation network for logging vehicles. In addition to the transportation network, the construction of the Chad/Cameroon pipeline has fueled the increase of [[Prostitution]] along these routes, with professional sex workers operating in virtually every town and village along the province's roads. Government estimates report the [[HIV]] rate among operators of these logging vehicles to be about 18% and that of the sex workers to be as high as 30%.\n\nGovernment efforts in the 1980s to improve the number and quality of [[hospital]]s in Cameroon have made healthcare more available in the region. Most hospitals and clinics are located in the larger towns, however, meaning that the seriously ill have little chance of getting to treatment in many cases. [[Traditional medicine]] is still largely practiced in the East, as well, and many people ascribe various maladies to the workings of [[witchcraft|witches]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early population movements===\n\nArchaeological finds around Batouri, Bertoua, and B\u00e9tar\u00e9-Oya attest to human presence in the territory of the East Province since prehistoric times. The earliest inhabitants of the region are commonly assumed to have been the [[Bambenga]] pygmies, part of the larger [[Twa peoples|Twa]] group who may be descendants of the pygmies mentioned in Egyptian and Classical sources. The pygmies were followed by waves of migrating Bantus in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Maka stayed to occupy the territories surrounding what is now [[Massam\u00e9na]] and Abong-Mbang, and the Njem settled around present-day Mindourou and Lomi\u00e9. The Kaka settled in the territory that is now Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9. A later wave of immigration came in the 19th century when the [[Beti-Pahuin]] pushed in from the west to escape pressures from the [[Babouti]]. This second Bantu invasion did not get far, however, as the Fang-Beti soon encountered the Maka and Njem and were unable to press on further. Of these, the Maka-Njem moved into the territory first, after being forced from their home north of the [[Lom River]] by migrating [[Beti-Pahuin]] peoples, themselves fleeing the [[Vute]], [[Mbum]], Gbaya, and, ultimately, the [[Fulani]]. The Maka stayed to occupy the territories surrounding what is now Massam\u00e9na and Abong-Mbang, and the Njem settled around present-day Mindourou and Lomi\u00e9. The Kaka settled in the territory that is now Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9.\n\nThe Adama-Ubangi peoples came into the territory as part of this same general migration, though they were usually the ones pushing the Bantu peoples further south. Gbaya tradition says that they moved into the region of Bertoua under a leader named [[Ndiba]]. His son, [[Mbartoua]], was in power when the Germans arrived.\n\n===The coming of the Europeans===\n\nFor the five centuries or so since the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first reached the coast of present Cameroon, European explorers made little attempt to push into the intererior. The region was a source of [[slavery|slaves]], which were shipped out via the port at Douala or via the [[Congo River]], though the numbers of natives taken were much smaller than in areas closer to the coast.\n\nThe [[France|French]] were the first Europeans to enter the region when they began exploring the Congo basin in the mid-19th century. It was the [[Germany|Germans]], however, who first gained formal control over the area, establishing the eastern border through negotiations with France between 1885 and 1908. Ironically, the earliest German colonists to the eastern forests were largely entering unknown territory. The Germans set to work building roads and establishing [[plantations]], both endeavors requiring forced labor by the natives. This often led to violence, such as when the Gbaya under Mbartoua led a rebellion in the Bertoua region in 1903. Another revolt occurred when the Kaka protested their loss of lucrative trade opportunities that they had enjoyed in pre-colonial days.\n\nAt the end of [[World War I]] in 1916, Germany was forced to cede its colony to France. The French divided Cameroon into nine administrative areas, and most of what is now the East Province fell into the Doum\u00e9-Loume-Yokadouma district with its capital in Doum\u00e9. The French largely continued the colonial practices of the Germans, with forced labor continuing into the early 20th century. They made further infrastructure improvements, as well, such as improving the road from Yaound\u00e9 to Bertoua and on to [[Garoua-Boula\u00ef]].\n\n===Post-independence===\n\nThe boundaries of the East Province were finalised after Cameroon gained independence in 1961. The capital was moved from Doum\u00e9 to Bertoua in 1972.\n\nThe region has largely been ignored since independence. One of the few developments of note include the extension of the [[railroad]] from Yaound\u00e9 to B\u00e9labo under the presidency of [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]].\n\nIn the first months of 2014, thousands of [[Refugees in Cameroon|refugees]] fleeing the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012\u2013present)|violence in the Central African Republic]] arrived in Cameroon via the border towns of the East Region, [[Adamawa Region]], and [[North Region (Cameroon)|North Region]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Cameroon: Location of Refugees and Main Entry Points (as of 02 May 2014) - Cameroon\n| work = [[ReliefWeb]]\n| accessdate = 2014-06-08\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/map/cameroon/cameroon-location-refugees-and-main-entry-points-02-may-2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n* Chrispin, Dr. Pettang, directeur, ''Cameroun: Guide touristique.''

It is bordered to the east by the [[Central African Republic]], to the south by [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], to the north by the [[Adamawa Region]], and to the west by the [[Centre Region (Cameroon)|Centre]] and [[South Region (Cameroon)|South Region]]s. With 109,002&nbsp;km\u00b2 of territory, it is the largest region in the nation as well as the most sparsely populated. Historically, the peoples of the East have been settled in Cameroonian territory for longer than any other of the country's many ethnic groups, the first inhabitants being the [[Baka (nomadic Central African people)|Baka]] (or Babinga) [[pygmy|pygmies]].\n\nThe East Region has very little [[industry]], its main commerce consisting of [[logging]], [[timber]], and [[mining]]. Instead, the bulk of its inhabitants are [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]]. The region is thus of little political import and is often ignored by Cameroonian politicians. This coupled with the low level of development in the province have led to its being dubbed \"the forgotten province\".\n\n==2008 presidential decree on abolition of provinces==\n\nIn 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, [[Paul Biya|President Paul Biya]] signed decrees abolishing \"Provinces\" and replacing them with \"Regions\". Hence, all of the country's ten provinces are now known as Regions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Land===\n\nThe [[soil]] of the East is predominantly [[ferrallitic]], rich with [[iron]] and red in colour. The southern three quarters of the region consists of [[metamorphic rock]] such as [[gneiss]], [[schist]], [[mica]], and [[migmatite]]. Starting at about the level of [[Bertoua]] and going north, however, [[granite]] becomes the dominate soil component. While the region supports an abundance of plant life, it is not particularly fertile due to leaching caused by the humid environment. Eastern dirt hardens quickly in the sun, and it is often used as a building material by poorer inhabitants.\n\n===Drainage===\n\nThe region contains several river systems: the [[Nyong River|Nyong]], which drains the central-western area, the [[Dja River|Dja]] in the southwest, the [[Lom River|Lom]] in the northeast, the [[Kad\u00e9\u00ef River|Kad\u00e9\u00ef]], which drains the northwest, the [[Boumba River|Boumba]] in the centre and southeast, and the [[Sangha River|Sangha]] and [[Ngoko River|Ngoko]], which drain portions of the southeast and form the border with the Central African Republic and Congo respectively. Many of these rivers have carved out valleys that surround them. The rivers of the territory have only slight gradients, and floods can occur along them during the rainy season. The Lom and Nyong rivers eventually empty into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. All other rivers in the East form part of the [[Congo River basin]].\n\n===Relief===\n\nAlmost the entire territory of the East Region lies on the [[South Cameroon Plateau]] that forms the southeastern half of the country. The elevation thus varies between 500 and 1000 metres above sea level except for lower-lying [[plain]]s of 200 to 500 metres in the extreme southeast centered on the Dja, Boumba, Sangha, and Ngoko Rivers. The land consists largely of monotonous, gently undulating hills known as \"half-oranges\" due to their resemblance to that fruit.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe East has a [[Type A climate|Type A]] [[wet equatorial climate]] (also known as a [[Guinea type climate]]), meaning that it experiences high temperatures (24\u02da C on average) and a lack of traditional [[season]]s. Instead, there is a long dry season from December to May, a light wet season from May to June, a short dry season from July to October, and a heavy wet season from October to November. Humidity and cloud cover are relatively high, and precipitation averages 1500\u20132000&nbsp;mm per year except in the extreme eastern and northern portions, where it is slightly less.\n\n[[File:East - Guinean Savanna 001.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Guinean savanna near Bertoua]]\n\n===Plant and animal life===\n\nApproximately the lower two thirds of the region is covered in [[rain forest]], which grows progressively thicker as one travels south. The forests are composed of hardwood evergreens of species such as [[dibetu]], [[ebony]], [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]], [[mahogany]], [[obeche]], and [[Sapele|sapelli]], some of which grow to heights of 70 metres or more. There are also numerous [[fern]]s and [[orchid]]s. This forest is stratified into several levels. The first is composed of straight, thick-rooted trees averaging about 40-metres tall. After this grow shorter, thinner trees with highly placed clusters of leaves. Sparse grasses and other plants make up the ground layer. In areas closer to settlements and roads, human groups have harvested the larger trees, thus exposing the forest floor to more direct sunlight and allowing thick vegetation to thrive. The upper third of the province (beginning at about the latitude of Bertoua and [[Batouri]]) is dominated by humid, wooded [[savanna]]. Trees here are sparser, but still may grow to be as tall as 20 metres.\n\nThe government of Cameroon has established four forest and game reserves in the East: the [[Dja Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve du Biosph\u00e8re de Dja'') in the southwest of the province and extending into the South Province, [[Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 Park]] (''Parc National de la Lob\u00e9k\u00e9''), the [[Boumba-Bek Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve de Boumba-Bek'') and the [[Nki Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve de Nki'') in the southeast. The [[Pangar Dj\u00e9rem Reserve]] (''R\u00e9serve Pangar Djerem'') protects one of the more heavily wooded parts of the Guinean savanna in the region's northwest and extends into the Adamawa Region.\n\nAnimal life is abundant and diverse. The forests are inhabited by numerous species of [[monkey]], as well as some of the last populations of [[gorilla]]s and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s in Cameroon. [[Bat]]s and [[bird]]s of various species are also common, as are various [[rodent]]s. A few [[forest elephant]]s still live in the region, as well. Many of these animals are currently under threat of [[extinction]] due to [[deforestation]] and the [[bushmeat]] trade.\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations|1976|366,235|1987|517,198|2005|771,755|2015|835,642|align=none|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/Cameroon-Cities.html Cameroon: Administrative Division population statistics]</ref>}}\n[[File:Njem house in Cameroon.jpg|thumb|278px|right|Typical Bantu house in the village of Ngoila]]\n\n===Settlement patterns===\n\nThe East had 517,198 inhabitants in 1987, and it remains the most sparsely populated of [[Provinces of Cameroon|Cameroon's ten regions]]. The bulk of the territory has a [[population density]] of less than five persons/km\u00b2. This is mostly a result of the area's thick forests, which inhibit settlement and support disease-carrying insects such as [[mosquito]]es and [[black fly|blackflies]]. These factors also make the East an unattractive target for development by both [[non-governmental organisation]]s and the Cameroonian government, a fact that has only further prevented larger numbers of people from settling in the region.\n\nThe majority of the population is thus primarily situated in [[village]]s and [[town]]s along the few major roads that traverse the region. Along these routes, population density jumps to as high as 20/km\u00b2 and to 20-60/km\u00b2 on the Bertoua-Batouri corridor. The traditional Bantu dwelling is a rectangular house made of [[mudbrick|sun-dried bricks]] placed in a wooden frame. [[Raffia]] palm fronds are a common covering, though metal roofing has become more common.\n\n===People===\n\n[[File:East Province ethnic groups.png|thumb|300px|right|Ethnic groups of the East Province]]\n\nThe majority of the inhabitants of the South are members of various Bantu tribes that are collectively known as the Beti-Pahuin (B\u00e9ti-Pahouin), the Fang-Beti, or simply the Fang. All of these groups speak various dialects of the Beti language. Most East Region peoples are considered [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] in origin. The second most numerous are the various [[Adamawa\u2013Ubangi]] (Sudanese) tribes that inhabit much of the northern portions of the territory. A third important group are the [[Fula people|Fulbe]] (Fula), who have immigrated into the area in great numbers over the past few decades. Finally, the [[Baka pygmie|pygmies]] comprise another significant population.\n\nMost eastern peoples speak their own distinctive languages, though educated individuals usually also know [[French language|French]]. Minor languages spoken include [[Bomwali language|Bomwali]], [[Bulu language|Bulu]], [[Kol language (Cameroon)|Kol]], [[Mbonga language|Mbonga]], and [[Vute language|Vute]].\n\nThe people of the East are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Presbyterianism]] and [[Catholicism]] claim the most members. [[Animism|Animist]] beliefs are also followed by much of the population, often in conjunction with Christianity. The East also has a significant percentage of [[Islam|Muslims]], particularly in the areas closer to the Adamawa Province.\n\n[[File:Maka woman going to fields.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Maka woman on the way to her fields near Abong-Mbang]]\n\n====Bantu====\n\nThe speakers of [[Makaa\u2013Njem languages]] are the largest group of Bantu peoples in the region. The [[Maka people|Maka]] form the majority of this group and occupy much of the western territories on the border with the Centre Region, including the towns of [[Abong-Mbang]], [[Nguelemendouka]], and [[Doum\u00e9]]. The Bajwe inhabit the territory immediately south of this, centred at [[Messam\u00e9na]]. The [[Nzime]] live at [[Mindourou]] and its surroundings on the road that runs south from Abong-Mbang. Further south on this road are the [[Njem]], whose territory includes the settlements of [[Lomi\u00e9]], [[Zoulabot]], [[Zwadiba]], and [[Ngoila]]. The [[Mpo]] occupy most of the territory surrounding the Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9-Yokadouma road and the side-roads off of it, as well as much of the border with the Congo. The [[Mpoman]] have a small enclave at [[Lokomo]] south of Yokadouma, and the Kunbabeeg live west of this Mpo-Mpoman territory. All of these groups speak distinct, but closely related, languages.\n\nThough the capital, Bertoua, is a traditional Gbaya settlement, the region is today a melange of several tribes, including the [[Baki people|Baki]], [[Pori people|Pori]], [[Bajem]], and [[Kwa people|Kwa]]. The southwestern portion of the Lom and Djerem division, just west of this, is peopled by the Eki, who have more extensive territories in the Centre Region. Small areas on the road from Doum\u00e9 to [[Gonga, Cameroon|Gonga]] belong to the [[Kwakum]] and Pori. The [[Kaka (people)|Kaka]] live to the south and the west of the Kadey River and have high centres at Batouri and Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9. The [[Bageto]] have lands south of Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9.\n\n====Adamawa\u2013Ubangi====\n\nThe [[Gbaya people|Gbaya]] are the most populous Ubangi group in the East, and they inhabit most of the Lom and Djerem division (including Bertoua) and the northernmost third of the Kadey division along the Kadey River. They also have smaller population centres, including the village of [[Gari-Gombo]] and [[Djampiel]]. The [[Kuo people|Kuo]] occupy the extreme northeastern corner of the region, including [[Wendoka]]. The [[Gbete]] (Kepere) live northwest of Bertoua, including the territory from [[B\u00e9labo]] west to [[Yangamo]]. The [[Bangantu]] people live east of the Yokadouma-[[Moloundou]] road in the region's southeastern corner.\n\n====Baka pygmies====\n\n[[File:Baka dancers June 2006.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Baka dancers]]\nThe rest of the region, that which is covered by thick forests and not serviced by roads, is inhabited by the Baka, Babaya, or Babinga pygmies. Though traditionally [[hunter-gatherer]]s, in recent times, the Baka have established trade with their Bantu neighbours, exchanging wild game for crops or metal tools. This relationship is not always equal, however, and Bantu sometimes take advantage of the Baka, exploiting them for labour or ceding their territory to logging companies without compensation.\n\nThe Cameroonian government has tried to encourage the Baka to establish permanent settlements, and some pygmy villages exist in the territory. Most of the Baka remain nomadic, however, living in temporary shelters of leaves and sticks. A much greater force acting to end the Baka's traditional lifestyle is intermarriage and assimilation into neighbouring tribes.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nThe vast majority of the inhabitants of the region are [[subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]]. Major crops are [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s south of Bertoua and Batouri and [[maize]] north of there. Farmers also raise many other crops in smaller quantities, including [[banana]]s, [[peanut|groundnut]]s, [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[manioc]], [[pineapple]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[mango]]es, and [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. The dense forest and presence of the [[tsetse fly]] prohibits much [[cattle]] raising, but various [[livestock]] are raised for subsistence purposes, including [[pig]]s, [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[duck]]s, and [[chicken]]s, as well as [[horse]]s and [[donkey]]s in the extreme northeast. The [[Livestock Development Exploitation Organisation]] also runs a modern cattle ranch at [[Ndokayo]] in the province's northeast.\n\nFarms are mostly small-scale affairs planted in clearings in the forest. Farmers clear an area during the dry season using traditional implements such as axes and machetes. The area is then burned, with care taken to preserve fruit trees such as mangoes or [[plum]]s. At the start of the wet season, spices and common vegetables are planted close to the home and tubers, such as cocoyams and manioc, are placed with plantains in larger plots farther afield. Farmyard manure is used as fertiliser. Crops are then harvested at the beginning of the next dry season.\n\nThis method of [[slash-and-burn agriculture]] allows for high yields in the short term, but quickly exhausts the soil. Farms are thus moved every two to three years, and land must remain fallow for up to ten years once it has been drained in this way. With the East's low population density, however, this generally presents little problem.\n\nCommercial crops also exist. [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] and [[coffee]] are raised for profit in the areas of Abong-Mbang, Bertoua, and Yokadouma, as well as in the heavy forests south of these areas. [[Tobacco]] is grown in the plains north of Batouri. No large-scale commercial livestock exists in the East, though cattle from the northern regions of Cameroon are herded through the province on their way to market in [[Yaound\u00e9]].\n\n====Hunting and gathering====\n\nCrop growing is often supplemented by [[hunting]] and [[Hunter-gatherer|gathering]], particularly in more rural areas. In fact, among the province's pygmies, these activities are carried out almost exclusively. While gathering of various wild plant species is primarily a female occupation, hunting is conducted by men with traditional implements such as [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]], [[spear]]s, [[blowgun]]s, and [[Animal trapping|trap]]s. In addition, [[firearm]]s are becoming much more common in modern times. Though most hunting is done on a small scale, larger-scale techniques are sometimes employed. In these bigger hunts, people set fire to areas of forest or grassland in order to flush out prey. Other hunters or dogs frighten the animals into running toward armed men who then kill them.\n\n===Industry===\n\nThe major industry of the East is [[forestry]]. The region has vast tracts of forest, and African and European companies have exploited these heavily. Because of the rapid rate of exploitation, however, lumber companies have been forced to push further and further into [[Central Africa]] to find suitable trees. As a result, much of the logging that once took place in Cameroon has been relocated to neighbouring countries such as Congo and the Central African Republic. The massive logging vehicles still travel through the East on their way to Cameroon's ports, and it is possible that without the logging industry, the East might never have got the little transportation network that exists there now. The East is also the home of several [[timber]] processing centres with major operations located around [[B\u00e9labo]], [[Dimako]], and [[Mindourou]].\n\nIn recent years, speculators have found deposits of [[gold]] near [[Batar\u00e9-Oya]], [[cobalt]] near Lomi\u00e9, and [[iron]] and [[aluminium]] in other areas. Companies have since moved in to exploit these resources as well. Other industries have a much smaller presence, such as a [[peanut oil|groundnut-oil]] mill located in Bertoua.\n\n===Transportation===\n\nFor its vast size, the East has very little transportation infrastructure. With the exception of a few private logging roads, travel through the province is only feasible along the three main roads that cover the territory. The first of these, National Road #10, heads east from Yaound\u00e9, passes through [[Ayos]] on the border with the Centre Province, then continues on through the towns of Abong-Mbang, [[Doum\u00e9]], Dimako, Bertoua, and Batouri before turning south at Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 near the Central African Republic border to pass through [[Gari-Goumbo]] and Yokadouma before terminating at [[Moloundou]] on the Congo border. Another major road begins in Abong-Mbang and heads south through Mindourou to Lomi\u00e9. Neither of these roads is paved, causing travel conditions in most of the province to fluctuate with the seasons. The third major route through the province is a road from Bertoua to [[Garoua-Boula\u00ef]] on the border with Central African Republic. This road was paved in 1997 with funds from the [[European Union]]. The only [[public transport]] that covers these routes is privately owned [[bush taxi]]s or mini-buses run by private groups known as GICs (French acronym meaning \"group d'initiative commune\").\n\nThe East is accessible via [[railroad]], as well, through [[Camrail]], the state-owned train system. The train comes from [[Douala]] and Yaound\u00e9 and passes through B\u00e9labo before heading north to [[Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9]] in the Adamawa Province. There is a regional [[airport]] in Bertoua that is officially part of state-owned [[Camair]]'s network, but it has been out of service since 2003. In addition, the Nyong River is navigable from Abong-Mbang to the Centre Province town of [[Mbalmayo]] during the rainy season.\n\n===Tourism===\nDue to the remoteness of the region and the difficulty of travel within it, the East sees very few tourists. The area boasts huge tracts of relatively untouched rain forest, however, and non-governmental organisations such as [[Ecofac]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] have in recent years endeavored to make the area a viable destination for [[eco-tourism]]. Their efforts have centered on the East's national parks and forest reserves, particularly the Dja Reserve. In 2003, for example, [[CIAD]] and other NGOs began a gorilla [[habituation]] project to pave the way for camera-toting tourists to come within a few metres of the animals to see them in their natural environment. However, government [[political corruption|corruption]] led to the cancellation of the initiative. [[Big-game hunting|Hunter]]s may also pursue game through these reserves.\n\n==Administration and social conditions==\n===Government===\n[[File:East Cameroon divisions.png|thumb|right|Departments of East Cameroon]]\nA presidentially appointed [[governor]] heads the administration of the province from the capital city of Bertoua.\n\nThe East is divided into four departments (''departements''), each headed by a presidentially appointed senior divisional officer or prefect (''prefet''):\n# [[Boumba-et-Ngoko]] (Boumba and Ngoko) takes up the southeast and has its centre in [[Yokadouma]].\n# [[Haut-Nyong]] (Upper Nyong) occupies the southwestern portion and is centred on [[Abong-Mbang]].\n# [[Kadey]] (also spelled Kad\u00e9\u00ef or Kadei) forms the central-eastern portion of the territory and is governed from [[Batouri]].\n# [[Lom-et-Dj\u00e9rem]] (Lom and Dj\u00e9rem) consists of the north of the province and has its capital in [[Bertoua]].\n\nEach of these divisions is further divided into sub-divisions, each headed by a sub-divisional officer or sub-prefect (''sous-prefet''). Individual towns usually have a [[mayor]], and some villages have a traditional [[Tribal chief|chief]], though this person usually holds little actual authority.\n\nCameroonian politicians have traditionally ignored the East. The region is simply too underpopulated to have much influence in countrywide elections. Eastern residents have in recent years called for more infrastructure improvements from the government, especially the paving of roads. Candidates for office and government officials do occasionally make stops in the region to address such issues, but their message is often simply an excuse for why such improvements would be detrimental to the region. For example, they often argue that paved roads would only allow the forests upon which the region depends to be cut down at an even faster rate.\n\n===Education===\n\nSchool attendance rates are difficult to determine for the East, but are generally higher in the towns than in the villages. [[Primary school]]s are fairly widely distributed, but most of the region's [[secondary school]]s are located in larger villages or in towns, meaning that students from more remote areas must walk long distances, stay with relatives, or rent rooms during the school year. In addition, school fees keep many families from sending their children for an education.\n\n===Health===\n\nDue to its thick forests and equatorial climate, the East is home to a host of tropical diseases. Chief among these is [[malaria]], which remains a major cause of death in the region. [[Dengue fever]], [[filariasis]], [[typhoid fever]], and [[tuberculosis]] are also endemic. In 1997 and 1998, health professionals recorded outbreaks of what may have been the [[Ebola]] virus in the southwest near Ngoila. The [[World Health Organization]] today doubts that this \"bloody [[diarrhea]]\" was in fact that virus, however.\n\nAs with most of sub-Saharan Africa, poor [[sanitation]] is a major source of illness for people in the East. Diseases spread this way include [[schistosomiasis]], [[brucellosis]], [[hepatitis A]], [[amoebic dysentery]], [[bacterial dysentery]], and [[giardia]].\n\nIn recent years, the East has come into focus for its role in the [[AIDS]] epidemic. This largely stems from the region's position as a transportation network for logging vehicles. In addition to the transportation network, the construction of the Chad/Cameroon pipeline has fueled the increase of [[Prostitution]] along these routes, with professional sex workers operating in virtually every town and village along the province's roads. Government estimates report the [[HIV]] rate among operators of these logging vehicles to be about 18% and that of the sex workers to be as high as 30%.\n\nGovernment efforts in the 1980s to improve the number and quality of [[hospital]]s in Cameroon have made healthcare more available in the region. Most hospitals and clinics are located in the larger towns, however, meaning that the seriously ill have little chance of getting to treatment in many cases. [[Traditional medicine]] is still largely practiced in the East, as well, and many people ascribe various maladies to the workings of [[witchcraft|witches]] or [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early population movements===\n\nArchaeological finds around Batouri, Bertoua, and B\u00e9tar\u00e9-Oya attest to human presence in the territory of the East Province since prehistoric times. The earliest inhabitants of the region are commonly assumed to have been the [[Bambenga]] pygmies, part of the larger [[Twa peoples|Twa]] group who may be descendants of the pygmies mentioned in Egyptian and Classical sources. The pygmies were followed by waves of migrating Bantus in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Maka stayed to occupy the territories surrounding what is now [[Massam\u00e9na]] and Abong-Mbang, and the Njem settled around present-day Mindourou and Lomi\u00e9. The Kaka settled in the territory that is now Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9. A later wave of immigration came in the 19th century when the [[Beti-Pahuin]] pushed in from the west to escape pressures from the [[Babouti]]. This second Bantu invasion did not get far, however, as the Fang-Beti soon encountered the Maka and Njem and were unable to press on further. Of these, the Maka-Njem moved into the territory first, after being forced from their home north of the [[Lom River]] by migrating [[Beti-Pahuin]] peoples, themselves fleeing the [[Vute]], [[Mbum]], Gbaya, and, ultimately, the [[Fulani]]. The Maka stayed to occupy the territories surrounding what is now Massam\u00e9na and Abong-Mbang, and the Njem settled around present-day Mindourou and Lomi\u00e9. The Kaka settled in the territory that is now Nd\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9.\n\nThe Adama-Ubangi peoples came into the territory as part of this same general migration, though they were usually the ones pushing the Bantu peoples further south. Gbaya tradition says that they moved into the region of Bertoua under a leader named [[Ndiba]]. His son, [[Mbartoua]], was in power when the Germans arrived.\n\n===The coming of the Europeans===\n\nFor the five centuries or so since the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] first reached the coast of present Cameroon, European explorers made little attempt to push into the intererior. The region was a source of [[slavery|slaves]], which were shipped out via the port at Douala or via the [[Congo River]], though the numbers of natives taken were much smaller than in areas closer to the coast.\n\nThe [[France|French]] were the first Europeans to enter the region when they began exploring the Congo basin in the mid-19th century. It was the [[Germany|Germans]], however, who first gained formal control over the area, establishing the eastern border through negotiations with France between 1885 and 1908. Ironically, the earliest German colonists to the eastern forests were largely entering unknown territory. The Germans set to work building roads and establishing [[plantations]], both endeavors requiring forced labor by the natives. This often led to violence, such as when the Gbaya under Mbartoua led a rebellion in the Bertoua region in 1903. Another revolt occurred when the Kaka protested their loss of lucrative trade opportunities that they had enjoyed in pre-colonial days.\n\nAt the end of [[World War I]] in 1916, Germany was forced to cede its colony to France. The French divided Cameroon into nine administrative areas, and most of what is now the East Province fell into the Doum\u00e9-Loume-Yokadouma district with its capital in Doum\u00e9. The French largely continued the colonial practices of the Germans, with forced labor continuing into the early 20th century. They made further infrastructure improvements, as well, such as improving the road from Yaound\u00e9 to Bertoua and on to [[Garoua-Boula\u00ef]].\n\n===Post-independence===\n\nThe boundaries of the East Province were finalised after Cameroon gained independence in 1961. The capital was moved from Doum\u00e9 to Bertoua in 1972.\n\nThe region has largely been ignored since independence. One of the few developments of note include the extension of the [[railroad]] from Yaound\u00e9 to B\u00e9labo under the presidency of [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]].\n\nIn the first months of 2014, thousands of [[Refugees in Cameroon|refugees]] fleeing the [[Central African Republic conflict (2012\u2013present)|violence in the Central African Republic]] arrived in Cameroon via the border towns of the East Region, [[Adamawa Region]], and [[North Region (Cameroon)|North Region]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Cameroon: Location of Refugees and Main Entry Points (as of 02 May 2014) - Cameroon\n| work = [[ReliefWeb]]\n| accessdate = 2014-06-08\n| url = http://reliefweb.int/map/cameroon/cameroon-location-refugees-and-main-entry-points-02-may-2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n* Chrispin, Dr. Pettang, directeur, ''Cameroun: Guide touristique.''

Cohen. It premiered in New York City on November 1, 2007 in the [[off-Broadway]] theater 37 Arts and was directed by Bill Fennelly. The cast featured Tony\u00ae nominee [[Hunter Foster]] as Victor Frankenstein, [[Steve Blanchard]] as The Creature, and [[Christiane Noll]] as Elizabeth. The show was produced by Gerald Goehring, Douglas C. Evans, Michael F. Mitri, and David S. Stone, in association with Barbara & Emery Olcott.\n\n== Creative Interpretation ==\n\nWhile adhering faithfully to the original Mary Shelley text, the creative team nonetheless took advantage of modern stage techniques to create a fluid, nonlinear story that challenged audiences to travel across vast distances and time spans while remaining in a single setting that employed projections, light and sound to paint its epic story. The show is nearly \u201csung-through,\u201d meaning there is very little spoken dialog, evoking the feeling of a modern operetta.\n\n== Development History ==\n\nEarly drafts of the show were co-written by Mark Baron and Gary P. Cohen exclusively, with Jeff Jackson, an award-winning screenwriter, coming aboard later to enhance the show\u2019s book and lyrics. Preliminary efforts included a high school production and multiple staged readings for local audiences in the authors\u2019 native New Jersey.\n\n=== Innovative Demo Video ===\nIn 2001, the team undertook a bold step to try to launch the show\u2019s professional future: a full-length video demo that was produced and directed by Jeff Jackson and titled Frankenstein, The Musical. Staged over a four-day shoot in a rented Union City, NJ theater, the production starred Tony Award\u00ae-winning actor [[Shuler Hensley]] (Oklahoma) as The Creature and featured Broadway veterans [[Ivan Rutherford]] (Les Miserables) as Victor Frankenstein and [[Rita Harvey]] (Phantom of the Opera) as Elizabeth. The production was a hybrid of a film and a live show. Shot cinematically out-of-sequence with multiple cameras and without an audience, the show was nonetheless filmed on a single stage with traditional theatrical lighting. The final product was published on DVD in 2002, but only screened privately for potential backers of future productions.\n\n=== NJPAC ===\nIn 2006, an updated version of the musical, renamed Frankenstein, A New Musical, was staged at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) in Newark, NJ for three performances on September 29, 30, and October 1. Featuring Broadway stars Ron Bohmer (The Scarlet Pimpernel) as The Creature and Davis Gaines (Phantom of the Opera) as Victor Frankenstein and directed by Bill Fennelly, this production served as a direct stepping stone to its ultimate New York debut the following year. It was produced by David S. Stone. An interesting twist occurred during the brief run when star Gaines took sick and co-author Jeff Jackson had to step in at the last minute to perform in the final two performances.\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nReviews for the 2007 off-Broadway production were mixed, with the national press receiving it positively while the New York papers were less appreciative. The Associated Press praised it for \u201cbringing the classic tale thrillingly to life,\u201d and Bloomberg Radio hailed it as \u201cRiveting!\u201d and \u201cTotally exciting!\u201d\n\n== Publishing and Licensing ==\nThe original cast album is available on Ghostlight Records and the play is published by Playscripts, Inc. and is currently enjoying ongoing licensed productions around the world. In addition to various US and UK productions, it has been performed in Germany, Hungary, and Latin America, having been translated into the native languages of those regions and countries.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prelude ===\n:''November 9th, 1793; Robert Walton, captain of an exploration ship bound for the North Pole, discovers the dying Victor Frankenstein adrift on a floe of ice. Nursed by Walton, but still close to death, Victor tells the captain the story of how he came to be in this predicament. Walton relates the horrific story in a letter to his sister and it is seen, in flashback, as he writes it down.''\n\n=== Act I ===\nGeneva, 1769; a child prodigy, Victor lives a happy and privileged childhood with his father and mother. When Victor is seven years old, his mother gives birth to his brother, William. By 1789, Victor has grown into a vibrant and incredibly intelligent young man. He is accepted to the University of Ingolstadt, where he decides to study science. Victor's mother dies of scarlet fever, inspiring him to research the secrets of life and death (\"A Golden Age\").\n\nVictor decides to leave home to further research his theories. He bids farewell to his family, his best friend Henry, and his cousin, also his fianc\u00e9e, Elizabeth. Victor makes a promise to Elizabeth that he will return to her. (\"Find Your Way Home\"). Victor visits his mother's grave before he leaves, and declares he shall see her again for he has discovered how to reanimate the dead. Victor demonstrates this by successfully bringing a dead sparrow back to life. At Ingolstadt Victor's theories are met with outrage, labeled as \"Madness, folly, and insanity.\" Determined to prove his theories to the world Victor attends the hanging of an unnamed, condemned man and, after the man is dead, claims the body for his experiment (\"Amen\"). Inside his lab at the University, Victor comprises a man, approximately eight feet in height, of carefully selected limbs and organs. Harnessing the power of a ferocious lightning storm, he tries to endow his creation with life (\"Birth to My Creation\"). At first, the experiment seems unsuccessful and Victor feverishly looks over his notes to see what could have gone wrong (\"1:15 AM\"). Elizabeth has been writing to Victor constantly, although he has never written back. As Elizabeth writes her last letter back in Geneva, Victor finally looks over the letters he has ignored. Realizing he has been neglecting his loved ones, Victor longs to return home and forget about his failure. Suddenly, a loud scream emits from the laboratory and Victor rushes in to investigate. He discovers that his creation has indeed come to life, but it is so hideous in appearance that Victor, terrified, sets fire to his laboratory, and believes the Creature has perished in the flames (\"Dear Victor/Burn the Laboratory\").\n\nHaving received no word from Victor during his time at Ingolstadt, Henry, Elizabeth, William, and Victor's father worry about what has become of him. Victor is in a hospital, suffering from mental shock. Authorities await his recovery to question him about the fire in the lab. (\"The Hands of Time\"). Victor's father, anxious for Victor's return, states that no matter what road his son chooses to take in life, he will always believe in him (\"Your Father's Eyes\").\n\nOnce Victor recovers he is brought to trial for setting the fire, however he is released due to lack of evidence. Vowing to give up his interest in science Victor quickly returns home to Geneva, but returns to hear that his brother, William, has been murdered. The culprit is believed to be William's nanny, Justine Moritz, after she is found with a bloodstained locket belonging to William. Justine protests her innocence, placing the blame on a \"monster\".\n\nVictor discovers the Creature and is horrified that he survived the fire in the lab. The Creature, now intelligent and capable of speech, is lonely and in pain. The Creature expresses his anguish and how he expected love and acceptance, only to find himself an object of hatred and fear (\"The Waking Nightmare\"). He forces Victor to listen to the story of his days since his creation (\"The Creature's Tale\").\n\nAfter escaping the burning lab, the confused Creature found his way to a cabin in the woods inhabited by an old blind man, his daughter Agatha, and her infant child. The Creature, hiding in the woodshed next to the cabin, observed the family through a crack in the wall. Hearing them sing the infant to sleep touched the Creature and awakened his longing to feel the same tenderness (\"The Music of Love\"). Determined to earn the love of the family, the Creature began to leave food and firewood at their door during the day and listen to them speak at night, in order to learn their language. When he finally felt confident that he could successfully approach the old man, the Creature entered the cabin when Agatha had gone. Since the old man was blind, he was not repulsed by the Creature's ugliness and accepted him as a friend. Overjoyed, the Creature embraced the old man, accidentally crushing him with his incredible strength. Distraught that he had killed his only friend the Creature left the cabin, never to return. Remembering his creator, the Creature embarked on a mission to rob Victor of his happiness and loved ones in an attempt to make Victor realize the pain of loneliness. The Creature traveled to Geneva and came upon William and Justine sitting in a field. The Creature listened while William asked Justine endless questions about the world (\"Why?\"). Justine and William then ran off into the woods together, however only Justine returned. William was reported missing and soon after found strangled to death. The Creature reveals that it was indeed he that murdered the boy and planted the locket on Justine. Here, the Creature ends his tale.\n\nQuaking with rage, Victor attempts to fight his creation but is easily overpowered. The Creature tries to persuade Victor to create an equally hideous female companion for him. Victor refuses, until the Creature vows to leave with his bride and never return. Hoping that creating a bride for the Creature will atone for his previous mistakes, Victor promises. Justine is hanged for William's murder (\"The Proposition\").\n\n=== Act II ===\nVictor's family celebrates his upcoming marriage to Elizabeth, however the celebration is somewhat somber due to William's death (\"A Happier Day\"). Henry begins to suspect that Victor is hiding something and determines to discover what it is. Victor, anxious to appease the Creature and end his family's suffering, begins to create a female creature, from the corpse of Justine. Henry enters the lab and confronts his friend, berating him for his actions. Trying to protect Victor, he vows to expose his creation to the world, causing the Creature to kill him in retaliation (\"The Modern Prometheus\"). Victor succeeds in bringing the Creature's bride to life, but kills her once the thought of the two having children enters his mind. The distraught Creature vows revenge on his creator, promising to be there on Victor's wedding night (\"Another Like Him\").\n\nVictor and Elizabeth are married and leave for their honeymoon (\"The Workings of the Heart\"). Afraid that the Creature may be hiding close by, Victor leaves Elizabeth locked in their room while he goes to search. Seeing that she is alone, The Creature sneaks into the room and murders Elizabeth (\"An Angel's Embrace\").\n\nHeartbroken, Victor stands before Elizabeth's grave and blames himself for her death, along with the deaths of William and Justine (The Workings of the Heart - Reprise\"). Victor's father is the last to die, of a broken heart (\"Your Father's Eyes - Reprise\"). Driven over the edge with grief, Victor vows to hunt down his creation.\n\nThe Creature, meanwhile, has been emotionally touched by the love Victor's family had for him, and powerfully expresses his remorse for his deeds and his hatred for the impulse that drove him to kill (\"These Hands\").\n\nVictor chases the Creature across Europe to the Arctic Ocean (\"The Chase). Finally alone and as desolate as his Creature, Victor has a revelation and realizes that a man is truly created through his deeds (\"The Coming of the Dawn\").\n\nWalton has been writing his letter in a room other than Victor's on board the ship. While Victor is resting, the Creature enters through a window. The Creature says he has come to watch Victor die, and then destroy himself upon his funeral pyre. Victor, finally realizing his paternal obligations to the Creature, begs for forgiveness and accepts him as his \"son.\" Victor then dies, leaving the Creature to wallow in the sorrow of losing his father. Walton enters the room as the Creature takes Victor into his arms and carries him off into the ice and darkness, never to be seen again (\"Amen - Reprise\").\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n<!-- WHICH CHARACTERS SING EACH NUMBER? -->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n*\"Prelude\" \u2013 Walton (speaking), Victor, (Victor's Father, Victor's Mother, William, Justine, Henry, Elizabeth - all speaking)\n*\"A Golden Age\" \u2013 Victor's Father and Company\n*\"Find Your Way Home\" \u2013 Elizabeth, Victor, Victor's Mother\n*\"A Golden Age (Reprise)\"  \u2013 Victor's Father and Company\n*\"Amen\" \u2013 Condemned Man, Victor, Executioner, Mob\n*\"Birth to My Creation\" \u2013 Victor\n*\"The Lab 1 (1:15 A.M.)\"  \u2013 Victor, Ensemble\n*\"Dear Victor\" \u2013 Elizabeth, Victor\n*\"Was it a Dream?/The Lab 2/Burn the Laboratory\"  \u2013 Victor\n*\"The Hands of Time\" \u2013 Elizabeth, Henry, William, Justine\n*\"Your Father's Eyes\" \u2013 Victor's Father\n*\"The Creature's Tale (Part 1)\" \u2013 Victor, Creature\n*\"The Waking Nightmare\" \u2013 Creature, Mob\n*\"The Creature's Tale (Part 2)\" \u2013 Creature\n*\"The Music of Love\" \u2013 Agatha, Blind Man, Creature\n*\"The Creature's Tale (Part 3)\" \u2013 Creature\n*\"Why?

Cohen. It premiered in New York City on November 1, 2007 in the [[off-Broadway]] theater 37 Arts and was directed by Bill Fennelly. The cast featured Tony\u00ae nominee [[Hunter Foster]] as Victor Frankenstein, [[Steve Blanchard]] as The Creature, and [[Christiane Noll]] as Elizabeth. The show was produced by Gerald Goehring, Douglas C. Evans, Michael F. Mitri, and David S. Stone, in association with Barbara & Emery Olcott.\n\n== Creative Interpretation ==\n\nWhile adhering faithfully to the original Mary Shelley text, the creative team nonetheless took advantage of modern stage techniques to create a fluid, nonlinear story that challenged audiences to travel across vast distances and time spans while remaining in a single setting that employed projections, light and sound to paint its epic story. The show is nearly \u201csung-through,\u201d meaning there is very little spoken dialog, evoking the feeling of a modern operetta.\n\n== Development History ==\n\nEarly drafts of the show were co-written by Mark Baron and Gary P. Cohen exclusively, with Jeff Jackson, an award-winning screenwriter, coming aboard later to enhance the show\u2019s book and lyrics. Preliminary efforts included a high school production and multiple staged readings for local audiences in the authors\u2019 native New Jersey.\n\n=== Innovative Demo Video ===\nIn 2001, the team undertook a bold step to try to launch the show\u2019s professional future: a full-length video demo that was produced and directed by Jeff Jackson and titled Frankenstein, The Musical. Staged over a four-day shoot in a rented Union City, NJ theater, the production starred Tony Award\u00ae-winning actor [[Shuler Hensley]] (Oklahoma) as The Creature and featured Broadway veterans [[Ivan Rutherford]] (Les Miserables) as Victor Frankenstein and [[Rita Harvey]] (Phantom of the Opera) as Elizabeth. The production was a hybrid of a film and a live show. Shot cinematically out-of-sequence with multiple cameras and without an audience, the show was nonetheless filmed on a single stage with traditional theatrical lighting. The final product was published on DVD in 2002, but only screened privately for potential backers of future productions.\n\n=== NJPAC ===\nIn 2006, an updated version of the musical, renamed Frankenstein, A New Musical, was staged at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center (NJPAC) in Newark, NJ for three performances on September 29, 30, and October 1. Featuring Broadway stars Ron Bohmer (The Scarlet Pimpernel) as The Creature and Davis Gaines (Phantom of the Opera) as Victor Frankenstein and directed by Bill Fennelly, this production served as a direct stepping stone to its ultimate New York debut the following year. It was produced by David S. Stone. An interesting twist occurred during the brief run when star Gaines took sick and co-author Jeff Jackson had to step in at the last minute to perform in the final two performances.\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nReviews for the 2007 off-Broadway production were mixed, with the national press receiving it positively while the New York papers were less appreciative. The Associated Press praised it for \u201cbringing the classic tale thrillingly to life,\u201d and Bloomberg Radio hailed it as \u201cRiveting!\u201d and \u201cTotally exciting!\u201d\n\n== Publishing and Licensing ==\nThe original cast album is available on Ghostlight Records and the play is published by Playscripts, Inc. and is currently enjoying ongoing licensed productions around the world. In addition to various US and UK productions, it has been performed in Germany, Hungary, and Latin America, having been translated into the native languages of those regions and countries.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prelude ===\n:''November 9th, 1793; Robert Walton, captain of an exploration ship bound for the North Pole, discovers the dying Victor Frankenstein adrift on a floe of ice. Nursed by Walton, but still close to death, Victor tells the captain the story of how he came to be in this predicament. Walton relates the horrific story in a letter to his sister and it is seen, in flashback, as he writes it down.''\n\n=== Act I ===\nGeneva, 1769; a child prodigy, Victor lives a happy and privileged childhood with his father and mother. When Victor is seven years old, his mother gives birth to his brother, William. By 1789, Victor has grown into a vibrant and incredibly intelligent young man. He is accepted to the University of Ingolstadt, where he decides to study science. Victor's mother dies of scarlet fever, inspiring him to research the secrets of life and death (\"A Golden Age\").\n\nVictor decides to leave home to further research his theories. He bids farewell to his family, his best friend Henry, and his cousin, also his fianc\u00e9e, Elizabeth. Victor makes a promise to Elizabeth that he will return to her. (\"Find Your Way Home\"). Victor visits his mother's grave before he leaves, and declares he shall see her again for he has discovered how to reanimate the dead. Victor demonstrates this by successfully bringing a dead sparrow back to life. At Ingolstadt Victor's theories are met with outrage, labeled as \"Madness, folly, and insanity.\" Determined to prove his theories to the world Victor attends the hanging of an unnamed, condemned man and, after the man is dead, claims the body for his experiment (\"Amen\"). Inside his lab at the University, Victor comprises a man, approximately eight feet in height, of carefully selected limbs and organs. Harnessing the power of a ferocious lightning storm, he tries to endow his creation with life (\"Birth to My Creation\"). At first, the experiment seems unsuccessful and Victor feverishly looks over his notes to see what could have gone wrong (\"1:15 AM\"). Elizabeth has been writing to Victor constantly, although he has never written back. As Elizabeth writes her last letter back in Geneva, Victor finally looks over the letters he has ignored. Realizing he has been neglecting his loved ones, Victor longs to return home and forget about his failure. Suddenly, a loud scream emits from the laboratory and Victor rushes in to investigate. He discovers that his creation has indeed come to life, but it is so hideous in appearance that Victor, terrified, sets fire to his laboratory, and believes the Creature has perished in the flames (\"Dear Victor/Burn the Laboratory\").\n\nHaving received no word from Victor during his time at Ingolstadt, Henry, Elizabeth, William, and Victor's father worry about what has become of him. Victor is in a hospital, suffering from mental shock. Authorities await his recovery to question him about the fire in the lab. (\"The Hands of Time\"). Victor's father, anxious for Victor's return, states that no matter what road his son chooses to take in life, he will always believe in him (\"Your Father's Eyes\").\n\nOnce Victor recovers he is brought to trial for setting the fire, however he is released due to lack of evidence. Vowing to give up his interest in science Victor quickly returns home to Geneva, but returns to hear that his brother, William, has been murdered. The culprit is believed to be William's nanny, Justine Moritz, after she is found with a bloodstained locket belonging to William. Justine protests her innocence, placing the blame on a \"monster\".\n\nVictor discovers the Creature and is horrified that he survived the fire in the lab. The Creature, now intelligent and capable of speech, is lonely and in pain. The Creature expresses his anguish and how he expected love and acceptance, only to find himself an object of hatred and fear (\"The Waking Nightmare\"). He forces Victor to listen to the story of his days since his creation (\"The Creature's Tale\").\n\nAfter escaping the burning lab, the confused Creature found his way to a cabin in the woods inhabited by an old blind man, his daughter Agatha, and her infant child. The Creature, hiding in the woodshed next to the cabin, observed the family through a crack in the wall. Hearing them sing the infant to sleep touched the Creature and awakened his longing to feel the same tenderness (\"The Music of Love\"). Determined to earn the love of the family, the Creature began to leave food and firewood at their door during the day and listen to them speak at night, in order to learn their language. When he finally felt confident that he could successfully approach the old man, the Creature entered the cabin when Agatha had gone. Since the old man was blind, he was not repulsed by the Creature's ugliness and accepted him as a friend. Overjoyed, the Creature embraced the old man, accidentally crushing him with his incredible strength. Distraught that he had killed his only friend the Creature left the cabin, never to return. Remembering his creator, the Creature embarked on a mission to rob Victor of his happiness and loved ones in an attempt to make Victor realize the pain of loneliness. The Creature traveled to Geneva and came upon William and Justine sitting in a field. The Creature listened while William asked Justine endless questions about the world (\"Why?\"). Justine and William then ran off into the woods together, however only Justine returned. William was reported missing and soon after found strangled to death. The Creature reveals that it was indeed he that murdered the boy and planted the locket on Justine. Here, the Creature ends his tale.\n\nQuaking with rage, Victor attempts to fight his creation but is easily overpowered. The Creature tries to persuade Victor to create an equally hideous female companion for him. Victor refuses, until the Creature vows to leave with his bride and never return. Hoping that creating a bride for the Creature will atone for his previous mistakes, Victor promises. Justine is hanged for William's murder (\"The Proposition\").\n\n=== Act II ===\nVictor's family celebrates his upcoming marriage to Elizabeth, however the celebration is somewhat somber due to William's death (\"A Happier Day\"). Henry begins to suspect that Victor is hiding something and determines to discover what it is. Victor, anxious to appease the Creature and end his family's suffering, begins to create a female creature, from the corpse of Justine. Henry enters the lab and confronts his friend, berating him for his actions. Trying to protect Victor, he vows to expose his creation to the world, causing the Creature to kill him in retaliation (\"The Modern Prometheus\"). Victor succeeds in bringing the Creature's bride to life, but kills her once the thought of the two having children enters his mind. The distraught Creature vows revenge on his creator, promising to be there on Victor's wedding night (\"Another Like Him\").\n\nVictor and Elizabeth are married and leave for their honeymoon (\"The Workings of the Heart\"). Afraid that the Creature may be hiding close by, Victor leaves Elizabeth locked in their room while he goes to search. Seeing that she is alone, The Creature sneaks into the room and murders Elizabeth (\"An Angel's Embrace\").\n\nHeartbroken, Victor stands before Elizabeth's grave and blames himself for her death, along with the deaths of William and Justine (The Workings of the Heart - Reprise\"). Victor's father is the last to die, of a broken heart (\"Your Father's Eyes - Reprise\"). Driven over the edge with grief, Victor vows to hunt down his creation.\n\nThe Creature, meanwhile, has been emotionally touched by the love Victor's family had for him, and powerfully expresses his remorse for his deeds and his hatred for the impulse that drove him to kill (\"These Hands\").\n\nVictor chases the Creature across Europe to the Arctic Ocean (\"The Chase). Finally alone and as desolate as his Creature, Victor has a revelation and realizes that a man is truly created through his deeds (\"The Coming of the Dawn\").\n\nWalton has been writing his letter in a room other than Victor's on board the ship. While Victor is resting, the Creature enters through a window. The Creature says he has come to watch Victor die, and then destroy himself upon his funeral pyre. Victor, finally realizing his paternal obligations to the Creature, begs for forgiveness and accepts him as his \"son.\" Victor then dies, leaving the Creature to wallow in the sorrow of losing his father. Walton enters the room as the Creature takes Victor into his arms and carries him off into the ice and darkness, never to be seen again (\"Amen - Reprise\").\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n<!-- WHICH CHARACTERS SING EACH NUMBER? -->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n*\"Prelude\" \u2013 Walton (speaking), Victor, (Victor's Father, Victor's Mother, William, Justine, Henry, Elizabeth - all speaking)\n*\"A Golden Age\" \u2013 Victor's Father and Company\n*\"Find Your Way Home\" \u2013 Elizabeth, Victor, Victor's Mother\n*\"A Golden Age (Reprise)\"  \u2013 Victor's Father and Company\n*\"Amen\" \u2013 Condemned Man, Victor, Executioner, Mob\n*\"Birth to My Creation\" \u2013 Victor\n*\"The Lab 1 (1:15 A.M.)\"  \u2013 Victor, Ensemble\n*\"Dear Victor\" \u2013 Elizabeth, Victor\n*\"Was it a Dream?/The Lab 2/Burn the Laboratory\"  \u2013 Victor\n*\"The Hands of Time\" \u2013 Elizabeth, Henry, William, Justine\n*\"Your Father's Eyes\" \u2013 Victor's Father\n*\"The Creature's Tale (Part 1)\" \u2013 Victor, Creature\n*\"The Waking Nightmare\" \u2013 Creature, Mob\n*\"The Creature's Tale (Part 2)\" \u2013 Creature\n*\"The Music of Love\" \u2013 Agatha, Blind Man, Creature\n*\"The Creature's Tale (Part 3)\" \u2013 Creature\n*\"Why?

The film is also in association with Digital Riot Media and Vesuvius Productions. It follows a [[Tree Gelbman|college student]] who is murdered on her birthday and begins [[Time loop|reliving the day repeatedly]], at which point she sets out to find the killer and stop her death.\n\nOriginally announced in 2007 under the title ''Half to Death'', the film was released on October 13, 2017, by [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]].<ref name=\"BD\">{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3433393/get-scared-half-to-death-october/ |title=Get Scared 'Half to Death' This October |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] |first=Brad |last=Miska |date=April 20, 2017 |accessdate=April 20, 2017}}</ref> It grossed $125{{nbsp}}million worldwide, on a $4.8{{nbsp}}million budget and received mostly positive reviews, with critics deeming the film entertaining while acknowledging the familiar premise,<ref name=\"rt\">{{cite web |url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/happy-death-day-is-familiar-but-fun/ |title=Happy Death Day Is Familiar but Fun |first=Jeff |last=Giles |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=October 12, 2017 |accessdate=October 13, 2017}}</ref> and describing it as \"''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' meets ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]''\".<ref name=\"opening\" /> A sequel, ''[[Happy Death Day 2U]]'', was released on February 13, 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a night of drunken partying, university student [[Tree Gelbman|Theresa \"Tree\" Gelbman]] wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of classmate Carter Davis. She ignores a phone call from her father and dismisses Carter, returning to her room. Her [[sorority]] housemate Lori Spengler gives her a cupcake, which she throws away. Tree meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the school mascot.\n\nTree immediately wakes up back in Carter's bed, and is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she relives the day, this time avoiding the tunnel and reaching the party. However, the masked killer follows her and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter's bed, realizes she is in a [[time loop]], and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, already hiding inside, murders her a third time.\n\nWaking up, Tree explains the events to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing people she considers suspects but is killed each time. After waking from a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. Her body shows evidence of recovery from multiple traumatic injuries, indicating she has retained physical damage from her previous deaths. When the killer shows up, Tree escapes the hospital in Gregory's car, only to be pursued and killed again.\n\nBack in Carter's bed, Tree convinces him of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. Tree admits to harboring tremendous self-loathing, particularly from pushing away her father after the death of her mother three years ago. Tree sees a local news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, Tree rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a nearby bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Realizing that Carter will remain dead if she ends the loop, Tree hangs herself.\n\nBelieving she has solved her murder, Tree proceeds happily through the day. She ends her affair with Dr. Butler and meets her father for lunch, where the two begin to reconcile. That night, she goes to the hospital and traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to finally be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake given to her by Lori.\n\nTree wakes up still in the loop. Angry and confused, she returns to her room, where Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes the previous loop was the only time she had ever eaten the cupcake, and she had died in her sleep. Tree realizes Lori is her true killer. Lori had poisoned the cupcake, but when Tree failed to eat it, Lori utilized her job as a nurse at the hospital to frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Tree threatens to take the cupcake to the police, but Lori attacks her. Lori admits to also having an affair with Dr. Butler, whose preference for Tree drove Lori mad with jealousy. In the ensuing fight, Tree stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth, then kicks her out a second-story window to her death.\n\nAt a restaurant, Tree and Carter muse over the day's events and he offers her his room for the night. The next day, Tree wakes up believing she is still in the time loop, but Carter quickly reveals he was just playing a prank on her, and it is really the next day at last. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him, and the two kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jessica Rothe]] as [[Tree Gelbman|Theresa \"Tree\" Gelbman]]\n* [[Israel Broussard]] as Carter Davis\n* [[Ruby Modine]] as Lori Spengler\n* [[Rachel Matthews]] as Danielle Bouseman\n* Charles Aitken as Gregory Butler\n* Rob Mello as John Tombs\n* Phi Vu as Ryan Phan\n* Caleb Spillyards as Tim Bauer\n* Laura Clifton as Stephanie Butler\n* Cariella Smith as Becky Shepard\n* Tran Tran as Emily\n* Blaine Kern III as Nick Sims\n* Jimmy Gonzales as hospital police officer\n* Dane Rhodes as Officer Santora\n* Tenea Intriago as student protestor\n* Donna Duplantier as Nurse Deena\n* Jason Bayle as David Gelbman\n* Missy Yager as Mrs. Gelbman\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|quote=The movie was in pre-production or soft production at the time, and I came on and I loved the concept of the movie.

Tree informs the nurse of the doctor's orders. The nurse reveals herself to be Dr. Butler's wife, Stephanie, who says it is for her own pain. She then murders Tree in revenge for her husband's affair with the girl.\n\nThis version was shown in the test screenings for the film and was received negatively by the audience, which led the writers to come up with the theatrical ending.

She ignores a phone call from her father and dismisses Carter, returning to her room. Her [[sorority]] housemate Lori Spengler gives her a cupcake, which she throws away. Tree meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask of the school mascot.\n\nTree immediately wakes up back in Carter's bed, and is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she relives the day, this time avoiding the tunnel and reaching the party. However, the masked killer follows her and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter's bed, realizes she is in a [[time loop]], and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, already hiding inside, murders her a third time.\n\nWaking up, Tree explains the events to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing people she considers suspects but is killed each time. After waking from a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. Her body shows evidence of recovery from multiple traumatic injuries, indicating she has retained physical damage from her previous deaths. When the killer shows up, Tree escapes the hospital in Gregory's car, only to be pursued and killed again.\n\nBack in Carter's bed, Tree convinces him of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. Tree admits to harboring tremendous self-loathing, particularly from pushing away her father after the death of her mother three years ago. Tree sees a local news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, Tree rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a nearby bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Realizing that Carter will remain dead if she ends the loop, Tree hangs herself.\n\nBelieving she has solved her murder, Tree proceeds happily through the day. She ends her affair with Dr. Butler and meets her father for lunch, where the two begin to reconcile. That night, she goes to the hospital and traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to finally be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake given to her by Lori.\n\nTree wakes up still in the loop. Angry and confused, she returns to her room, where Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes the previous loop was the only time she had ever eaten the cupcake, and she had died in her sleep. Tree realizes Lori is her true killer. Lori had poisoned the cupcake, but when Tree failed to eat it, Lori utilized her job as a nurse at the hospital to frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Tree threatens to take the cupcake to the police, but Lori attacks her. Lori admits to also having an affair with Dr. Butler, whose preference for Tree drove Lori mad with jealousy. In the ensuing fight, Tree stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth, then kicks her out a second-story window to her death.\n\nAt a restaurant, Tree and Carter muse over the day's events and he offers her his room for the night. The next day, Tree wakes up believing she is still in the time loop, but Carter quickly reveals he was just playing a prank on her, and it is really the next day at last. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him, and the two kiss.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jessica Rothe]] as [[Tree Gelbman|Theresa \"Tree\" Gelbman]]\n* [[Israel Broussard]] as Carter Davis\n* [[Ruby Modine]] as Lori Spengler\n* [[Rachel Matthews]] as Danielle Bouseman\n* Charles Aitken as Gregory Butler\n* Rob Mello as John Tombs\n* Phi Vu as Ryan Phan\n* Caleb Spillyards as Tim Bauer\n* Laura Clifton as Stephanie Butler\n* Cariella Smith as Becky Shepard\n* Tran Tran as Emily\n* Blaine Kern III as Nick Sims\n* Jimmy Gonzales as hospital police officer\n* Dane Rhodes as Officer Santora\n* Tenea Intriago as student protestor\n* Donna Duplantier as Nurse Deena\n* Jason Bayle as David Gelbman\n* Missy Yager as Mrs. Gelbman\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|quote=The movie was in pre-production or soft production at the time, and I came on and I loved the concept of the movie.

The percussion in the score are mostly sampled from college [[marching band]] drum lines to evoke the collegiate setting.<ref>[http://www.bearmccreary.com/#blog/blog/films/happy-death-day/ Bear Blog: Happy Death Day], Bear McCreary</ref> While the film's trailer featured [[50 Cent]]'s \"[[In Da Club]]\" as Tree's ringtone, Landon said the film could not afford to use the track, but still preferred the eventual song music supervisor Andrea von Foerster improvised, the comedic \"Busy Day Birthday\".<ref name=\"nw\" />\n\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Standard album<ref>{{cite web |title=Happy Death Day (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) [Bonus Track Version] |url=https://itunes.apple.com/br/album/happy-death-day-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1333288421 |work=[[iTunes Store]] |accessdate=February 16, 2018 |date=October 13, 2018}}</ref>\n| total_length    = 39:57\n|-\n| title1          = Day One\n| length1         = 5:26\n|-\n| title2          = Day Two\n| length2         = 6:05\n|-\n| title3          = Day Three\n| length3         = 4:18\n|-\n| title4          = Day Four\n| length4         = 2:17\n|-\n| title5          = Hospital Pursuit\n| length5         = 5:55\n|-\n| title6          = The Bell Tower\n| length6         = 3:30\n|-\n| title7          = Righting Wrongs\n| length7         = 3:40\n|-\n| title8          = Tree Takes Control\n| length8         = 4:30\n|-\n| title9          = The Cupcake\n| length9         = 4:16\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Bonus track\n| total_length    = 44:16\n| closed          = yes\n|-\n| title10         = Happy Death Day End Title Credits\n| length10        = 4:19\n}}\n\n== Reception==\n=== Box office ===\n''Happy Death Day'' grossed $55.7{{nbsp}}million in the United States and Canada, and $69.8{{nbsp}}million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $125.5{{nbsp}}million, against a production budget of $4.8{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\nIn the United States and Canada, ''Happy Death Day'' was released alongside ''[[Marshall (film)|Marshall]]'', ''[[The Foreigner (2017 film)|The Foreigner]]'' and ''[[Professor Marston and the Wonder Women]]'', and was expected to gross $15\u201320{{nbsp}}million from 3,130 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-movie-projector-happy-death-day-20171011-htmlstory.html |title='Happy Death Day' expected to unseat 'Blade Runner 2049' at the box office |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 11, 2017 |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}</ref> It made $1{{nbsp}}million from Thursday night previews at 2,450 theaters, similar to fellow Blumhouse release ''[[The Visit (2015 American film)|The Visit]]'' ($1.05{{nbsp}}million in 2015)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=4334&p=.htm |title=Blumhouse Makes a Wish for Another #1 Opener with 'Happy Death Day' |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |date=October 12, 2017 |accessdate=October 13, 2017}}</ref> and $11.6{{nbsp}}million on its first day, increasing weekend projections to $26{{nbsp}}million.
