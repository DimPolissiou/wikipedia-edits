And I hope people will just welcome the return of this extremely unlikely pair of Salander and this crusading journalist.\"<ref name=\"NPR\" />\n\n==Plot==\nComputer scientist Frans Balder abandons a prestigious job in [[Silicon Valley]] and returns to [[Sweden]] to take custody of his [[autistic]] son August. Balder is informed by several law enforcement agencies that he is in danger from a criminal organization who call themselves the \"Spider Society\", but he ignores their warnings, preferring to focus on his neglected son. August exhibits [[savant syndrome]]; he produces drawings of impressive veracity and demonstrates facility with numbers. Meanwhile, one year since ''Millennium'' magazine's [[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest|scoop]] on The Section, the publication has stagnated and is in danger of losing creative control to outside investors. Balder's former associate, Linus Brandell, tells [[Mikael Blomkvist]] about Balder and his tumultuous history, mentioning that some of his activities were aided by [[Lisbeth Salander]].\n\nSpurred by a childhood memory, Salander attempts to track down someone from her past, leading her to the Spider Society. She helps a group of [[hacker]]s gain access into [[National Security Agency|NSA]] servers, much to the fury of the agency's top [[cyber security]] agent, Edwin Needham. NSA agent Alona Casales and [[Swedish Security Service|S\u00c4PO]] agent Gabriella Grane are given the task of pursuing Salander and the Spider Society, which are a group of elite [[Russia]]n criminals led by an individual named \"Thanos\". Grane calls Balder with concerns about his safety, and Balder hires Milton Security for protection. He also reaches out to Blomkvist, hoping to confess his concerns to a respected journalist. Blomkvist agrees to meet him, but as he arrives, an assassin, self-identified in the narration as Jan Holtser, kills Balder. Blomkvist reaches out to Salander, hoping to harness her talents to the investigation.\n\nAugust's mother is unable to cope with his disorder and remands him to a care facility. However, Blomkvist realizes that August is drawing a picture of his father's killer. Holtser's superior, a woman called Kira, orders him to eliminate the child, but Salander rescues August and reaches out to Blomkvist and ''Millennium'' editor Erika Berger. Grane, a friend of Berger's, offers her beachfront vacation property as a [[safe house]]. Blomkvist learns from Balder's former associates that he had hired Salander to confirm that someone had robbed him, implicating executives inside Solifon, the company he worked for, in the theft. Thus, Balder went to Solifon to attempt to gain more evidence, discovering that they were collaborating with both the NSA and the Spider Society in their [[espionage]] efforts. It was this investigation that resulted in his death.\n\nNeedham is pulled off the investigation into Salander's hack, as the NSA is eager to cover up the agency's involvement. He learns of an individual known as \"Wasp\", and catches the allusions to [[Marvel Comics]] characters [[Wasp_(comics)|Janet Van Dyne]], founding member of [[Avengers_(comics)|the Avengers]], and [[Thanos|their perennial foe]]. Meanwhile, a woman calling herself Rebecka Mattson attempts to seduce Blomkvist. After talking to Salander's former guardian, Holger Palmgren, he learns she is Lisbeth's long-missing twin sister Camilla, who has taken over part of her father Zalachenko's criminal network and is using it to strike against Lisbeth. Needham comes to Sweden and contacts Blomkvist, asking to meet Salander so that she can help him secure the NSA database. However, they are interrupted by Salander: she and August are under attack at the safe house by the Spider Society under orders of Camilla AKA Kira AKA Thanos. Lisbeth fends them off, wounding Holtser and several other suspects.\n\nThough Camilla gets away, Lisbeth and August do as well; additionally, August has already drawn the picture implicating Holtser and helping Salander decrypt the last of the NSA's secrets. Grane takes a position at the [[United Nations|UN]] working for [[human rights]]. ''Millennium'' publishes an expos\u0117 of the affair which restores their credibility; additionally, a new investment from [[Gibraltar]] (the site of Salander's Wasp Enterprises) allows ''Millennium'' to buy out their meddlesome investors. Needham, with the magazine as ammunition, ousts the crooked officers at the NSA. Salander visits Blomkvist to renew their friendship.\n\n== Characters ==\n* [[Mikael Blomkvist]] \u2013 a journalist at ''Millennium'' magazine\n* [[Lisbeth Salander]] \u2013 a computer hacker known

She's brave, she's intrepid, she's unfrightenable, she's got a moral core (...) And I hope people will just welcome the return of this extremely unlikely pair of Salander and this crusading journalist.\"<ref name=\"NPR\" />\n\n==Plot==\nComputer scientist Frans Balder abandons a prestigious job in [[Silicon Valley]] and returns to [[Sweden]] to take custody of his [[autistic]] son August. Balder is informed by several law enforcement agencies that he is in danger from a criminal organization who call themselves the \"Spider Society\", but he ignores their warnings, preferring to focus on his neglected son. August exhibits [[savant syndrome]]; he produces drawings of impressive veracity and demonstrates facility with numbers. Meanwhile, one year since ''Millennium'' magazine's [[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest|scoop]] on The Section, the publication has stagnated and is in danger of losing creative control to outside investors. Balder's former associate, Linus Brandell, tells [[Mikael Blomkvist]] about Balder and his tumultuous history, mentioning that some of his activities were aided by [[Lisbeth Salander]].\n\nSpurred by a childhood memory, Salander attempts to track down someone from her past, leading her to the Spider Society. She helps a group of [[hacker]]s gain access into [[National Security Agency|NSA]] servers, much to the fury of the agency's top [[cyber security]] agent, Edwin Needham. NSA agent Alona Casales and [[Swedish Security Service|S\u00c4PO]] agent Gabriella Grane are given the task of pursuing Salander and the Spider Society, which are a group of elite [[Russia]]n criminals led by an individual named \"Thanos\". Grane calls Balder with concerns about his safety, and Balder hires Milton Security for protection. He also reaches out to Blomkvist, hoping to confess his concerns to a respected journalist. Blomkvist agrees to meet him, but as he arrives, an assassin, self-identified in the narration as Jan Holtser, kills Balder. Blomkvist reaches out to Salander, hoping to harness her talents to the investigation.\n\nAugust's mother is unable to cope with his disorder and remands him to a care facility. However, Blomkvist realizes that August is drawing a picture of his father's killer. Holtser's superior, a woman called Kira, orders him to eliminate the child, but Salander rescues August and reaches out to Blomkvist and ''Millennium'' editor Erika Berger. Grane, a friend of Berger's, offers her beachfront vacation property as a [[safe house]]. Blomkvist learns from Balder's former associates that he had hired Salander to confirm that someone had robbed him, implicating executives inside Solifon, the company he worked for, in the theft. Thus, Balder went to Solifon to attempt to gain more evidence, discovering that they were collaborating with both the NSA and the Spider Society in their [[espionage]] efforts. It was this investigation that resulted in his death.\n\nNeedham is pulled off the investigation into Salander's hack, as the NSA is eager to cover up the agency's involvement. He learns of an individual known as \"Wasp\", and catches the allusions to [[Marvel Comics]] characters [[Wasp_(comics)|Janet Van Dyne]], founding member of [[Avengers_(comics)|the Avengers]], and [[Thanos|their perennial foe]]. Meanwhile, a woman calling herself Rebecka Mattson attempts to seduce Blomkvist. After talking to Salander's former guardian, Holger Palmgren, he learns she is Lisbeth's long-missing twin sister Camilla, who has taken over part of her father Zalachenko's criminal network and is using it to strike against Lisbeth. Needham comes to Sweden and contacts Blomkvist, asking to meet Salander so that she can help him secure the NSA database. However, they are interrupted by Salander: she and August are under attack at the safe house by the Spider Society under orders of Camilla AKA Kira AKA Thanos. Lisbeth fends them off, wounding Holtser and several other suspects.\n\nThough Camilla gets away, Lisbeth and August do as well; additionally, August has already drawn the picture implicating Holtser and helping Salander decrypt the last of the NSA's secrets. Grane takes a position at the [[United Nations|UN]] working for [[human rights]]. ''Millennium'' publishes an expos\u0117 of the affair which restores their credibility; additionally, a new investment from [[Gibraltar]] (the site of Salander's Wasp Enterprises) allows ''Millennium'' to buy out their meddlesome investors. Needham, with the magazine as ammunition, ousts the crooked officers at the NSA. Salander visits Blomkvist to renew their friendship.\n\n== Characters ==\n* [[Mikael Blomkvist]] \u2013 a journalist at ''Millennium'' magazine\n* [[Lisbeth Salander]] \u2013 a computer hacker known

{"title_page": "Double (baseball)", "text_new": "{{distinguish|double play|doubleheader (baseball)}}\nIn [[baseball]], a '''double''' is the act of a [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] striking the pitched [[ball]] and safely reaching [[second base]] without being called out by the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]], without the benefit of a fielder's misplay (see [[error (baseball statistics)|error]]) or another [[baserunner|runner]] being put out on a [[fielder's choice]]. A double is a type of [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] (the others being the [[Single (baseball)|single]], [[Triple (baseball)|triple]] and [[home run]]) and is sometimes called a \"two-bagger\" or \"two-base hit\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/double|title=Double (2B)|work=MLB.com|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}</ref> For [[baseball statistics|statistical]] and [[baseball scorekeeping|scorekeeping]] purposes it is denoted by '''2B'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/rendoan01.shtml|title=Anthony Rendon|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=McMahon |editor-first=Rob |date=2009 |title=USA Today Baseball Scorebook |publisher=Sterling Innovation |page=11 |isbn=978-1-4027-6245-1}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nTypically, a double is a well-hit ball into the [[outfield]] that finds the \"gap\" between the [[center fielder]] and one of the [[corner outfielder]]s, bounces off the outfield wall and down into the field of play, or is hit up one of the two foul lines.  To hit many doubles, one must have decent hitting skill and power; it also helps to run well enough to beat an outfield throw.\n\nDoubles typically drive in [[Run (baseball)|run]]s from [[third base]], second base, and even from [[first base]] at times. When [[total base]]s and [[slugging percentage]]s are calculated, the number two is used for the calculation.\n\nA two-base hit awarded by an umpire when a batted ball is hit fairly and bounces out of play is referred to as a [[ground rule double]]. The batter is awarded second base and any runners advance two bases from the base they occupied at the time of the pitch.  Prior to [[1931 in sports|1931]], such hits were considered [[home run]]s.  A two-base hit awarded because the batter hit into a special situation defined in the ground rules is also defined as a ground rule double.  An example of this occurs where the rules of Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]] award a ground rule double if a batted ball is lost in the vines on the outfield [[bleacher]] wall.

To hit many doubles, one must have decent hitting skill and power; it also helps to run well enough to beat an outfield throw.\n\nDoubles typically drive in [[Run (baseball)|run]]s from [[third base]], second base, and even from [[first base]] at times. When [[total base]]s and [[slugging percentage]]s are calculated, the number two is used for the calculation.\n\nA two-base hit awarded by an umpire when a batted ball is hit fairly and bounces out of play is referred to as a [[ground rule double]]. The batter is awarded second base and any runners advance two bases from the base they occupied at the time of the pitch.  Prior to [[1931 in sports|1931]], such hits were considered [[home run]]s.  A two-base hit awarded because the batter hit into a special situation defined in the ground rules is also defined as a ground rule double.  An example of this occurs where the rules of Chicago's [[Wrigley Field]] award a ground rule double if a batted ball is lost in the vines on the outfield [[bleacher]] wall.  The rules of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in Minneapolis awarded a ground rule double if the ball became stuck in its [[Teflon]] ceiling. This happened only once in [[Major League Baseball]]{{emdash}}[[Dave Kingman]] hit a ball into the ceiling during a 1984 game.\n\nRenowned doubles hitters occasionally acquire a nickname that relates to their doubles hitting, for example \"Mitchy Two Bags\" ([[Mitch Moreland]]) and \"Tony Two Bags\" ([[Anthony Rendon]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/friv/baseball-player-nicknames.shtml|title=Baseball Player Nicknames|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=July 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Major League Baseball records==\n{{Further|List of Major League Baseball doubles records}}\n===Career===\n{{Details|List of Major League Baseball career doubles leaders}}\nThe all-time leader in doubles is [[Tris Speaker]], with 792.

He finished the year with an 8-1 record and a 3.89 ERA in 11 games, with nine complete games and one save in a total of 88 innings. He had 25 strikeouts and 22 walks.

He had 23 strikeouts and 46 walks while having 19 complete games. In 25 games, he batted .256 while having 13 RBIs and a home run. Before the 1902 season, Orth and several other Phillies left for the American League; Orth joined the Washington Senators. When Orth was traded to the [[New York Highlanders]] in {{Baseball year|1904}} after struggling the year before, he picked up the [[spitball]] from [[Jack Chesbro]] and had his best year in {{Baseball year|1906}}, going 27\u201317 and leading the [[American League]] in [[win (baseball)|wins]]. During that season, Orth threw 36 complete games in 39 starts.\n\nKnown as '''The Curveless Wonder''', Orth never relied on the breaking ball. Instead, his pitching success centered on his control and his ability to change pitch speeds. His pitch was once described in a poem by W.A. Phelon  as a \"glistening ball... but little speed, and scarce a curve at all.\"<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/9ddb48e5</ref> Orth twice finished with the fewest walks in his league.

Orth would frequently [[batting average (baseball)|hit above .300]]. The left-handed hitter was used as a [[pinch hitter]] 78 times and even played the field on a few occasions, including fifty-five games as an [[outfielder]] and eight at [[shortstop]] during his time with the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]].\n\n==Umpiring and coaching days==\nAfter knee injuries and a sore arm ended his career,<ref name=obit/> he [[baseball manager|managed]] for Lynchburg in the [[Virginia League]].

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed.

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Belgique: l'attentat du Mus\u00e9e juif en 2014

Victoria's Secret used the show to promote and market its goods in high-profile settings.\n\nThe show is a lavish event with elaborate costumed lingerie, varying music by leading entertainers, and [[Scenic design|set design]] according to the different themes running within the show. The show attracted hundreds of celebrities and entertainers, with special performers and acts every year. Each year, twenty to forty of the world's top [[fashion model]]s we're selected to perform in the fashion show. In a typical year, this included about a half dozen women under contract to the company,<ref name=\"MB\" /> known as [[Victoria's Secret Angels]]; the current Angels include [[Candice Swanepoel]], [[Lais Ribeiro]], [[Elsa Hosk]], [[Jasmine Tookes]], [[Martha Hunt]], [[Sara Sampaio]], [[Romee Strijd]], [[Stella Maxwell]], [[Taylor Hill (model)|Taylor Hill]], [[Josephine Skriver]], [[Barbara Palvin]], [[Alexina Graham]], [[Grace Elizabeth]], and [[Leomie Anderson]].\n\nAmerican [[network television]] broadcasts the show during [[prime time]]. The first few shows in the 1990s were held in the days preceding [[Valentine's Day]] to promote the brand for this holiday due to its romantic theme. They were not aired on national television. In 1999 and 2000, the show was [[webcast]]. Beginning in 2001, the shows were moved ahead of the [[Christmas holiday season]]. Also in 2001, the show made its network television broadcast debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], though from 2002 to 2017, it had been broadcast on [[CBS]]; the show moved back to ABC for the 2018 edition. The show has been held at a variety of locations in different cities including [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Cannes]], [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Shanghai]]. The first four shows were held at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York City, but since it has become a televised event, it has most often been held at the [[69th Regiment Armory]] in New York City.\n\nThe show was canceled in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095862/sorry-angels-the-2019-victoria's-secret-fashion-show-is-officially-cancelled|title=Sorry Angels, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Is Now Cancelled|date=November 21, 2019|website=E!

The very same models who were featured in the campaigns for the \"Angel\"-bra line, with the exception of [[Chandra North]] filling in the spot for Christensen, walked the runway with Angel wings on. Over the years, the show featured various forms and sizes of wings, such as butterfly, peacock, or devil wings, which have become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret brand. In theory, wings are any ornamental back piece worn by a model on the runway, or any sort of structural appendage resembling traditional wings. Even though the amount of wings have expanded over the years and thus far have taken away the prestige to wear wings, a lot of models still consider it an honor to wear wings.\n\n[[Adriana Lima]] has worn the most wings in the history of the show. With her count of 22 pair of wings, she's closely followed by [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] and [[Candice Swanepoel]], who have  worn 18 pair of wings.\n\n== Critical review ==\nThe early webcasts were criticized for poor connection, and users that could connect were subjected to low video quality.<ref name=\"TMBA\" /> One critic from ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the initial 20th-century webcast experience as having felt like he was \"watching a striptease through a keyhole\".<ref name=\"IRASMbVS\" />\n\nSome critics have described the 21st-century televised editions of the show as pornographic,<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2091491/ | title = These Are a Few of My Favorite Thongs: The Victoria's Secret spectacle on CBS | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2003 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | author = Stevens, Dana}}</ref><ref name=\"WGPVSS\">{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,70904,00.html | title = Watchdog Groups Protest Victoria's Secret Show | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2002 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}</ref>  while others have described it as both \"outright commercialism\" and indistinguishable from an [[infomercial]].<ref name=\"VVSoT\" /> The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has received complaints regarding the broadcast, but no fines have been imposed, with the FCC, following the 2001 airing, citing the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and stating that \"sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium\" were not broadcast.<ref>''People'': [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623699,00.html Sexy Telecast No Problem With FCC.]  March 26, 2002.</ref>  In the initial 2001 airing ABC blurred the screen on particularly sheer lingerie.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  This enabled the show to pass muster with its internal Broadcast Standards and Practices department and to achieve a [[TV Parental Guidelines]] rating of TV-14 (a rating maintained for each broadcast presentation over the years), as a TV-MA rating is virtually unmarketable for advertisers on broadcast television.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport | title = FCC Investigating ABC's 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show' | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 21, 2001 | author = Kleder, Martha | publisher = [[Concerned Women for America]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728121642/http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport|archive-date=July 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 2002, the [[National Organization for Women]] protested the show calling it a \"soft-core porn infomercial.\"<ref name=\"Slate\"/>   They were joined in protest by the [[Parents Television Council]] and other watchdog organizations.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" /> Despite the program's timeslot and parental ratings, some affiliates have chosen not to air the program, including [[Fisher Communications]]' CBS stations in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] in the past.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  In 2009, the [[American Decency Association]] organized [[email]] letters of protests to sponsors of the show including [[AT&T]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Netflix]], [[Nikon]], and [[Reebok]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717081121/http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 17, 2011 | title = Victoria's Secret toning down?

more models are chosen to wear the \"Swarovski Outfit\" and the \"Swarovski Wings\" every year. The first Swarovski items that were shown on the runway were given to [[Alessandra Ambrosio]]. [[Victoria's Secret]] had worked with [[Swarovski]] for 9 years prior to the Swarovski items worn on the runway in 2011.<ref>https://www.crystals-from-swarovski.com/editorial/events/15-years-of-victorias-secret-and-swarovski.en.html/</ref>\n\n[[Alessandra Ambrosio]]'s Swarovski outfit, worn in 2011, included a 60-pound wing which was made out of 105,000 Swarovski crystals. The base of her wing was made out of 23-carat gold. [[Cameron Russell]] was given the \"10th Anniversary\" Swarovski outfit, worn in 2012, celebrating Victoria's Secret's 10th year working with Swarovski.\n\nThe 2013 Swarovski outfit was a 3D printed piece given to [[Lindsay Ellingson]], which included mini-micro Swarovski crystals.

sponsored by and featuring [[Victoria's Secret]], a brand of [[lingerie]] and [[sleepwear]]. Victoria's Secret used the show to promote and market its goods in high-profile settings.\n\nThe show is a lavish event with elaborate costumed lingerie, varying music by leading entertainers, and [[Scenic design|set design]] according to the different themes running within the show. The show attracted hundreds of celebrities and entertainers, with special performers and acts every year. Each year, twenty to forty of the world's top [[fashion model]]s we're selected to perform in the fashion show. In a typical year, this included about a half dozen women under contract to the company,<ref name=\"MB\" /> known as [[Victoria's Secret Angels]]; the current Angels include [[Candice Swanepoel]], [[Lais Ribeiro]], [[Elsa Hosk]], [[Jasmine Tookes]], [[Martha Hunt]], [[Sara Sampaio]], [[Romee Strijd]], [[Stella Maxwell]], [[Taylor Hill (model)|Taylor Hill]], [[Josephine Skriver]], [[Barbara Palvin]], [[Alexina Graham]], [[Grace Elizabeth]], and [[Leomie Anderson]].\n\nAmerican [[network television]] broadcasts the show during [[prime time]]. The first few shows in the 1990s were held in the days preceding [[Valentine's Day]] to promote the brand for this holiday due to its romantic theme. They were not aired on national television. In 1999 and 2000, the show was [[webcast]]. Beginning in 2001, the shows were moved ahead of the [[Christmas holiday season]]. Also in 2001, the show made its network television broadcast debut on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], though from 2002 to 2017, it had been broadcast on [[CBS]]; the show moved back to ABC for the 2018 edition. The show has been held at a variety of locations in different cities including [[Miami]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Cannes]], [[Paris]], [[London]], and [[Shanghai]]. The first four shows were held at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York City, but since it has become a televised event, it has most often been held at the [[69th Regiment Armory]] in New York City.\n\nThe show was canceled in November 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095862/sorry-angels-the-2019-victoria's-secret-fashion-show-is-officially-cancelled|title=Sorry Angels, the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Is Now Cancelled|date=November 21, 2019|website=E!

The idea to feature wings as part of the collection came in the wake of the immense success of the \"Angels\"-bra line, which was advertised with the models [[Tyra Banks]], [[Helena Christensen]], [[Karen Mulder]], [[Daniela Pestova]], and [[Stephanie Seymour]] wearing wings, and was introduced to the annual show in 1998. The very same models who were featured in the campaigns for the \"Angel\"-bra line, with the exception of [[Chandra North]] filling in the spot for Christensen, walked the runway with Angel wings on. Over the years, the show featured various forms and sizes of wings, such as butterfly, peacock, or devil wings, which have become emblematic of the Victoria's Secret brand. In theory, wings are any ornamental back piece worn by a model on the runway, or any sort of structural appendage resembling traditional wings. Even though the amount of wings have expanded over the years and thus far have taken away the prestige to wear wings, a lot of models still consider it an honor to wear wings.\n\n[[Adriana Lima]] has worn the most wings in the history of the show. With her count of 22 pair of wings, she's closely followed by [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] and [[Candice Swanepoel]], who have  worn 18 pair of wings.\n\n== Critical review ==\nThe early webcasts were criticized for poor connection, and users that could connect were subjected to low video quality.<ref name=\"TMBA\" /> One critic from ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the initial 20th-century webcast experience as having felt like he was \"watching a striptease through a keyhole\".<ref name=\"IRASMbVS\" />\n\nSome critics have described the 21st-century televised editions of the show as pornographic,<ref name=\"Slate\">{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2091491/ | title = These Are a Few of My Favorite Thongs: The Victoria's Secret spectacle on CBS | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2003 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | author = Stevens, Dana}}</ref><ref name=\"WGPVSS\">{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,70904,00.html | title = Watchdog Groups Protest Victoria's Secret Show | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 20, 2002 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}</ref>  while others have described it as both \"outright commercialism\" and indistinguishable from an [[infomercial]].<ref name=\"VVSoT\" /> The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has received complaints regarding the broadcast, but no fines have been imposed, with the FCC, following the 2001 airing, citing the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and stating that \"sexual or excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium\" were not broadcast.<ref>''People'': [http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623699,00.html Sexy Telecast No Problem With FCC.]  March 26, 2002.</ref>  In the initial 2001 airing ABC blurred the screen on particularly sheer lingerie.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  This enabled the show to pass muster with its internal Broadcast Standards and Practices department and to achieve a [[TV Parental Guidelines]] rating of TV-14 (a rating maintained for each broadcast presentation over the years), as a TV-MA rating is virtually unmarketable for advertisers on broadcast television.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport | title = FCC Investigating ABC's 'Victoria's Secret Fashion Show' | accessdate = March 2, 2010 | date = November 21, 2001 | author = Kleder, Martha | publisher = [[Concerned Women for America]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728121642/http://www.cultureandfamily.org/articledisplay.asp?id=310&department=CFI&categoryid=cfreport|archive-date=July 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In 2002, the [[National Organization for Women]] protested the show calling it a \"soft-core porn infomercial.\"<ref name=\"Slate\"/>   They were joined in protest by the [[Parents Television Council]] and other watchdog organizations.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" /> Despite the program's timeslot and parental ratings, some affiliates have chosen not to air the program, including [[Fisher Communications]]' CBS stations in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] in the past.<ref name=\"WGPVSS\" />  In 2009, the [[American Decency Association]] organized [[email]] letters of protests to sponsors of the show including [[AT&T]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Netflix]], [[Nikon]], and [[Reebok]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717081121/http://www.americandecency.org/archives/victorias-secret-toning-down-not/#more-2743|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 17, 2011 | title = Victoria's Secret toning down?

more models are chosen to wear the \"Swarovski Outfit\" and the \"Swarovski Wings\" every year. The first Swarovski items that were shown on the runway were given to [[Alessandra Ambrosio]]. [[Victoria's Secret]] had worked with [[Swarovski]] for 9 years prior to the Swarovski items worn on the runway in 2011.<ref>https://www.crystals-from-swarovski.com/editorial/events/15-years-of-victorias-secret-and-swarovski.en.html/</ref>\n\n[[Alessandra Ambrosio]]'s Swarovski outfit, worn in 2011, included a 60-pound wing which was made out of 105,000 Swarovski crystals. The base of her wing was made out of 23-carat gold. [[Cameron Russell]] was given the \"10th Anniversary\" Swarovski outfit, worn in 2012, celebrating Victoria's Secret's 10th year working with Swarovski.\n\nThe 2013 Swarovski outfit was a 3D printed piece given to [[Lindsay Ellingson]], which included mini-micro Swarovski crystals. In 2017, [[Elsa Hosk]] was chosen to wear the 15th Anniversary Swarovski outfit, which came out to a total value of $1,000,000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

When she arrives, the child, Tara, is already asleep; Helen and Dr. Cordell leave, Amanda makes tea in the kitchen, and is watched by a man through the window. After hearing odd noises, she is startled by the doorbell ringing, and finds her boyfriend Chris at the door. The two lounge on the couch before she makes him leave after Helen calls the home to check in. As Chris walks outside, he is attacked by a man hiding outside who clobbers him on the head. \n\nAmanda continues to hear knocking noises and believes it is Chris playing a prank on her. She opens a window to reveal a silhouetted face staring back at her. Panicked, Amanda calls the restaurant where Helen is dining with her boyfriend Jim and their friend, Dr. Cordell. Helen is notified by the restaurant staff and goes to take the call, but the line goes dead after she picks up. Worried that her ex-husband, Brian, may have arrived at the home, Helen has Jim call the local psychiatric institute, who notify him that Brian escaped earlier in the night; Helen reveals in conversation that he had been institutionalized after he attempted to murder her; Dr. Cordell is his doctor.\n\nAt the front door, Amanda finds Chris, covered in blood; with him is Brian, who claims to be a neighbor who heard a commotion outside. Chris loses consciousness on the floor, and Brian consoles Amanda, who is distraught. At the house, Amanda grows disconcerted when Brian refuses to allow her upstairs, and begins calling her Helen. Realizing that he is Helen's ex-husband, Amanda begins to play into Brian's [[delusion]]s, and repeatedly proclaims her love for him. \n\nBrian eventually falls asleep, and Amanda attempts to leave the house with Tara, but is stopped by him in the foyer. Chris regains consciousness and attempts to fight Brian, but Brian murders him. Amanda flees out the front door just as police arrive at the home, but she is pulled back inside by Brian, who threatens her and Tara with a shard of glass. Helen and Jim arrive at the home, where Dr. Cordell and numerous policemen have gathered. A standoff ensues in which they attempt to coax him out of the house. Brian demands Helen come inside, but she agrees only on the condition that Amanda and Tara are let outside. \n\nHelen enters the home, where Brian locks her inside, and begins choking her after he finds she has brought in a canister of [[tear gas]]. Amanda stops him by slashing his face open with the glass shard, and flees outside. Brian charges after her, carrying Tara with a piece of glass against his neck. The police hold fire and Helen follows outside and attempts to negotiate with him. Brian hands Tara to her and she slowly backs away from him.

The aircraft involved, a [[Vickers Viscount]] named the ''Hunyani'', was flying the last leg of [[Air Rhodesia]]'s regular scheduled service from [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] to the capital [[Harare|Salisbury]], via the resort town of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]].\n\nSoon after Flight 825 took off, a group of ZIPRA guerrillas hit it on its [[Port and starboard|starboard]] wing with a Soviet-made [[9K32 Strela-2|Strela-2]] surface-to-air [[infrared homing]] missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an [[emergency landing]]. An attempted [[belly landing]] in a cotton field just west of [[Karoi]] was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived.\n\nZIPRA leader [[Joshua Nkomo]] publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the ''Hunyani'' in an interview with the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white,<ref name=nyarota62/> saw the attack as an act of terrorism.<ref name=freeman/> A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind.<ref name=nyarota62/> Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.\n\nTalks between Nkomo and Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a \"monster\".<ref name=moorcraft154/> On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of [[martial law]] over selected areas. The [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were [[refugee]]s camping in and around guerrilla positions.<ref name=moorcraft155/> In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Zimbabwe in Africa.svg|thumb|upright|[[Rhodesia]]]]\nA dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the [[self-governing colony]] of [[Rhodesia]]{{refn|group=n|name=zimbabwe}} led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], to [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declare independence]] from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965.

K. van der Byl|P&nbsp;K van der Byl]], the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.<ref name=heraldmemorial>{{Harvnb|Rhodesia Herald|9 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] [[John de Costa]] gave a sermon damning what he described as a \"deafening silence\" from overseas. \"Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the Viscount\", he said. \"But are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised? We are not!

For others, far from our borders, it is an intellectual matter, not one which affects them deeply. Here is the tragedy!\"<ref name=heraldmemorial/>\n\n===Smith\u2013Nkomo talks halted===\nThe talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called Nkomo a \"monster\".<ref name=moorcraft154>{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=154}}</ref> Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith\u2013Nkomo talks at this time was \"potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre\",<ref name=cilliers47/> as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two \"at this critical stage\" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition.<ref name=\"cilliers47\"/>\n\nOn 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of [[martial law]], which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to \"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \"any defensive strikes we might undertake\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=266\u2013267}}</ref> [[William Irvine (Rhodesian politician)|William Irvine]], the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\".<ref name=godwinhancock288/>\n\n==Rhodesian military response==\n\n===Operation Snoopy===\nBecause ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country,<ref name=moorcraft154/> but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around [[Chimoio]] in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during [[Operation Dingo]], destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \"New Chimoio\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called [[Operation Snoopy]], the Rhodesian Air Force, [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978.<ref name=petterbowyer331/> Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid in the form of nine Soviet-made [[T-54/55|T-54]] tanks and four Russian [[BTR-152]] armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were \"several hundred\" guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike.<ref name=moorcraft154/>\n\nRhodesia then attacked ZIPRA's bases in Zambia, in what Group Captain Peter Petter-Bowyer later described as \"payback time\" for Flight 825.<ref name=pb333>{{Harvnb|Petter-Bowyer|2005|p=333}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Gatling===\n{{See also|Operation Gatling}}\n{{Location map+|Zambia|width=220|alt=Map of Zambia and the surrounding region showing relevant locations|float=right|places=\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Lubumbashi</span>|position=left|lat=-11.666667|long=27.466667|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#fefee9;\">Lusaka</span>|position=left|lat=-15.416667|long=28.283333|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#fefee9;\">'''Westlands&nbsp;Farm'''</span>|position=right|lat=-15.231111|long=28.342778|mark=Crosshairs Red.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Salisbury</span>|position=right|lat=-17.863889|long=31.029722|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Kariba</span>|position=right|lat=-16.516667|long=28.8|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Victoria Falls</span>|position=right|lat=-17.933333|long=25.833333|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:90px;top:105px;\"><span style=\"background-color:#fefee9;\"><small>Z A M B I A</small></span></div>\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:71px;top:27px;\"><small>Zaire</small></div>\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:3px;top:70px;\"><small>Angola</small></div>\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:130px;top:157px;\"><small>Rhodesia</small></div>\n|caption=Westlands Farm (or Freedom Camp) was ZIPRA's headquarters and Operation Gatling's main target.}}\n[[Operation Gatling]] was launched on 19 October 1978. It was another joint-force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] and [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] paratroopers. Operation Gatling's primary target, just {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=off}} north-east of central [[Lusaka]], was the formerly white-owned [[Westlands Farm]], which had been transformed into ZIPRA's main headquarters and training base under the name \"Freedom Camp\". [[ZIPRA]] presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka. About 4,000 guerrillas underwent training at [[Freedom Camp]], with senior ZIPRA staff also on site.<ref name=pb333/> The Rhodesian operation's other targets were [[Chikumbi]], {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} north of Lusaka, and Mkushi Camp; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked.<ref name=moorcraft155/>\n\nLed by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to [[Lusaka International Airport|Lusaka Airport]] tower as \"Green Leader\", a [[Rhodesian Air Force]] group flew into [[Zambia]] at very low altitudes (thereby avoiding Zambian radar) and took control of the country's [[airspace]] for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on Westlands Farm, informing Lusaka tower that the attack was against \"Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia\", and that Rhodesian [[Hawker Hunter]]s were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader's instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic.<ref name=moorcraft135144>{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|pp=135\u2013144}}</ref> Using [[Rufunsa District|Rufunsa]] airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three-day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors.<ref name=moorcraft155/>\n\nHistorians [[Paul Moorcraft]] and [[Peter McLaughlin]] write that this exaggerated considerably the number of guerrillas killed, as most of Nkomo's army, then numbering about 10,000 fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed [[refugee]]s often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been \"impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits.\"<ref name=moorcraft155/> Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as \"a refugee camp for boys\",<ref name=sibanda191912/> and says \"351 boys and girls\" were killed.<ref name=sibanda191912/> He claims that the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN Refugee Agency]] \"confirmed ZAPU's claim that Smith's forces struck at defenseless, civilian trainees\".<ref name=sibanda191912/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and ZIPRA bases did much to restore the morale of the Rhodesian people following the Viscount incident, though they had not made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns. Nkomo and the Zambian President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia's rural areas, and covered three-quarters of the country by the end of 1978.<ref name=moorcraft155>{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=155}}</ref> Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing {{nobreak|anti-Strela}} shielding for its Viscounts. Before this work was completed, ZIPRA shot down a second Viscount, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], on 12 February 1979. This time there were no survivors.<ref name=petterbowyer331/>\n\nFollowing the second shootdown, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the Viscounts would be coated with {{nobreak|low-radiation}} paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the Strela's targeting system once it was over {{convert|2000|ft}}. There were no further Viscount shootdowns in Rhodesia.<ref name=petterbowyer331/>\n\nIn the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by ZANU and ZAPU, Muzorewa won a majority, and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted, {{nobreak|majority-ruled}} state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979.<ref name=hackland289>{{Harvnb|Williams|Hackland|1988|p=289}}</ref> This new order failed to win international acceptance, however, and in December 1979 the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the UK government and the Patriotic Front, returning the country to its former colonial status.

State media in Zimbabwe, prominently the ''Herald'' newspaper, often claim that Rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations.<ref name=herald2013/> ZIPRA's downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board.<ref name=herald2013>{{Harvnb|The Herald|2013 a}}</ref><ref name=ZAPUps/> The massacre of surviving Flight 825 passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than ZIPRA; in his 1984 memoirs Nkomo repeated his claim that ZIPRA fighters had helped the survivors, and wrote simply that \"I truly have no idea how the ten died\".<ref name=nkomo165>{{Harvnb|Nkomo|Harman|1984|p=165}}</ref>\n\nA monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on Chikumbi was built in Zambia in 1998, and dedicated jointly by the Zambian and Zimbabwean governments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Machona|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Phiri|Phiri|1998}}</ref> A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents, dubbed the Viscount Memorial, was erected on the grounds of the [[Voortrekker Monument]] in [[Pretoria]], South Africa, in 2012, and inaugurated on 1 September that year.<ref name=inauguration/> The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright, side by side, the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft.

[[Christopher Mutsvangwa]], a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling Hoey's proposed commemoration \"a provocation&nbsp;...

The aircraft involved, a [[Vickers Viscount]] named the ''Hunyani'', was flying the last leg of [[Air Rhodesia]]'s regular scheduled service from [[Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe|Victoria Falls]] to the capital [[Harare|Salisbury]], via the resort town of [[Kariba, Zimbabwe|Kariba]].\n\nSoon after Flight 825 took off, a group of ZIPRA guerrillas hit it on its [[Port and starboard|starboard]] wing with a Soviet-made [[9K32 Strela-2|Strela-2]] surface-to-air [[infrared homing]] missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an [[emergency landing]]. An attempted [[belly landing]] in a cotton field just west of [[Karoi]] was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived.\n\nZIPRA leader [[Joshua Nkomo]] publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the ''Hunyani'' in an interview with the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, both black and white,<ref name=nyarota62/> saw the attack as an act of terrorism.<ref name=freeman/> A fierce Rhodesian backlash followed against enemy strongholds and increased racial tension even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind.<ref name=nyarota62/> Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.\n\nTalks between Nkomo and Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], which had been progressing promisingly, were immediately suspended by the Rhodesians, with Smith calling Nkomo a \"monster\".<ref name=moorcraft154/> On 10 September, Smith announced the extension of [[martial law]] over selected areas. The [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were [[refugee]]s camping in and around guerrilla positions.<ref name=moorcraft155/> In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Zimbabwe in Africa.svg|thumb|upright|[[Rhodesia]]]]\nA dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the [[self-governing colony]] of [[Rhodesia]]{{refn|group=n|name=zimbabwe}} led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]], to [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declare independence]] from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965.

The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the [[9K32 Strela-2|Strela-2]] shoulder-launched [[Man-portable air-defense system|surface-to-air missile launcher]], supplied by the [[Soviet Union]] from the mid-1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact's materiel support.{{refn|ZANLA, aligned with China rather than the Soviets, never received such weapons.

Heaving wildly, the ''Hunyani'' began to descend rapidly.<ref name=nyarota62/>\n\nAt 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to [[air traffic control]], informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. \"We're going in,\" he radioed.<ref name=time/> Telling his passengers to brace for an [[emergency landing]], he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of [[Karoi]], intending to [[belly landing|belly land]] the craft.

They told the passengers to congregate around a point a few metres from the wreckage; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk, the insurgents told the able-bodied men to carry the others. The passengers were assembled into an area of about {{convert|10|m2|ft2}}.

Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and [[South African Airways]] personnel, as well as [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including [[P. K. van der Byl|P&nbsp;K van der Byl]], the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.<ref name=heraldmemorial>{{Harvnb|Rhodesia Herald|9 September 1978}}</ref>\n\n[[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] [[John de Costa]] gave a sermon damning what he described as a \"deafening silence\" from overseas. \"Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but sickened at the events attending the Viscount\", he said. \"But are we deafened with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves civilised?

Here is the tragedy!\"<ref name=heraldmemorial/>\n\n===Smith\u2013Nkomo talks halted===\nThe talks between Smith and the ZAPU leader that had been progressing so promisingly were immediately halted by Salisbury. Smith himself called Nkomo a \"monster\".<ref name=moorcraft154>{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=154}}</ref> Cilliers comments that the ending of the Smith\u2013Nkomo talks at this time was \"potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre\",<ref name=cilliers47/> as the talks had been progressing well before the incident. He surmises that an agreement between the two \"at this critical stage\" might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition.<ref name=\"cilliers47\"/>\n\nOn 10 September, the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of [[martial law]], which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed. He declared Rhodesia's intent to \"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \"any defensive strikes we might undertake\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=266\u2013267}}</ref> [[William Irvine (Rhodesian politician)|William Irvine]], the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\".<ref name=godwinhancock288/>\n\n==Rhodesian military response==\n\n===Operation Snoopy===\nBecause ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country,<ref name=moorcraft154/> but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around [[Chimoio]] in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during [[Operation Dingo]], destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \"New Chimoio\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals. In a combined airborne-ground assault called [[Operation Snoopy]], the Rhodesian Air Force, [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978.<ref name=petterbowyer331/> Mozambique sent armour to ZANLA's aid in the form of nine Soviet-made [[T-54/55|T-54]] tanks and four Russian [[BTR-152]] armoured personnel carriers, but the former were routed and one of the latter destroyed by the Rhodesian security forces. According to Rhodesian figures, there were \"several hundred\" guerrillas killed, while the security forces lost only two soldiers, one of whom was accidentally killed by a friendly air strike.<ref name=moorcraft154/>\n\nRhodesia then attacked ZIPRA's bases in Zambia, in what Group Captain Peter Petter-Bowyer later described as \"payback time\" for Flight 825.<ref name=pb333>{{Harvnb|Petter-Bowyer|2005|p=333}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Gatling===\n{{See also|Operation Gatling}}\n{{Location map+|Zambia|width=220|alt=Map of Zambia and the surrounding region showing relevant locations|float=right|places=\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Lubumbashi</span>|position=left|lat=-11.666667|long=27.466667|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#fefee9;\">Lusaka</span>|position=left|lat=-15.416667|long=28.283333|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#fefee9;\">'''Westlands&nbsp;Farm'''</span>|position=right|lat=-15.231111|long=28.342778|mark=Crosshairs Red.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Salisbury</span>|position=right|lat=-17.863889|long=31.029722|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Kariba</span>|position=right|lat=-16.516667|long=28.8|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n  {{Location map~|Zambia|label=<span style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0;\">Victoria Falls</span>|position=right|lat=-17.933333|long=25.833333|mark=Steel pog.svg|marksize=8}}\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:90px;top:105px;\"><span style=\"background-color:#fefee9;\"><small>Z A M B I A</small></span></div>\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:71px;top:27px;\"><small>Zaire</small></div>\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:3px;top:70px;\"><small>Angola</small></div>\n<div style=\"position: absolute;left:130px;top:157px;\"><small>Rhodesia</small></div>\n|caption=Westlands Farm (or Freedom Camp) was ZIPRA's headquarters and Operation Gatling's main target.}}\n[[Operation Gatling]] was launched on 19 October 1978. It was another joint-force operation between the Air Force and the Army, which contributed [[Rhodesian Special Air Service]] and [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] paratroopers. Operation Gatling's primary target, just {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=off}} north-east of central [[Lusaka]], was the formerly white-owned [[Westlands Farm]], which had been transformed into ZIPRA's main headquarters and training base under the name \"Freedom Camp\". [[ZIPRA]] presumed that Rhodesia would never dare to attack a site so close to Lusaka. About 4,000 guerrillas underwent training at [[Freedom Camp]], with senior ZIPRA staff also on site.<ref name=pb333/> The Rhodesian operation's other targets were [[Chikumbi]], {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} north of Lusaka, and Mkushi Camp; all three were to be attacked more or less simultaneously in a coordinated sweep across Zambia. Assaulting targets deep inside Zambia was a first for the Rhodesian forces; previously only guerrillas near the border had been attacked.<ref name=moorcraft155/>\n\nLed by Squadron Leader Chris Dixon, who identified himself to [[Lusaka International Airport|Lusaka Airport]] tower as \"Green Leader\", a [[Rhodesian Air Force]] group flew into [[Zambia]] at very low altitudes (thereby avoiding Zambian radar) and took control of the country's [[airspace]] for about a quarter of an hour during the initial assault on Westlands Farm, informing Lusaka tower that the attack was against \"Rhodesian dissidents, and not against Zambia\", and that Rhodesian [[Hawker Hunter]]s were circling the Zambian airfields under orders to shoot down any fighter that attempted to take off. The Zambians obeyed all of Green Leader's instructions, made no attempt to resist and temporarily halted civil air traffic.<ref name=moorcraft135144>{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|pp=135\u2013144}}</ref> Using [[Rufunsa District|Rufunsa]] airstrip in eastern Zambia as a forward base, the Rhodesian military suffered only minor casualties during the three-day operation, and afterwards claimed to have killed over 1,500 ZIPRA personnel, as well as some Cuban instructors.<ref name=moorcraft155/>\n\nHistorians [[Paul Moorcraft]] and [[Peter McLaughlin]] write that this exaggerated considerably the number of guerrillas killed, as most of Nkomo's army, then numbering about 10,000 fighters, had not been touched. On the other hand, unarmed [[refugee]]s often camped in or around insurgent positions, and hundreds of these had been killed in the Rhodesian raid. Moorcraft and McLaughlin comment that for the Rhodesian airmen, it would have been \"impossible to distinguish innocent refugees from young ZIPRA recruits.\"<ref name=moorcraft155/> Sibanda describes Freedom Camp as \"a refugee camp for boys\",<ref name=sibanda191912/> and says \"351 boys and girls\" were killed.<ref name=sibanda191912/> He claims that the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN Refugee Agency]] \"confirmed ZAPU's claim that Smith's forces struck at defenseless, civilian trainees\".<ref name=sibanda191912/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and ZIPRA bases did much to restore the morale of the Rhodesian people following the Viscount incident, though they had not made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns. Nkomo and the Zambian President [[Kenneth Kaunda]] all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively. Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia's rural areas, and covered three-quarters of the country by the end of 1978.<ref name=moorcraft155>{{Harvnb|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=155}}</ref> Air Rhodesia, meanwhile, began developing {{nobreak|anti-Strela}} shielding for its Viscounts. Before this work was completed, ZIPRA shot down a second Viscount, [[Air Rhodesia Flight 827]], on 12 February 1979. This time there were no survivors.<ref name=petterbowyer331/>\n\nFollowing the second shootdown, Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the Viscounts would be coated with {{nobreak|low-radiation}} paint, with the exhaust pipes concurrently shrouded. According to tests conducted by the Air Force, a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the Strela's targeting system once it was over {{convert|2000|ft}}. There were no further Viscount shootdowns in Rhodesia.<ref name=petterbowyer331/>\n\nIn the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms, boycotted by ZANU and ZAPU, Muzorewa won a majority, and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted, {{nobreak|majority-ruled}} state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979.<ref name=hackland289>{{Harvnb|Williams|Hackland|1988|p=289}}</ref> This new order failed to win international acceptance, however, and in December 1979 the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the UK government and the Patriotic Front, returning the country to its former colonial status.

State media in Zimbabwe, prominently the ''Herald'' newspaper, often claim that Rhodesian forces indiscriminately and deliberately slaughtered thousands of helpless refugees during such operations.<ref name=herald2013/> ZIPRA's downing of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board.<ref name=herald2013>{{Harvnb|The Herald|2013 a}}</ref><ref name=ZAPUps/> The massacre of surviving Flight 825 passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than ZIPRA; in his 1984 memoirs Nkomo repeated his claim that ZIPRA fighters had helped the survivors, and wrote simply that \"I truly have no idea how the ten died\".<ref name=nkomo165>{{Harvnb|Nkomo|Harman|1984|p=165}}</ref>\n\nA monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on Chikumbi was built in Zambia in 1998, and dedicated jointly by the Zambian and Zimbabwean governments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Machona|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Phiri|Phiri|1998}}</ref> A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents, dubbed the Viscount Memorial, was erected on the grounds of the [[Voortrekker Monument]] in [[Pretoria]], South Africa, in 2012, and inaugurated on 1 September that year.<ref name=inauguration/> The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright, side by side, the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft.
