The song has [[mento]] influences, but it is commonly classified as an example of the better known [[calypso music]].\n\nIt is a [[work song]], from the point of view of dock workers working the night shift loading [[banana]]s onto ships. The lyrics describe how daylight has come, their shift is over, and they want their work to be counted up so that they can go home.\n\nThe best-known version was released by American singer [[Harry Belafonte]] in 1956 and later became one of his signature songs. That same year [[The Tarriers]] released an alternative version that incorporated the chorus of another Jamaican [[folk song]], \"Hill and Gully Rider\". The Tarriers version was recorded by [[Shirley Bassey]] in 1957<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Shirley-Bassey-The-Banana-Boat-Song/master/1461636</ref> for her 1959 album ''[[The Bewitching Miss Bassey]]''.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Shirley-Bassey-The-Bewitching-Miss-Bassey/master/648488</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe song originated as a Jamaican folk song. It was thought to be sung by Jamaican banana workers, with a repeated melody and refrain ([[Call and response (music)|call and response]]); to each set lyric, the workers made a response. There were numerous versions of lyrics, some likely improvised on the spot by the singers. The song was probably created around the second half of the nineteenth century or the first half of the twentieth century, where there was [[History of Jamaica#Decline of the sugar industry|a rise of the banana trade in Jamaica]].\n\nThe song was first recorded by [[Trinidad]]ian singer [[Edric Connor]] and his band \"Edric Connor and the Caribbeans\" on the 1952 album ''Songs From Jamaica''; the song was called \"Day Dah Light\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentomusic.com/edricConner.htm |title=Edric Connor, Louise Bennett and Jamaican Folk Music |publisher=Mento Music |date= |accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref> Belafonte based his version on Connor's 1952 and [[Louise Bennett]]'s 1954 recordings.<ref>The Louise Bennett version of ''Day O (The Banana Boat Song)'' is available and documented in both French and English on the ''Jamaica &ndash; Mento 1951&ndash;1958'' album (2009)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fremeaux.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.livrets&content_id=5362&product_id=1176&category_id=128 |title=Fr\u00e9meaux & Associ\u00e9s \u00e9diteur, La Librairie Sonore |website=Fremeaux.com |date=1932-06-19 |accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, American singer-songwriters [[Lord Burgess]] and [[William Attaway]] wrote a version of the lyrics for ''[[the Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', in which the song was performed by [[Harry Belafonte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGSnsW6rA6EC&pg=PA186|title=Trinidad Carnival: The Cultural Politics of a Transnational Festival|first1=Garth L.|last1=Green|first2=Philip W.|last2=Scher|date=28 March 2007|page=186|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|accessdate=1 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Belafonte recorded the song for [[RCA Victor]]  and this is the version that is best known to listeners today, as it reached number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts in 1957 and later became Belafonte's [[signature song]]. Side two of Belafonte's 1956 ''Calypso'' album opens with \"Star O\", a song referring to the day shift ending when the first star is seen in the sky. During recording, when asked for its title, Harry spells, \"Day Done Light\".\n\nAlso in 1956, folk singer [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]], who had traveled to Jamaica and heard the song, taught his version to the folk band [[The Tarriers]]. They recorded a version of that song that incorporated the chorus of \"Hill and Gully Rider\", another Jamaican folk song. This release became their biggest hit, reaching number four on the pop charts, where it outperformed Belafonte's version. The Tarriers' version was recorded by [[Shirley Bassey]] in 1957 and it became a hit in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/The%20Banana%20Boat%20Song |title=ChartArchive - Shirley Bassey - The Banana Boat Song |website=Archive.is |date= |accessdate=2016-08-22 |df= }}</ref> The Tarriers, or some subset of the three members of the group ([[Erik Darling]], [[Bob Carey (musician)|Bob Carey]] and [[Alan Arkin]], later better known as an actor) are sometimes credited as the writers of the song; their version combined elements of another song and was thus newly created.\n\n== Covers ==\n* [[Sarah Vaughan]] recorded the song for [[Mercury Records]] in 1956.\n* [[The Fontane Sisters]] mimicked The Tarriers version in a recording of the song for [[Dot Records]] in 1956.

When he hears the lyric about the \"deadly black [[tarantula|taranch-la]]\" (actually the highly venomous [[Brazilian wandering spider]], commonly dubbed \"banana spider\"), the beatnik protests, \"No, man!

This song asks repetitively why bananas are bent. It reaches the conclusion that if the bananas weren't bent they wouldn't fit into their peels.\n* German band [[Trio (band)|Trio]] performed a parody where \"Bommerlunder\" (a German schnapps) substituted the words \"daylight come\" in the 1980s. In one rare occurrence, Trio and Harry Belafonte appeared in the same TV show, \"Bio's Bahnhof\", in 1982,  with the latter watching Trio's act in disbelief.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF8n9MDkXRw#t=525 |title=Trio bei Bio |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref>\n* The [[Serbia]]n comedy rock band [[The Kuguars]], consisting of famous Serbian actors, covered the song in 1998, with lyrics in [[Serbian language]] dedicated to the, at the time, [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] national [[soccer]] team player [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107|Dejan \"Dejo\" Savi\u0107evi\u0107]]. The song became a nationwide hit, and a promotional video for the song had been recorded.\n* In their 1994 album, the comedy music group [[Grup Vitamin]] included a Turkish cover of the song parodying the [[Machismo|macho culture]] in the country.\n*The Swedish humor show [[:sv:Rally (radioprogram)|Rally]], which aired between 1995 and 2002 in [[Sveriges Radio P3]] made a version called \"Hey Mr. Taliban\", which speaks about Osama Bin Laden with the lyrics \"Hey Mister Tallyman, tally me banana/Daylight come and me wan' go home\" replaced by \"Hey Mister Taliban, In Afghanistan/US Come and you wanna go home\" or \"Hey Mister Taliban! Turn over Bin Laden\" and \"Day-O! Daaaaay-O! Daylight come and me wan' go home\" is replaced by \"Day-O! Daaaay-O! Missile come and you wanna go home\".\n* Since 1988 British radio [[DJ]] and presenter [[Simon Mayo]] has used several variations of the song as jingles.

The song has [[mento]] influences, but it is commonly classified as an example of the better known [[calypso music]].\n\nIt is a [[work song]], from the point of view of dock workers working the night shift loading [[banana]]s onto ships. The lyrics describe how daylight has come, their shift is over, and they want their work to be counted up so that they can go home.\n\nThe best-known version was released by American singer [[Harry Belafonte]] in 1956 and later became one of his signature songs. That same year [[The Tarriers]] released an alternative version that incorporated the chorus of another Jamaican [[folk song]], \"Hill and Gully Rider\". The Tarriers version was recorded by [[Shirley Bassey]] in 1957<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Shirley-Bassey-The-Banana-Boat-Song/master/1461636</ref> for her 1959 album ''[[The Bewitching Miss Bassey]]''.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/Shirley-Bassey-The-Bewitching-Miss-Bassey/master/648488</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nThe song originated as a Jamaican folk song. It was thought to be sung by Jamaican banana workers, with a repeated melody and refrain ([[Call and response (music)|call and response]]); to each set lyric, the workers made a response. There were numerous versions of lyrics, some likely improvised on the spot by the singers. The song was probably created around the second half of the nineteenth century or the first half of the twentieth century, where there was [[History of Jamaica#Decline of the sugar industry|a rise of the banana trade in Jamaica]].\n\nThe song was first recorded by [[Trinidad]]ian singer [[Edric Connor]] and his band \"Edric Connor and the Caribbeans\" on the 1952 album ''Songs From Jamaica''; the song was called \"Day Dah Light\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentomusic.com/edricConner.htm |title=Edric Connor, Louise Bennett and Jamaican Folk Music |publisher=Mento Music |date= |accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref> Belafonte based his version on Connor's 1952 and [[Louise Bennett]]'s 1954 recordings.<ref>The Louise Bennett version of ''Day O (The Banana Boat Song)'' is available and documented in both French and English on the ''Jamaica &ndash; Mento 1951&ndash;1958'' album (2009)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fremeaux.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.livrets&content_id=5362&product_id=1176&category_id=128 |title=Fr\u00e9meaux & Associ\u00e9s \u00e9diteur, La Librairie Sonore |website=Fremeaux.com |date=1932-06-19 |accessdate=2016-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, American singer-songwriters [[Lord Burgess]] and [[William Attaway]] wrote a version of the lyrics for ''[[the Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', in which the song was performed by [[Harry Belafonte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dGSnsW6rA6EC&pg=PA186|title=Trinidad Carnival: The Cultural Politics of a Transnational Festival|first1=Garth L.|last1=Green|first2=Philip W.|last2=Scher|date=28 March 2007|page=186|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|accessdate=1 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Belafonte recorded the song for [[RCA Victor]]  and this is the version that is best known to listeners today, as it reached number five on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts in 1957 and later became Belafonte's [[signature song]]. Side two of Belafonte's 1956 ''Calypso'' album opens with \"Star O\", a song referring to the day shift ending when the first star is seen in the sky. During recording, when asked for its title, Harry spells, \"Day Done Light\".\n\nAlso in 1956, folk singer [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]], who had traveled to Jamaica and heard the song, taught his version to the folk band [[The Tarriers]]. They recorded a version of that song that incorporated the chorus of \"Hill and Gully Rider\", another Jamaican folk song. This release became their biggest hit, reaching number four on the pop charts, where it outperformed Belafonte's version. The Tarriers' version was recorded by [[Shirley Bassey]] in 1957 and it became a hit in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/The%20Banana%20Boat%20Song |title=ChartArchive - Shirley Bassey - The Banana Boat Song |website=Archive.is |date= |accessdate=2016-08-22 |df= }}</ref> The Tarriers, or some subset of the three members of the group ([[Erik Darling]], [[Bob Carey (musician)|Bob Carey]] and [[Alan Arkin]], later better known as an actor) are sometimes credited as the writers of the song; their version combined elements of another song and was thus newly created.\n\n== Covers ==\n* [[Sarah Vaughan]] recorded the song for [[Mercury Records]] in 1956.\n* [[The Fontane Sisters]] mimicked The Tarriers version in a recording of the song for [[Dot Records]] in 1956.

When he hears the lyric about the \"deadly black [[tarantula|taranch-la]]\" (actually the highly venomous [[Brazilian wandering spider]], commonly dubbed \"banana spider\"), the beatnik protests, \"No, man!

He writes in several genres but is known best for his [[science fiction]] works. His novel ''[[Ender's Game]]'' (1985) and its sequel ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' (1986) have won both [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award]]s, making Card the first author to [[List of joint winners of the Hugo and Nebula awards|win the two top American prizes in science fiction literature]] in consecutive years. A [[Ender's Game (film)|feature film adaptation of ''Ender's Game'']], which Card co-produced, was released in 2013. Card also wrote the [[Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel|Locus Fantasy Award]]-winning series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' (1987\u20132003).\n\nCard, who is a great-great-grandson of [[Brigham Young]], was born in [[Richland, Washington]], and grew up in [[Utah]] and [[California]]. While he was a student at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), his plays were performed on stage. He served in Brazil as a missionary for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and headed a community theater for two summers. Card had twenty-seven short stories published between 1978 and 1979, and won the [[Astounding Award for Best New Writer|John W. Campbell Award for best new writer]] in 1978. He earned a master's degree in English from the [[University of Utah]] in 1981 and wrote novels in science fiction, fantasy, non-fiction, and historical fiction genres in the 1980s. Card continued to write prolifically, and published [[Orson Scott Card bibliography|over 50 novels]] and over 45 short stories.<ref name=mapsinmirror/>\n\nCard's works were influenced by classic literature, popular fantasy, and science fiction; he often uses tropes from [[genre fiction]]. His background as a screenwriter helped Card make his works accessible and character-focused, though some critics dislike his characterization. Card's early fiction is original but contains graphic violence. His fiction often features characters with exceptional gifts who make difficult choices, often with the fate of an entire people at stake. Card has also written political, religious, and social commentary in his columns and other writing. Card's opposition to homosexuality has provoked public criticism and in 2013 it prompted a boycott of the film ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]''.\n\nCard is a professor of [[English (subject)|English]] at [[Southern Virginia University]]; he has written two books on [[creative writing]] and serves as a judge in the [[Writers of the Future]] contest. He is a practicing member of LDS Church and has taught many successful writers at his \"literary boot camps\"; [[Mormon fiction|LDS fiction]] writers [[Stephenie Meyer]], [[Brandon Sanderson]], and [[Dave Wolverton]] have cited his works as a major influence.\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood and education===\n[[File:Scott Card.jpg|thumb|Card (right) signing autographs at [[New York Comic Con]] in 2008]]\nOrson Scott Card was born on August 24, 1951, in [[Richland, Washington]].{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=165}} He is the son of Peggy Jane (n\u00e9e Park) and Willard Richards Card, and is the third of six children and the older brother of composer and arranger [[Arlen Card]].{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=77}} Card's family has [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon pioneer]] heritage;  [[Brigham Young]], one of his great-great-grandfathers, was the second president of the LDS Church and led the Mormon pioneers west to [[Salt Lake City]], where they settled. [[Charles Ora Card]], who founded the first Mormon settlement in Canada, was Card's great-grandfather from his paternal line who married Brigham Young's daughter [[Zina P. Young Card]]. Their daughter [[Zina Young Card Brown]] married [[Hugh B. Brown]], who was a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] and the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=13}}\n\nWhen Card was one month old, his family moved to [[San Mateo, California]] so Willard Card could begin a sign-painting business. When he was three years old, the family moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], so his father could finish his bachelor's degree. The family moved to [[Santa Clara, California]] when Card was six; they stayed there for seven years while his father completed his master's degree and worked as a professor at [[San Jose State University|San Jose State College]]. In school, Card took classes for gifted students but he was more interested in studying music\u2014he played clarinet and French horn. Card read texts that included historical novels by [[Elswyth Thane]] and [[Mark Twain]]. He credits ''[[Tunesmith]]'' by [[Lloyd Biggle Jr]]. as having a large effect on his life.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xv}} At age ten, Card wrote his first story, which was about an intelligent child who is assaulted by bullies and sustains [[brain damage]]. Card submitted the story to two magazines but it was not published, though Ender's confrontation with Stilson in ''[[Ender's Game]]'' is based on this story.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvi}}\n \nIn 1964, Card and his family moved to [[Mesa, Arizona]], where he participated in mock debates in junior high school. In 1967, the family moved to [[Orem, Utah]], where his father worked at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). Card attended BYU's laboratory school, where he took both high school and early college-level classes. At first he intended to major in anthropology but after becoming increasingly more interested in theater, he began script-writing, writing ten original plays and rewriting other students' plays. Most of his plays were based on Mormon history and scriptures; one was science fiction. Card said script-writing developed his writing skills because he could tell when an audience was interested in his scripts by their body language.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvi}} During his studies as a theater major, he began doctoring scripts, adapting fiction for [[Reader's theatre|reader's theater]] production, and writing one-act and full-length plays, several of which were produced by faculty directors at BYU.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=36\u201337}} [[Charles W.

He defended his choices and said speculative fiction is the genre best suited to exploring theological and moral issues.{{sfn|England|1994|pp=59\u201361}} While women are not prominent in the Book of Mormon, Card makes them prominent in his retelling.{{sfn|England|1994|pp=70\u201371}} One non-LDS critic described the saga as \"readable\" but lacking in new ideas.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=185}} Unaware of its relation to ''The Book of Mormon'', another critic said it is similar to the Bible.{{sfn|Reid|1998|p=50}}\n\n===Style===\nBecause Card began his writing career in screenplays, his early work is accessible, fast-paced, and has good characters but is stylistically unremarkable. His tone has been described as emotionless or conversely, as nonjudgmental, leaving readers to come to their own conclusions about how to feel about a story.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134\u2013135}} Though Card was initially classified as a [[hard science fiction]] writer for publishing in [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']],{{sfn|Westfahl|2005|p=197}} his science fiction focuses more on his characters than on the details of future technology.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134\u2013135}} One critic said Card is poor at characterization, stating the characters Peter and Valentine in ''Ender's Game'' are \"totally unbelievable\".{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=130}} Many of Card's early stories are unusually original.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|pp=181\u2013182}} The graphic violence in his early fiction was controversial; frequent appearances of naked men and boys have raised \"questions about homoerotic imagery\" according to Westfahl.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=179}} Collings, a critic who acknowledges his \"unabashed appreciation\" of Card,{{sfn|Collings|2001|p=11}} states the early stories are \"essential steps in the development of Card's fiction\".{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=22\u201323}} Card uses a technique common in [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] when he refers to characters by a quirk of their appearance or personality.<ref name=CluteSF/> Card's fantasy stories also use tropes that are common to fantasy.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|pp=160\u2013161}}\n\nCard cites ''The Book of Mormon'' as an important influence on his writing; his habit of beginning sentences with [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s comes from the book.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=22}} Literary devices in ''Hot Sleep'' parallel those of ''The Book of Mormon''.{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=61\u201363}} Collings said ''Hot Sleep''{{'s}} mimicry of Book of Mormon language makes it an \"inherently\" Mormon novel. Card combined several Worthing stories and revised ''Hot Sleep'' to create ''The Worthing Chronicle'', which does not mirror the language of the Book of Mormon as much as ''Hot Sleep'' does.{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=64; 67}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe original short story ''Ender's Game'' is reminiscent of Heinlein's young-adult novels because it is about a young person with impressive gifts who is guided by a stern mentor whose choices affect all of humanity.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|pp=181\u2013182}} The situations and choices in the ''Ender'' series invoke a number of philosophical topics, including the rules of war, embodiment psychology, the ethics of anthropology and [[xenology]], and the morality of manipulating children.{{sfn|WittkowerRush|2013|p=35; 48; 65; 112}} Though Card described ''Happy Head'' (1978) as an embarrassment, it anticipated [[cyberpunk]] fiction with an investigator judge who can experience memories with witnesses. Both ''A Thousand Deaths'' (1978) and ''Unaccompanied Sonata'' feature protagonists who rebel against the dystopias they inhabit.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=180}}\n\nCard's works usually feature characters with exceptional abilities who achieve their destiny \"through discipline and suffering\".{{sfn|Beswick|1989|p=52}} Often, his gifted protagonists are introspective children.{{sfn|Lupoff|1991|pp=120\u2013121}} Card's work features children and adults working together; usually fiction focuses on either adults or children separate from each another.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=179}} His characters feel \"real\" and must grow and take on responsibilities, and must often sacrifice themselves to improve their own societies.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134\u2013135}} This sacrifice is a difficult choice in which none of the options are obviously good.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=157}}  These protagonists have unusual abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. The protagonists, who are isolated from family and friends, relate better to adults than to other young people; when they grow up, they often mentor other precocious youths.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=158}}{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=15}} Alvin Maker follows this pattern; his magical abilities are very unusual and he uses them to redeem his people.{{sfn|Samuelson|1996|p=912}}\n\nAccording to Collings, Card's protagonists are \"lonely and manipulative Messiah-figures\" who make sacrifices that can be interpreted as a declaration of principles. Family and community problems arise when individuals are not fully accepted or when communities do not work with others in larger units.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=94}}<ref name=CluteSF/> Often one group tries to kill or enslave another group but their conflict is alleviated when they try to understand each other.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|pp=159\u2013160}} Protagonists make choices that save a person or a group of people.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=157}} In ''The Porcelain Salamander'', a girl is saved by a magical salamander; this action restores her ability to move but she takes on some attributes of the salamander.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=95\u201396}} In ''Kingsmeat'' the Shepherd painlessly excises meat from humans to save them from being completely eaten by their alien overlords. The violence of removing parts of people is like the violence of repentance.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=96\u201398}} Collings states part of this story \"could serve as an epigram of all Card's fictions; trapped within a circle of opposing forces, one focal character must decide whether or not to become, like Ender Wiggin, 'something of a savior, or a prophet, or at least a martyr'{{sp}}.\"{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=36}}\n\n==Views==\nIn the 1980s, Card held several \"Secular Humanist Revival Meetings\" at science fiction conventions, satirizing Evangelical revival meetings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Program Information - Bobs Slacktime Funhouse: BSTF 917 - Orson Scott Card's SECULAR HUMANIST REVIVAL MEETING{{!}}A-Infos Radio Project |url=http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/60671 |website=www.radio4all.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Card |first1=Orson Scott |title=The secular, humanist revival meeting |url=https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/cat.2628512.with.31197217122594?holding=csnmvi1574eb8q7d |website=search.lib.byu.edu}}</ref><ref name=locus/> Since 2001, Card's commentary includes the political columns \"War Watch\",<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Andrew |title=This Week in Mormon Literature, November 9, 2013 |url=http://associationmormonletters.org/blog/2013/11/this-week-in-mormon-literature-november-9-2013/ |website=Dawning of a Brighter Day: Twenty-First Century Mormon Literature |publisher=Association of Mormon Letters |accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> \"World Watch\",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stover Jr |first1=George M. |title=Integrity in Crisis: The Rise & Fall of the American Republic |date=2012 |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781619965287 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzrbiYzxFgcC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=Orson+Scott+Card+%22World+Watch%22&source=bl&ots=x8XYCGvj_8&sig=ACfU3U1-SBHNj-OuDZOXMd8VhqqYxDz-uQ&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUq-Ogue_kAhUiCTQIHdM_DoY4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Orson%20Scott%20Card%20%22World%20Watch%22&f=false}}</ref> or \"Civilization Watch\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Horn |first1=John |title=\"Ender's Game\" author compares Obama to Hitler |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-xpm-2013-aug-15-la-et-mn-enders-game-orson-card-obama-hitler-20130815-story.html |accessdate=26 September 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 15, 2013}}</ref> and \"Uncle Orson Reviews Everything\", all of which are published in the Greensboro ''[[Rhinoceros Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=Bob |title=The Rhinoceros Times going out of business after 20 years |url=https://myfox8.com/2013/04/30/the-rhinoceros-times-going-out-of-business-after-20-years/ |accessdate=26 September 2019 |work=Fox 8 |date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> \"Uncle Orson Reviews Everything\" features personal reviews of films and commentary on other topics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Tim |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10401422/Enders-Game-will-the-film-be-derailed-by-the-authors-homophobia.html |title=Ender's Game: will the film be derailed by the author's homophobia?

He writes in several genres but is known best for his [[science fiction]] works. His novel ''[[Ender's Game]]'' (1985) and its sequel ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' (1986) have won both [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award]]s, making Card the first author to [[List of joint winners of the Hugo and Nebula awards|win the two top American prizes in science fiction literature]] in consecutive years. A [[Ender's Game (film)|feature film adaptation of ''Ender's Game'']], which Card co-produced, was released in 2013. Card also wrote the [[Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel|Locus Fantasy Award]]-winning series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' (1987\u20132003).\n\nCard, who is a great-great-grandson of [[Brigham Young]], was born in [[Richland, Washington]], and grew up in [[Utah]] and [[California]]. While he was a student at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), his plays were performed on stage. He served in Brazil as a missionary for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and headed a community theater for two summers. Card had twenty-seven short stories published between 1978 and 1979, and won the [[Astounding Award for Best New Writer|John W. Campbell Award for best new writer]] in 1978. He earned a master's degree in English from the [[University of Utah]] in 1981 and wrote novels in science fiction, fantasy, non-fiction, and historical fiction genres in the 1980s. Card continued to write prolifically, and published [[Orson Scott Card bibliography|over 50 novels]] and over 45 short stories.<ref name=mapsinmirror/>\n\nCard's works were influenced by classic literature, popular fantasy, and science fiction; he often uses tropes from [[genre fiction]]. His background as a screenwriter helped Card make his works accessible and character-focused, though some critics dislike his characterization. Card's early fiction is original but contains graphic violence. His fiction often features characters with exceptional gifts who make difficult choices, often with the fate of an entire people at stake. Card has also written political, religious, and social commentary in his columns and other writing. Card's opposition to homosexuality has provoked public criticism and in 2013 it prompted a boycott of the film ''[[Ender's Game (film)|Ender's Game]]''.\n\nCard is a professor of [[English (subject)|English]] at [[Southern Virginia University]]; he has written two books on [[creative writing]] and serves as a judge in the [[Writers of the Future]] contest. He is a practicing member of LDS Church and has taught many successful writers at his \"literary boot camps\"; [[Mormon fiction|LDS fiction]] writers [[Stephenie Meyer]], [[Brandon Sanderson]], and [[Dave Wolverton]] have cited his works as a major influence.\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood and education===\n[[File:Scott Card.jpg|thumb|Card (right) signing autographs at [[New York Comic Con]] in 2008]]\nOrson Scott Card was born on August 24, 1951, in [[Richland, Washington]].{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=165}} He is the son of Peggy Jane (n\u00e9e Park) and Willard Richards Card, and is the third of six children and the older brother of composer and arranger [[Arlen Card]].{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=77}} Card's family has [[Mormon pioneers|Mormon pioneer]] heritage;  [[Brigham Young]], one of his great-great-grandfathers, was the second president of the LDS Church and led the Mormon pioneers west to [[Salt Lake City]], where they settled. [[Charles Ora Card]], who founded the first Mormon settlement in Canada, was Card's great-grandfather from his paternal line who married Brigham Young's daughter [[Zina P. Young Card]]. Their daughter [[Zina Young Card Brown]] married [[Hugh B. Brown]], who was a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] and the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of the LDS Church.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=13}}\n\nWhen Card was one month old, his family moved to [[San Mateo, California]] so Willard Card could begin a sign-painting business. When he was three years old, the family moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], so his father could finish his bachelor's degree. The family moved to [[Santa Clara, California]] when Card was six; they stayed there for seven years while his father completed his master's degree and worked as a professor at [[San Jose State University|San Jose State College]]. In school, Card took classes for gifted students but he was more interested in studying music\u2014he played clarinet and French horn. Card read texts that included historical novels by [[Elswyth Thane]] and [[Mark Twain]]. He credits ''[[Tunesmith]]'' by [[Lloyd Biggle Jr]]. as having a large effect on his life.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xv}} At age ten, Card wrote his first story, which was about an intelligent child who is assaulted by bullies and sustains [[brain damage]]. Card submitted the story to two magazines but it was not published, though Ender's confrontation with Stilson in ''[[Ender's Game]]'' is based on this story.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvi}}\n \nIn 1964, Card and his family moved to [[Mesa, Arizona]], where he participated in mock debates in junior high school. In 1967, the family moved to [[Orem, Utah]], where his father worked at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). Card attended BYU's laboratory school, where he took both high school and early college-level classes. At first he intended to major in anthropology but after becoming increasingly more interested in theater, he began script-writing, writing ten original plays and rewriting other students' plays. Most of his plays were based on Mormon history and scriptures; one was science fiction. Card said script-writing developed his writing skills because he could tell when an audience was interested in his scripts by their body language.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=xvi}} During his studies as a theater major, he began doctoring scripts, adapting fiction for [[Reader's theatre|reader's theater]] production, and writing one-act and full-length plays, several of which were produced by faculty directors at BYU.{{sfn|Willett|2006|pp=36\u201337}} [[Charles W.

Eugene England called the first five novels \"good literature\". Card received criticism from members of the LDS church for \"plagiarizing\" the Book of Mormon and using it irreverently. He defended his choices and said speculative fiction is the genre best suited to exploring theological and moral issues.{{sfn|England|1994|pp=59\u201361}} While women are not prominent in the Book of Mormon, Card makes them prominent in his retelling.{{sfn|England|1994|pp=70\u201371}} One non-LDS critic described the saga as \"readable\" but lacking in new ideas.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=185}} Unaware of its relation to ''The Book of Mormon'', another critic said it is similar to the Bible.{{sfn|Reid|1998|p=50}}\n\n===Style===\nBecause Card began his writing career in screenplays, his early work is accessible, fast-paced, and has good characters but is stylistically unremarkable. His tone has been described as emotionless or conversely, as nonjudgmental, leaving readers to come to their own conclusions about how to feel about a story.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134\u2013135}} Though Card was initially classified as a [[hard science fiction]] writer for publishing in [[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|''Analog'']],{{sfn|Westfahl|2005|p=197}} his science fiction focuses more on his characters than on the details of future technology.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134\u2013135}} One critic said Card is poor at characterization, stating the characters Peter and Valentine in ''Ender's Game'' are \"totally unbelievable\".{{sfn|Nicol|1992|p=130}} Many of Card's early stories are unusually original.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|pp=181\u2013182}} The graphic violence in his early fiction was controversial; frequent appearances of naked men and boys have raised \"questions about homoerotic imagery\" according to Westfahl.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=179}} Collings, a critic who acknowledges his \"unabashed appreciation\" of Card,{{sfn|Collings|2001|p=11}} states the early stories are \"essential steps in the development of Card's fiction\".{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=22\u201323}} Card uses a technique common in [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] when he refers to characters by a quirk of their appearance or personality.<ref name=CluteSF/> Card's fantasy stories also use tropes that are common to fantasy.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|pp=160\u2013161}}\n\nCard cites ''The Book of Mormon'' as an important influence on his writing; his habit of beginning sentences with [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s comes from the book.{{sfn|Willett|2006|p=22}} Literary devices in ''Hot Sleep'' parallel those of ''The Book of Mormon''.{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=61\u201363}} Collings said ''Hot Sleep''{{'s}} mimicry of Book of Mormon language makes it an \"inherently\" Mormon novel. Card combined several Worthing stories and revised ''Hot Sleep'' to create ''The Worthing Chronicle'', which does not mirror the language of the Book of Mormon as much as ''Hot Sleep'' does.{{sfn|Collings|2014|pp=64; 67}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe original short story ''Ender's Game'' is reminiscent of Heinlein's young-adult novels because it is about a young person with impressive gifts who is guided by a stern mentor whose choices affect all of humanity.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|pp=181\u2013182}} The situations and choices in the ''Ender'' series invoke a number of philosophical topics, including the rules of war, embodiment psychology, the ethics of anthropology and [[xenology]], and the morality of manipulating children.{{sfn|WittkowerRush|2013|p=35; 48; 65; 112}} Though Card described ''Happy Head'' (1978) as an embarrassment, it anticipated [[cyberpunk]] fiction with an investigator judge who can experience memories with witnesses. Both ''A Thousand Deaths'' (1978) and ''Unaccompanied Sonata'' feature protagonists who rebel against the dystopias they inhabit.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=180}}\n\nCard's works usually feature characters with exceptional abilities who achieve their destiny \"through discipline and suffering\".{{sfn|Beswick|1989|p=52}} Often, his gifted protagonists are introspective children.{{sfn|Lupoff|1991|pp=120\u2013121}} Card's work features children and adults working together; usually fiction focuses on either adults or children separate from each another.{{sfn|Westfahl|1998|p=179}} His characters feel \"real\" and must grow and take on responsibilities, and must often sacrifice themselves to improve their own societies.{{sfn|Bleiler|1989|p=134\u2013135}} This sacrifice is a difficult choice in which none of the options are obviously good.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=157}}  These protagonists have unusual abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. The protagonists, who are isolated from family and friends, relate better to adults than to other young people; when they grow up, they often mentor other precocious youths.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=158}}{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=15}} Alvin Maker follows this pattern; his magical abilities are very unusual and he uses them to redeem his people.{{sfn|Samuelson|1996|p=912}}\n\nAccording to Collings, Card's protagonists are \"lonely and manipulative Messiah-figures\" who make sacrifices that can be interpreted as a declaration of principles. Family and community problems arise when individuals are not fully accepted or when communities do not work with others in larger units.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=94}}<ref name=CluteSF/> Often one group tries to kill or enslave another group but their conflict is alleviated when they try to understand each other.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|pp=159\u2013160}} Protagonists make choices that save a person or a group of people.{{sfn|Tyson|2003|p=157}} In ''The Porcelain Salamander'', a girl is saved by a magical salamander; this action restores her ability to move but she takes on some attributes of the salamander.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=95\u201396}} In ''Kingsmeat'' the Shepherd painlessly excises meat from humans to save them from being completely eaten by their alien overlords. The violence of removing parts of people is like the violence of repentance.{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=96\u201398}} Collings states part of this story \"could serve as an epigram of all Card's fictions; trapped within a circle of opposing forces, one focal character must decide whether or not to become, like Ender Wiggin, 'something of a savior, or a prophet, or at least a martyr'{{sp}}.\"{{sfn|Collings|2014|p=36}}\n\n==Views==\nIn the 1980s, Card held several \"Secular Humanist Revival Meetings\" at science fiction conventions, satirizing Evangelical revival meetings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Program Information - Bobs Slacktime Funhouse: BSTF 917 - Orson Scott Card's SECULAR HUMANIST REVIVAL MEETING{{!}}A-Infos Radio Project |url=http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/60671 |website=www.radio4all.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Card |first1=Orson Scott |title=The secular, humanist revival meeting |url=https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/cat.2628512.with.31197217122594?holding=csnmvi1574eb8q7d |website=search.lib.byu.edu}}</ref><ref name=locus/> Since 2001, Card's commentary includes the political columns \"War Watch\",<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Andrew |title=This Week in Mormon Literature, November 9, 2013 |url=http://associationmormonletters.org/blog/2013/11/this-week-in-mormon-literature-november-9-2013/ |website=Dawning of a Brighter Day: Twenty-First Century Mormon Literature |publisher=Association of Mormon Letters |accessdate=26 September 2019}}</ref> \"World Watch\",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stover Jr |first1=George M. |title=Integrity in Crisis: The Rise & Fall of the American Republic |date=2012 |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781619965287 |page=73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VzrbiYzxFgcC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=Orson+Scott+Card+%22World+Watch%22&source=bl&ots=x8XYCGvj_8&sig=ACfU3U1-SBHNj-OuDZOXMd8VhqqYxDz-uQ&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUq-Ogue_kAhUiCTQIHdM_DoY4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Orson%20Scott%20Card%20%22World%20Watch%22&f=false}}</ref> or \"Civilization Watch\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Horn |first1=John |title=\"Ender's Game\" author compares Obama to Hitler |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-xpm-2013-aug-15-la-et-mn-enders-game-orson-card-obama-hitler-20130815-story.html |accessdate=26 September 2019 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 15, 2013}}</ref> and \"Uncle Orson Reviews Everything\", all of which are published in the Greensboro ''[[Rhinoceros Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=Bob |title=The Rhinoceros Times going out of business after 20 years |url=https://myfox8.com/2013/04/30/the-rhinoceros-times-going-out-of-business-after-20-years/ |accessdate=26 September 2019 |work=Fox 8 |date=April 30, 2013}}</ref> \"Uncle Orson Reviews Everything\" features personal reviews of films and commentary on other topics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin |first=Tim |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10401422/Enders-Game-will-the-film-be-derailed-by-the-authors-homophobia.html |title=Ender's Game: will the film be derailed by the author's homophobia?

During the [[American Revolution]], Newburgh served as the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]].

The area that became Newburgh was first explored by Europeans when [[Henry Hudson]] stopped by during his 1609 expedition up the river that now bears his name. His navigator, Robert Juet, is said to have called the site \"a pleasant place to build a town\",<ref name=con>[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/city-history/pages/early-days \"City History\", City of Newburgh]</ref> although some later historians believe he may actually have been referring to the area where [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]] now stands.\n\nAround 1683 [[Province of New York|provincial governor]] [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan]] purchased the land from the Woaranek people. The first settlement was made in the spring of 1709 by fifty-four [[Palatinate region|Palatine refugees]], sponsored by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne of Great Britain]]. The settlers named it the Palatine Parish by Quassic. In 1743 a ferry at the foot of First Street had been established between Newburgh and Fishkill Landing (now [[Beacon, New York]]).<ref name=Barrett/> In 1752 the land had been surveyed by [[Cadwallader Colden]] and named \"Newburgh\" after Newburgh in his native Scotland.<ref name=con/> Shipyards were established and docks and warehouses lined the waterfront.\n\nNewburgh was the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]] from March 1782 until late 1783.<ref name=con/> While the army was camped at Newburgh, some of its senior officers began the \"[[Newburgh conspiracy]]\" to overthrow the government. General [[George Washington]] was able to persuade his officers to stay loyal to him. The army was disbanded here in 1783. Washington received the famous [[Newburgh letter]] from [[Lewis Nicola]] proposing that he become [[monarch|king]] here. It drew a vigorous rebuke from Washington. In honor of his refusal of that suggestion, Kings Highway, the north\u2013south street on which the Newburgh headquarters is located, was renamed Liberty Street.<ref name=hsn>[http://www.newburghhistoricalsociety.com/history/newburgh-history/ \"Newburgh History\", Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands]</ref>\n\n=== Municipal growth ===\n[[File:1842 engraving of Newburgh, NY.jpg|thumb|Woodcut of Newburgh skyline from Hudson in 1842, with [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], then with its original dome and lantern]]\n[[File:Water Street, Newburgh, N.Y. det.4a13482.jpg|thumb|Water Street in Newburgh, photo taken circa 1906; the buildings on the street were demolished as part of urban renewal efforts in the 1960s and 1970]][[File:Newburgh NY Columbus Statue.JPG|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] Statue on Newburgh's Waterfront]]\nThe year 1793 saw Newburgh's first newspaper, ''The Newburgh Packet''. The hamlet of Newburgh was incorporated as a village in 1800. At the time of its settlement it was in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] and was that county's seat. When [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] was split from Orange County in 1798, Newburgh and the other towns north of [[Moodna Creek]] were put in a redrawn Orange County. Newburgh thus lost its status as the county seat to [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]]. The former Ulster County courthouse still stands as Newburgh's old city courthouse building (currently used as municipal office space).\n\nBy 1793 there were four sloop lines operating out of Newburgh. As new turnpikes opened trade extended into the interior, passenger coaches and farm wagons raveled as far west as [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]. This was the shortest route from the Hudson to [[Western New York]]. By 1819 a steamboat on [[Cayuga Lake]] connected Newburgh stage lines with Ithaca. Streets leading to the river were often blocked for hours with farmers' wagons waiting to be unloaded at the wharves. With the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] much of the traffic from the [[Southern Tier]] was diverted. In 1830 Richard Carpenter of Newburgh had the steamboat ''William Young'' built at [[Chelsea, Dutchess County, New York|Low Point]]; it ran between Newburgh and Albany.<ref name=\"Nutt\">Nutt, John J., ''Newburgh, her Institutions, Industries, and Leading citizens'', Ritchie & Hull, Newburgh, NY, 1891</ref> Prosperity returned with the arrival of the railroads.\n\nOn the evening of September 24, 1824, beacon fires in the [[Hudson Highlands]] announced the arrival of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|the Marquis de Lafayette]]. Having been feted in New York, he sailed upriver on the chartered steamer ''James Kent''. The next day, people came from the surrounding towns to catch a glimpse of the general as he made his way to a reception at the Orange Hotel. The Rev. John Brown of St. George's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] was part of the welcoming committee. At 2&nbsp;am., Lafayette sailed from Reeve & Falls dock for Poughkeepsie.<ref name=\"Nutt\" />\n\nThe [[Erie Railroad]] charter was amended April 8, 1845, to allow the building of the Newburgh Branch, running from the main line near Harriman north-northeast to Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. The branch opened January 8, 1850.<ref name=\"Nutt\" /> It was later used as a connection to the [[New York and New England Railroad]] via a car float operation across the river to [[Beacon, New York]].\n\nNewburgh was chartered as a city in April 1865.\n\nNewburgh became quite prosperous during the [[Gilded Age]] that followed. Newburgh had telephone service in 1879.<ref name=\"Barrett\" /> In 1883 there was a steamboat landing on Second Street. The United States Hotel was on Front Street opposite the landing.

In October 1939, [[RCA]] chose to test-market televisions in Newburgh, which was within range of the television signal of RCA's experimental station [[W2XBS]]. 600 sets were sold in Newburgh at a deep discount. The test-marketing campaign's success encouraged RCA to go forward with developing the new medium. Additionally, with consumer television production ceasing during [[World War II]], those Newburgh households which purchased televisions during 1939 and 1940 were among the few to enjoy television (albeit with a greatly reduced programming schedule) during the war.<ref>von Schilling, James, ''The Magic Window: American Television, 1939\u20131953'' New York: Haworth Press, 2003</ref>\n\nNewburgh was one of the first cities in the country to fluoridate its water in 1945.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Mullen J  |title=History of water fluoridation |journal=Br Dent J |volume=199 |issue=7s |pages=1\u20134 |year=2005 |pmid=16215546 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4812863 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finn |first1=Sindey |title=Progress Report on Newburgh-Kingston N.Y.

The Hudson River, which previously served as the main means of transporting goods, lost much of its shipping traffic to [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking]]. The city's trolley system was shut down in 1924 in favor of buses. The nation moved to the automobile for transportation and, as with many other cities, there was a resulting [[Suburbanization|migration to the suburbs]]. In 1963 the [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Bridge]] was opened, carrying [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] and spanning the Hudson River, bypassing the Newburgh waterfront and the city of Newburgh altogether. The ferry closed down soon thereafter\u2014it was not [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Ferry|revived]] until 2005\u2014and the waterfront area declined rapidly.\n\nIn 1962, Lloyd's Department Store became the first major shopping center in Newburgh. Its motto was \"Years Ahead\". Many features of Lloyd's, including widely divergent ministores under one roof, did not become common in other shopping centers for many decades. Lloyd's successfully drew a great deal of retail business away from the downtown area. In 1964, the Mid Valley Mall opened, also outside of the city limits in Newburgh, and attracted many long-established local businesses away from the waterfront and downtown city of Newburgh. Other retail shopping malls soon sprang up, all also outside the city of Newburgh, and the retail industry of the city declined further. The city continued to lose its previously well regarded retail sector along Water Street and Broadway to the suburban shopping malls, which did not share the city's congested parking and traffic problems or the perceived rising crime rate.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the city's response to the economic decline was an ambitious [[urban renewal]] plan. The city's historic waterfront area, an area composed of several square blocks which included numerous historically significant buildings, was completely [[demolition|demolished]] between 1970 and 1973. Residents were relocated, or were supposed to be relocated, to newer [[housing project]]s around Muchattoes Lake in the city's interior.\n\nA grand complex that was planned for the urban renewal area was never built when state and federal spending began to dry up after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. To this day, the blocks which slope down to the river remain open, grassy slopes, offering sweeping views of the Hudson but generating no [[property tax]]es for the city. Public sentiment is mixed on whether they should be built on again at all, and the city's view-protection ordinances make it less likely. Below, the waterfront was developed in the late 1990s after the city was once again able to secure grants from the state's Environmental Protection fund for [[riprap]] (a type of stone) to stabilize the shoreline.\n\n[[File:Joseph Mitchell NBC White Paper 3.jpg|thumb|right|City manager Joseph Mitchell attending the Newburgh City Council in 1961]]\nIn the early 1960s, city manager [[Joseph McDowell Mitchell]] and the council attracted nationwide attention and the admiration of political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] when they attempted to require welfare recipients to pick up their payments at police headquarters. Mitchell later announced a program aimed largely at Blacks and African Americans on welfare, whom many in the community blamed for its economic problems. The program would have denied welfare payments to all after three months except the aged, the blind and the handicapped. Those affected would have largely been single mothers of young children, the only category in which blacks were predominant. After opposition by both state and federal officials, the program created a national controversy and never went into effect. Along with the failed urban renewal, the mid to late 1960s in Newburgh were also marked by [[Ethnic conflict|race riots]] and other tensions.\n\nNewburgh in the early 21st century is more racially diverse than it used to be, as a growing [[Latin American]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]] population (mainly of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent) complements the city's sizable [[African Americans|African American]] contingent. [[Economic development]] has been a major concern, but poorly realized, as the good jobs once found in the local manufacturing sector have not been replaced. Pockets of [[poverty]] persist in the city, often mere blocks away from its many historical and architectural [[landmark]]s. In addition to this, the city has been facing issues regarding [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], like many other cities across the United States, ranging from overcrowded apartment buildings to mild racial conflict.\n\nIn spite of this Newburgh is experiencing a spurt of new businesses on its historic Liberty Street near Washington's Headquarters. An art supply store, a gourmet food market, an antiques store, a used furniture shop, a souvenir shop, a flower shop, a bakery and a restaurant have joined an existing caf\u00e9, a graphic design shop and two additional antiques stores in the final months of 2008 and January 2009. This is all in the midst of the redevelopment of East Parmenter Street in a partnership with [[Habitat for Humanity]] and a private developer to build 24 new houses. The city has completed the overhaul of the infrastructure of the street.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Newburgh from the bridge.jpg|thumb|View of Newburgh from the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]], 2006|alt=A city on a slope over a body of water with larger buildings at the left and center right.

The Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands was chartered by the State of New York and incorporated in 1884. The [[David Crawford House]] on Montgomery Street, built in 1834, is the current home of the Newburgh Historical Society.\n\nThe city's modern preservation efforts began when the [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] structure designed by [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], was slated for demolition as part of urban renewal after the congregation left the decaying building in 1967. The movement to stop it led to the development of [[Montgomery\u2013Grand\u2013Liberty Streets Historic District|a historic district]], now the second largest in New York State. The church was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] three years later, and in 2001 became the city's second [[National Historic Landmark]] after Washington's Headquarters.\n\nThe city was designated a Preserve America community in 2005 and it also signed an agreement with the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|State Office of Historic Preservation]] as a Certified Local Government community.

In 1852 land was purchased for a cemetery at the corner of First and Stone streets. The rectory was built in 1854.

In 1966 Father John Filippelli of the [[Society of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart]] initiated a Spanish Mass as well as cultural celebrations such as the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Three Kings]]. In 1973, Fr. Rogelio Cuesta, OP was named Director of the Hispanic Apostolate of Newburgh and Beacon. Other patronal feasts were celebrated such as Our Lady of Charity from Cuba, Se\u00f1or de los Milagros of Peru, and Our Lady of Suyapa of Honduras, reflecting the diversity of the community.

Rev. Michael J. Phelan was appointed pastor, and said his first mass in the parish on Easter Sunday, 1875, in the opera-house. The Wilson property at Gidney Avenue and South Street was purchased and mass celebrated in the mansion on the premises. In May following a temporary frame building for church purposes was erected. In 1880 the building occupied by the church until 2015 was erected.  It was dedicated by Archbishop McCloskey on Sunday, October 3. The Academy of Our Lady of Mercy (a branch convent of the Sisters of Mercy of New York), which was opened at Balmville in the summer of 1875.<ref>Ruttenber, Edward Manning.

John C Henry appointed rector and opened St. Mary's Parochial School on September 1, 1886. under the direction of four Sisters of St. Dominic.<ref name=\"Nutt\" />\n\nIn 2005, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York decided to close St. Mary's Church as a cost saving measure. The people of the parish, and of the Newburgh community as a whole, rose up in protest and the Archdiocese withdrew the proposal. Then, in the summer of 2015, the archdiocese proposed closing the parish yet again, and while the community protests eclipsed those of 2005, this time the proposal was carried through. St. Mary's Parish was merged with St. Patrick's effective August 1, 2015. The church building was shuttered and closed and has not been used since that date. Father William Scafidi, the pastor and arguably the most popular community leader in Newburgh at that time, was transferred by the Archdiocese to a parish church in [[Liberty, New York]].\n\n==== St. Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church ====\nIn December 1908, Father Francis Fabian, pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish in Rondout visited Newburgh. Seeing that there the city had only two churches serving a large Catholic population, Fr. Fabian began to look into establishing another parish. Meetings were held and funds were raised and on April 22, 1909, Archbishop [[John Murphy Farley|John Farley]] of New York appointed Fr Fabian pastor of the new congregation. Land was purchased at Benkard Avenue and Avoca Street and by May a temporary chapel was started.<ref name=\"Lafort\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA399 Lafort, Remigius.

The bricks were donated by nearby brickyards and transported from the different yards to the dock in Newburgh free of charge. Gustave Fettweise donated a bell. The church was completed on August 15, 1909, and a rectory completed that same year. The parish grew so rapidly that two-year later excavation was begun for a new stone church on a hill east of the rectory. Services were continued in the old chapel until September 1, 1913 when the new church was dedicated. The interior has beautiful Bavarian stained glass windows and a large mural behind the altar that was painted in Bavaria. The Tracker organ was built in 1862. It has 2600 pipes and two keyboards.

The parish became separate from St. Patrick's on September 8, 1912. Land was purchased on the southeast corner of Robinson Avenue and Ann Street. A temporary chapel situated in a vacant store at 286 Washington Street was used until the church was completed. The first Mass was celebrated in the new church on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1913.{{sfn|LaFort p.419}} Rev. Cyrus Falco was the pastor who guided the parish through the trying years of the Great Depression. In 1933 he invited the Sisters of St. Dominic to take charge of our parish Sunday School. Rev. John B. Caldarola was pastor during World War II.<ref name=\"shcn\">[http://sacredheartnewburgh.org/history \"Our History\", Sacred Heart Catholic Church]</ref>\n\nRev. Salvatore Celauro became pastor in 1947. The groundbreaking ceremony for the parish school was held on April 23, 1950 and school opened on September 9, 1951. In the mid-1950s it became apparent that a new church was needed as repairs would not be cost-effective. Work began in May 1963 and the first Mass in the new church was said on Christmas Eve, 1964. In September 1967 Rev. Salvatore Cantatore was named pastor of Sacred Heart and in October 1978, opened the Sacred Heart Parish Center. Msgr. George J. Valastro became pastor in 1981 and saw the parish celebrate its o75th Anniversary in 1987. Msgr. Valastro purchased the building at 319 Broadway which became the Activity Center.<ref name=\"shcn\" />\n\n==Economy==\nNewburgh was once a major economic hub between New York City and the New York State capital of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. Partly due to [[suburbanization]] and other economic factors the city suffered an economic decline from the 1960s to first quarter of the 21st century. Currently over 11,400 residents are employed within the city limits.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe largest industries as of 2020 were [[retail]], [[Health care in the United States|healthcare]] and social assistance, [[Foodservice|food services]], [[finance]], [[public administration]], and [[For-profit education|educational services]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://datausa.io/profile/geo/newburgh-ny|title=Newburgh, NY {{!}} Data USA|website=datausa.io |access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref> Being in close proximity to other major [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] cities, it serves as a significant location for [[Stop & Shop]], [[M&T Bank]], [[Chase Bank]], [[Verizon Communications]], [[Charter Communications]], [[Dunkin' Donuts|Dunkin']], [[McDonald's]], [[Metro by T-Mobile]], [[Boost Mobile]], and [[Marshalls]]. The city's economy is also stimulated by several hospitals and educational institutions including the [[Veterans Health Administration|VA Hudson Valley Heathcare System]], the [[Newburgh Enlarged City School District]], and [[SUNY Orange]].\n\n== Media ==\nNewburgh is within the [[media market]] of New York City and [[Middletown, Orange County, New York|Middletown]]. It is served by ''[[Times Herald-Record|The Times Herald-Record]]'', ''The Hudson Valley Press'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[El Diario La Prensa]]'', ''[[New York Post|The New York Post]]'', and other newspapers local to the area.

This ultimately led to a major reorganization of the school system. Newburgh is served by the [[Newburgh Enlarged City School District]].<ref>[http://www.newburghschools.org/newburgh/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716004100/http://www.newburghschools.org/newburgh/index.html |date=July 16, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe local high school is called [[Newburgh Free Academy]], and it is the largest public high school in Orange County. It serves approximately 3,000 students in grades 9\u201312 from the Newburgh area. Newburgh Free Academy is currently split into three campuses, with NFA Main located on Fullerton Avenue, NFA North located on Robinson Avenue a few blocks away, and NFA West located on West Street. Between the three campuses, there are roughly over 4,300 students enrolled. Two colleges are located in Newburgh, [[Mount Saint Mary College]] and the Newburgh campus of [[SUNY Orange]].\n\n== Public safety ==\n\n=== Police ===\nNewburgh's early police department consisted of twenty-two officers. On April 6, 1869 the Newburgh Police Department was authorized with regulations by the Common Council Ordinance. The first headquarters of the department was on First Street between Montgomery and Smith Street. Its current headquarters is located in the Newburgh City Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/police/pages/history|title=History {{!}} Newburgh NY|website=www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Fire ===\nThe city of Newburgh is protected by the firefighters of the City of Newburgh Fire Department which operates out of two citywide firehouses. The department runs a frontline apparatus fleet of four engine companies (including two reserve engines), two ladder companies (including one reserve ladder), one fire boat, one fire alarm truck, and seven support units. It also houses and runs one of the Orange County Technical Rescue trailers as well as a foam trailer as part of the NYS Foam Task Force.\n\nNewburgh's fire department is one of the oldest chartered departments in New York State being established by an act of the young state legislature on March 24, 1797. The earliest Newburgh fire companies were the Protection Engine Company, Cataract Engine Co., Washington Engine Co., and Empire Hook & Ladder. More appeared as neighborhoods expanded. The department purchased its first steam engine in 1872. In its inaugural test, the engine threw a stream of water over the top of the cross of St. Patrick's Church, 161 feet high, to the delight of the citizens watching. The first firefighter to die in the line of duty, Joseph Tillotson, burned to death in a fire at The Bleachery on Lake Street in 1887. In March 1889, the city purchased and installed a modern electric telegraph fire alarm system with 23 alarm boxes placed around the city, these boxes are still in service today. As horses were phased out of service, Ringgold Hose on Colden Street was the first of Newburgh's companies to get a motorized fire truck in 1907. As early as 1915, editorials were calling for the establishment of a paid fire department to assure the response necessary for a densely populated and heavily commercial and industrial city like Newburgh. Beginning with drivers, tillermen and then officers, paid positions for full-time firemen were gradually created for each company. In 1934, the volunteer companies disbanded, and a professional department was instituted by resolution of the City Council. Protection has a cost. Eight men have perished in the line of duty during the department's history: Joseph Tillotson, Willis Meginn, James Hunter, Moses Embler, Armand Santacroce, Edward Maney, Frederick Carpenter and Patrick Bardin.<ref name=\"Newburgh Fire History\">[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211144153/http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm |date=February 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nNewburgh was ranked more dangerous than 95 percent of US cities by website ''[[NeighborhoodScout]]'', based on 2012 FBI crime data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/newburgh/crime/ |title=Newburgh NY crime rates and statistics |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> This group also ranked Newburgh as the 10th most dangerous place to live in the United States based on the same 2012 dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2013/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2013 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> It was ranked at number 12 in the previous year's rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2012/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2012 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, ''The New York Times'' wrote an extensive article on gang activity in Newburgh.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/nyregion/12newburgh.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=In Newburgh, Gangs and Violence Reign|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Newburgh began implementing a program called \"Group Violence Intervention,\" an example of focused deterrence.<ref>https://nnscommunities.org/impact/city/newburgh</ref> In 2017, Newburgh reported the lowest crime rates in 10 years.<ref>http://www.recordonline.com/news/20180123/newburgh-crime-rates-lowest-in-over-10-years</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Broadway, Newburgh NY.jpg|thumb|right|Lower Broadway, 2006]]\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please note that vandalism of this page will not be tolerated; this includes unregistered IP addresses.\nVandalism includes adding of your own views, deleting large sections of text, and inserting manifestly false information.

Allegations of [[electoral fraud]] had dogged the city's first African American woman mayor, Audrey Carey, since her 1991 victory in a four-way race. Supporters of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Regina Angelo alleged that many registered voters in neighborhoods Carey had carried heavily used false addresses. In response, four years later deputy [[sheriff]]s were stationed at polling places and challenged voters to provide proof of residency and identity. Although she won, Carey's supporters claimed that the deputy sheriffs had singled out minority voters for such challenges, and accused the Republicans of [[voter suppression]]. These tensions were only aggravated when the council selected the city's Republican chairman at the time, Harry Porr, as the new city manager. Carey was defeated by Tyrone Crabb, a black man running on the Republican line, in 1999. Porr was fired, rehired and fired again in 2001. Crabb died suddenly of a heart attack ten days before he was slated to take office. The vacancy was filled by his widow, Mary.\n\nDespite demographics and urban trends favoring [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the voters of the city had until recent years regularly voted across party lines. Nicholas Valentine, mayor from 2003 until 2011 and several other recent mayors and council members were Republicans. The late [[Thomas Kirwan]]\u2014a resident who served in the [[New York State Assembly]] until 2008\u2014and was re-elected in a successful comeback bid in 2010, by one of the smallest margins in state history (15 votes), was a Republican. He died late in 2011. On March 20, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in which former Assemblyman [[Frank Skartados]], Democrat, won by a large margin. In the general election held in November 2011, a newcomer to the city named Judith Kennedy was overwhelmingly elected Mayor over incumbent Republican Councilwoman Christine Bello. In addition, the Democratic candidates for Council seats, Gay Lee and Cedric Brown, were also overwhelmingly elected. Accordingly, the council is now 5-0 Democrat\u2014the first time in recorded history one party monopolizes the Newburgh city government.\n\nAn independent documentary was made in 2004 about the mayoral race in Newburgh, called ''[[Saving Newburgh]]''.\n\nIn 2009, the Republican party did not field its own candidates for city council. Instead the Republican Committee endorsed two Democrats\u2014one a former councilman, the other an incumbent councilwoman\u2014and they were not opposed for the Republican nomination in the primary despite their being registered Democrats. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] and [[Independence Party of New York|Independence]] parties both nominated them also. They lost the Democratic primary and despite their appearing on three party lines they lost the November election to two straight Democrats, both one time Republicans.<ref>Certified election returns available from the Orange County Board of Elections.</ref>\n\nNewburgh declared itself a [[sanctuary city]] in March 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.recordonline.com/news/20170313/newburgh-council-approves-sanctuary-city-immigration-policy|title=Newburgh Council approves 'sanctuary city' immigration policy|last=Sparks|first=Leonard|date=March 13, 2017|website=recordonline.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nDelano-Hitch formerly served as the home field for the [[Newburgh Black Diamonds]] and [[Newburgh Nighthawks]] baseball teams.\n\nThe [[Hudson Valley Renegades]] are a minor league baseball team affiliated with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]].

During the [[American Revolution]], Newburgh served as the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]]. Prior to its chartering in 1865, the city of Newburgh was part of the [[Newburgh (town), New York|town of Newburgh]]; the town now borders the city to the north and west.

The area that became Newburgh was first explored by Europeans when [[Henry Hudson]] stopped by during his 1609 expedition up the river that now bears his name. His navigator, Robert Juet, is said to have called the site \"a pleasant place to build a town\",<ref name=con>[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/city-history/pages/early-days \"City History\", City of Newburgh]</ref> although some later historians believe he may actually have been referring to the area where [[Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York|Cornwall-on-Hudson]] now stands.\n\nAround 1683 [[Province of New York|provincial governor]] [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan]] purchased the land from the Woaranek people. The first settlement was made in the spring of 1709 by fifty-four [[Palatinate region|Palatine refugees]], sponsored by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne of Great Britain]]. The settlers named it the Palatine Parish by Quassic. In 1743 a ferry at the foot of First Street had been established between Newburgh and Fishkill Landing (now [[Beacon, New York]]).<ref name=Barrett/> In 1752 the land had been surveyed by [[Cadwallader Colden]] and named \"Newburgh\" after Newburgh in his native Scotland.<ref name=con/> Shipyards were established and docks and warehouses lined the waterfront.\n\nNewburgh was the headquarters of the [[Continental Army]] from March 1782 until late 1783.<ref name=con/> While the army was camped at Newburgh, some of its senior officers began the \"[[Newburgh conspiracy]]\" to overthrow the government. General [[George Washington]] was able to persuade his officers to stay loyal to him. The army was disbanded here in 1783. Washington received the famous [[Newburgh letter]] from [[Lewis Nicola]] proposing that he become [[monarch|king]] here. It drew a vigorous rebuke from Washington. In honor of his refusal of that suggestion, Kings Highway, the north-south street on which the Newburgh headquarters is located, was renamed Liberty Street.<ref name=hsn>[http://www.newburghhistoricalsociety.com/history/newburgh-history/ \"Newburgh History\", Historical Society of Newburgh Bay and the Highlands]</ref>\n\n=== Municipal growth ===\n[[File:1842 engraving of Newburgh, NY.jpg|thumb|Woodcut of Newburgh skyline from Hudson in 1842, with [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], then with its original dome and lantern]]\n[[File:Water Street, Newburgh, N.Y. det.4a13482.jpg|thumb|Water Street in Newburgh, photo taken circa 1906; the buildings on the street were demolished as part of urban renewal efforts in the 1960s and 1970]][[File:Newburgh NY Columbus Statue.JPG|thumb|[[Christopher Columbus]] Statue on Newburgh's Waterfront]]\nThe year 1793 saw Newburgh's first newspaper, ''The Newburgh Packet''. The hamlet of Newburgh was incorporated as a village in 1800. At the time of its settlement it was in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] and was that county's seat. When [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]] was split from Orange County in 1798, Newburgh and the other towns north of [[Moodna Creek]] were put in a redrawn Orange County. Newburgh thus lost its status as the county seat to [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]]. The former Ulster County courthouse still stands as Newburgh's old city courthouse building (currently used as municipal office space).\n\nBy 1793 there were four sloop lines operating out of Newburgh. As new turnpikes opened trade extended into the interior, passenger coaches and farm wagons raveled as far west as [[Canandaigua (city), New York|Canandaigua]]. This was the shortest route from the Hudson to [[Western New York]]. By 1819 a steamboat on [[Cayuga Lake]] connected Newburgh stage lines with Ithaca. Streets leading to the river were often blocked for hours with farmers' wagons waiting to be unloaded at the wharves. With the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] much of the traffic from the [[Southern Tier]] was diverted. In 1830 Richard Carpenter of Newburgh had the steamboat ''William Young'' built at [[Chelsea, Dutchess County, New York|Low Point]]; it ran between Newburgh and Albany.<ref name=\"Nutt\">Nutt, John J., ''Newburgh, her Institutions, Industries, and Leading citizens'', Ritchie & Hull, Newburgh, NY, 1891</ref> Prosperity returned with the arrival of the railroads.\n\nOn the evening of September 24, 1824, beacon fires in the [[Hudson Highlands]] announced the arrival of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|the Marquis de Lafayette]]. Having been feted in New York, he sailed upriver on the chartered steamer ''James Kent''. The next day, people came from the surrounding towns to catch a glimpse of the general as he made his way to a reception at the Orange Hotel. The Rev. John Brown of St. George's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] was part of the welcoming committee. At 2&nbsp;am., Lafayette sailed from Reeve & Falls dock for Poughkeepsie.<ref name=\"Nutt\" />\n\nThe [[Erie Railroad]] charter was amended April 8, 1845, to allow the building of the Newburgh Branch, running from the main line near Harriman north-northeast to Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. The branch opened January 8, 1850.<ref name=\"Nutt\" /> It was later used as a connection to the [[New York and New England Railroad]] via a car float operation across the river to [[Beacon, New York]].\n\nNewburgh was chartered as a city in April 1865.\n\nNewburgh became quite prosperous during the [[Gilded Age]] that followed. Newburgh had telephone service in 1879.<ref name=\"Barrett\" /> In 1883 there was a steamboat landing on Second Street. The United States Hotel was on Front Street opposite the landing.

In October 1939, [[RCA]] chose to test-market televisions in Newburgh, which was within range of the television signal of RCA's experimental station [[W2XBS]]. 600 sets were sold in Newburgh at a deep discount. The test-marketing campaign's success encouraged RCA to go forward with developing the new medium. Additionally, with consumer television production ceasing during [[World War II]], those Newburgh households which purchased televisions during 1939 and 1940 were among the few to enjoy television (albeit with a greatly reduced programming schedule) during the war.<ref>von Schilling, James, ''The Magic Window: American Television, 1939\u20131953'' New York: Haworth Press, 2003</ref>\n\nNewburgh was one of the first cities in the country to fluoridate its water in 1945.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=Mullen J  |title=History of water fluoridation |journal=Br Dent J |volume=199 |issue=7s |pages=1\u20134 |year=2005 |pmid=16215546 |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4812863 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finn |first1=Sindey |title=Progress Report on Newburgh-Kingston N.Y.

The Hudson River, which previously served as the main means of transporting goods, lost much of its shipping traffic to [[Trucking industry in the United States|trucking]]. The city's trolley system was shut down in 1924 in favor of buses. The nation moved to the automobile for transportation and, as with many other cities, there was a resulting [[Suburbanization|migration to the suburbs]]. In 1963 the [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Bridge]] was opened, carrying [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]] and spanning the Hudson River, bypassing the Newburgh waterfront and the city of Newburgh altogether. The ferry closed down soon thereafter\u2014it was not [[Newburgh\u2013Beacon Ferry|revived]] until 2005\u2014and the waterfront area declined rapidly.\n\nIn 1962, Lloyd's Department Store became the first major shopping center in Newburgh. Its motto was \"Years Ahead\". Many features of Lloyd's, including widely divergent ministores under one roof, did not become common in other shopping centers for many decades. Lloyd's successfully drew a great deal of retail business away from the downtown area. In 1964, the Mid Valley Mall opened, also outside of the city limits in Newburgh, and attracted many long-established local businesses away from the waterfront and downtown city of Newburgh. Other retail shopping malls soon sprang up, all also outside the city of Newburgh, and the retail industry of the city declined further. The city continued to lose its previously well regarded retail sector along Water Street and Broadway to the suburban shopping malls, which did not share the city's congested parking and traffic problems or the perceived rising crime rate.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the city's response to the economic decline was an ambitious [[urban renewal]] plan. The city's historic waterfront area, an area composed of several square blocks which included numerous historically significant buildings, was completely [[demolition|demolished]] between 1970 and 1973. Residents were relocated, or were supposed to be relocated, to newer [[housing project]]s around Muchattoes Lake in the city's interior.\n\nA grand complex that was planned for the urban renewal area was never built when state and federal spending began to dry up after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. To this day, the blocks which slope down to the river remain open, grassy slopes, offering sweeping views of the Hudson but generating no [[property tax]]es for the city. Public sentiment is mixed on whether they should be built on again at all, and the city's view-protection ordinances make it less likely. Below, the waterfront was developed in the late 1990s after the city was once again able to secure grants from the state's Environmental Protection fund for [[riprap]] (a type of stone) to stabilize the shoreline.\n\n[[File:Joseph Mitchell NBC White Paper 3.jpg|thumb|right|City manager Joseph Mitchell attending the Newburgh City Council in 1961]]\nIn the early 1960s, city manager [[Joseph McDowell Mitchell]] and the council attracted nationwide attention and the admiration of political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] when they attempted to require welfare recipients to pick up their payments at police headquarters. Mitchell later announced a program aimed largely at Blacks and African Americans on welfare, whom many in the community blamed for its economic problems. The program would have denied welfare payments to all after three months except the aged, the blind and the handicapped. Those affected would have largely been single mothers of young children, the only category in which blacks were predominant. After opposition by both state and federal officials, the program created a national controversy and never went into effect. Along with the failed urban renewal, the mid to late 1960s in Newburgh were also marked by [[Ethnic conflict|race riots]] and other tensions.\n\nNewburgh in the early 21st century is more racially diverse than it used to be, as a growing [[Latin American]] [[Immigration to the United States|immigrant]] population (mainly of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] descent) complements the city's sizable [[African Americans|African American]] contingent. [[Economic development]] has been a major concern, but poorly realized, as the good jobs once found in the local manufacturing sector have not been replaced. Pockets of [[poverty]] persist in the city, often mere blocks away from its many historical and architectural [[landmark]]s. In addition to this, the city has been facing issues regarding [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]], like many other cities across the United States, ranging from overcrowded apartment buildings to mild racial conflict.\n\nIn spite of this Newburgh is experiencing a spurt of new businesses on its historic Liberty Street near Washington's Headquarters. An art supply store, a gourmet food market, an antiques store, a used furniture shop, a souvenir shop, a flower shop, a bakery and a restaurant have joined an existing caf\u00e9, a graphic design shop and two additional antiques stores in the final months of 2008 and January 2009. This is all in the midst of the redevelopment of East Parmenter Street in a partnership with [[Habitat for Humanity]] and a private developer to build 24 new houses. The city has completed the overhaul of the infrastructure of the street.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Newburgh from the bridge.jpg|thumb|View of Newburgh from the [[Newburgh-Beacon Bridge]], 2006|alt=A city on a slope over a body of water with larger buildings at the left and center right.

The [[David Crawford House]] on Montgomery Street, built in 1834, is the current home of the Newburgh Historical Society.\n\nThe city's modern preservation efforts began when the [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], a [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] structure designed by [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], was slated for demolition as part of urban renewal after the congregation left the decaying building in 1967. The movement to stop it led to the development of [[Montgomery\u2013Grand\u2013Liberty Streets Historic District|a historic district]], now the second largest in New York State. The church was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] three years later, and in 2001 became the city's second [[National Historic Landmark]] after Washington's Headquarters.\n\nThe city was designated a Preserve America community in 2005 and it also signed an agreement with the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation|State Office of Historic Preservation]] as a Certified Local Government community.

Rev. Michael J. Phelan was appointed pastor, and said his first mass in the parish on Easter Sunday, 1875, in the opera-house. The Wilson property at Gidney Avenue and South Street was purchased and mass celebrated in the mansion on the premises. In May following a temporary frame building for church purposes was erected. In 1880 the building occupied by the church until 2015 was erected.  It was dedicated by Archbishop McCloskey on Sunday, October 3.

The people of the parish, and of the Newburgh community as a whole, rose up in protest and the Archdiocese withdrew the proposal. Then, in the summer of 2015, the archdiocese proposed closing the parish yet again, and while the community protests eclipsed those of 2005, this time the proposal was carried through. St. Mary's Parish was merged with St. Patrick's effective August 1, 2015. The church building was shuttered and closed and has not been used since that date. Father William Scafidi, the pastor and arguably the most popular community leader in Newburgh at that time, was transferred by the Archdiocese to a parish church in [[Liberty, New York]].\n\n==== St. Francis of Assisi Roman Catholic Church ====\nIn December 1908, Father Francis Fabian, pastor of Immaculate Conception Parish in Rondout visited Newburgh. Seeing that there the city had only two churches serving a large Catholic population, Fr. Fabian began to look into establishing another parish. Meetings were held and funds were raised and on April 22, 1909, Archbishop [[John Murphy Farley|John Farley]] of New York appointed Fr Fabian pastor of the new congregation.

The church was completed on August 15, 1909, and a rectory completed that same year. The parish grew so rapidly that two-year later excavation was begun for a new stone church on a hill east of the rectory. Services were continued in the old chapel until September 1, 1913 when the new church was dedicated. The interior has beautiful Bavarian stained glass windows and a large mural behind the altar that was painted in Bavaria. The Tracker organ was built in 1862. It has 2600 pipes and two keyboards. The interior was completely renovated in 2000.<ref name=\"sfcn\">{{Cite web |url=http://stfrancisnewburgh.com/pages/churchpage.asp |title=St. Francis Church, Newburgh |access-date=2015-10-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116044552/http://stfrancisnewburgh.com/pages/churchpage.asp |archive-date=2015-11-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church ====\nSacred Heart Parish traces its roots to when Rev. John B. Gallo came to Newburgh to minister to the spiritual needs of the Italian-speaking people who had been attending Mass at St. Patrick's Church. The parish became separate from St. Patrick's on September 8, 1912. Land was purchased on the southeast corner of Robinson Avenue and Ann Street. A temporary chapel situated in a vacant store at 286 Washington Street was used until the church was completed. The first Mass was celebrated in the new church on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1913.{{sfn|LaFort p.419}} Rev. Cyrus Falco was the pastor who guided the parish through the trying years of the Great Depression. In 1933 he invited the Sisters of St. Dominic to take charge of our parish Sunday School. Rev. John B. Caldarola was pastor during World War II.<ref name=\"shcn\">[http://sacredheartnewburgh.org/history \"Our History\", Sacred Heart Catholic Church]</ref>\n\nRev. Salvatore Celauro became pastor in 1947. The groundbreaking ceremony for the parish school was held on April 23, 1950 and school opened on September 9, 1951. In the mid-1950s it became apparent that a new church was needed as repairs would not be cost-effective. Work began in May 1963 and the first Mass in the new church was said on Christmas Eve, 1964. In September 1967 Rev. Salvatore Cantatore was named pastor of Sacred Heart and in October 1978, opened the Sacred Heart Parish Center. Msgr. George J. Valastro became pastor in 1981 and saw the parish celebrate its o75th Anniversary in 1987. Msgr.

It serves approximately 3,000 students in grades 9\u201312 from the Newburgh area. Newburgh Free Academy is currently split into three campuses, with NFA Main located on Fullerton Avenue, NFA North located on Robinson Avenue a few blocks away, and NFA West located on West Street. Between the three campuses, there are roughly over 4,300 students enrolled. Two colleges are located in Newburgh, [[Mount Saint Mary College]] and the Newburgh campus of [[SUNY Orange]].\n\n== Public safety ==\n\n=== Police ===\nNewburgh's early police department consisted of twenty-two officers. On April 6, 1869 the Newburgh Police Department was authorized with regulations by the Common Council Ordinance. The first headquarters of the department was on First Street between Montgomery and Smith Street. Its current headquarters is located in the Newburgh City Hall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/police/pages/history|title=History {{!}} Newburgh NY|website=www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov|access-date=2020-02-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Fire ===\nThe city of Newburgh is protected by the firefighters of the City of Newburgh Fire Department which operates out of two citywide firehouses. The department runs a frontline apparatus fleet of four engine companies (including two reserve engines), two ladder companies (including one reserve ladder), one fire boat, one fire alarm truck, and seven support units. It also houses and runs one of the Orange County Technical Rescue trailers as well as a foam trailer as part of the NYS Foam Task Force.\n\nNewburgh's fire department is one of the oldest chartered departments in New York State being established by an act of the young state legislature on March 24, 1797. The earliest Newburgh fire companies were the Protection Engine Company, Cataract Engine Co., Washington Engine Co., and Empire Hook & Ladder. More appeared as neighborhoods expanded. The department purchased its first steam engine in 1872. In its inaugural test, the engine threw a stream of water over the top of the cross of St. Patrick's Church, 161 feet high, to the delight of the citizens watching. The first firefighter to die in the line of duty, Joseph Tillotson, burned to death in a fire at The Bleachery on Lake Street in 1887. In March 1889, the city purchased and installed a modern electric telegraph fire alarm system with 23 alarm boxes placed around the city, these boxes are still in service today. As horses were phased out of service, Ringgold Hose on Colden Street was the first of Newburgh's companies to get a motorized fire truck in 1907. As early as 1915, editorials were calling for the establishment of a paid fire department to assure the response necessary for a densely populated and heavily commercial and industrial city like Newburgh. Beginning with drivers, tillermen and then officers, paid positions for full-time firemen were gradually created for each company. In 1934, the volunteer companies disbanded, and a professional department was instituted by resolution of the City Council. Protection has a cost. Eight men have perished in the line of duty during the department's history: Joseph Tillotson, Willis Meginn, James Hunter, Moses Embler, Armand Santacroce, Edward Maney, Frederick Carpenter and Patrick Bardin.<ref name=\"Newburgh Fire History\">[http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211144153/http://www.cityofnewburgh-ny.gov/fire/hist.htm |date=February 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crime ===\nNewburgh was ranked more dangerous than 95 percent of US cities by website ''[[NeighborhoodScout]]'', based on 2012 FBI crime data.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/newburgh/crime/ |title=Newburgh NY crime rates and statistics |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> This group also ranked Newburgh as the 10th most dangerous place to live in the United States based on the same 2012 dataset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2013/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2013 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref> It was ranked at number 12 in the previous year's rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/neighborhoods/crime-rates/top100dangerous2012/ |title=Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. \u2013 2012 |publisher=NeighborhoodScout |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, ''The New York Times'' wrote an extensive article on gang activity in Newburgh.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/nyregion/12newburgh.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=In Newburgh, Gangs and Violence Reign|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=2014-02-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Newburgh began implementing a program called \"Group Violence Intervention,\" an example of focused deterrence.<ref>https://nnscommunities.org/impact/city/newburgh</ref> In 2017, Newburgh reported the lowest crime rates in 10 years.<ref>http://www.recordonline.com/news/20180123/newburgh-crime-rates-lowest-in-over-10-years</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Broadway, Newburgh NY.jpg|thumb|right|Lower Broadway, 2006]]\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Please note that vandalism of this page will not be tolerated; this includes unregistered IP addresses.\nVandalism includes adding of your own views, deleting large sections of text, and inserting manifestly false information.

Allegations of [[electoral fraud]] had dogged the city's first African American woman mayor, Audrey Carey, since her 1991 victory in a four-way race. Supporters of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate Regina Angelo alleged that many registered voters in neighborhoods Carey had carried heavily used false addresses. In response, four years later deputy [[sheriff]]s were stationed at polling places and challenged voters to provide proof of residency and identity. Although she won, Carey's supporters claimed that the deputy sheriffs had singled out minority voters for such challenges, and accused the Republicans of [[voter suppression]]. These tensions were only aggravated when the council selected the city's Republican chairman at the time, Harry Porr, as the new city manager. Carey was defeated by Tyrone Crabb, a black man running on the Republican line, in 1999. Porr was fired, rehired and fired again in 2001. Crabb died suddenly of a heart attack ten days before he was slated to take office. The vacancy was filled by his widow, Mary.\n\nDespite demographics and urban trends favoring [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the voters of the city had until recent years regularly voted across party lines. Nicholas Valentine, mayor from 2003 until 2011 and several other recent mayors and council members were Republicans. The late [[Thomas Kirwan]]\u2014a resident who served in the [[New York State Assembly]] until 2008\u2014and was re-elected in a successful comeback bid in 2010, by one of the smallest margins in state history (15 votes), was a Republican. He died late in 2011. On March 20, a special election was held to fill the vacancy in which former Assemblyman [[Frank Skartados]], Democrat, won by a large margin. In the general election held in November 2011, a newcomer to the city named Judith Kennedy was overwhelmingly elected Mayor over incumbent Republican Councilwoman Christine Bello. In addition, the Democratic candidates for Council seats, Gay Lee and Cedric Brown, were also overwhelmingly elected. Accordingly, the council is now 5-0 Democrat\u2014the first time in recorded history one party monopolizes the Newburgh city government.\n\nAn independent documentary was made in 2004 about the mayoral race in Newburgh, called ''[[Saving Newburgh]]''.\n\nIn 2009, the Republican party did not field its own candidates for city council. Instead the Republican Committee endorsed two Democrats\u2014one a former councilman, the other an incumbent councilwoman\u2014and they were not opposed for the Republican nomination in the primary despite their being registered Democrats. The [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] and [[Independence Party of New York|Independence]] parties both nominated them also.
