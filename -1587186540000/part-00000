During the 1990\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s the Weevil Lane area became known as a hotbed for rampant homosexuality, the ringleader of which was no other than John \u2018Gypsy King\u2019 Hurlock but he was famously aided by Big Gay Al Sullivan and the biggest queen of them all, Owen \u2018the taker\u2019 Greenwood. At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.\n\nSeveral sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].\n\nThere has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.\n\n====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850\u201351====\nIn November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-\u0131 Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route.

At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.\n\nSeveral sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].\n\nThere has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.\n\n====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850\u201351====\nIn November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-\u0131 Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |title=Tram scheme to be formally abandoned |publisher=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112031656/http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |archivedate=12 January 2007 }}</ref> During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers.\n\n==Present day==\n[[File:Forton Bridge 2019.jpg|thumb|Forton Lake Millennium Bridge 2019]]\n\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] recorded 54,854 people in Gosport of working age between the ages of 16 and 74.

{"title_page": "Georgian affair", "text_new": "[[Image:Ordzhonikidze, Stalin and Mikoyan, 1925.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Anastas Mikoyan]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Grigol Ordzhonikidze]] in Tiflis (now [[Tbilisi]]), in 1925.]]\nThe '''Georgian affair of 1922''' ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e}}) was a political conflict within the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leadership about the way in which social and political transformation was to be achieved in the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]]. The dispute over Georgia, which arose shortly after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|forcible Sovietization of the country]] and peaked in the latter part of 1922, involved local Georgian [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] leaders, led by [[Filipp Makharadze]] and [[Budu Mdivani]], on one hand, and their ''[[de facto]]'' superiors from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], particularly [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Grigol Ordzhonikidze]], on the other hand. The content of this dispute was complex, involving the [[Georgians]]' desire to preserve autonomy from [[Moscow]] and the differing interpretations of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|Bolshevik nationality policies]], and especially those specific to Georgia. One of the main points at issue was Moscow's decision to amalgamate Georgia, [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]] into [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]], a move that was staunchly opposed by the Georgian leaders who urged for their republic a full-member status within the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe affair was a critical episode in the power struggle surrounding the sick [[Vladimir Lenin]], whose support Georgians sought to obtain. The dispute ended with the victory of the Stalin-Ordzhonikidze line and resulted in the fall of the Georgian moderate Communist government. It also contributed to a final break between Lenin and Stalin, and inspired Lenin's [[Lenin's Testament|last major writings]].<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Jeremy | year = 1998 | title = The Georgian Affair of 1922.

New York: Penguin Books, 2014. Pgs. 32-35</ref>\n\nBy 1904, however, influenced by Marxist writings, Stalin had moved toward repudiation of independent Georgian nationalism, as he outlined in his essay ''The Social-Democratic View on the National Question.''<ref>https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1904/09/01.htm</ref>\n\nStalin developed his views further in his 1913 pamphlet ''[[Marxism and the National Question]].'' The essay describes nationalism as an important force to be reckoned with that historically had arisen in tandem with the rise of capitalism and had gained a great deal of momentum in Russian border regions (including Georgia) following the fall of the tsarist autocracy, and attempted to strike a balance between a right of national self-determination as a legitimate response to oppressor chauvinism while also recognizing the potentially exploitative uses of nationalism as a means to divide the working class, to engage in actual oppression, or to cling to what Stalin viewed as outmoded cultural totems (derisively citing \"such 'national peculiarities' of the Georgians as the [[Feud|vendetta]]!\" as an example); similarly, it attempted to strike a balance between adherence to principles and the need to temporize according to particular circumstances.<ref>https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03a.htm</ref>\n\nIn the same essay, Stalin specifically describes problems related to \"cultural-national\" autonomy in the Caucasus region, including Georgia, referring to the possible organization both within and beyond that territory of ethnically defined institutions, objecting in part that such a project would be bound to failure by the region's kaleidoscopic ethnic diversity and also that it might lead to power-grabs by what he viewed as \"reactionary\" religious leaders.\n\nBy 1917, partly as a result of these efforts, Stalin became the recognized expert within the Russia Bolshevik Party on the National Question, and had risen to position of Commissar of Nationalities in the new Soviet government.<ref>Kotkin, pg. 349</ref>\n\n=== Diplomatic Backdrop ===\n\nThe establishment of the new RSFSR in 1917 (and, especially, the conclusion of the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]) touched off a flurry of diplomatic activity. Initially, relations between the Russian SFSR and other Soviet Socialist Republics were governed by a series of bilateral treaties, a state of affairs that the top Bolshevik leadership regarded as undesirable and unsustainable over a long period of time.\n\nShortly before the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Party Congress]] in March 1921, Stalin published theses emphasizing his view of the non-viability of bilateral treaties as a long-term solution, writing \"Not one Soviet republic taken separately can consider itself safe from economic exhaustion and military defeat by world imperialism. Therefore, the isolated existence of separate Soviet republics has no firm basis in view of the threats to their existence from the capitalist states....The national Soviet republics that have freed themselves from their own and from the foreign bourgeoisie will be able to defend their existence and conquer the united forces of imperialism only by joining in a close political union.\"<ref>Kotkin, pg. 386</ref>\n\nThe terms under which different SSRs might be incorporated into some larger body with the RSFR was, however, the subject of much debate.\n\n=== Bolshevik Takeover of Georgia ===\n\nSoviet rule in Georgia was established by the Soviet [[Red Army]] during the February\u2013March 1921 military campaign that was largely engineered by the two influential Georgian-born Soviet officials, Joseph Stalin, then [[Commissar#People's Commissar|People's Commissar]] for Nationalities for the RSFSR, and Grigol Ordzhonikidze, head of the [[Transcaucasia]]n Regional Committee (''Zaikkraikom'') of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]]. Disagreements among the Bolsheviks about the fate of Georgia preceded the Red Army invasion. While Stalin and Ordzhonikidze urged the immediate Sovietization of independent Georgia led by the [[Mensheviks|Menshevik]]-dominated government, Trotsky favored \"a certain preparatory period of work inside Georgia, in order to develop the uprising and later come to its aid\". Lenin was unsure about the outcome of the Georgian campaign, fearful of the international consequences and the possible crisis with [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Kemalist]] [[Turkey]]. Lenin finally gave his consent, on February 14, 1921, to the intervention in Georgia, but later repeatedly complained about the lack of precise and consistent information from the Caucasus.<ref name=\"SUNY1\">[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition'', pp. 210-212. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}</ref> Well aware of widespread opposition to the newly established Soviet rule, Lenin favored a reconciliatory policy with Georgian intelligentsia and peasants who remained hostile to the militarily imposed regime. However, many Communists found it difficult to abandon the methods used against their opposition during the [[Russian Civil War]] and make adjustment to the more flexible policy. For moderates like [[Filipp Makharadze]], Lenin's approach was a reasonable way to secure for Soviet power a broad base of support. They advocated tolerance toward the Menshevik opposition, greater democracy within the party, gradual land reform and, above all, respect for national sensitivities and Georgia's sovereignty from Moscow. Communists like Ordzhonikidze and Stalin pursued a more hard-line policy: they sought to eliminate completely political opposition and centralize party control over the newly Sovietized republics.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight, Ami W.

[[Princeton University Press]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]], {{ISBN|0-691-01093-5}}</ref><ref name=\"SUNY1\"/>\n\nConflict soon broke out between the moderate and hard-line Georgian Bolshevik leaders. The dispute was preceded by Stalin's ban on formation of the national Red Army of Georgia, and subordination of all local workers' organizations and [[trade union]]s to the Bolshevik party committees. Dissatisfied by the Soviet Georgian government's moderate treatment of the political opposition and its desire to retain sovereignty from Moscow, Stalin arrived in [[Tiflis|Tbilisi]], capital of Georgia, in early July 1921.

One of the most important points at issue was the question of Georgia's status in the projected union of Soviet republics. Over the objections of other Georgian Bolsheviks, Grigol Ordzhonikidze in late 1921 had set in motion the formation of a union of all three [[Transcaucasia]]n republics\u2014[[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]], and [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgia]]\u2014as a means of resolving simmering territorial and ethnic disputes, and with Stalin's strong backing insisted that this federation join the [[Soviet Union]] together as one federative republic. The Georgian Central Executive Committee, particularly Mdivani, vehemently disagreed with this proposal, desiring their country to retain a stronger individual identity and enter the union as a full member rather than as part of a single [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]]. (Ordzhonikidze's proposal, however, was passed at a Georgian Party Congress with support of rank-and-file delegates.)<ref>Kotkin, pg. 479</ref> Stalin and his aides accused the Georgian Central Executive Committee of selfish nationalism and labeled them as \"national deviationists\". On their part, the Georgian Central Executive Committee responded with charges of \"Great Russian chauvinism\". On October 21, 1922, Mdivani contacted Moscow to berate Ordzhonikidze in harsh terms. The same day, Lenin sent a telegram rebuking Mdivani, upholding Stalin's position, and expressing his strong support for the political and economic integration of the Transcaucasian republics, informing the Georgian leaders that he rejected their criticism of Moscow's bullying tactics.\n\nThe conflict peaked in November 1922, when Ordzhonikidze resorted to physical violence with a member of the Mdivani group and struck him during a verbal confrontation.<ref>Kort, M (2001), ''The Soviet Colossus'', p.154.

The dispute over Georgia, which arose shortly after the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|forcible Sovietization of the country]] and peaked in the latter part of 1922, involved local Georgian [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] leaders, led by [[Filipp Makharadze]] and [[Budu Mdivani]], on one hand, and their ''[[de facto]]'' superiors from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], particularly [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Grigol Ordzhonikidze]], on the other hand. The content of this dispute was complex, involving the [[Georgians]]' desire to preserve autonomy from [[Moscow]] and the differing interpretations of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|Bolshevik nationality policies]], and especially those specific to Georgia. One of the main points at issue was Moscow's decision to amalgamate Georgia, [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan]] into [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]], a move that was staunchly opposed by the Georgian leaders who urged for their republic a full-member status within the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe affair was a critical episode in the power struggle surrounding the sick [[Vladimir Lenin]], whose support Georgians sought to obtain. The dispute ended with the victory of the Stalin-Ordzhonikidze line and resulted in the fall of the Georgian moderate Communist government. It also contributed to a final break between Lenin and Stalin, and inspired Lenin's [[Lenin's Testament|last major writings]].<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Jeremy | year = 1998 | title = The Georgian Affair of 1922.

New York: Penguin Books, 2014. Pgs. 32-35</ref>\n\nBy 1904, however, influenced by Marxist writings, Stalin had moved toward repudiation of independent Georgian nationalism, as he outlined in his essay ''The Social-Democratic View on the National Question.''<ref>https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1904/09/01.htm</ref>\n\nStalin developed his views further in his 1913 pamphlet ''[[Marxism and the National Question]].'' The essay describes nationalism as an important force to be reckoned with that historically had arisen in tandem with the rise of capitalism and had gained a great deal of momentum in Russian border regions (including Georgia) following the fall of the tsarist autocracy, and attempted to strike a balance between a right of national self-determination as a legitimate response to oppressor chauvinism while also recognizing the potentially exploitative uses of nationalism as a means to divide the working class, to engage in actual oppression, or to cling to what Stalin viewed as outmoded cultural totems (derisively citing \"such 'national peculiarities' of the Georgians as the [[vendetta]]!\" as an example); similarly, it attempted to strike a balance between adherence to principles and the need to temporize according to particular circumstances.<ref>https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03a.htm</ref>\n\nIn the same essay, Stalin specifically describes problems related to \"cultural-national\" autonomy in the Caucasus region, including Georgia, referring to the possible organization both within and beyond that territory of ethnically defined institutions, objecting in part that such a project would be bound to failure by the region's kaleidoscopic ethnic diversity and also that it might lead to power-grabs by what he viewed as \"reactionary\" religious leaders.\n\nBy 1917, partly as a result of these efforts, Stalin became the recognized expert within the Russia Bolshevik Party on the National Question, and had risen to position of Commissar of Nationalities in the new Soviet government.<ref>Kotkin, pg. 349</ref>\n\n=== Diplomatic Backdrop ===\n\nThe establishment of the new RSFSR in 1917 (and, especially, the conclusion of the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]) touched off a flurry of diplomatic activity. Initially, relations between the Russian SFSR and other Soviet Socialist Republics were governed by a series of bilateral treaties, a state of affairs that the top Bolshevik leadership regarded as undesirable and unsustainable over a long period of time.\n\nShortly before the [[10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)|10th Party Congress]] in March 1921, Stalin published theses emphasizing his view of the non-viability of bilateral treaties as a long-term solution, writing \"Not one Soviet republic taken separately can consider itself safe from economic exhaustion and military defeat by world imperialism. Therefore, the isolated existence of separate Soviet republics has no firm basis in view of the threats to their existence from the capitalist states....The national Soviet republics that have freed themselves from their own and from the foreign bourgeoisie will be able to defend their existence and conquer the united forces of imperialism only by joining in a close political union.\"<ref>Kotkin, pg. 386</ref>\n\nThe terms under which different SSRs might be incorporated into some larger body with the RSFR was, however, the subject of much debate.\n\n=== Bolshevik Takeover of Georgia ===\n\nSoviet rule in Georgia was established by the Soviet [[Red Army]] during the February\u2013March 1921 military campaign that was largely engineered by the two influential Georgian-born Soviet officials, Joseph Stalin, then [[Commissar#People's Commissar|People's Commissar]] for Nationalities for the RSFSR, and Grigol Ordzhonikidze, head of the [[Transcaucasia]]n Regional Committee (''Zaikkraikom'') of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]]. Disagreements among the Bolsheviks about the fate of Georgia preceded the Red Army invasion. While Stalin and Ordzhonikidze urged the immediate Sovietization of independent Georgia led by the [[Mensheviks|Menshevik]]-dominated government, Trotsky favored \"a certain preparatory period of work inside Georgia, in order to develop the uprising and later come to its aid\". Lenin was unsure about the outcome of the Georgian campaign, fearful of the international consequences and the possible crisis with [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Kemalist]] [[Turkey]]. Lenin finally gave his consent, on February 14, 1921, to the intervention in Georgia, but later repeatedly complained about the lack of precise and consistent information from the Caucasus.<ref name=\"SUNY1\">[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition'', pp. 210-212. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}</ref> Well aware of widespread opposition to the newly established Soviet rule, Lenin favored a reconciliatory policy with Georgian intelligentsia and peasants who remained hostile to the militarily imposed regime. However, many Communists found it difficult to abandon the methods used against their opposition during the [[Russian Civil War]] and make adjustment to the more flexible policy. For moderates like [[Filipp Makharadze]], Lenin's approach was a reasonable way to secure for Soviet power a broad base of support. They advocated tolerance toward the Menshevik opposition, greater democracy within the party, gradual land reform and, above all, respect for national sensitivities and Georgia's sovereignty from Moscow. Communists like Ordzhonikidze and Stalin pursued a more hard-line policy: they sought to eliminate completely political opposition and centralize party control over the newly Sovietized republics.<ref name=\"Knight\">Knight, Ami W.

The dispute was preceded by Stalin's ban on formation of the national Red Army of Georgia, and subordination of all local workers' organizations and [[trade union]]s to the Bolshevik party committees. Dissatisfied by the Soviet Georgian government's moderate treatment of the political opposition and its desire to retain sovereignty from Moscow, Stalin arrived in [[Tiflis|Tbilisi]], capital of Georgia, in early July 1921.

Another major consequence of the defeat of Georgian \"national deviationists\" was the intensification of political repressions in Georgia, leading to an [[August Uprising|armed rebellion in August 1924]] and the ensuing [[Red Terror]], which took several thousands of lives.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}} \n*{{cite journal | author=[[Stephen F.

They then choose the most appropriate mapping of the spherical coordinate system onto that ellipsoid, called a terrestrial reference system or [[geodetic datum]].\n\nDatums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be local, meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal [[Earth tide|Earth tidal]] movement caused by the [[Moon]] and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to {{nowrap|10 cm}} a year, or {{nowrap|10 m}} in a century. A [[weather system]] high-pressure area can cause a sinking of {{nowrap|5 mm}}. [[Scandinavia]] is rising by {{nowrap|1 cm}} a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the [[quaternary glaciation|last ice age]], but neighboring [[Scotland]] is rising by only {{nowrap|0.2 cm}}. These changes are insignificant if a local datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used.<ref name=OSGB/>\n\nExamples of global datums include [[World Geodetic System]] (WGS 84, also known as EPSG:4326 <ref>https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/</ref>), the default datum used for the [[Global Positioning System]],{{NoteTag|WGS 84 is the default datum used in most GPS equipment, but other datums can be selected.}} and the [[International Terrestrial Reference Frame]] (ITRF), used for estimating [[continental drift]] and [[crustal deformation]].<ref name=Bolstad>{{cite book |last=Bolstad |first=Paul |title=GIS Fundamentals |edition = 5th |publisher=Atlas books|isbn=978-0-9717647-3-6 |page=102 |url = http://www.paulbolstad.net/5thedition/samplechaps/Chapter3_5th_small.pdf }}</ref> The distance to Earth's center can be used both for very deep positions and for positions in space.<ref name=OSGB/>\n\nLocal datums chosen by a national cartographical organization include the [[North American Datum]], the European [[ED50]], and the British [[OSGB36]].

The [[North Pole]] is 90\u00b0&nbsp;N; the [[South Pole]] is 90\u00b0&nbsp;S. The 0\u00b0 parallel of latitude is designated the [[Equator]], the [[fundamental plane (spherical coordinates)|fundamental plane]] of all geographic coordinate systems.

All meridians are halves of great [[ellipse]]s (often called [[great circle]]s), which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the [[UK|British]] [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]], in southeast London, England, is the international [[prime meridian]], although some organizations\u2014such as the French [[Institut G\u00e9ographique National]]\u2014continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The prime meridian determines the proper [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere]]s, although maps often divide these hemispheres further west in order to keep the [[Old World]] on a single side. The [[Antipodes|antipodal]] meridian of Greenwich is both 180\u00b0W and 180\u00b0E. This is not to be conflated with the [[International Date Line]], which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western [[Aleutian Islands]].\n\nThe combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of [[altitude]] or depth.

The datum, along with a map projection applied to a grid of reference locations, establishes a ''grid system'' for plotting locations. Common map projections in current use include the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system|Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM), the [[Military Grid Reference System]] (MGRS), the [[United States National Grid]] (USNG), the [[Global Area Reference System]] (GARS) and the [[World Geographic Reference System]] (GEOREF).<ref name=NGA_grids>{{cite web |title=Grids and Reference Systems |url = http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/grids/referencesys.html |publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency |access-date=4 March 2014 }}</ref>\nCoordinates on a map are usually in terms [[northing]] N and [[easting]] E offsets relative to a specified origin.\n\nMap projection formulas depend on the geometry of the projection as well as parameters dependent on the particular location at which the map is projected. The set of parameters can vary based on the type of project and the conventions chosen for the projection. For the [[transverse Mercator projection]] used in UTM, the parameters associated are the latitude and longitude of the natural origin, the false northing and false easting, and an overall scale factor.<ref name=OGP7_2>{{cite web |title=Geomatics Guidance Note Number 7, part 2 Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas |url = http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf |publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP) |access-date=5 March 2014 |pages=9\u201310 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf |archive-date=6 March 2014 }}</ref> Given the parameters associated with particular location or grin, the projection formulas for the transverse Mercator are a complex mix of algebraic and trigonometric functions.{{r|OGP7_2|page1=45-54}}\n\n====UTM and UPS systems====\n{{Main|Universal Transverse Mercator|Universal Polar Stereographic}}\n\nThe [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM) and [[Universal Polar Stereographic]] (UPS) coordinate systems both use a metric-based Cartesian grid laid out on a [[Map projection#Projections by preservation of a metric property|conformally projected]] surface to locate positions on the surface of the Earth.

Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal [[Earth tide|Earth tidal]] movement caused by the [[Moon]] and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to {{nowrap|10 cm}} a year, or {{nowrap|10 m}} in a century.

The local ENU coordinates are formed from a plane tangent to the Earth's surface fixed to a specific location and hence it is sometimes known as a ''local tangent'' or ''local geodetic'' plane.

The screenplay was adapted by [[James Dickey]] from his 1970 [[Deliverance (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film was a critical success, earning three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations and five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.\n\nWidely acclaimed as a landmark picture, the film is noted for a music scene near the beginning, with one of the city men playing \"[[Dueling Banjos]]\" on guitar with a banjo-strumming country boy, and for its visceral and notorious rape scene. In 2008, ''Deliverance'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nFour [[Atlanta]] businessmen, Lewis Medlock, Ed Gentry, Bobby Trippe and Drew Ballinger, decide to [[canoe]] down a river in the remote northern Georgia wilderness, expecting to have fun and witness the area's unspoiled nature before the fictional Cahulawassee River valley is flooded by construction of a dam. Lewis, an experienced outdoorsman, is the leader. Ed is a good friend of Lewis and also a veteran of several trips but lacks Lewis' [[machismo]]. Bobby and Drew are novices. While traveling to their launch site, the men (Bobby in particular) are condescending towards the locals, who are unimpressed by the \"city boys\". At a local gas station Drew engages a young boy (implied to be [[inbred]]) in a musical duel, with the boy on [[banjo]] and Drew on his guitar. Although the duel appears mutual and Drew enjoys it, the boy does not acknowledge him when prompted for a congratulatory handshake.\n\nThe men spend the first day canoeing without incident, successfully negotiating the [[rapids]] that dot the river. About to go to sleep, Lewis takes off into the dark only to return a few moments  saying that he thought he had something or someone. In the morning while the others are still asleep Ed takes Lewis's [[recurve bow]] to hunt but misses a clear shot he has of a deer.\n\nTraveling in pairs, the foursome, in their two canoes, are briefly separated. Bobby and Ed, in the one craft, land briefly and encounter a pair of local [[hillbillies]] emerging from the woods, one of whom is carrying a shotgun. After a verbal altercation, Bobby is forced at gunpoint to strip, his ear twisted to bring him to his hands and knees, and then ordered to \"squeal like a [[pig]]\" before being [[rape|raped]] by one of the locals. Ed is bound to a tree and held at gunpoint by the other man. \n\nWhile the second local prepares to assault Ed sexually after the first has finished with Bobby, Lewis and Drew arrive, unnoticed by the locals.  As soon as Lewis kills one of the rapists with an arrow from his bow, the other man dashes away into the woods.\n\nA brief but hotheaded debate between Lewis and Drew concludes with Bobby and Ed's voting for Lewis's recommendation to bury the dead man's body and continue on as if nothing had happened.  Drew has wanted to inform the authorities, but Lewis has argued that the four of them would receive no fair trial for the killing, since the local [[jury]] would be composed of the dead man's friends and relatives.  His view is that the body will soon be buried by the water backed up by the dam and will never be found.  Bobby, for his part, doesn't want what happened to him to be known.\n\nThe four continue downriver but soon disaster strikes as the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of rapids. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew shakes his head and falls into the water. It is unclear why.\n\nWhen the survivors' canoes collide on the rocks, spilling Lewis, Bobby and Ed into the river, Lewis breaks his [[femur]] and the others are washed ashore alongside him. Encouraged by the badly injured Lewis, who believes the escaped local is stalking them and shot Drew, Ed climbs a nearby rock face in order to dispatch the stalker with his bow.  Bobby stays behind to look after Lewis. After reaching the top and hiding out until the next morning, Ed sees a man he takes to be the stalker appear on the cliff top with a rifle and look down into the gorge where Lewis and Bobby are located. Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill the man, accidentally stabbing himself with one of his own spare arrows in the process.\n\nReturning to the others with the body of the man he has killed, Bobby is uncertain that the dead man is the man who had fled from them earlier, but Ed convinces him that he is.  Bobby and Ed weigh down the body in the river, to ensure it will never be found, and repeat the same with Drew's body, which they encounter downriver.  Lewis is too distracted with pain to do anything more than encourage this compounding of their hiding of what they've experienced.\n\nUpon finally reaching the small town of Aintry, Bobby and Ed take Lewis to the hospital. To the authorities, the men present a cover story that Drew's death and disappearance were accidental, with no mention of the four men's encounter with the two locals.  The story is clearly doubted by the local Sheriff Bullard and by Bullard's deputy, whose brother-in-law, the sheriff says, hasn't returned from a hunting trip back up there in the mountains.  Having no legal basis to hold the men, Bullard simply tells them never to come back. Affecting levity, Bobby replies that they sure won't.\n\nWith Lewis still hospitalized and in danger of losing his leg, Bobby and Ed take leave of each other to head home separately.  Declining Bobby's offer to handle it, Ed says he will carry out the duty of informing Drew's wife of Drew's death.\n\nAt his own home, Ed is comforted by his wife and returns to his role of husband and father.  When the hand of a dead man rises from the spooky water of a lake, Ed, who has dreamed the image, bolts upright, in distress, from bed.  His wife gently settles him back down beside her and tells him to go to sleep.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus two named in synopsis, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Ed\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Lewis\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Bobby\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Drew\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as Mountain Man\n* [[Herbert \"Cowboy\" Coward]] as Toothless Man\n* [[James Dickey]] as Sheriff Bullard\n* [[Billy Redden]] as Lonnie, the banjo boy\n* [[Macon McCalman]] as Deputy Queen, whose brother-in-law is missing\n\nIn addition, Ned Beatty's then wife, Belinda Beatty, and director John Boorman's son, [[Charley Boorman]], briefly appear as the wife and young child of Jon Voight's character.\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=January 2020}}\n''Deliverance'' was shot primarily in [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]] in northeastern Georgia. The canoe scenes were filmed in the [[Tallulah Gorge]] southeast of [[Clayton, Georgia|Clayton]] and on the [[Chattooga River]]. This river divides the northeastern corner of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] from the northwestern corner of [[South Carolina]]. Additional scenes were shot in [[Salem, South Carolina]].\n\nA scene was also shot at the Mount Carmel Baptist Church cemetery. This site has since been flooded and lies 130 feet under the surface of [[Lake Jocassee]], on the border between [[Oconee County, South Carolina|Oconee]] and [[Pickens County, South Carolina|Pickens]] counties in South Carolina.<ref name=\"jocassee\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/greenvilleonline/access/1688999131.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Feb+20,+2009|title=Cable network to detail history of Lake Jocassee|accessdate=2009-02-25 | work=The Greenville News | first=Anna | last=Simon | date=2009-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/mailbag/69264542.html|title=Body double plays banjo|first=Rich|last=Heldenfels|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|date=2009-11-05|accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> The dam shown under construction is [[Jocassee Dam]].\n\nDuring the filming of the canoe scene, author [[James Dickey]] showed up inebriated and entered into a bitter argument with producer-director [[John Boorman]], who had rewritten Dickey's script.

The two reconciled and became good friends, and Boorman gave Dickey a cameo role as the sheriff at the end of the film.\n\nThe inspiration for the Cahulawassee River was the [[Coosawattee River]], which was dammed in the 1970s and contained several dangerous whitewater rapids before being flooded by [[Carters Lake (Blue Ridge Mountains)|Carters Lake]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Roper|first1=Daniel M.|title=The Story of the Coosawattee River Gorge|journal=North Georgia Journal|issue=Summer 1995|url=http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/coosawattee-river-gorge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222063750/http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/coosawattee-river-gorge |archivedate=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nCasting was by [[Lynn Stalmaster]].

In one scene, the stunt coordinator decided that a scene showing a canoe with a dummy of Burt Reynolds in it looked phony; he said it looked \"like a canoe with a dummy in it\". Reynolds requested to have the scene re-shot with himself in the canoe rather than the dummy. After shooting the scene, Reynolds, coughing up river water and nursing a broken [[coccyx]], asked how the scene looked. The director responded, \"like a canoe with a dummy in it\".\n\nRegarding the courage of the four main actors in the movie performing their own stunts without insurance protection, Dickey was quoted as saying all of them \"had more guts than a burglar.\" In a nod to their stunt-performing audacity, early in the movie Lewis says, \"Insurance? I've never been insured in my life. I don't believe in insurance. There's no risk\".\n\n===\"Squeal like a pig\"===\nSeveral people have been credited with the phrase \"squeal like a pig\", the now-famous line spoken during the graphic rape scene. Ned Beatty said he thought of it while he and actor McKinney (who played Beatty's rapist) were improvising the scene.<ref>Burger, Mark. (2006, March 19). \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/journalnow/access/1005939731.html?dids=1005939731:1005939731&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+19%2C+2006&author=Mark+Burger+JOURNAL+ARTS+REPORTER&pub=Winston+-+Salem+Journal&edition=&startpage=1&desc=BEATTY+GIVEN+MASTER+OF+CINEMA+AWARD+%3B+CHARACTER+ACTOR+IS+A+VETERAN+OF+MORE+THAN+200+FILM+AND+TELEVISION+PRODUCTIONS BEATTY GIVEN MASTER OF CINEMA AWARD; CHARACTER ACTOR IS A VETERAN OF MORE THAN 200 FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS]\", ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'', Page B1<br>\"Regarding his debut film, ''Deliverance'' (1972), in which his character undergoes an unforgettably vivid sexual assault, Beatty said: 'The whole \"squeal like a pig\" thing ... came from guess who.'

As Boorman did not want to do that, he decided that the phrase \"squeal like a pig\", suggested by Rabun County liaison Frank Rickman, was a good replacement for the original dialogue in the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rabunhistory.org/history-sketches/frank-rickman-red-clay-michelangelo/|title= Rabun County Historical Society|publisher=www.rabunhistory.org|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack and copyright dispute==\nThe film's soundtrack brought new attention to the musical work \"[[Dueling Banjos]]\", which had been recorded numerous times since 1955. Only [[Eric Weissberg]] and Steve Mandel were originally credited for the piece. The onscreen credits state that the song is an arrangement of the song \"Feudin' Banjos\", showing Combine Music Corp as the copyright owner. Songwriter and producer [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith]], who had written \"Feudin' Banjos\" in 1955, and recorded it with five-string banjo player [[Don Reno]], filed a lawsuit for songwriting credit and a percentage of royalties. He was awarded both in a landmark copyright infringement case.<ref>{{cite news |title=Country guitarist Arthur Smith dies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26885910 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref> Smith asked Warner Bros. to include his name on the official soundtrack listing, but reportedly asked to be omitted from the film credits because he found the film offensive.<ref>{{cite web |first=Terence |last=McArdle |title=Arthur Smith, guitarist who wrote \u2018Guitar Boogie\u2019 and \u2018Duelin\u2019 Banjos,\u2019 dies at 93 |url=http://wapo.st/1ihceud |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=15 April 2015 |date=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nNo credit was given for the [[film score]].

The screenplay was adapted by [[James Dickey]] from his 1970 [[Deliverance (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film was a critical success, earning three [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations and five [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations.\n\nWidely acclaimed as a landmark picture, the film is noted for a music scene near the beginning, with one of the city men playing \"[[Dueling Banjos]]\" on guitar with a banjo-strumming country boy, and for its visceral and notorious rape scene. In 2008, ''Deliverance'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nFour [[Atlanta]] businessmen, Lewis Medlock, Ed Gentry, Bobby Trippe and Drew Ballinger, decide to canoe down a river in the remote northern Georgia wilderness, expecting to have fun and witness the area's unspoiled nature before the fictional Cahulawassee River valley is flooded by construction of a dam. Lewis, an experienced outdoorsman, is the leader. Ed is a good friend of Lewis and also a veteran of several trips but lacks Lewis' machismo. Bobby and Drew are novices. While traveling to their launch site, the men (Bobby in particular) are condescending towards the locals, who are unimpressed by the \"city boys\". At a local gas station Drew engages a young boy (implied to be inbred) in a musical duel, with the boy on banjo and Drew on his guitar. Although the duel appears mutual and Drew enjoys it, the boy does not acknowledge him when prompted for a congratulatory handshake.\n\nThe men spend the first day canoeing without incident, successfully negotiating the rapids that dot the river. About to go to sleep, Lewis takes off into the dark only to return a few moments  saying that he thought he had something or someone. In the morning while the others are still asleep Ed takes Lewis's [[recurve bow]] to hunt but misses a clear shot he has of a deer.\n\nTraveling in pairs, the foursome, in their two canoes, are briefly separated. Bobby and Ed, in the one craft, land briefly and encounter a pair of local [[hillbillies]] emerging from the woods, one of whom is carrying a shotgun. After a verbal altercation, Bobby is forced at gunpoint to strip, his ear twisted to bring him to his hands and knees, and then ordered to \"squeal like a [[pig]]\" before being [[rape|raped]] by one of the locals. Ed is bound to a tree and held at gunpoint by the other man. \n\nWhile the second local prepares to assault Ed sexually after the first has finished with Bobby, Lewis and Drew arrive, unnoticed by the locals.  As soon as Lewis kills one of the rapists with an arrow from his bow, the other man dashes away into the woods.\n\nA brief but hotheaded debate between Lewis and Drew concludes with Bobby and Ed's voting for Lewis's recommendation to bury the dead man's body and continue on as if nothing had happened.  Drew has wanted to inform the authorities, but Lewis has argued that the four of them would receive no fair trial for the killing, since the local [[jury]] would be composed of the dead man's friends and relatives.  His view is that the body will soon be buried by the water backed up by the dam and will never be found.  Bobby, for his part, doesn't want what happened to him to be known.\n\nThe four continue downriver but soon disaster strikes as the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of [[rapids]]. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew shakes his head and falls into the water. It is unclear why.\n\nWhen the survivors' canoes collide on the rocks, spilling Lewis, Bobby and Ed into the river, Lewis breaks his [[femur]] and the others are washed ashore alongside him. Encouraged by the badly injured Lewis, who believes the escaped local is stalking them and shot Drew, Ed climbs a nearby rock face in order to dispatch the stalker with his bow.  Bobby stays behind to look after Lewis. After reaching the top and hiding out until the next morning, Ed sees a man he takes to be the stalker appear on the cliff top with a rifle and look down into the gorge where Lewis and Bobby are located. Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill the man, accidentally stabbing himself with one of his own spare arrows in the process.\n\nReturning to the others with the body of the man he has killed, Bobby is uncertain that the dead man is the man who had fled from them earlier, but Ed convinces him that he is.  Bobby and Ed weigh down the body in the river, to ensure it will never be found, and repeat the same with Drew's body, which they encounter downriver.  Lewis is too distracted with pain to do anything more than encourage this compounding of their hiding of what they've experienced.\n\nUpon finally reaching the small town of Aintry, Bobby and Ed take Lewis to the hospital. To the authorities, the men present a cover story that Drew's death and disappearance were accidental, with no mention of the four men's encounter with the two locals.  The story is clearly doubted by the local Sheriff Bullard and by Bullard's deputy, whose brother-in-law, the sheriff says, hasn't returned from a hunting trip back up there in the mountains.  Having no legal basis to hold the men, Bullard simply tells them never to come back. Affecting levity, Bobby replies that they sure won't.\n\nWith Lewis still hospitalized and in danger of losing his leg, Bobby and Ed take leave of each other to head home separately.  Declining Bobby's offer to handle it, Ed says he will carry out the duty of informing Drew's wife of Drew's death.\n\nAt his own home, Ed is comforted by his wife and returns to his role of husband and father.  When the hand of a dead man rises from the spooky water of a lake, Ed, who has dreamed the image, bolts upright, in distress, from bed.  His wife gently settles him back down beside her and tells him to go to sleep.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone opening credits, plus two named in synopsis, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Jon Voight]] as Ed\n* [[Burt Reynolds]] as Lewis\n* [[Ned Beatty]] as Bobby\n* [[Ronny Cox]] as Drew\n* [[Bill McKinney]] as Mountain Man\n* [[Herbert \"Cowboy\" Coward]] as Toothless Man\n* [[James Dickey]] as Sheriff Bullard\n* [[Billy Redden]] as Lonnie, the banjo boy\n* [[Macon McCalman]] as Deputy Queen, whose brother-in-law is missing\n\nIn addition, Ned Beatty's then wife, Belinda Beatty, and director John Boorman's son, [[Charley Boorman]], briefly appear as the wife and young child of Jon Voight's character.\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=January 2020}}\n''Deliverance'' was shot primarily in [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]] in northeastern Georgia. The canoe scenes were filmed in the [[Tallulah Gorge]] southeast of [[Clayton, Georgia|Clayton]] and on the [[Chattooga River]]. This river divides the northeastern corner of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] from the northwestern corner of [[South Carolina]]. Additional scenes were shot in [[Salem, South Carolina]].\n\nA scene was also shot at the Mount Carmel Baptist Church cemetery. This site has since been flooded and lies 130 feet under the surface of [[Lake Jocassee]], on the border between [[Oconee County, South Carolina|Oconee]] and [[Pickens County, South Carolina|Pickens]] counties in South Carolina.<ref name=\"jocassee\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/greenvilleonline/access/1688999131.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Feb+20,+2009|title=Cable network to detail history of Lake Jocassee|accessdate=2009-02-25 | work=The Greenville News | first=Anna | last=Simon | date=2009-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/mailbag/69264542.html|title=Body double plays banjo|first=Rich|last=Heldenfels|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|date=2009-11-05|accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref> The dam shown under construction is [[Jocassee Dam]].\n\nDuring the filming of the canoe scene, author [[James Dickey]] showed up inebriated and entered into a bitter argument with producer-director [[John Boorman]], who had rewritten Dickey's script. They allegedly had a brief fistfight in which Boorman, a much smaller man than Dickey, suffered a broken nose and four shattered teeth.<ref name=iw>{{cite news|last=Lyttleton|first=Oliver|title=5 Things You Might Not Know About \u2018Deliverance,\u2019 Released 40 Years Ago Today|date=30 July 2012|work=[[IndieWire]]|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/07/5-things-you-might-not-know-about-deliverance-released-40-years-ago-today-251460/|accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref> Dickey was thrown off the set, but no charges were filed against him. The two reconciled and became good friends, and Boorman gave Dickey a cameo role as the sheriff at the end of the film.\n\nThe inspiration for the Cahulawassee River was the [[Coosawattee River]], which was dammed in the 1970s and contained several dangerous whitewater rapids before being flooded by [[Carters Lake (Blue Ridge Mountains)|Carters Lake]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Roper|first1=Daniel M.|title=The Story of the Coosawattee River Gorge|journal=North Georgia Journal|issue=Summer 1995|url=http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/coosawattee-river-gorge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222063750/http://www.brownsguides.com/blog/coosawattee-river-gorge |archivedate=2010-12-22 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nCasting was by [[Lynn Stalmaster]].

Scott]] and [[Warren Beatty]].<ref name=iw/>\n\n=== Stunts ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nThe film is infamous for cutting costs by not insuring the production and having the actors perform their own stunts (most notably, Jon Voight climbed the cliff himself). In one scene, the stunt coordinator decided that a scene showing a canoe with a dummy of Burt Reynolds in it looked phony; he said it looked \"like a canoe with a dummy in it\". Reynolds requested to have the scene re-shot with himself in the canoe rather than the dummy. After shooting the scene, Reynolds, coughing up river water and nursing a broken [[coccyx]], asked how the scene looked. The director responded, \"like a canoe with a dummy in it\".\n\nRegarding the courage of the four main actors in the movie performing their own stunts without insurance protection, Dickey was quoted as saying all of them \"had more guts than a burglar.\" In a nod to their stunt-performing audacity, early in the movie Lewis says, \"Insurance? I've never been insured in my life. I don't believe in insurance. There's no risk\".\n\n===\"Squeal like a pig\"===\nSeveral people have been credited with the phrase \"squeal like a pig\", the now-famous line spoken during the graphic rape scene. Ned Beatty said he thought of it while he and actor McKinney (who played Beatty's rapist) were improvising the scene.<ref>Burger, Mark. (2006, March 19). \"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/journalnow/access/1005939731.html?dids=1005939731:1005939731&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+19%2C+2006&author=Mark+Burger+JOURNAL+ARTS+REPORTER&pub=Winston+-+Salem+Journal&edition=&startpage=1&desc=BEATTY+GIVEN+MASTER+OF+CINEMA+AWARD+%3B+CHARACTER+ACTOR+IS+A+VETERAN+OF+MORE+THAN+200+FILM+AND+TELEVISION+PRODUCTIONS BEATTY GIVEN MASTER OF CINEMA AWARD; CHARACTER ACTOR IS A VETERAN OF MORE THAN 200 FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS]\", ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'', Page B1<br>\"Regarding his debut film, ''Deliverance'' (1972), in which his character undergoes an unforgettably vivid sexual assault, Beatty said: 'The whole \"squeal like a pig\" thing ... came from guess who.'

As Boorman did not want to do that, he decided that the phrase \"squeal like a pig\", suggested by Rabun County liaison Frank Rickman, was a good replacement for the original dialogue in the script.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rabunhistory.org/history-sketches/frank-rickman-red-clay-michelangelo/|title= Rabun County Historical Society|publisher=www.rabunhistory.org|accessdate=September 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack and copyright dispute==\nThe film's soundtrack brought new attention to the musical work \"[[Dueling Banjos]]\", which had been recorded numerous times since 1955. Only [[Eric Weissberg]] and Steve Mandel were originally credited for the piece. The onscreen credits state that the song is an arrangement of the song \"Feudin' Banjos\", showing Combine Music Corp as the copyright owner. Songwriter and producer [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith]], who had written \"Feudin' Banjos\" in 1955, and recorded it with five-string banjo player [[Don Reno]], filed a lawsuit for songwriting credit and a percentage of royalties. He was awarded both in a landmark copyright infringement case.<ref>{{cite news |title=Country guitarist Arthur Smith dies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26885910 |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref> Smith asked Warner Bros. to include his name on the official soundtrack listing, but reportedly asked to be omitted from the film credits because he found the film offensive.<ref>{{cite web |first=Terence |last=McArdle |title=Arthur Smith, guitarist who wrote \u2018Guitar Boogie\u2019 and \u2018Duelin\u2019 Banjos,\u2019 dies at 93 |url=http://wapo.st/1ihceud |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=15 April 2015 |date=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nNo credit was given for the [[film score]]. The film has a number of sparse, brooding passages of music scattered throughout, including several played on a [[synthesizer]]. Some prints of the movie omit much of this extra music.\n\nBoorman was given a gold record for the \"Dueling Banjos\" hit single; this was later stolen from his house by the Dublin gangster [[Martin Cahill]].
