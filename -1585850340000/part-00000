Cohen]], lyrics by [[Dean Pitchford]], and music by [[Michael Gore]]. Adapted from [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', it focuses on an awkward teenage girl with [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic powers]] whose lonely life is dominated by an oppressive [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatic]] mother. When she is humiliated by her classmates at the high school [[prom]], she unleashes chaos on everyone and everything in her path.\n\nOriginally premiering in England in 1988, ''Carrie'' came to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the same year, and closed after 16 previews and 5 performances. Because of the passionate response from both its critics and its fans, the show is considered one of the most notable flops in Broadway musical history; a 1991 book written by Ken Mandelbaum, which chronicled the history of flop Broadway musicals, was partially titled ''Not Since Carrie''.\n\n==Production history==\nInspired by a 1981 performance of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]],<ref name=\"DVD featurette\">{{cite video | title = Carrie's DVD featurette (\"Singing Carrie\") | publisher=[[United Artists]] | date=2002}}</ref> [[Lawrence D. Cohen]], who wrote the script for the 1976 film version of [[Carrie (1976 film)|''Carrie'']], and [[Michael Gore]] began work on a musical based on the [[Stephen King]] novel.  Gore's ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' collaborator, [[Dean Pitchford]], was brought in to work on the project, which underwent numerous rewrites.<ref>{{cite web| title = Carrie R.S.C.

It was soon announced that ''Carrie'' would be produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1986.<ref name=\"flop\">Mandelbaum 348</ref> Funding was not raised until late 1987.\n\n===Stratford try-out===\nThe show was produced by Friedrich Kurz and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and had its first four-week run beginning on February 13, 1988 in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], England, where it received mixed reviews. Directed by [[Terry Hands]] and [[choreography|choreographed]] by [[Debbie Allen]], the cast included [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] veteran and [[cabaret]] singer [[Barbara Cook]], [[Charlotte d'Amboise]], [[Gene Anthony Ray]], [[Darlene Love]], and [[Linzi Hateley]], in her stage debut, as Carrie. The massive, technically complex production by designer [[Ralph Koltai]] featured pyrotechnics, lasers, automated scenery and a gigantic white flying staircase that appeared for the show's tragic finale (with a lighting rig underneath lighting most of the show). \n\nThe production was plagued with script and technical problems.  The crew was unable to douse Hateley with fake blood without causing her microphone to malfunction. Rewrites continued following each show,<ref>{{cite web| title = Linzi Hateley \"Green Room Radio\" Interview| publisher = greenroomradio.com| url = http://www.greenroomradio.com/?p=59| accessdate = }}</ref> and the program cited a song, \"Once I Loved a Boy,\" which had been rewritten and retitled \"When There's No One\" prior to the first performance. Cook resigned when she was nearly decapitated by an elaborate set piece - the White's Living Room, during \"Open Your Heart\" - on opening night, but she agreed to stay on until a replacement could be cast, which turned out to be the remainder of the show's Stratford run.<ref name=\"flop\" /> A musical section of the \"Locker Room Scene\" (which has come to be known as \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\") was removed after the initial few performances, and another song, \"White Star,\" was later excised.\n\n===1988 Broadway production===\nThe show transferred to Broadway at an expense of $8 million (at the time an exorbitant amount). Hateley (who ultimately won a [[Theatre World Award]]) and other members of the UK cast remained with the show, but Cook was replaced by [[Betty Buckley]] (who had played the teacher [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Collins]] in the 1976 [[Carrie (1976 film)|film version]]).\n\nThe show started previews on April 28, 1988, at the [[August Wilson Theatre|Virginia Theatre]]. After the final song, boos were heard mixed in with applause. [[Ken Mandelbaum]] is quoted by Wollman, MacDermot, and Trask: \"Ken Mandelbaum writes of an audience divided during early previews, the curtain calls of which were greeted with a raucous mix of cheers and boos.<ref>Wollman, Elizabeth L., MacDermot, Galt, and Trask, Stephen (2006), ''The theater will rock'', University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0-472-11576-6}}, p. 140.</ref>  However, in an instant, when Linzi Hateley and [[Betty Buckley]] rose to take their bows, the entire theatre turned to a standing ovation.

After class, the girls head to the [[locker room]] and have fun teasing a less attractive, plump girl named [[Carrie White]].\n\nThe girls start to shower while talking about boys and their plans for the upcoming prom (\"Dream On\"). Carrie has her first [[menstruation|period]] in the shower and, not understanding what is happening, thinks she is bleeding to death.  The other girls taunt her mercilessly until Miss Gardner hears the commotion, sends the girls away, and explains menstruation to Carrie.\n\nOn the way out of the gym, Sue and Chris talk about what just happened in the locker room. Sue is already feeling remorseful for her part in the incident, but Chris calls Carrie \"Scary White.\" Carrie is hurt by their name-calling and teasing, but dreams of being vindicated and gaining respect from her peers (\"Carrie\").\n\nCarrie's mother Margaret is praying (\"Open Your Heart\") when Carrie arrives home. Carrie joins her mother in prayer for a few minutes and then explains what happened in the locker room. Margaret tells Carrie that the blood is a sign of her sin (\"And Eve Was Weak\") and forces her into the cellar to pray for forgiveness.\n\nThat night, many of the high school students are at the [[drive-in theater]], including Sue and her boyfriend Tommy and Chris and her boyfriend Billy. Sue tells Tommy that she is still upset about what she and the other girls did to Carrie in the locker room, while Chris complains about Carrie to Billy (\"Don't Waste the Moon\"). While the other teenagers are at the drive-in, Carrie and Margaret are home praying (\"Evening Prayers\"). Margaret prays for the strength to help her daughter while Carrie, depressed, questions God's love for her.  Margaret apologizes for hurting Carrie and assures her that she loves her unconditionally.\n\nAt school the following day, Miss Gardner tells the girls they must all apologize to Carrie. Sue and the other girls comply, but Chris refuses. Upset, Miss Gardner tells Chris that she will not be allowed to go to the prom, and Chris vows revenge.  Miss Gardner encourages Carrie to dream about her Prince Charming (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nStill upset over the way Carrie has been treated, Sue asks Tommy to take Carrie to the prom instead of her (\"Do Me a Favor\"), and he reluctantly agrees. At the same time, Chris asks Billy to help her get revenge on Carrie.\n\nTommy surprises Carrie by knocking on her door and asking her to go to prom. Though at first confused and uneasy, Carrie eventually agrees to go with him. When she tells her mother the news (\"Invited\"), Margaret forbids her to go, insisting that all boys just want to take advantage of girls, including her own father (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"), and the prom would be an occasion of sin. Carrie reveals her supernatural powers, telling her mother that she is determined to attend the prom and will not be stopped.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nThe act opens at a pig farm while a storm rages, where Chris, Billy, and several of his friends are on a mission (\"Out for Blood\"). For their planned revenge on Carrie, they kill a pig and collect its blood.  Back at the high school, Sue is confronted by girls who are upset that Carrie is going to the prom. Sue believes she is doing the right thing but realizes that doing the right thing is not always easy (\"It Hurts to be Strong\").\n\nGetting ready for the prom, Carrie dreams about her date and, in a positive display of her special powers, she sends her dress, shoes, and hairbrush dancing through the air (\"I'm Not Alone\"). Margaret tries one more time to convince Carrie not to go to the prom (\"Carrie (Reprise)\"), but Carrie doesn't listen. She leaves for the prom with Tommy.  Alone, Margaret plans to save Carrie from damnation the only way she can (\"When There's No One\").\n\nTommy and Carrie arrive at the prom (\"Wotta Night\") and everyone is surprised at how beautiful Carrie is. Miss Gardner is there as a chaperone and talks to Carrie about how it feels to be in love (\"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\"). Carrie is nervous about dancing with Tommy, but he finally convinces her to go out on the dance floor with him (\"Heaven\"). As the votes for prom king and queen are cast, Tommy, Carrie, Sue, Chris, Billy, and Miss Gardner soliloquize about the events unfolding (\"Heaven (Reprise)\").  Tommy and Carrie are declared king and queen of the prom, and they are crowned as the students sing the \"Alma Mater\".\n\nSuddenly, Billy and Chris appear and dump a bucket of pig blood on Carrie. Humiliated and incensed, Carrie realizes her full powers.  She closes off the gym exit and kills everyone present (\"The Destruction\"). After Carrie leaves the prom, she is met by her mother, who somehow followed her into the school.  Margaret comforts her daughter (\"Carrie (2nd Reprise)\") and then stabs her fatally, thinking it will save Carrie's soul.  Carrie retaliates, killing Margaret with her powers, and she apologizes as her mother dies.  Sue, the sole survivor who escaped this massacre, finds Carrie and comforts her as she dies.\n\n===2012 production===\n\n'''Act I'''\n\n[[Sue Snell]], haunted witness and tour guide to our story, struggles to recount the incidents leading up to the tragic night of May 28. As she's questioned about the past, figures from her life in high school appear. Whatever their differences \u2013 be they good girl Sue, her varsity-athlete boyfriend Tommy Ross, her spoiled-rotten best friend Chris Hargensen, Chris' trouble-maker boyfriend Billy Nolan, or perennial misfit Carrie White \u2013 they are all wrestling with the same insecurities and united in their desire to belong (\"In\").\n\nAfter gym class, Carrie experiences her first period in the shower. Her terrified screams for help and seeming ignorance about what's happening to her amuse and inflame the girls. With Chris as ringleader, Sue and the others encircle Carrie, gleefully chanting names and savagely taunting her. As gym teacher Miss Gardner races in at the height of Carrie's hysteria, an overhead light bulb inexplicably explodes. When the girls are reprimanded, they dismissively rationalize, \"It's just Carrie,\" the butt of their jokes since childhood.\n\nMiss Gardner and guidance counselor/English teacher Mr. Stephens send Carrie home for the rest of the day. But even as she leaves, her classmates' hurtful insults and name-calling ricochet in Carrie's mind until she cracks in fury (\"Carrie\"). Tommy and his pals discuss the upcoming senior prom as Billy roars in on his skateboard, clowning around. Carrie passes by and he jeeringly ridicules her. But when she turns a furious glance in his direction, he goes sprawling. Angry and embarrassed, Billy tries to blame his seeming clumsiness on Carrie, but the other guys just laugh.\n\nAt the White bungalow, Carrie's mother Margaret works at her sewing machine and sings along to her favorite evangelical radio program (\"Open Your Heart\"). When the still-troubled Carrie arrives home, she reluctantly joins in the hymn. Carrie summons the courage to tell her mother about the day's traumatic event. The realization that her child is now a woman throws Margaret into a God-fearing panic. When Carrie resists, Margaret locks her in a closet to beg for repentance (\"And Eve Was Weak\").\n\nWith her parents out of town, Chris throws a party at which she recounts to the kids the details of that day's incident with Carrie in the locker room. When Sue \u2013 confused and upset about her role in the hazing \u2013 protests that it wasn't funny, Chris perversely instructs her in the natural order of things (\"The World According to Chris\"). Upset by Chris' toxic message, Sue turns her back on her best friend and leaves with Tommy.\n\nBack at the White household, Carrie is still locked in her prayer closet surrounded by religious icons. Margaret, meanwhile, pleads for her own divine guidance. As Carrie puzzles over this new sensation she's been feeling, she grows more agitated. Suddenly, a little figurine of Jesus levitates, leaving Carrie to wonder if this strange power might possibly be coming from within her. Margaret releases her from the closet and tearfully apologizes for her actions, prompting Carrie to beg for forgiveness as well. The two find solace in each other's goodnight embrace (\"Evening Prayers\").\n\nIn English class, Mr. Stephens praises a poem Tommy has written, and has him recite his work (\"Dreamer in Disguise\"). When the teacher asks the unruly students for reactions, Carrie volunteers. Her heartfelt emotion only provokes the other kids' mockery. After class, Sue acts on Tommy's advice and tries to apologize to Carrie but, thinking it's some kind of trick, Carrie explodes at her and storms off. Shaken and shocked into awareness, Sue muses on their encounter (\"Once You See\"). Miss Gardner rebukes the girls for their reckless mistreatment of Carrie and demands that they apologize to her \u2013 or else they will be sent to detention for one week. They all do, except for Chris, who instead hurls a vicious invective at Carrie, causing Miss Gardner to change Chris's charge from detention to suspension, thus kicking her out of the prom. Frantic, Chris tries to rally the girls to join her in defying their teacher until Sue shouts defiance. Battle lines are drawn; the best friends are now enemies. When Miss Gardner apologizes to the sobbing Carrie for what just happened, Carrie surprises her by insisting that she's got to let Chris go to Prom. Carrie points out that for girls like Chris, Prom is like a dream. When pressed, Carrie admits that she herself is not going. Moved by Carrie's lack of self-esteem and her need for support, Miss Gardner assures her that things can change (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nDetermined to do right by Carrie, Sue asks Tommy for help with a plan she's devised. Similarly, Chris, blaming Carrie for her humiliation, interrupts a make-out session with Billy to get his help in her plot for revenge (\"Do Me A Favor\"). Alone in the library, Carrie reads about telekinesis from a book. Concentrating intensely, she succeeds in moving chairs across the room without touching them, startling herself with this newfound power. In retrospect, the exploding light bulb in the shower and Billy's tumble from his skateboard start to make sense.\n\nNervous but honoring Sue's request, Tommy arrives at Carrie's front door and asks her to Prom. Wary, she repeatedly refuses, until Margaret calls her in for dinner. Worried that her mother will find her with Tommy, Carrie hurriedly accepts the offer to be his date. As he leaves, she calls out a joyous \"thank you\" as it begins to rain. While the storm outside intensifies, Carrie excitedly tells Margaret of her Prom invitation, triggering Margaret's own tortured reverie (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"). When she orders Carrie to tell Tommy that she can't go, they battle and, as rain starts to blow in, Margaret walks away to close the windows. \"I'll get them!\" Carrie shouts and uses her mind to slam them shut. Horrified by this display of power that she's certain is the work of the devil, Margaret cowers in fear as Carrie calmly finishes her dessert.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nPreparations for Prom and the news that Tommy's taking Carrie preoccupy everyone at school, including Chris and Billy, who sneak into the gymnasium with a bucket of pig's blood and set their own nasty prank in place (\"A Night We'll Never Forget\"). Miss Gardner, suspicious of Sue's motives in having Tommy invite Carrie, warns them both that if they hurt Carrie in any way, they'll have to answer to her. Sue worries that Tommy is mad at her too, but insists he's merely disappointed, wanting to take his girlfriend to Prom. To make up for the event they're going to miss, he takes her into the half-decorated gym to share a private romantic moment (\"You Shine\").\n\nIt's finally Prom Night. The kids are electric with nervous excitement, and Carrie, no less anxious, resolves to make the most of the evening (\"Why Not Me?\"). Frantic with worry, Margaret tries to undermine Carrie's confidence (\"Stay Here Instead\"). Just then, Tommy arrives, and Carrie, looking ravishing in the gown she's made herself, departs with him. Alone, Margaret struggles with fundamentalist scriptures. \"She must be sacrificed. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" Her duty \u2013 however horrific and tragic \u2013 is clear (\"When There's No One\").\n\nAt the gym, the psyched kids show off their Prom finery and pose for yearbook photos. Tommy enters with Carrie, and the crowd's reaction to her stunning transformation turns from initially hostile to unexpectedly welcoming (\"Prom Arrival\"). Miss Gardner, surprised and delighted by Carrie's new self-assurance, shares her own recollection of Prom, and teacher and student trade notes on this timeless high school ritual (\"Unsuspecting Hearts \u2013 Reprise\"). After much coaxing, Tommy leads a hesitant Carrie onto the dance floor where they're observed \u2013 first by Sue, who's felt compelled to sneak in and see how her plan has worked out, and then by Chris' partner-in-crime, Norma (\"Dreamer in Disguise \u2013 Reprise\"). Chris and Billy, hidden high in the rafters above, prepare to unleash their prank, as Sue comes upon Norma switching real Prom ballots for fake ones, arousing her suspicions (\"Prom Climax\").\n\nVotes tabulated, Mr. Stephens and Miss Gardner announce Tommy and Carrie as Prom King and Queen. While the assembled salute them with the school song (\"Alma Mater\"), Sue spots the bucket dangling above the coronation area, confirming her worst suspicions. Frantic, she tries to warn Miss Gardner, but the teacher, who's been wary of Sue's motives in forgoing her Prom in favor of Carrie, pushes her out of the gym. Chris cues Billy, who yanks the bucket and drenches Carrie in blood. As the Prom-goers' stunned silence turns to derisive laughter, her unimaginable humiliation turns to fury \u2013 and then madness. Lashing out with her power, she exacts a terrible revenge on friend and foe alike (\"The Destruction\"). Powerless, Sue watches her classmates all perish. She alone survives. As emergency whistles sound and sirens wail, Sue follows the path of destruction that leads through the street to Carrie's house.\n\nCarrie arrives home in her bloody prom dress and finds momentary solace in her mother's arms (\"Carrie \u2013 Reprise\"). Just as she's lulled into a sense of safety, Margaret \u2013 fulfilling what she believes to be her biblical duty \u2013 plunges a knife into her daughter. Wounded and trying to defend herself from further assault, Carrie uses her powers to stop her mother's heart. Sue stumbles into this horrific scene and, hearing Carrie's anguished cries, rushes to her side to comfort her. But she's too late. As Carrie dies in her arms, the figures from Sue's memory provide a final, haunting testimony of redemption (\"Epilogue\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Stratford-upon-Avon===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, and Girls\n* \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Margaret and Carrie\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Crackerjack\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"Dream On (The Prom)\" \u2013 Girls\n* \"White Star\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" (Reprise) \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Finale)\" \u2013 Margaret{{col-end}}\n\n===Broadway===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, Girls\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Out for Blood\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"It Hurts to Be Strong\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" - Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night!\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue, Miss Gardner, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Off-Broadway revival===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"In\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Reverend Bliss, Margaret, Carrie, Choir\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"The World According to Chris\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Sue, Tommy, Kids\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise\" \u2013 Tommy\n* \"Once You See\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Tommy, Billy, Kids\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"A Night We'll Never Forget\" \u2013 Carrie, Chris, Billy, Sue, Ensemble\n* \"You Shine\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue\n* \"Why Not Me?\" \u2013 Carrie, Kids\n* \"Stay Here Instead\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Prom Arrival\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Carrie, Miss Gardner\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise (Reprise)\" \u2014 Tommy, Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Prom Climax\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Carrie, Tommy, Ensemble\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Epilogue\" \u2013 Sue, Ensemble\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Character\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:70%;\"| Description\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Carrie White]]\n| The main character, Carrie is a shy outcast who is often bullied by her classmates.

After suffering a breakdown after being doused in pig's blood, Carrie kills her entire class and teachers due to setting the school on fire, only to come home to be fatally stabbed by her mother.

When she is humiliated by her classmates at the high school [[prom]], she unleashes chaos on everyone and everything in her path.\n\nOriginally premiering in England in 1988, ''Carrie'' came to [[Broadway]] the same year, and closed after 16 previews and 5 performances. Because of the passionate response from both its critics and its fans, the show is considered one of the most notable flops in Broadway musical history; a 1991 book written by Ken Mandelbaum, which chronicled the history of flop Broadway musicals, was partially titled ''Not Since Carrie''.\n\n==Production history==\nInspired by a 1981 performance of [[Alban Berg]]'s opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]],<ref name=\"DVD featurette\">{{cite video | title = Carrie's DVD featurette (\"Singing Carrie\") | publisher=[[United Artists]] | date=2002}}</ref> [[Lawrence D.

Directed by [[Terry Hands]] and [[choreography|choreographed]] by [[Debbie Allen]], the cast included [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] veteran and [[cabaret]] singer [[Barbara Cook]], [[Charlotte d'Amboise]], [[Gene Anthony Ray]], [[Darlene Love]], and [[Linzi Hateley]], in her stage debut, as Carrie. The massive, technically complex production by designer [[Ralph Koltai]] featured pyrotechnics, lasers, automated scenery and a gigantic white flying staircase that appeared for the show's tragic finale (with a lighting rig underneath lighting most of the show). \n\nThe production was plagued with script and technical problems.  The crew was unable to douse Hateley with fake blood without causing her microphone to malfunction. Rewrites continued following each show,<ref>{{cite web| title = Linzi Hateley \"Green Room Radio\" Interview| publisher = greenroomradio.com| url = http://www.greenroomradio.com/?p=59| accessdate = }}</ref> and the program cited a song, \"Once I Loved a Boy,\" which had been rewritten and retitled \"When There's No One\" prior to the first performance. Cook resigned when she was nearly decapitated by an elaborate set piece - the White's Living Room, during \"Open Your Heart\" - on opening night, but she agreed to stay on until a replacement could be cast, which turned out to be the remainder of the show's Stratford run.<ref name=\"flop\" /> A musical section of the \"Locker Room Scene\" (which has come to be known as \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\") was removed after the initial few performances, and another song, \"White Star,\" was later excised.\n\n===1988 Broadway production===\nThe show transferred to Broadway at an expense of $8 million (at the time an exorbitant amount). Hateley (who ultimately won a [[Theatre World Award]]) and other members of the UK cast remained with the show, but Cook was replaced by [[Betty Buckley]] (who had played the teacher [[Rita Desjardin|Miss Collins]] in the 1976 [[Carrie (1976 film)|film version]]).\n\nThe show started previews on April 28, 1988, at the [[August Wilson Theatre|Virginia Theatre]]. After the final song, boos were heard mixed in with applause. [[Ken Mandelbaum]] is quoted by Wollman, MacDermot, and Trask: \"Ken Mandelbaum writes of an audience divided during early previews, the curtain calls of which were greeted with a raucous mix of cheers and boos.<ref>Wollman, Elizabeth L., MacDermot, Galt, and Trask, Stephen (2006), ''The theater will rock'', University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0-472-11576-6}}, p. 140.</ref>  However, in an instant, when Linzi Hateley and [[Betty Buckley]] rose to take their bows, the entire theatre turned to a standing ovation.

After class, the girls head to the [[locker room]] and have fun teasing a less attractive, plump girl named [[Carrie White]].\n\nThe girls start to shower while talking about boys and their plans for the upcoming prom (\"Dream On\"). Carrie has her first [[menstruation|period]] in the shower and, not understanding what is happening, thinks she is bleeding to death.  The other girls taunt her mercilessly until Miss Gardner hears the commotion, sends the girls away, and explains menstruation to Carrie.\n\nOn the way out of the gym, Sue and Chris talk about what just happened in the locker room. Sue is already feeling remorseful for her part in the incident, but Chris calls Carrie \"Scary White.\" Carrie is hurt by their name-calling and teasing, but dreams of being vindicated and gaining respect from her peers (\"Carrie\").\n\nCarrie's mother Margaret is praying (\"Open Your Heart\") when Carrie arrives home. Carrie joins her mother in prayer for a few minutes and then explains what happened in the locker room. Margaret tells Carrie that the blood is a sign of her sin (\"And Eve Was Weak\") and forces her into the cellar to pray for forgiveness.\n\nThat night, many of the high school students are at the [[drive-in theater]], including Sue and her boyfriend Tommy and Chris and her boyfriend Billy. Sue tells Tommy that she is still upset about what she and the other girls did to Carrie in the locker room, while Chris complains about Carrie to Billy (\"Don't Waste the Moon\"). While the other teenagers are at the drive-in, Carrie and Margaret are home praying (\"Evening Prayers\"). Margaret prays for the strength to help her daughter while Carrie, depressed, questions God's love for her.  Margaret apologizes for hurting Carrie and assures her that she loves her unconditionally.\n\nAt school the following day, Miss Gardner tells the girls they must all apologize to Carrie. Sue and the other girls comply, but Chris refuses. Upset, Miss Gardner tells Chris that she will not be allowed to go to the prom, and Chris vows revenge.  Miss Gardner encourages Carrie to dream about her Prince Charming (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nStill upset over the way Carrie has been treated, Sue asks Tommy to take Carrie to the prom instead of her (\"Do Me a Favor\"), and he reluctantly agrees. At the same time, Chris asks Billy to help her get revenge on Carrie.\n\nTommy surprises Carrie by knocking on her door and asking her to go to prom. Though at first confused and uneasy, Carrie eventually agrees to go with him. When she tells her mother the news (\"Invited\"), Margaret forbids her to go, insisting that all boys just want to take advantage of girls, including her own father (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"), and the prom would be an occasion of sin. Carrie reveals her supernatural powers, telling her mother that she is determined to attend the prom and will not be stopped.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nThe act opens at a pig farm while a storm rages, where Chris, Billy, and several of his friends are on a mission (\"Out for Blood\"). For their planned revenge on Carrie, they kill a pig and collect its blood.  Back at the high school, Sue is confronted by girls who are upset that Carrie is going to the prom. Sue believes she is doing the right thing but realizes that doing the right thing is not always easy (\"It Hurts to be Strong\").\n\nGetting ready for the prom, Carrie dreams about her date and, in a positive display of her special powers, she sends her dress, shoes, and hairbrush dancing through the air (\"I'm Not Alone\"). Margaret tries one more time to convince Carrie not to go to the prom (\"Carrie (Reprise)\"), but Carrie doesn't listen. She leaves for the prom with Tommy.  Alone, Margaret plans to save Carrie from damnation the only way she can (\"When There's No One\").\n\nTommy and Carrie arrive at the prom (\"Wotta Night\") and everyone is surprised at how beautiful Carrie is. Miss Gardner is there as a chaperone and talks to Carrie about how it feels to be in love (\"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\"). Carrie is nervous about dancing with Tommy, but he finally convinces her to go out on the dance floor with him (\"Heaven\"). As the votes for prom king and queen are cast, Tommy, Carrie, Sue, Chris, Billy, and Miss Gardner soliloquize about the events unfolding (\"Heaven (Reprise)\").  Tommy and Carrie are declared king and queen of the prom, and they are crowned as the students sing the \"Alma Mater\".\n\nSuddenly, Billy and Chris appear and dump a bucket of pig blood on Carrie. Humiliated and incensed, Carrie realizes her full powers.  She closes off the gym exit and kills everyone present (\"The Destruction\"). After Carrie leaves the prom, she is met by her mother, who somehow followed her into the school.  Margaret comforts her daughter (\"Carrie (2nd Reprise)\") and then stabs her fatally, thinking it will save Carrie's soul.  Carrie retaliates, killing Margaret with her powers, and she apologizes as her mother dies.  Sue, the sole survivor who escaped this massacre, finds Carrie and comforts her as she dies.\n\n===2012 production===\n\n'''Act I'''\n\n[[Sue Snell]], haunted witness and tour guide to our story, struggles to recount the incidents leading up to the tragic night of May 28. As she's questioned about the past, figures from her life in high school appear. Whatever their differences \u2013 be they good girl Sue, her varsity-athlete boyfriend Tommy Ross, her spoiled-rotten best friend Chris Hargensen, Chris' trouble-maker boyfriend Billy Nolan, or perennial misfit Carrie White \u2013 they are all wrestling with the same insecurities and united in their desire to belong (\"In\").\n\nAfter gym class, Carrie experiences her first period in the shower. Her terrified screams for help and seeming ignorance about what's happening to her amuse and inflame the girls. With Chris as ringleader, Sue and the others encircle Carrie, gleefully chanting names and savagely taunting her. As gym teacher Miss Gardner races in at the height of Carrie's hysteria, an overhead light bulb inexplicably explodes. When the girls are reprimanded, they dismissively rationalize, \"It's just Carrie,\" the butt of their jokes since childhood.\n\nMiss Gardner and guidance counselor/English teacher Mr. Stephens send Carrie home for the rest of the day. But even as she leaves, her classmates' hurtful insults and name-calling ricochet in Carrie's mind until she cracks in fury (\"Carrie\"). Tommy and his pals discuss the upcoming senior prom as Billy roars in on his skateboard, clowning around. Carrie passes by and he jeeringly ridicules her. But when she turns a furious glance in his direction, he goes sprawling. Angry and embarrassed, Billy tries to blame his seeming clumsiness on Carrie, but the other guys just laugh.\n\nAt the White bungalow, Carrie's mother Margaret works at her sewing machine and sings along to her favorite evangelical radio program (\"Open Your Heart\"). When the still-troubled Carrie arrives home, she reluctantly joins in the hymn. Carrie summons the courage to tell her mother about the day's traumatic event. The realization that her child is now a woman throws Margaret into a God-fearing panic. When Carrie resists, Margaret locks her in a closet to beg for repentance (\"And Eve Was Weak\").\n\nWith her parents out of town, Chris throws a party at which she recounts to the kids the details of that day's incident with Carrie in the locker room. When Sue \u2013 confused and upset about her role in the hazing \u2013 protests that it wasn't funny, Chris perversely instructs her in the natural order of things (\"The World According to Chris\"). Upset by Chris' toxic message, Sue turns her back on her best friend and leaves with Tommy.\n\nBack at the White household, Carrie is still locked in her prayer closet surrounded by religious icons. Margaret, meanwhile, pleads for her own divine guidance. As Carrie puzzles over this new sensation she's been feeling, she grows more agitated. Suddenly, a little figurine of Jesus levitates, leaving Carrie to wonder if this strange power might possibly be coming from within her. Margaret releases her from the closet and tearfully apologizes for her actions, prompting Carrie to beg for forgiveness as well. The two find solace in each other's goodnight embrace (\"Evening Prayers\").\n\nIn English class, Mr. Stephens praises a poem Tommy has written, and has him recite his work (\"Dreamer in Disguise\"). When the teacher asks the unruly students for reactions, Carrie volunteers. Her heartfelt emotion only provokes the other kids' mockery. After class, Sue acts on Tommy's advice and tries to apologize to Carrie but, thinking it's some kind of trick, Carrie explodes at her and storms off. Shaken and shocked into awareness, Sue muses on their encounter (\"Once You See\"). Miss Gardner rebukes the girls for their reckless mistreatment of Carrie and demands that they apologize to her \u2013 or else they will be sent to detention for one week. They all do, except for Chris, who instead hurls a vicious invective at Carrie, causing Miss Gardner to change Chris's charge from detention to suspension, thus kicking her out of the prom. Frantic, Chris tries to rally the girls to join her in defying their teacher until Sue shouts defiance. Battle lines are drawn; the best friends are now enemies. When Miss Gardner apologizes to the sobbing Carrie for what just happened, Carrie surprises her by insisting that she's got to let Chris go to Prom. Carrie points out that for girls like Chris, Prom is like a dream. When pressed, Carrie admits that she herself is not going. Moved by Carrie's lack of self-esteem and her need for support, Miss Gardner assures her that things can change (\"Unsuspecting Hearts\").\n\nDetermined to do right by Carrie, Sue asks Tommy for help with a plan she's devised. Similarly, Chris, blaming Carrie for her humiliation, interrupts a make-out session with Billy to get his help in her plot for revenge (\"Do Me A Favor\"). Alone in the library, Carrie reads about telekinesis from a book. Concentrating intensely, she succeeds in moving chairs across the room without touching them, startling herself with this newfound power. In retrospect, the exploding light bulb in the shower and Billy's tumble from his skateboard start to make sense.\n\nNervous but honoring Sue's request, Tommy arrives at Carrie's front door and asks her to Prom. Wary, she repeatedly refuses, until Margaret calls her in for dinner. Worried that her mother will find her with Tommy, Carrie hurriedly accepts the offer to be his date. As he leaves, she calls out a joyous \"thank you\" as it begins to rain. While the storm outside intensifies, Carrie excitedly tells Margaret of her Prom invitation, triggering Margaret's own tortured reverie (\"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\"). When she orders Carrie to tell Tommy that she can't go, they battle and, as rain starts to blow in, Margaret walks away to close the windows. \"I'll get them!\" Carrie shouts and uses her mind to slam them shut. Horrified by this display of power that she's certain is the work of the devil, Margaret cowers in fear as Carrie calmly finishes her dessert.\n\n'''Act II'''\n\nPreparations for Prom and the news that Tommy's taking Carrie preoccupy everyone at school, including Chris and Billy, who sneak into the gymnasium with a bucket of pig's blood and set their own nasty prank in place (\"A Night We'll Never Forget\"). Miss Gardner, suspicious of Sue's motives in having Tommy invite Carrie, warns them both that if they hurt Carrie in any way, they'll have to answer to her. Sue worries that Tommy is mad at her too, but insists he's merely disappointed, wanting to take his girlfriend to Prom. To make up for the event they're going to miss, he takes her into the half-decorated gym to share a private romantic moment (\"You Shine\").\n\nIt's finally Prom Night. The kids are electric with nervous excitement, and Carrie, no less anxious, resolves to make the most of the evening (\"Why Not Me?\"). Frantic with worry, Margaret tries to undermine Carrie's confidence (\"Stay Here Instead\"). Just then, Tommy arrives, and Carrie, looking ravishing in the gown she's made herself, departs with him. Alone, Margaret struggles with fundamentalist scriptures. \"She must be sacrificed. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\" Her duty \u2013 however horrific and tragic \u2013 is clear (\"When There's No One\").\n\nAt the gym, the psyched kids show off their Prom finery and pose for yearbook photos. Tommy enters with Carrie, and the crowd's reaction to her stunning transformation turns from initially hostile to unexpectedly welcoming (\"Prom Arrival\"). Miss Gardner, surprised and delighted by Carrie's new self-assurance, shares her own recollection of Prom, and teacher and student trade notes on this timeless high school ritual (\"Unsuspecting Hearts \u2013 Reprise\"). After much coaxing, Tommy leads a hesitant Carrie onto the dance floor where they're observed \u2013 first by Sue, who's felt compelled to sneak in and see how her plan has worked out, and then by Chris' partner-in-crime, Norma (\"Dreamer in Disguise \u2013 Reprise\"). Chris and Billy, hidden high in the rafters above, prepare to unleash their prank, as Sue comes upon Norma switching real Prom ballots for fake ones, arousing her suspicions (\"Prom Climax\").\n\nVotes tabulated, Mr. Stephens and Miss Gardner announce Tommy and Carrie as Prom King and Queen. While the assembled salute them with the school song (\"Alma Mater\"), Sue spots the bucket dangling above the coronation area, confirming her worst suspicions. Frantic, she tries to warn Miss Gardner, but the teacher, who's been wary of Sue's motives in forgoing her Prom in favor of Carrie, pushes her out of the gym. Chris cues Billy, who yanks the bucket and drenches Carrie in blood. As the Prom-goers' stunned silence turns to derisive laughter, her unimaginable humiliation turns to fury \u2013 and then madness. Lashing out with her power, she exacts a terrible revenge on friend and foe alike (\"The Destruction\"). Powerless, Sue watches her classmates all perish. She alone survives. As emergency whistles sound and sirens wail, Sue follows the path of destruction that leads through the street to Carrie's house.\n\nCarrie arrives home in her bloody prom dress and finds momentary solace in her mother's arms (\"Carrie \u2013 Reprise\"). Just as she's lulled into a sense of safety, Margaret \u2013 fulfilling what she believes to be her biblical duty \u2013 plunges a knife into her daughter. Wounded and trying to defend herself from further assault, Carrie uses her powers to stop her mother's heart. Sue stumbles into this horrific scene and, hearing Carrie's anguished cries, rushes to her side to comfort her. But she's too late. As Carrie dies in her arms, the figures from Sue's memory provide a final, haunting testimony of redemption (\"Epilogue\").\n\n==Musical numbers==\n\n===Stratford-upon-Avon===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, and Girls\n* \"Her Mother Should Have Told Her\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Margaret and Carrie\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner and Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Crackerjack\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"Dream On (The Prom)\" \u2013 Girls\n* \"White Star\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" (Reprise) \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Finale)\" \u2013 Margaret{{col-end}}\n\n===Broadway===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Girls\n* \"Dear Lord\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Dream On\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Carrie, Girls\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"Don't Waste the Moon\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Tommy, Chris, Billy, Boys and Girls\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"Out for Blood\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Boys\n* \"It Hurts to Be Strong\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"I'm Not Alone\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" - Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Wotta Night!\" \u2013 Boys and Girls\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Heaven\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue, Miss Gardner, Carrie, Margaret, Boys and Girls\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Boys and Girls\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Off-Broadway revival===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* \"In\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Carrie\" \u2013 Carrie\n* \"Open Your Heart\" \u2013 Reverend Bliss, Margaret, Carrie, Choir\n* \"And Eve Was Weak\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"The World According to Chris\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Sue, Tommy, Kids\n* \"Evening Prayers\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise\" \u2013 Tommy\n* \"Once You See\" \u2013 Sue\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts\" \u2013 Miss Gardner, Carrie\n* \"Do Me a Favor\" \u2013 Sue, Chris, Tommy, Billy, Kids\n* \"I Remember How Those Boys Could Dance\" \u2013 Carrie, Margaret\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* \"A Night We'll Never Forget\" \u2013 Carrie, Chris, Billy, Sue, Ensemble\n* \"You Shine\" \u2013 Tommy, Sue\n* \"Why Not Me?\" \u2013 Carrie, Kids\n* \"Stay Here Instead\" \u2013 Margaret, Carrie\n* \"When There's No One\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Prom Arrival\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"Unsuspecting Hearts (Reprise)\" \u2013 Carrie, Miss Gardner\n* \"Dreamer in Disguise (Reprise)\" \u2014 Tommy, Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Prom Climax\" \u2013 Chris, Billy, Carrie, Tommy, Ensemble\n* \"Alma Mater\" \u2013 Ensemble\n* \"The Destruction\" \u2013 Carrie, Ensemble\n* \"Carrie (Reprise)\" \u2013 Margaret\n* \"Epilogue\" \u2013 Sue, Ensemble\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:80%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Character\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:70%;\"| Description\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Carrie White]]\n| The main character, Carrie is a shy outcast who is often bullied by her classmates. While showering at school, Carrie has her first period, for which the other girls in her class tease her. This event sparks the emergence of Carrie's telekinetic powers, which she ultimately uses for revenge after being cruelly pranked at the prom. After suffering a breakdown after being doused in pig's blood, Carrie kills her entire class and teachers due to setting the school on fire, only to come home to be fatally stabbed by her mother. Carrie then uses her powers to kill her mother, dying shortly afterwards (of her stab wound) comforted by Sue.\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Margaret White (Stephen King)|Margaret White]]\n| One of the main antagonists of the show. Carrie's overprotective and abusive mother, Margaret is a religious zealot. Although she loves Carrie and wants to protect her from the world, especially from the school, her fanaticism often drives her to homeschool or abuse her daughter. After Carrie develops telekinesis and goes to the prom against her wishes, Margaret comes to believe that killing Carrie is a sacrifice and that is the only way to save her from damnation. Carrie uses her telekinetic powers to stop her mother's heart in retaliation after being stabbed by her.\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Sue Snell]]\n| This main character is one of the most popular girls at school, Sue initially teases Carrie like all the other girls, but later feels remorse for what she's done. To make up for all she's done, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to prom instead of her. Sue goes to the prom to see how things ended up and when she realizes that Carrie is in trouble she goes to Miss Gardner for help. However, Miss Gardner throws Sue out of the prom, thinking that she is trying to humiliate Carrie.

For his bravery he was awarded a silver medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL/>\n\n=== Harbour Commission Lifeboat ===\nIn 1845 the Shoreham Harbour Commissioners decided to provide funds to open a lifeboat service for the town.<ref name=PERIL>For Those In Peril \u2013 The Lifeboat Service of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, Station by Station. Author: Leach, Nicholas. Publisher: Silver Link Publishing Ltd, First Issue 1999.

In 1870 the Harbour Board funded the installation of a slipway.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== The RNLI station ===\nIn 1865<ref name=PERIL/> the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] took over the lifeboat cover for Shoreham Harbour. They established a station with a boathouse constructed on Kingston beach. This boathouse was used until 1892<ref name=PERIL/> when a new timber framed boathouse was built near the coastguard station on Shoreham beach on the western side of the Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> The old station building at Kingston beach was demolished.\n\nIn 1903 the boathouse was moved further from the shore and was in use until 1924.<ref name=PERIL/> In October of that year the station had to be closed due to the silting up of the harbour entrance, which had made operations hazardous and then impossible. The station did not re-open until October 1929 after work had been carried out to remove the sandbar across the harbour entrance.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== New Boathouse ===\nIn 1933 the station moved into new facilities at Kingston Beach opposite Shoreham Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> This boathouse and slipway was specifically built to accommodate a new lifeboat, the 41&nbsp;ft {{Lbc|Watson}} {{RNLB|Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn|ON 758}}.<ref name=DLS>{{cite web|title=RNLB Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn now Dowager|url= http://www.adls.org.uk/t1/content/rosa-woodd-and-phyllis-lunn-now-dowager-0|publisher=All content copyright 2009 - 2014 Association of Dunkirk Little Ships|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> This lifeboat was at Shoreham for 30 years and during that period the lifeboat was launched 244 times and saved 143 lives. Over the years since that boathouse was constructed it has undergone alterations on several occasions to accommodate different lifeboats sent to serve at the station. Problems with sinkage of the slipway led to the decision to allocate a 13-ton {{Lbc|Rother}} lifeboat (primarily designed for carriage launching) to the station in 1981. However, the slipway was strengthened following the decision to place a {{Lbc|Tyne}} boat on station and the Rother was replaced in 1986 by the first of two {{Lbc|47ft Watson}} boats that served for four years before being replaced by the new Tyne. In 1967 the station was supplied with a second lifeboat. This was a {{Lbc|D|EA16}} inshore lifeboat and was kept in its own berth constructed beneath the main boathouse.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n===''Tyne''-class lifeboat ===\nIn 1990 the station was supplied with a new {{Lbc|Tyne}} lifeboat. She was the {{RNLB|Hermione Lady Colwyn|ON 1158}}.<ref name=NAVNUTYNE>{{cite web|title=Tyne-class 47 foot Lifeboat|url=http://www.lifeboatsonline.com/RNLITyne.html|work=List of Tyne-class lifeboats, includes ON-1158|publisher =Lifeboat World On-Line\u00a9 2014|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref> The ''Hermione Lady Colwyn'' was on station from 1990 until 2010 and during that period she was launched to service 414<ref name=ON1158>{{cite web|title= The vessel - Odin Nautical \u2013 Tyne Class Lifeboat|url=http://www.aegirnautical.com/about-us/the-vessels|work=Details of the lifeboats service as a lifeboat and photographs of ON 1158|publisher = Aegir Nautical\u00a9 2014|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref>  times and she rescued 458 people. 72 of these were classed as medical emergency but she is credited with saving the lives of 39 people. After the withdrawal of ''Hermione Lady Colwyn'' in April 2010, the station was served by various relief fleet Tynes until the new {{Lbc|Tamar}} entered service in December.\n\n=== New ''Tamar''-class lifeboat station ===\nIn 2008 the Trustees and the RNLI set out to develop the station. A \u00a31 million public appeal was launched to help towards the cost of the re-build to accommodate a new {{Lbc|Tamar}} lifeboat. In January 2009 the work began with the demolition of the old station boathouse and slipway. Whilst the work was carried out the station was housed in temporary accommodation on Kingston Beach, with the inshore lifeboat being launched using a tractor. The Tyne-class lifeboat Lady Hermione Colwyn being moored afloat by the locks. Contracted to build the new boathouse and slipways was Dean & Dyball Civil Engineering of [[Ringwood]].<ref name=CONEWS>{{cite web|title=Construction News \u2013 New Lifeboat Station|url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/buildings/project-reports/lifeboat-station-construction-101-10-06-2009/|work=Details about the Construction of the station|publisher=Copyright \u00a9 2002-2014 EMAP Publishing Limited|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref> The building is a timber-framed building on three storeys. Within this structure are boat halls for the all-weather lifeboat and the inshore lifeboat, each with dedicated slipways to the harbour. The new facility has office and mess accommodation, training facilities, kitchen and showers. A 10,000-litre fuel tank sitting on the middle floor enables the crew to refuel the boat inside the station.\n\n====Wave pit ====\nThe previous boathouse and station encountered problems with the occasional higher than normal spring tides.<ref name=CONEWS/> On more than one occasion the energy of south easterly storm waves would race across through the open harbour mouth and crash against the slipway, flooding the old station. A design innovation of the new station includes a wave pit at the front of the station. The steep gradient of the slipway would accentuate the waves hitting it, and the wave pit ensures that the waves break before they hit the boathouse door. The resulting seawater will drain away back into the harbour through a channel running parallel to the slipway.<ref name=CONEWS/>\n\n==== The opening ceremony ====\nThe project cost a total of \u00a34,200,000 and was officially opened by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent KG]] on Thursday 16 June 2011.

This lifeboat was funded by the generous bequests of Miss Enid Marjory Collett together with other gifts and legacies. The ''Enid Collett'' was the first Tamar-class lifeboat to go on service at a lifeboat station in the RNLI's south east region.

Customs was observing the first RNLI Shoreham lifeboat {{RNLB|Ramonet}} whilst it was out on an exercise in very rough weather and very heavy seas. The lifeboat was capsized and one of the crew members drowned. William Sheader, unaware that the crewman was already dead, at great risk to himself swam out through the breaking surf and brought his body ashore. For his bravery he was awarded an RNLI silver medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won. Author: Cox, Barry. Publisher:Spink & son Ltd and the RNLI, 1998.

On 1 June 1940 the lifeboat was towed to Dunkirk by Naval Drifter ''Kindred Star''. During the evacuation the lifeboat made three trips from the beaches back to Dover, but naval crews did not keep detailed logs which are the rule in the RNLI. There is a story that the naval officer in charge protected his men from shrapnel and strafing by constructing a makeshift wheelhouse from steel plate, but this has never been substantiated.\n\n==== HM Minesweeper ''President Briand'' ====\nOn 16 November 1941<ref name=LIFEGAL1>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

The coxswain of the ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' then returned to the minesweeper aboard the Shoreham Pilot Cutter with the intention of piloting the minesweeper. At 9.45pm<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> the lifeboat now under command of second coxswain James Upperton,<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> was recalled up to service as both the Tug and the minesweeper were now being driven ashore in the appalling weather. At the scene the tug was trying to haul the vessel clear of shallow water but the line broke which caused the minesweeper to roll heavily and the sea began to break over her decks. With great skill and courage, avoiding the presence of the [[naval mine]]s in the vicinity, the lifeboat went alongside six or seven times and removed all 22 men aboard the minesweeper, including their own coxswain. For their part played in this rescue Second Coxswain James Upperton was awarded the RNLI silver medal and Mechanic Henry Philcox was awarded a bronze medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL1/>\n\n==== The yacht ''Gull'' ====\nFrom early morning on 8 August 1948<ref name=LIFEGAL2>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

Just of the coast at Shoreham the yacht ''Gull'' had got into difficulties and was being driven along the coast with her sails torn and shredded and she was out of control. The Shoreham Lifeboat ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' was launched to service with coxswain Upperton<ref name=LIFEGAL2/> at the helm. The lifeboat raced after the yacht and to boost her speed hoisted her sail to help her engines. The lifeboat eventually caught the yacht at the entrance to [[Port of Newhaven|Newhaven]] Harbour. The yacht by this time in a desperate attempt to enter the harbour, [[Jibe (sailing)|gybed]] and became waterlogged and caught in broken shallow water. The lifeboat at great risk got alongside her on two occasions and took off three men, two women and a boy. They were all landed safely at Newhaven. The lifeboat returned to Shoreham arriving back at their station at 3:30 pm after being out at sea for 7 hours.<ref name=LIFEGAL2/> For this service coxswain James Upperton received an RNLI silver medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL2/>\n\n=== RNLB ''Dorothy and Philip Constant'' (ON 967) ===\n==== Drilling Rig ''William Allpress'' ====\nOn 19 October 1971,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

The weather was slowly deteriorating and the rig was awaiting a tow into [[Portsmouth]] Harbour. After three days the conditions had caused the crew to have no food or sleep and the five men aboard were all suffering from sea sickness and it was necessary for the men to be taken off the rig. The Watson-class lifeboat {{RNLB|Dorothy and Philip Constant|ON 697}}<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> was launched at 2.10 pm in south-westerly gale to a very heavy sea, torrential rain and poor visibility. Coxswain John Fox,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> after circling the rig to assess the situation, piled all his [[Fender (boating)|fenders]] into one large one, brought the life-boat starboard on to the rig enabling the five survivors to be pulled on board across the foredeck. The lifeboat then headed back to Shoreham. The rescue had taken three hours. John Fox was awarded an RNLI Bronze medal for his part in the service.<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/>\n\n==== The yacht ''Albin Ballard'' ====\nOn 5 August 1975,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

She had broached to windward and under bare poles (No sail) was drifting with the remains of her sails flapping in the water. At 3.15 am the lifeboat ''Dorothy and Philip Constant'' was launched to service with coxswain John Fox<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1/> at the helm. The lifeboat found the yacht due south of [[Littlehampton]] and by this time the vessel was being deluged with large breaking waves. Her crew by this time were seasick  and exhausted. Coxswain Fox put the lifeboat against the amidships of the yacht at which point two of the lifeboat men scrambled aboard. They then set up, and proceeded to take the yacht into tow. Despite losing the line once they finally towed the yacht into Shoreham arriving at 7.25 am in the morning. John Fox was awarded an RNLI Bronze medal for his part in the service.<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1/>\n\n==== MS ''Athina B'' ====\n[[File:Athina B.jpg|thumb|right|250px| The Athina B aground to the east of the Palace Pier in Brighton]]\nThe [[MS Athina B|MS ''Athina B'']] had left the [[Azores]] on 11 December 1979 laden with 3,000 tonnes of [[pumice]]. Her destination was the port at [[Shoreham-by-Sea]]. During the voyage, she had problems with her [[Electrical generator|generator]], [[gyro compass]] and [[radar]], and put in at [[La Rochelle]] in France for repairs. On arrival at Shoreham on 20 January 1980<ref name=PERIL/> the vessel was caught in a force seven or eight gale and with seas breaking across her decks, she was unable to enter Shoreham harbour. Her engines failed, and a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] call was issued.

In 1870 the Harbour Board funded the installation of a slipway.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== The RNLI station ===\nIn 1865<ref name=PERIL/> the [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] took over the lifeboat cover for Shoreham Harbour. They established a station with a boathouse constructed on Kingston beach. This boathouse was used until 1892<ref name=PERIL/> when a new timber framed boathouse was built near the coastguard station on Shoreham beach on the western side of the Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> The old station building at Kingston beach was demolished.\n\nIn 1903 the boathouse was moved further from the shore and was in use until 1924.<ref name=PERIL/> In October of that year the station had to be closed due to the silting up of the harbour entrance, which had made operations hazardous and then impossible. The station did not re-open until October 1929 after work had been carried out to remove the sandbar across the harbour entrance.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n=== New Boathouse ===\nIn 1933 the station moved into new facilities at Kingston Beach opposite Shoreham Harbour.<ref name=PERIL/> This boathouse and slipway was specifically built to accommodate a new lifeboat, the 41&nbsp;ft {{Lbc|Watson}} {{RNLB|Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn|ON 758}}.<ref name=DLS>{{cite web|title=RNLB Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn now Dowager|url= http://www.adls.org.uk/t1/content/rosa-woodd-and-phyllis-lunn-now-dowager-0|publisher=All content copyright 2009 - 2014 Association of Dunkirk Little Ships|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> This lifeboat was at Shoreham for 30 years and during that period the lifeboat was launched 244 times and saved 143 lives. Over the years since that boathouse was constructed it has undergone alterations on several occasions to accommodate different lifeboats sent to serve at the station. Problems with sinkage of the slipway led to the decision to allocate a 13-ton {{Lbc|Rother}} lifeboat (primarily designed for carriage launching) to the station in 1981. However, the slipway was strengthened following the decision to place a {{Lbc|Tyne}} boat on station and the Rother was replaced in 1986 by the first of two {{Lbc|47ft Watson}} boats that served for four years before being replaced by the new Tyne. In 1967 the station was supplied with a second lifeboat. This was a {{Lbc|D|EA16}} inshore lifeboat and was kept in its own berth constructed beneath the main boathouse.<ref name=PERIL/>\n\n===''Tyne''-class lifeboat ===\nIn 1990 the station was supplied with a new {{Lbc|Tyne}} lifeboat.

After the withdrawal of ''Hermione Lady Colwyn'' in April 2010, the station was served by various relief fleet Tynes until the new {{Lbc|Tamar}} entered service in December.\n\n=== New ''Tamar''-class lifeboat station ===\nIn 2008 the Trustees and the RNLI set out to develop the station. A \u00a31 million public appeal was launched to help towards the cost of the re-build to accommodate a new {{Lbc|Tamar}} lifeboat. In January 2009 the work began with the demolition of the old station boathouse and slipway. Whilst the work was carried out the station was housed in temporary accommodation on Kingston Beach, with the inshore lifeboat being launched using a tractor. The Tyne-class lifeboat Lady Hermione Colwyn being moored afloat by the locks. Contracted to build the new boathouse and slipways was Dean & Dyball Civil Engineering of [[Ringwood]].<ref name=CONEWS>{{cite web|title=Construction News \u2013 New Lifeboat Station|url=https://www.constructionnews.co.uk/buildings/project-reports/lifeboat-station-construction-101-10-06-2009/|work=Details about the Construction of the station|publisher=Copyright \u00a9 2002-2014 EMAP Publishing Limited|accessdate = 17 March 2014}}</ref> The building is a timber-framed building on three storeys. Within this structure are boat halls for the all-weather lifeboat and the inshore lifeboat, each with dedicated slipways to the harbour. The new facility has office and mess accommodation, training facilities, kitchen and showers. A 10,000-litre fuel tank sitting on the middle floor enables the crew to refuel the boat inside the station.\n\n====Wave pit ====\nThe previous boathouse and station encountered problems with the occasional higher than normal spring tides.<ref name=CONEWS/> On more than one occasion the energy of south easterly storm waves would race across through the open harbour mouth and crash against the slipway, flooding the old station. A design innovation of the new station includes a wave pit at the front of the station. The steep gradient of the slipway would accentuate the waves hitting it, and the wave pit ensures that the waves break before they hit the boathouse door. The resulting seawater will drain away back into the harbour through a channel running parallel to the slipway.<ref name=CONEWS/>\n\n==== The opening ceremony ====\nThe project cost a total of \u00a34,200,000 and was officially opened by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent KG]] on Thursday 16 June 2011.

On 1 June 1940 the lifeboat was towed to Dunkirk by Naval Drifter ''Kindred Star''. During the evacuation the lifeboat made three trips from the beaches back to Dover, but naval crews did not keep detailed logs which are the rule in the RNLI. There is a story that the naval officer in charge protected his men from shrapnel and strafing by constructing a makeshift wheelhouse from steel plate, but this has never been substantiated.\n\n==== HM Minesweeper ''President Briand'' ====\nOn 16 November 1941<ref name=LIFEGAL1>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

The coxswain of the ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' then returned to the minesweeper aboard the Shoreham Pilot Cutter with the intention of piloting the minesweeper. At 9.45pm<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> the lifeboat now under command of second coxswain James Upperton,<ref name=LIFEGAL1/> was recalled up to service as both the Tug and the minesweeper were now being driven ashore in the appalling weather. At the scene the tug was trying to haul the vessel clear of shallow water but the line broke which caused the minesweeper to roll heavily and the sea began to break over her decks. With great skill and courage, avoiding the presence of the [[naval mine]]s in the vicinity, the lifeboat went alongside six or seven times and removed all 22 men aboard the minesweeper, including their own coxswain. For their part played in this rescue Second Coxswain James Upperton was awarded the RNLI silver medal and Mechanic Henry Philcox was awarded a bronze medal.<ref name=LIFEGAL1/>\n\n==== The yacht ''Gull'' ====\nFrom early morning on 8 August 1948<ref name=LIFEGAL2>Lifeboat Gallantry - RNLI Medals and how they were won.

Just of the coast at Shoreham the yacht ''Gull'' had got into difficulties and was being driven along the coast with her sails torn and shredded and she was out of control. The Shoreham Lifeboat ''Rosa Woodd and Phyllis Lunn'' was launched to service with coxswain Upperton<ref name=LIFEGAL2/> at the helm. The lifeboat raced after the yacht and to boost her speed hoisted her sail to help her engines. The lifeboat eventually caught the yacht at the entrance to [[Port of Newhaven|Newhaven]] Harbour. The yacht by this time in a desperate attempt to enter the harbour, [[Jibe (sailing)|gybed]] and became waterlogged and caught in broken shallow water. The lifeboat at great risk got alongside her on two occasions and took off three men, two women and a boy. They were all landed safely at Newhaven.

The weather was slowly deteriorating and the rig was awaiting a tow into [[Portsmouth]] Harbour. After three days the conditions had caused the crew to have no food or sleep and the five men aboard were all suffering from sea sickness and it was necessary for the men to be taken off the rig. The Watson-class lifeboat {{RNLB|Dorothy and Philip Constant|ON 697}}<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> was launched at 2.10 pm in south-westerly gale to a very heavy sea, torrential rain and poor visibility. Coxswain John Fox,<ref name=LIFEGALFOX/> after circling the rig to assess the situation, piled all his [[Fender (boating)|fenders]] into one large one, brought the life-boat starboard on to the rig enabling the five survivors to be pulled on board across the foredeck. The lifeboat then headed back to Shoreham. The rescue had taken three hours.

At 3.15 am the lifeboat ''Dorothy and Philip Constant'' was launched to service with coxswain John Fox<ref name=LIFEGALFOX1/> at the helm. The lifeboat found the yacht due south of [[Littlehampton]] and by this time the vessel was being deluged with large breaking waves. Her crew by this time were seasick  and exhausted.

solid, \"flattish\" and angled piece \"morphs into an airier version\" with vertical and horizontal elements of smaller proportions.<ref name=\"Campus\" /> The title, an invented term, was suggested

\"simplified, yet expressive\": chalices and crucifixes which demonstrated Nugent's interest in modern interpretations of early Christian and [[Romanesque sculpture|Romanesque]] models.<ref

[[beeswax]] bought from the beekeepers co-operative processing plant at [[Tisdale, Saskatchewan|Tisdale]] and treated with a solution, the ingredients of which were a [[trade secret]] taught to him by L. H. Shirley, a [[Roman Catholic priest]] in [[Young, Saskatchewan]].<ref name=\"Longman\" /> \n\n===New studio and abstract sculpture===\nIn 1960, Nugent's candle works in Lumsden burned down. Nugent commissioned [[Clifford Wiens]] to design a [[John Nugent Studio|new studio with a novel curved, conical design]] that earned the architect a Massey silver medal.<ref name=\"Long2\" /> The studio was constructed over successive weekends by Nugent and Wiens, with help from fellow artists [[Kenneth Lochhead]] and [[Roy Kiyooka]].<ref name=\"Studio\" /> Resistance from the Church hierarchy and from parishioners led to Nugent abandoning his liturgical work in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Long\" /><ref name=\"Long2\" /> After meeting American sculptor [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]] in New York in 1961, Nugent was in any case gradually shifting to welded steel abstracts, for which he is now best known, and which exhibit what Long calls \"an awkward grace\" in its [[constructivism (art)|constructivist]] [[collage]] of prefabricated steel elements.<ref name=\"Long\"/> He acquired some of the raw materials from the [[SSAB#North American operations|IPSCO Steel]] steel company in Regina, and often gave the pieces names \"to eliminate distraction from the form itself\".<ref name=\"Campus\">{{cite web |title=John Cullen Nugent |url=http://www2.uregina.ca/president/art/outdoor/john-cullen-nugent/ |website=Campus Art Guide |publisher=[[University of Regina]] |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref> Long describes how Nugent's work differentiates itself from that of others:<blockquote>While often incorporating identifiable parts, such as wheels, his sculpture eludes easy metaphorical readings, instead creating meaning through unexpected combinations of forms and materials. Nugent's work represents an independent strain within Canadian abstract steel sculpture without direct ties to the Emma Lake Artists' Workshops or other western Canadian sculptors.<ref name=\"Long2\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Macdonaldstat.jpg|thumb|John A.

{"title_page": "The Turkish harpist (Manuchehri)", "text_new": "{{short description|11th-century poem by Manuchehri}}\n'''Manuchehri's Turkish harpist''' is a poem by the 11th-century Persian royal court poet [[Manuchehri]]. It is also known as {{lang|fa-Latn|Dar mahd-e Espahbad Man\u016bchehr ebn-e Q\u0101b\u016bs}} ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0627\u0633\u067e\u0647\u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0622\u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0633}}) \"In praise of the Espahbad Manuchehr son of Qabus\", or [[Qasida]] no. 39 in the collected works of Manuchehri.<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ Qasida 39] (Ganjoor website).</ref>\n\nThe poem is a ''[[qasida|qas\u012bda]]'' (praise poem) in the Arabic style, consisting of 30 or 31 verses,<ref>Kazimirski's text omits verse 13.</ref> all with the same rhyme. The first ten lines praise the beauty and skill of a harpist who is playing at the autumn festival of Mehrgan. Lines 11\u201316 describe the fierceness and warlike qualities of Manuchehr, to whom the poem is addressed, and lines 17\u201323 describe the ruler's splendid war horse. The poet goes on to encourage Manuchehr to enjoy the feast and ends with a prayer that his career will continue to be successful and glorious.\n\nThe poem is notable for its musical rhymes, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang \u010dang ... sang sang ... tang tang}}, which imitate the thrumming of the harp (''[[chang (instrument)|chang]]'') and play on different meanings of the words. As with many of Manuchehri's poems he expresses his delight in the feast and the joys of life.<ref>Cf. Shokrpour et al (2014).</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nManuchehri's patron, after whom he took his pen-name Manuchehri, [[Manuchihr|Manuchehr]] son of Qabus, was ruler of the region of [[Tabaristan]], also known as [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], on the south side of the Caspian Sea. Manuchehr was not completely independent, but was a vassal of Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (d. 1030). The title Espahbad or Espahbod was given to an army commander or minor ruler not directly appointed by the Sultan, but who was a vassal like Manuchehr or his father.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 360.</ref> The title goes back to pre-Islamic times.<ref>Browne (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n\nManuchehr died c. 1030, so the poem was evidently written therefore before this date. Sometime after Manuchehr's death, Manuchehri migrated to [[Ghazni]] (in present day Afghanistan) where be became a court poet to Mahmud's son, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]].\n\nThe poem was written to celebrate [[Mehregan|Mehrg\u0101n]] (also pronounced Mehreg\u0101n or Mehrag\u0101n), an autumn festival dating back to pre-Islamic times which is held 195 days after the spring festival of [[Nowruz]].\n\n==Sex of the harpist==\nThe sex of the harpist is not completely clear. Although harpists were often illustrated as female, yet the instrument was also played by men: both [[Rudaki]]<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref> and Manuchehri's contemporary [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] are said to have been excellent harpists.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 124.</ref> It was possible for the same person to be both a soldier and to play the harp, as this verse of Farrokhi, in another ''qasida'' using the rhyme ''-ang'' and playing on the two meanings of {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u010dang}}, makes clear:<ref>Quoted by EIr (2004); cf.

The transcription shows the modern Iranian pronunciation. The letter ''x'' is used for ''kh'' (as in Khayyam), ''q'' for both ''qeyn'' and ''gh\u0101f''; \" ' \" is a glottal stop. \n\nThe metre of the poem is known as ''ramal''; in Elwell-Sutton's classification 2.4.15 (see [[Persian metres]]). In most lines there is a break or ''[[caesura]]'' after the 7th syllable, but in some lines the break is after the 8th or 6th. The pattern is as follows (\u2013 = long syllable, u = short syllable):\n: \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 u \u2013\n\nOverlong syllables (which take up the

several meanings: (1) a harp; (2) a hand with fingers bent; (3) anything crooked or bent; (4) the talon of a bird or claws of a wild animal; (5) a person crippled in hand or foot.<ref>\u0654F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=400 p. 400].</ref>\n\nKazimirski translates {{lang|fa-Latn|sang}} (literally, a stone) as \"the stone which weighs on the heart\" and \"the burden of his griefs ({{lang|fr|le fardeau de ses chagrins}})\".<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The author of EIr (2004) translates it as \"self-restraint\".\n\nA ''[[parasang|farsang]]'', which Ancient Greek authors called a parasang, is a unit equivalent to the distance travelled in an hour, still used today. In modern times it is defined as a distance of 6 km (about 3.7 miles), but in the past it varied with the terrain. The European equivalent was the [[league (unit)|league]].\n\n===Verse 2===\nThe word {{lang|fa-Latn|tang}} also has several meanings.<ref>F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=330 page 330].</ref> These include (1) narrow, straight, tight; (2) a horse-girth or strap for fastening on a load; (3) half a load (as much as is carried upon one side of an animal). \n\n{{lang|fa-Latn|bartang}} is the upper strap or over-strap used for tying on a load.\n\nThe harp is seen metaphorically as a horse which the player is riding. The strings of a harp were often made of horsehair. \"Since harp strings were usually made of horsehair, Man\u016b\u010dehr\u012b likens a harp to a horse \u201cwith its head up and its mane down\u201d.<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref>.\n\n===Verse 4===\nIt is a frequent metaphor of Persian love poetry that the curly locks ({{lang|fa-Latn|zolf}}) of the beloved keep the lover in bondage.<ref>J.

Browne relates a story of how Sultan Mahmud cut off the locks of his favourite slave boy Ayaz when drunk and was in a very bad mood the following day.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 38.</ref>\n\n===Verse 5===\nThe meaning of this verse is obscure. Kazimirski suggests that it means that \"an Ethiopian (a race known to be constantly joyful) has put his hand in the harpist's and is moving it so rapidly over the instrument that the hands appear to be invisible, as if they have been cut off.\" However, this is not certain.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|Zang\u012b}} is the word generally used in Persian poetry for a negro or black man. It is also chosen here for its rhyme with {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}.\n\n===Verse 7===\n[[R\u00fbm|R\u016bm]] was the name given to the remnant of the former Roman empire (by this time Greek-speaking) in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), hence {{lang|fa-Latn|R\u016bm\u012b}} means \"Greek\" or from Asia Minor.

However, \"blood\" is not one of the meanings given for {{lang|fa-Latn|rang}} in Steingass's dictionary. Dehkhoda's dictionary quotes this verse as an example of the meaning \"rays of the sun\".<ref>Dehkhoda, ''Loqatn\u0101me'', [http://www.vajehyab.com/dehkhoda/%D8%B2%D9%86%DA%AF \"\u0632\u0646\u06af\".]</ref>\n\n===Verse 10===\n[[Fereydun|Fereidun]] was a mythical ancient Iranian king, whose life is described in Ferdowsi's [[Shahnameh]].

It is also known as {{lang|fa-Latn|Dar mahd-e Espahbad Man\u016bchehr ebn-e Q\u0101b\u016bs}} ({{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u062f\u062d \u0627\u0633\u067e\u0647\u0628\u062f \u0645\u0646\u0648\u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0622\u0628\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0628\u0648\u0633}}) \"In praise of the Espahbad Manuchehr son of Qabus\", or [[Qasida]] no. 39 in the collected works of Manuchehri.<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ Qasida 39] (Ganjoor website).</ref>\n\nThe poem is a ''[[qasida|qas\u012bda]]'' (praise poem) in the Arabic style, consisting of 30 or 31 verses,<ref>Kazimirski's text omits verse 13.</ref> all with the same rhyme. The first ten lines praise the beauty and skill of a harpist who is playing at the autumn festival of Mehrgan. Lines 11\u201316 describe the fierceness and warlike qualities of Manuchehr, to whom the poem is addressed, and lines 17\u201323 describe the ruler's splendid war horse. The poet goes on to encourage Manuchehr to enjoy the feast and ends with a prayer that his career will continue to be successful and glorious.\n\nThe poem is notable for its musical rhymes, such as {{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang \u010dang ... sang sang ... tang tang}}, which imitate the thrumming of the harp (''[[chang (instrument)|chang]]'') and play on different meanings of the words. As with many of Manuchehri's poems he expresses his delight in the feast and the joys of life.<ref>Cf. Shokrpour et al (2014).</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nManuchehri's patron, after whom he took his pen-name Manuchehri, [[Manuchihr|Manuchehr]] son of Qabus, was ruler of the region of [[Tabaristan]], also known as [[Mazandaran Province|Mazandaran]], on the south side of the Caspian Sea. Manuchehr was not completely independent, but was a vassal of Sultan [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (d. 1030). The title Espahbad or Espahbod was given to an army commander or minor ruler not directly appointed by the Sultan, but who was a vassal like Manuchehr or his father.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 360.</ref> The title goes back to pre-Islamic times.<ref>Browne (1906), p. 92.</ref>\n\nManuchehr died c. 1030, so the poem was evidently written therefore before this date. Sometime after Manuchehr's death, Manuchehri migrated to [[Ghazni]] (in present day Afghanistan) where be became a court poet to Mahmud's son, [[Mas'ud I of Ghazni]].\n\nThe poem was written to celebrate the autumn festival of [[Mehregan|Mehrg\u0101n]] (also pronounced Mehreg\u0101n or Mehrag\u0101n), a festival dating back to pre-Islamic times which is held 195 days after the spring festival of [[Nowruz]].\n\n==Sex of the harpist==\nThe sex of the harpist is not completely clear. Although harpists were often illustrated as female, yet the instrument was also played by men: both [[Rudaki]]<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref> and Manuchehri's contemporary [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] are said to have been excellent harpists.<ref>Browne (1906), vol. 2, p. 124.</ref> It was possible for the same person to be both a soldier and to play the harp, as this verse of Farrokhi, in another ''qasida'' using the rhyme ''-ang'' and playing on the two meanings of {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u010dang}}, makes clear:<ref>Quoted by EIr (2004); cf.

In most lines there is a break or ''[[caesura]]'' after the 7th syllable, but in some lines the break is after the 8th or 6th.

several meanings: (1) a harp; (2) a hand with fingers bent; (3) anything crooked or bent; (4) the talon of a bird or claws of a wild animal; (5) a person crippled in hand or foot.<ref>\u0654F.

In modern times it is defined as a distance of 6 km (about 3.7 miles), but in the past it varied with the terrain. The European equivalent was the [[league (unit)|league]].\n\n===Verse 2===\nThe word {{lang|fa-Latn|tang}} also has several meanings.<ref>F. J. Steingass (1892), ''A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary'', [https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/steingass_query.py?page=330 page 330].</ref> These include (1) narrow, straight, tight; (2) a horse-girth or strap for fastening on a load; (3) half a load (as much as is carried upon one side of an animal). \n\n{{lang|fa-Latn|bartang}} is the upper strap or over-strap used for tying on a load.\n\nThe harp is seen metaphorically as a horse which the player is riding. The strings of a harp were often made of horsehair. \"Since harp strings were usually made of horsehair, Man\u016b\u010dehr\u012b likens a harp to a horse \u201cwith its head up and its mane down\u201d.<ref>Mallah (1990).</ref>.\n\n===Verse 4===\nIt is a frequent metaphor of Persian love poetry that the curly locks ({{lang|fa-Latn|zolf}}) of the beloved keep the lover in bondage.<ref>J.

Kazimirski suggests that it means that \"an Ethiopian (a race known to be constantly joyful) has put his hand in the harpist's and is moving it so rapidly over the instrument that the hands appear to be invisible, as if they have been cut off.\" However, this is not certain.<ref>Kazimirski (1886), p. 361.</ref> The word {{lang|fa-Latn|Zang\u012b}} is the word generally used in Persian poetry for a negro or black man.

Because of the General's commitment to his marriage, the couple's love remained unconsummated. Now faced by the reality of retirement with his hypochondriac wife, the General finds himself lost in fond memories of his old flirtation. When Ghislaine suddenly reappears, he is delighted \u2014 until he finds himself competing for her hand with a considerably younger suitor.\n\n==Background==\nThe General and his mad wife had previously appeared in Anouilh's 1948 play ''[[Ard\u00e8le ou la Marguerite]]'', and a further variant on the character appeared in the 1958 comedy ''L'Hurluberlu, ou le R\u00e9actionnaire amoureux''. By the time of Anouilh's last play, ''Le Nombril'' (1981), L\u00e9on St P\u00e9 had transformed into a grouchy and unfashionable old playwright obviously intended by Anouilh as a cynical self-portrait.\n\n==Stage productions==\n''The Waltz of the Toreadors'' premiered in Paris at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es on 8 January 1952, with Claude Sainval and Marie Ventura in the leading roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regietheatrale.com/index/index/programmes/programmes.php?recordID=133&La |title=Programmes originaux de th\u00e9\u00e2tre - La Valse des Tor\u00e9adors de Jean ANOUILH - Com\u00e9die des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es 1952 |publisher=Regietheatrale.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref> Four years later, it premiered in [[London]] in an English translation by Lucienne Hill.

There are scenes of pure horror and there are scenes of pure comedy, and M Anouilh modulates between them with an absolutely sure touch.\" According to the ''[[News Chronicle]]'', \"the play, though deplorable, is a bit of a masterpiece.\" \"This farce,\" added ''[[The Times]]'', \"has a bitter, some will say sour, flavour, but even those who resent its hard realism will be highly amused in spite of themselves, for a resourceful wit is supported by a brilliant sense of the theatre.\"<ref>quotes taken from the Elek Books edition of ''The Waltz of the Toreadors'', London 1956</ref>\n\nA [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, directed by [[Harold Clurman]], opened on 17 January 1957 at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theatre|Coronet Theatre]], where it ran for 132 performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=2603|title=The Waltz of the Toreadors - IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information|author=The Broadway League|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref> The cast included [[Ralph Richardson]] as the General, his real-life wife Meriel Forbes as Ghislaine, and [[Mildred Natwick]] as Mme St P\u00e9.

Because of the General's commitment to his marriage, the couple's love remained unconsummated. Now faced by the reality of retirement with his hypochondriac wife, the General finds himself lost in fond memories of his old flirtation. When Ghislaine suddenly reappears, he is delighted \u2014 until he finds himself competing for her hand with a considerably younger suitor.\n\n==Background==\nThe General and his mad wife had previously appeared in Anouilh's 1948 play ''[[Ard\u00e8le ou la Marguerite]]'', and a further variant on the character appeared in the 1958 comedy ''L'Hurluberlu, ou le R\u00e9actionnaire amoureux''. By the time of Anouilh's last play, ''Le Nombril'' (1981), L\u00e9on St P\u00e9 had transformed into a grouchy and unfashionable old playwright obviously intended by Anouilh as a cynical self-portrait.\n\n==Stage productions==\n''The Waltz of the Toreadors'' premiered in Paris at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es on 8 January 1952, with Claude Sainval and Marie Ventura in the leading roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regietheatrale.com/index/index/programmes/programmes.php?recordID=133&La |title=Programmes originaux de th\u00e9\u00e2tre - La Valse des Tor\u00e9adors de Jean ANOUILH - Com\u00e9die des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es 1952 |publisher=Regietheatrale.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-09}}</ref> Four years later, it premiered in [[London]] in an English translation by Lucienne Hill.

A pair of Fats Waller romps are decked out in New Orleans brass and pianos, one of them played by Allen Toussaint.\"<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n===Grammy Awards===\nThe track Run Back to Your Side was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance|Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]] at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]], held on 13 February 2011.\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"Travelin' Alone\" ([[Melvin Jackson|Lil' Son Jackson]]) \u2013 3:56\n# \"[[Rockin' Chair (1929 song)|Rocking Chair]]\" ([[Hoagy Carmichael]]) \u2013 4:04\n# \"River Runs Deep\" ([[J.J.

Irving Berlin's \"How Deep Is the Ocean\" comes with an earnest, sandy Clapton vocal and lighthouse beams of trumpet by Wynton Marsalis. Little Walter's \"Can't Hold Out Much Longer\" has the crusty flair of Clapton's 1965 and '66 recordings with John Mayall.

{"title_page": "Black body", "text_new": "{{short description|Idealised physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation}}\n{{For| the radiation from a black body in thermal equilibrium|Black-body radiation}}\n\n[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|As the temperature of a black body decreases, its intensity also decreases and its peak moves to longer wavelengths. Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon\u2013photon interactions]]<ref name=Karplus>Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,\"The Scattering of Light by Light\", Phys. Rev. 83, 776\u2013784 (1951)</ref> are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.<ref name=Bergmann/> Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,<ref name=boson/> and as described by the [[H-theorem]],<ref name=Tolman/> under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.\n\n===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===\nA body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission \u03c4, absorption \u03b1, and reflection \u03c1.\n \nThe boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.\n<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev, Lev N., Lemanskii, Aleksander A. |first1=. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 [in Russian] |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[Impedance matching|impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[angle of incidence]]. In 1911, Macdonald H.M. proposed nearly self-evident approach.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macdonald |first1=Hector Muaro |title=The Effect Produced by an Obstacle on a Train of Electric Waves (A Perfectly Absorbing Obstacle) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1912 |volume=212 |issue=Series A |pages=484-496 |url=http://doi.org/10.1098/rsta1913.0010}}</ref> He used two well formulated problems in electrodynamics-  that of reflection from ideal metal:  \n: <math> \\mathbf E_{\\tau} = 0 </math>,\nand that of reflection from ideal magnetic:\n: <math> \\mathbf H_{\\tau} = 0 </math>.\nHalf-sum of solutions is the field around the black-body in  Macdonald's model. The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography <ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />. \n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]]. Therefore, the problem is got to be spacious  instead of surface one. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sommerfeld |first1=Arnold |title=Theoretishes \u00fcber die Beugung der R\u00f6ntgen Strahlen |journal=Zeitchrift f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik- Wikisource |date=1901 |volume=Band 46 |pages=ss.11-97 |url=http://de.wikisource.org>wiki>Zeitschrift_f\u00fcr_Ma}}</ref>\n\nThe idea to continue physical space was developed later. In 1978, Sergei P. Efimov from [[Bauman Moscow State Technical  University]] found that Macdonald's model is equivalent to that with symmetrical adjunct space. \n<ref name=\"Efimov>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Absolutely black-body in diffraction theory |journal=Radio Engineering & Electronic Physics |date=1978 |volume=23 |issue=Jan. |pages=6-13 |url=http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1978RaEI...23....7E}} Stanford libraries 621.38405.R(33)</ref>\nThe spaces  are connected formally on the surface of black-body. Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems with changing sign of the magnetic component. In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scatter of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babine's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics, for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions  is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916-920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 |url=https://www.link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01031726}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234-238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru_1979_ 234-238.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Black-body of arbitrary form===\n[[Anechoic chamber|Non-reflecting chamber]] has absolutely absorbing walls. Regarding physical picture, adjunct space now is simply  the surrounding space as far as the walls are missed. Therefore, adjunct spaces for the totally convex surface and  concave one are identical. The adjunct space is continued along normal directed into side of convexity of surface. Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface. The condition is based on [[Fourier optics|Stratton - Chu formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stratton, J.A., Chu, L.J. |title=Diffraction Theory of Electromagnetic Waves |journal=Physical Review, Am.

Fields on the surface are bound by [[Green's function]] in two points - <math>\\mathbf x</math> and <math>\\mathbf y </math>:\n:<math> G(\\mathbf {x,y}) = \\frac{\\exp (\\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid})}{4 \\pi (\\mathbf {\\mid x-y \\mid}) }.    </math>\nLet be charges (or radiation sources) are placed in non-reflecting chamber i.e. in free space. Green's formula defines field <math> u(\\mathbf x) </math> in adjunct space by boundary values on the surface of non-reflecting chamber. Upon sending argument <math>\\mathbf x</math> on the surface, formula gives boundary condition:\n:<math> \\frac {u(\\mathbf x)}{2}= \\iint\\limits_{S,\\, y \\neq x    }\\left[ { G(\\mathbf{x,y})\\frac { \\partial u(\\mathbf y)}{\\partial n_y} -u(\\mathbf y) \\frac{\\partial G(\\mathbf{x,y)}  }{\\partial n_y  }       }\\right]        \\,dS_y   .</math>\nThe [[surface integral|surface integral]]    is calculated in the sense of [[Hadamard regularization]]. Normal <math> n_y </math> is directed outside of chamber i.e. in side of convexity of surface. Vector <math> \\mathbf x </math> lays on the surface.\n\nBoundary condition for convex black-body (for example ball) is the same. It is necessary however to take the  normal directed outside of convex surface.\n\nAt last, boundary condition for arbitrary surface, containing convex  and concave  parts, conserves its form under condition that normal is directed into side of convexity. Therefore, the normal changes its sign on different parts of surface.\n\n==Realizations==\nA ''realization'' of a black body refers to a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsanm.9b01950 Viney Ghai, Harpreet Singh, and Prabhat K. Agnihotri, ''Dandelion-Like Carbon Nanotubes for Near-Perfect Black Surfaces,'' ACS Applied Nano Particles]</ref> all absorb 99.9% of light or more.\n\n===Stars and planets===\n{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}\n\n[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the radius of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface.

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon\u2013photon interactions]]<ref name=Karplus>Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,\"The Scattering of Light by Light\", Phys. Rev. 83, 776\u2013784 (1951)</ref> are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.<ref name=Bergmann/> Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,<ref name=boson/> and as described by the [[H-theorem]],<ref name=Tolman/> under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.\n\n===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===\nA body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission \u03c4, absorption \u03b1, and reflection \u03c1.\n \nThe boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.\n<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev, Lev N., Lemanskii, Aleksander A. |first1=. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 [in Russian] |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[Impedance matching|impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[angle of incidence]]. In 1911, Macdonald H.M. proposed nearly self-evident approach.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macdonald |first1=Hector Muaro |title=The Effect Produced by an Obstacle on a Train of Electric Waves (A Perfectly Absorbing Obstacle) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1912 |volume=212 |issue=Series A |pages=484-496 |url=http://doi.org/10.1098/rsta1913.0010}}</ref> He used two well formulated problems in electrodynamics-  that of reflection from ideal metal:  \n: <math> \\mathbf E_{\\tau} = 0 </math>,\nand that of reflection from ideal magnetic:\n: <math> \\mathbf H_{\\tau} = 0 </math>.\nHalf-sum of solutions is the field around the black-body in  Macdonald's model. The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography <ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />. \n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]]. Therefore, the problem is got to be spacious  instead of surface one. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sommerfeld |first1=Arnold |title=Theoretishes \u00fcber die Beugung der R\u00f6ntgen Strahlen |journal=Zeitchrift f\u00fcr Mathematik und Physik- Wikisource |date=1901 |volume=Band 46 |pages=ss.11-97 |url=http://de.wikisource.org>wiki>Zeitschrift_f\u00fcr_Ma}}</ref>\n\nThe idea to continue physical space was developed later. In 1978, Sergei P.

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems with changing sign of the magnetic component. In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scatter of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babine's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics, for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions  is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations. \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916-920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 |url=https://www.link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01031726}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234-238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru_1979_ 234-238.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of adjunct space can be applied to the [[Black-hole|black hole]] in theory of [[General relativity| gravitation]].

It is [[Inversion in a sphere]] of radius <math> a </math>. Radius <math> a </math> is taken to give the  Schwarzschild metrics again:\n:<math> a =\\frac{r^s}{4} </math>.\nTherefore, the black hole can be considered as the connection of two symmetrical spaces on the surface of ball with radius <math> a </math>. In that case, well known singularity point <math> R =0 </math>  is disappeared. \n===Black-body of arbitrary form===\n[[Anechoic chamber|Non-reflecting chamber]] has absolutely absorbing walls. Regarding physical picture, adjunct space now is simply  the surrounding space as far as the walls are missed. Therefore, adjunct spaces for the totally convex surface and  concave one are identical. The adjunct space is continued along normal directed into side of convexity of surface. Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface. The condition is based on [[Fourier optics|Stratton - Chu formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stratton, J.A., Chu, L.J. |title=Diffraction Theory of Electromagnetic Waves |journal=Physical Review, Am.

Upon sending argument <math>\\mathbf x</math> on the surface, formula gives boundary condition:\n:<math> \\frac {u(\\mathbf x)}{2}= \\iint\\limits_{S,\\, y \\neq x    }\\left[ { G(\\mathbf{x,y})\\frac { \\partial u(\\mathbf y)}{\\partial n_y} -u(\\mathbf y) \\frac{\\partial G(\\mathbf{x,y)}  }{\\partial n_y  }       }\\right]        \\,dS_y   .</math>\nThe [[surface integral|surface integral]]    is calculated in the sense of [[Hadamard regularization]]. Normal <math> n_y </math> is directed outside of chamber i.e. in side of convexity of surface. Vector <math> \\mathbf x </math> lays on the surface.\n\nBoundary condition for convex black-body (for example ball) is the same. It is necessary however to take the  normal directed outside of convex surface.\n\nAt last, boundary condition for arbitrary surface, containing convex  and concave  parts, conserves its form under condition that normal is directed into side of convexity. Therefore, the normal changes its sign on different parts of surface.\n\n==Realizations==\nA ''realization'' of a black body refers to a real world, physical embodiment. Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsanm.9b01950 Viney Ghai, Harpreet Singh, and Prabhat K. Agnihotri, ''Dandelion-Like Carbon Nanotubes for Near-Perfect Black Surfaces,'' ACS Applied Nano Particles]</ref> all absorb 99.9% of light or more.\n\n===Stars and planets===\n{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}\n\n[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the radius of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.<ref name=Lewin/> An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.<ref name=Mason/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]\n* [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n* [[Vantablack]], a substance produced in 2014 and the blackest known\n* [[Planckian locus]], black body incandescence in a given chromaticity space\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adkins\">\n{{cite book |author=Clement John Adkins |chapter=\u00a74.1 The function of the second law |title=Equilibrium thermodynamics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW4Oz48TWwQC&pg=PA50 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-521-27456-2 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aller>\n{{cite book |title=Atoms, stars, and nebulae |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HupvoeJDCGoC&pg=PA61 |page=61 |author=Lawrence Hugh Aller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31040-6 |edition=3rd |year=1991}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batrouni>\nIn simple cases the approach to equilibrium is governed by a [[relaxation time]].
