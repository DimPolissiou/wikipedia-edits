Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalization of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH\u2014called Chess Boxing Global, CBG\u2014was founded, that {{as of|2013|May|lc=y}}, is responsible for organizing all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\n\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professionals reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as [[Marco Huck]]'s and [[Yoan Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez]]' sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division-winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate.

Chess and boxing rounds alternate, and a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a [[time control]] of 9 minutes with no [[Fischer delay|increment]] to make all their moves ([[blitz chess]]). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\n* Victory by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]] in boxing\n* Victory by [[checkmate]] in chess\n* Loss due to exceeding the chess game's [[time control]]\n* Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).\n**This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other\n* Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)\n\nIn the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]], the fighter who is ahead on boxing [[Points decision|points]] wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the [[White and Black in chess|black]] chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the [[first-move advantage in chess]]). This has not yet occurred in practice.\n\n=== Weight classes ===\nLike [[Weight class (boxing)|boxing]], chessboxers are divided into [[weight class]]es. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ({{as of|2014|October|lc=y}}):\n\n==== Men (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 154.324&nbsp;lbs (70 kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 176.37&nbsp;lbs (80&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 198.416&nbsp;lbs (90&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)<ref>Chess Boxing Global: [http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ CBG Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905052145/http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ |date=2016-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==== Women (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 121.254&nbsp;lbs (55&nbsp;kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 143.3&nbsp;lbs (65&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 165.347&nbsp;lbs (75&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg)\n\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.\n\n== Particular requirements and training ==\nA chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an [[Elo rating]] of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.\n\nIn order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout.  They will use exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\n\n== Champions ==\n{{further|List of Chess boxing champions}}\n\nBetween 2003\u20132013, the chessboxing world championships were organised by the WCBO. {{as of|2013}}, they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\n\n=== WCBO (2003\u20132012) ===\n\n==== World champions ====\n* 2003: Iepe Rubingh {{NLD}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Amsterdam against Jean Louis Veenstra {{NLD}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/you-thought-we-were-making-it-up- Chessboxing Amsterdam]</ref>\n* 2007: Frank Stoldt {{DEU}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against David Depto {{USA}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/cheboxing-world-championship-2008-in-berlin Stoldt vs. Depto]</ref>\n* 2008: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Frank Stoldt {{DEU}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-ruians-are-coming-in-cheboxing Stoldt vs. Sazhin]</ref>\n* 2009: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Krasnoyarsk against Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}}<ref>Iepe.net: [http://www.iepe.net/dada/mail.cgi/archive/WCBO/20091203163513/ Sazhin vs. Chernobaev]</ref>\n\n==== European champions ====\n* 2005: [[Tihomir Dovramadjiev]] {{BGR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Andreas Dilschneider {{DEU}}<ref>Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42736496.html Dilschneider Teasertext]</ref>\n* 2010: Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in London against Andrew Costello {{GBR}}\n* 2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Darius Rolkis {{LTU}}\n*2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Dmitri Pechurin {{RUS}}\n* 2016: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Daniel Wakeham  {{GBR}}\n\n=== CBG (starting 2013) ===\n{{update section|date=May 2017}}\n* 2013: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in Moscow against Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}}\n* 2013: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Moscow against Shaliesh Tripathi {{IND}}\n* 2013: Sven Rooch {{DEU}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Moscow against Jonathan Rodriguez Vega {{ESP}}\n\n== Major organizations ==\n\n=== World Chess Boxing Organisation ===\nThe [[World Chess Boxing Organisation|World Chess Boxing Organisation e.V.]] (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organisation for international amateur chessboxing.

Furthermore, the third chessboxing organization in the United States, USA Chessboxing, was founded in 2011 and the European movement was being reinforced by the foundation of the Italian Chessboxing Federation in 2012. What's more, the professionalization of chessboxing started to take shape in the second decade of the 21st century. In addition to the WCBO that became a registered association under German law in 2014, the Chess Boxing Global Marketing CBGM GmbH\u2014called Chess Boxing Global, CBG\u2014was founded, that {{as of|2013|May|lc=y}}, is responsible for organizing all of the professional chessboxing fights worldwide and above all, for the organization of the Chess Boxing World Championships.\n\nThe Chess Boxing Organisation India was founded in 2011 by kickboxing official and former Indian kickboxing and karate champion Montu Das. With this, the growth of chessboxing in Asia gained momentum with the first Chess Boxing Organisation in Western Asia already being built in the following year by another experienced official in the kickboxing world: Fereydoun Pouya started the Chess Boxing Organisation Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the process of turning chessboxing professionals reached a milestone: The 2013 World Championship in Moscow was the first chessboxing event organized and marketed by Chess Boxing Global. With three world championship fights in one night, more than 1200 spectators and a standard of fighting never seen before, the first CBG event set new standards in the history of chessboxing with Leonid Chernobaev leading the way. He has been able to make a name for himself with more than 15 years of chess playing experience and in the boxing world, as [[Marco Huck]]'s and [[Yoan Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez]]' sparring partner and having fought over 200 amateur bouts. He won the light heavyweight title against Indian fighter Shailesh Tripathi after a technical knockout in the 8th round (boxing). Sven Rooch secured his title in the middleweight class division-winning against Jonatan Rodriguez Vega after the Spaniard resigned in the 7th round (chess) and Russian Nikolay Sazhin won the heavyweight title against Gianluca Sirci by checkmate. Thus, Sazhin (Heavyweight), Chernobaev (Light heavyweight) and Rooch (Middleweight) would all go down in Chess Boxing history as the first Chess Boxing Global World Champions.

Chess and boxing rounds alternate, and a full-distance contest begins and ends with a round of chess. Each round lasts three minutes, regardless of whether it involves chess or boxing. A single chess game is played over the six chess rounds. These total 18 minutes; each player is subject to a [[time control]] of 9 minutes with no [[Fischer delay|increment]] to make all their moves ([[blitz chess]]). After each chess round, the exact setup is digitally recorded and then repositioned before the following chess round. The breaks between the chess and boxing rounds usually last 60 seconds. The duration of the rounds and overall fight time in amateur chessboxing fights can change to some degree, as in for example youth tournaments and exhibition fights.\n\n=== Decisions ===\nA chessboxing match can end by any of the following:\n* Victory by [[knockout]] or [[technical knockout]] in boxing\n* Victory by [[checkmate]] in chess\n* Loss due to exceeding the chess game's [[time control]]\n* Victory due to disqualification of his or her opponent by the referee e.g. due to inactivity due to overextended playing time (chess or boxing rounds following multiple warnings).\n**This rule prevents a player who is in an obviously lost position in one arena from stalling in order to attempt to win in the other\n* Loss by resignation (chess or boxing rounds)\n\nIn the case that neither of the chessboxers win in regulation time and the chess game ends in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]], the fighter who is ahead on boxing [[Points decision|points]] wins the overall bout. In case the scoreboard is also tied, the fighter that used the [[White and Black in chess|black]] chess pieces will be named the winner (due to the [[first-move advantage in chess]]). This has not yet occurred in practice.\n\n=== Weight classes ===\nLike [[Weight class (boxing)|boxing]], chessboxers are divided into [[weight class]]es. Currently, the following apply to professional chessboxing events of Chess Boxing Global ({{as of|2014|October|lc=y}}):\n\n==== Men (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 154.324&nbsp;lbs (70 kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 176.37&nbsp;lbs (80&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 198.416&nbsp;lbs (90&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 198.416+ lbs (90+ kg)<ref>Chess Boxing Global: [http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ CBG Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905052145/http://www.chessboxing-global.com/about/ |date=2016-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n==== Women (17 years+) ====\n* Lightweight: max. 121.254&nbsp;lbs (55&nbsp;kg)\n* Middleweight: max. 143.3&nbsp;lbs (65&nbsp;kg)\n* Light heavyweight: max. 165.347&nbsp;lbs (75&nbsp;kg)\n* Heavyweight: 165.347+ lbs (75+ kg)\n\nFor amateur and youth chessboxing bouts under the flag of the WCBO weight classes are graduated in 5-kilo-steps. In exception event hosts can classify into 10-kilo-steps.\n\n== Particular requirements and training ==\nA chess boxer must have strong skills in both chess and boxing in order to be permitted to compete in a professional chess boxing fight. The current minimum requirements to fight in a Chess Boxing Global event include an [[Elo rating]] of 1600 and a record of at least 50 amateur bouts fought in boxing or another similar martial art. One deciding factor in chess boxing is that the fighters have to mainly train in speed chess; the skills required by speed chess are different from those for chess using classical time controls. However, chess boxing is not only the ability to master both sports but above all, being able to withstand the constant switch from a full contact sport to a thinking sport, round after round. After three minutes of boxing, pulses are racing, yet the opponents have to face each other at the chessboard barely having taken a break, and have to then perform calmly and think tactically. This switch becomes increasingly hard for the athletes as the fight goes on and they become tired.\n\nIn order to train these skills, a specialised chess boxing training is used, in which physical interval training forms are combined with blitz or speed chess games. Thereby the fighters adapt the rhythm of a chessboxing bout.  They will use exercises like \"track chess\" and \"stair chess\" in which training partners will play an 18-minute game of speed chess over six rounds with intensive running exercises in between, such as 400-meter sprints or stair sprints. Other common methods of training combine speed chess games with strength exercises such as push-ups. The classic chess boxing training is box sparring combined with a game of speed chess.\n\n== Champions ==\n{{further|List of Chess boxing champions}}\n\nBetween 2003\u20132013, the chessboxing world championships were organised by the WCBO. {{as of|2013}}, they take the form of professional events under the auspices of Chess Boxing Global.\n\n=== WCBO (2003\u20132012) ===\n\n==== World champions ====\n* 2003: Iepe Rubingh {{NLD}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Amsterdam against Jean Louis Veenstra {{NLD}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/you-thought-we-were-making-it-up- Chessboxing Amsterdam]</ref>\n* 2007: Frank Stoldt {{DEU}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against David Depto {{USA}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/cheboxing-world-championship-2008-in-berlin Stoldt vs. Depto]</ref>\n* 2008: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Frank Stoldt {{DEU}}<ref>Chessbase: [http://en.chessbase.com/post/the-ruians-are-coming-in-cheboxing Stoldt vs. Sazhin]</ref>\n* 2009: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Krasnoyarsk against Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}}<ref>Iepe.net: [http://www.iepe.net/dada/mail.cgi/archive/WCBO/20091203163513/ Sazhin vs. Chernobaev]</ref>\n\n==== European champions ====\n* 2005: [[Tihomir Dovramadjiev]] {{BGR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Berlin against Andreas Dilschneider {{DEU}}<ref>Spiegel: [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42736496.html Dilschneider Teasertext]</ref>\n* 2010: Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in London against Andrew Costello {{GBR}}\n* 2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Darius Rolkis {{LTU}}\n*2015: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Dmitri Pechurin {{RUS}}\n* 2016: Sergio Leveque {{ITA}} - Heavyweight, in London against Daniel Wakeham  {{GBR}}\n\n=== CBG (starting 2013) ===\n{{update section|date=May 2017}}\n* 2013: Nikolay Sazhin {{RUS}} \u2013 Heavyweight, in Moscow against Gianluca Sirci {{ITA}}\n* 2013: Leonid Chernobaev {{BLR}} \u2013 Light heavyweight, in Moscow against Shaliesh Tripathi {{IND}}\n* 2013: Sven Rooch {{DEU}} \u2013 Middleweight, in Moscow against Jonathan Rodriguez Vega {{ESP}}\n\n== Major organizations ==\n\n=== World Chess Boxing Organisation ===\nThe [[World Chess Boxing Organisation|World Chess Boxing Organisation e.V.]] (WCBO) is the leading umbrella organisation for international amateur chessboxing.
