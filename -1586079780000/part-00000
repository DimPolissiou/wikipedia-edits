He was the son of Mir Nawab Khan Tanoli.\n\nFrom about 1813, Painda Khan Tanoli spent a lifelong rebellion against the Sikhs, who, realizing the potential dangers of his rebellion, set up forts at strategic locations to keep him in check. Hari Singh Nalwa took this initiative during his governorship. In order to consolidate his hold on Tanawal and to unite the Tanoli people, Painda Khan Tanoli had to first contend with his major rivals within the tribe itself, i.e. the chiefs of the Suba Khani/Pallal khel section, whom he subdued after a bitter struggle.\n\nPainda Khan set the tone for the regional resistance in Upper Hazara against Sikh rule. In 1828 he created and gifted the smaller neighbouring state of Phulra to his younger brother Madad Khan Tanoli.\n\nPainda Khan also briefly took over the valley of Agror in 1834. The Swatis inhabiting it appealed to Sardar Hari Singh, who was unable to help them but in 1841, Hari Singh's successor restored Agror to Ata Muhammad Khan, the chief of that area, a descendant of Akhund Ahmed Sad-ud-din. <ref>Hazara Gazetteer</ref>\n\n'''[[Mir Jehandad Khan|Jehandad Khan Tanoli]]:'''\nWas the son of Mir Painda Khan Tanoli. In 1852, Jehandad Khan Tanoli was summoned by the President of the Board of Administration in relation to a murder enquiry of two British officers, supposedly on his lands. In fact, this related to the murder of two British Salt Tax collectors by some tribesmen in the neighbouring [[Kala Dhaka]] or Black Mountain area, which eventually led to the punitive First Black Mountain campaign/expedition of 1852. The President of the Board of Administration was [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Sir John Lawrence]], later to be the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and he visited [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]], in Hazara, where he invited many Hazara chiefs to see him, on various matters, at a general Durbar.<ref>See ''The Hazara District Gazetteer 1883-8'' (Lahore, 1884); and H. Lee, ''Brothers in the Raj: The Lives of John and Henry Lawrence'' (Karachi: Oxford UP, 2002)</ref> Jehandad Khan Tanoli was able successfully to establish his innocence and consolidate his position.\n\nJahandad Khan Tanoli's relationship with [[British India]] is summed in the following lines in a letter dated 8 January 1859 from R. Temple, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, addressed to the Financial Commissioner of the Punjab: \"'5. The term \"Jagir\" has never appeared to me applicable in any sense to this [Jehandad Khan's] hereditary domain [Upper Tannowul], for it was never granted as such by the Sikhs or by our Government; we upheld the Khan as we found him in his position as a feudal lord and large proprietor.'\n\nJehandad's son, Nawab Bahadur Sir Muhammed Akram Khan Tanoli, was given the title of ''Nawab'' in perpetuity by the British.\n\n'''Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Akram Khan|Muhammad Akram Khan Tanoli]]:''' The next chief of the Tanolis, a son of Mir Jahandad Khan Tanoli, was Nawab Sir Akram Khan Tanoli [[Order of the Star of India|KCSI]] 68\u20131907). He was a popular chief, and it was during his tenure that the fort at Shergarh was constructed, along with Dogah and Shahkot Forts. His rule was a peaceful time for Tanawal, with no major conflicts. He opposed to construct schools in the state, a advice that was given by British.\n\n'''Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Khan Zaman Khan|Muhammad Khan Zaman Khan Tanoli]]:''' Nawab Khanizaman Khan Tanoli (K.C.I.E) succeeded his father,  taking over the reins of power in Tanawal in Amb. He helped the British in carrying out the later Black Mountain (Kala Dhaka/Tor Ghar) expeditions.\n\n'''Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Farid Khan|Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli]]:'''\nNawab Sir Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] had good relations with [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and Nawabzada Liaqat Ali Khan.

In order to consolidate his hold on Tanawal and to unite the Tanoli people, Painda Khan Tanoli had to first contend with his major rivals within the tribe itself, i.e. the chiefs of the Suba Khani/Pallal khel section, whom he subdued after a bitter struggle.\n\nPainda Khan set the tone for the regional resistance in Upper Hazara against Sikh rule. In 1828 he created and gifted the smaller neighbouring state of Phulra to his younger brother Madad Khan Tanoli.\n\nPainda Khan also briefly took over the valley of Agror in 1834. The Swatis inhabiting it appealed to Sardar Hari Singh, who was unable to help them but in 1841, Hari Singh's successor restored Agror to Ata Muhammad Khan, the chief of that area, a descendant of Akhund Ahmed Sad-ud-din. <ref>Hazara Gazetteer</ref>\n\n'''[[Mir Jehandad Khan|Jehandad Khan Tanoli]]:'''\nWas the son of Mir Painda Khan Tanoli. In 1852, Jehandad Khan Tanoli was summoned by the President of the Board of Administration in relation to a murder enquiry of two British officers, supposedly on his lands. In fact, this related to the murder of two British Salt Tax collectors by some tribesmen in the neighbouring [[Kala Dhaka]] or Black Mountain area, which eventually led to the punitive First Black Mountain campaign/expedition of 1852. The President of the Board of Administration was [[John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence|Sir John Lawrence]], later to be the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, and he visited [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]], in Hazara, where he invited many Hazara chiefs to see him, on various matters, at a general Durbar.<ref>See ''The Hazara District Gazetteer 1883-8'' (Lahore, 1884); and H. Lee, ''Brothers in the Raj: The Lives of John and Henry Lawrence'' (Karachi: Oxford UP, 2002)</ref> Jehandad Khan Tanoli was able successfully to establish his innocence and consolidate his position.\n\nJahandad Khan Tanoli's relationship with [[British India]] is summed in the following lines in a letter dated 8 January 1859 from R. Temple, Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, addressed to the Financial Commissioner of the Punjab: \"'5. The term \"Jagir\" has never appeared to me applicable in any sense to this [Jehandad Khan's] hereditary domain [Upper Tannowul], for it was never granted as such by the Sikhs or by our Government; we upheld the Khan as we found him in his position as a feudal lord and large proprietor.'\n\nJehandad's son, Nawab Bahadur Sir Muhammed Akram Khan Tanoli, was given the title of ''Nawab'' in perpetuity by the British.\n\n'''Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Akram Khan|Muhammad Akram Khan Tanoli]]:''' The next chief of the Tanolis, a son of Mir Jahandad Khan Tanoli, was Nawab Sir Akram Khan Tanoli [[Order of the Star of India|KCSI]] 68\u20131907). He was a popular chief, and it was during his tenure that the fort at Shergarh was constructed, along with Dogah and Shahkot Forts. His rule was a peaceful time for Tanawal, with no major conflicts. He opposed to construct schools in the state, a advice that was given by British.\n\n'''Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Khan Zaman Khan|Muhammad Khan Zaman Khan Tanoli]]:''' Nawab Khanizaman Khan Tanoli (K.C.I.E) succeeded his father,  taking over the reins of power in Tanawal in Amb. He helped the British in carrying out the later Black Mountain (Kala Dhaka/Tor Ghar) expeditions.\n\n'''Nawab Sir [[Muhammad Farid Khan|Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli]]:'''\nNawab Sir Muhammad Farid Khan Tanoli [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] had good relations with [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and Nawabzada Liaqat Ali Khan. His contributions to the Pakistan movement have been acknowledged by letters from the Quaid e Azam.<ref>Quaid-I-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah Papers: First Series, Volume III: On the Threshold of Pakistan,  1\u201325 July 1947\nBy Mahomed Ali Jinnah, Z.

In locales with telephone connection charges, each connection incurs an incremental cost. If calls are time-metered, the duration of the connection incurs costs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDial-up access is a transient connection, because either the user, ISP or phone company terminates the connection. Internet service providers will often set a limit on connection durations to allow sharing of resources, and will disconnect the user\u2014requiring reconnection and the costs and delays associated with it. Technically inclined users often find a way to disable the auto-disconnect program such that they can remain connected for more days than one.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA 2008 [[Pew Research Center]] study stated that only 10% of US adults still used dial-up Internet access.

Broadband does not require exclusive use of a phone line, and thus one can access the Internet and at the same time make and receive voice phone calls without having a second phone line.\n\nHowever, many rural areas remain without high speed Internet despite the eagerness of potential customers. This can be attributed to population, location, or sometimes ISPs' lack of interest due to little chance of profitability and high costs to build the required infrastructure. Some dial-up ISPs have responded to the increased competition by lowering their rates and making dial-up an attractive option for those who merely want email access or basic web browsing.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/02/27/could-you-go-back-to-dial-up/ |title=Could You Go Back to Dial-Up? - Digits - WSJ.com  |accessdate=2009-02-27 |work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones | first=Andrew | last=LaVallee | date=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,500686,00.html |title=Recession Has Many Holding on to Dirt-Cheap Dial-Up  |accessdate=2009-02-27 |work=Fox News | date=2009-02-26}}</ref>\n\nDial-up Internet access has undergone a precipitous fall in usage, and potentially approaches extinction as modern users turn towards broadband. In contrast to the year 2000 when about 34% of the U.S. population used dial-up, this dropped to 3% in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title= Home Broadband 2013 |work= Pew Internet & American Life Project |url=http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Broadband.aspx |accessdate= April 20, 2015}}</ref> One contributing factor to the extinction of dial-up is the bandwidth requirements of newer computer programs, like antivirus software, which automatically download sizable updates in the background when a connection to the Internet is first made. These background downloads can take several minutes or longer and, until all updates are completed, they can severely impact the amount of bandwidth available to other applications like web browsers. Since an \"always on\" broadband is the norm expected by most newer applications being developed{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, this automatic upload trend in the background is expected to continue to eat away at dial-up's available bandwidth to the detriment of dial-up users' applications.<ref>Kaspersky Technical Support website [search \"dial up\" slow] July 17, 2015</ref> Many newer websites also now assume broadband speeds as the norm and when confronted with slower dial-up speeds may drop (timeout) these slower connections to free up communication resources. On websites that are designed to be more dial-up friendly, use of a [[reverse proxy]] prevents dial-ups from being dropped as often but can introduce long wait periods for dial-up users caused by the buffering used by a reverse proxy to bridge the different data rates. Despite the rapid decline, dial-up Internet still does exist in aforementioned rural areas, or many area of developing and underdeveloped nations. It is also important to note, dial-up does serve as an alternate in areas, where broadband Internet is not viable.\n\n==Performance==\n[[File:Dial up modem noises explained final.png|thumbnail|An example handshake of a dial-up modem]]\n{{Listen\n|filename = Dial up modem noises.ogg\n|title = \"Dial up modem noises\"\n|description = Typical noises of dial-up modem (North America and United Kingdom) while a modem is establishing connection with a local ISP-server in order to get access to the [[Internet|public Internet]].\n|pos=right}}\n\nModern dial-up modems typically have a maximum theoretical transfer speed of 56 kbit/s (using the [[List of ITU-T V-series recommendations#Simultaneous transmission of data and other signals|V.90]] or [[V.92]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]), although in most cases, 40\u201350 kbit/s is the norm.

[[Digital Signal 0]] is 64 kbit/s and reserves 8 kbit/s for signaling information; therefore a 56 kbit/s connection is the highest that will ever be possible with analog phone lines.\n\nDial-up connections usually have [[latency (engineering)|latency]] as high as 150 ms or even more; this is longer than for many forms of broadband, such as cable or DSL, but typically less than satellite connections. Longer latency can make [[Videoconferencing|video conferencing]] and [[Online game|online gaming]] difficult, if not impossible. An increasing amount of Internet content such as [[streaming media]] will not work at dial-up speeds.\n\nVideo games released from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s that utilized Internet access such as ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[Red Faction]]'', ''[[Warcraft 3]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', ''[[Guild Wars]]'', ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'', ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', ''[[Audition Online|Audition]]'', ''[[Quake 3: Arena]]'', ''[[Starsiege: Tribes]]'' and ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', etc., accommodated for 56k dial-up with limited [[data transfer]] between the game servers and user's personal computer. The first consoles to provide Internet connectivity, the [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]], supported dial-up as well as broadband. The [[GameCube]] could use dial-up and broadband connections, but this was used in very few games and required a separate adapter. The [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] exclusively required a broadband connection. Many computer and video games released since the mid-2000s do not even include the option to use dial-up. However, there are exceptions to this, such as ''[[Vendetta Online]]'', which can still run on a dial-up modem.\n\n===Using compression to exceed 56k===\n[[V.42|The V.42, V.42bis and V.44 standards]] allow modems to accept uncompressed data at a rate faster than the line rate. These algorithms use [[data compression]] to achieve higher throughput.\n\nFor instance, a 53.3 kbit/s connection with V.44 can transmit up to 53.3 \u00d7 6 = 320 kbit/s if the offered data stream can be compressed that much. However, the compressibility of data tends to vary considerably, for example, due to the transfer of already-compressed files (ZIP files, JPEG images, MP3 audio, MPEG video).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |title=Modem compression: V.44 against V.42bis |accessdate=2008-02-18 |author=Pavel Mitronov |publisher=Pricenfees.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202062749/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A modem might be sending compressed files at approximately 50 kbit/s, uncompressed files at 160 kbit/s, and pure text at 320 kbit/s, or any rate in this range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |accessdate=2008-02-18 |title=What You Need to Know about Modems |author=Karl Willdig |work=Fermilab Data Communications and Networking Group |publisher=Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104124418/http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |archivedate=2007-01-04 }}</ref>\n\n====Compression by the ISP====\n{{Main article|Web accelerator}}\nAs telephone-based Internet lost popularity in the mid-2000s, some Internet service providers such as TurboUSA, [[Netscape]], CdotFree, and [[NetZero]] started using data compression to increase the perceived speed. As an example, EarthLink advertises \"surf the Web up to 7x faster\" using a compression program that squeezes images, text/html, and SWF flash animations prior to transmission across the phone line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthlink.net/dialup/|title=EarthLink Dial-Up Internet service \u2013 fast, reliable dialup access nationwide.|website=www.earthlink.net|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-compression operates much more efficiently than the on-the-fly compression of V.44 modems. Typically website text is compacted to 5% thus increasing effective throughput to approximately 1000 kbit/s, and JPEG/GIF/PNG images are lossy-compressed to 15\u201320% (increasing throughput up to 300 kbit/s).\n\nThe drawback of this approach is a loss in quality, where the graphics acquire [[compression artifacts]] taking on a blurry or colorless appearance; however the perceived speed is dramatically improved. (If desired the user may choose to view uncompressed images instead, but at a much slower load rate.) Since streaming music and video are already compressed at the source, they are typically passed by the ISP unaltered.\n\n===List of dial-up speeds===\n{{See also|List of device bandwidths}}\nNote that the values given are maximum values, and actual values may be slower under certain conditions (for example, noisy phone lines).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V/en |accessdate=2008-02-18 |title=Data communication over the telephone network |publisher=International Telecommunication Union}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right;\"| Connection\n!

This feature did not require an [[Internet service provider]] account \u2013 instead, the device's internal modem dialed directly the server of the service provider. These devices may had experience diffuculties when operating on a [[VoIP]] line because the compression could alter the modem signal. Later, these devices moved to using a [[Ethernet]] connection to the user's Internet [[router (computing)|router]], which became a more convinient approach due to the grown popularity of broadband.

This can be attributed to population, location, or sometimes ISPs' lack of interest due to little chance of profitability and high costs to build the required infrastructure.

Since an \"always on\" broadband is the norm expected by most newer applications being developed{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, this automatic upload trend in the background is expected to continue to eat away at dial-up's available bandwidth to the detriment of dial-up users' applications.<ref>Kaspersky Technical Support website [search \"dial up\" slow] July 17, 2015</ref> Many newer websites also now assume broadband speeds as the norm and when confronted with slower dial-up speeds may drop (timeout) these slower connections to free up communication resources. On websites that are designed to be more dial-up friendly, use of a [[reverse proxy]] prevents dial-ups from being dropped as often but can introduce long wait periods for dial-up users caused by the buffering used by a reverse proxy to bridge the different data rates. Despite the rapid decline, dial-up Internet still does exist in aforementioned rural areas, or many area of developing and underdeveloped nations. It is also important to note, dial-up does serve as an alternate in areas, where broadband Internet is not viable.\n\n==Performance==\n[[File:Dial up modem noises explained final.png|thumbnail|An example handshake of a dial-up modem]]\n{{Listen\n|filename = Dial up modem noises.ogg\n|title = \"Dial up modem noises\"\n|description = Typical noises of dial-up modem (North America and United Kingdom) while a modem is establishing connection with a local ISP-server in order to get access to the [[Internet|public Internet]].\n|pos=right}}\n\nModern dial-up modems typically have a maximum theoretical transfer speed of 56 kbit/s (using the [[List of ITU-T V-series recommendations#Simultaneous transmission of data and other signals|V.90]] or [[V.92]] [[Communications protocol|protocol]]), although in most cases, 40\u201350 kbit/s is the norm.

[[Digital Signal 0]] is 64 kbit/s and reserves 8 kbit/s for signaling information; therefore a 56 kbit/s connection is the highest that will ever be possible with analog phone lines.\n\nDial-up connections usually have [[latency (engineering)|latency]] as high as 150 ms or even more; this is longer than for many forms of broadband, such as cable or DSL, but typically less than satellite connections. Longer latency can make [[Videoconferencing|video conferencing]] and [[Online game|online gaming]] difficult, if not impossible. An increasing amount of Internet content such as [[streaming media]] will not work at dial-up speeds.\n\nVideo games released from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s that utilized Internet access such as ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[Red Faction]]'', ''[[Warcraft 3]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'', ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', ''[[Guild Wars]]'', ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'', ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', ''[[Audition Online|Audition]]'', ''[[Quake 3: Arena]]'', ''[[Starsiege: Tribes]]'' and ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', etc., accommodated for 56k dial-up with limited [[data transfer]] between the game servers and user's personal computer. The first consoles to provide Internet connectivity, the [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]], supported dial-up as well as broadband. The [[GameCube]] could use dial-up and broadband connections, but this was used in very few games and required a separate adapter. The [[Xbox (console)|original Xbox]] exclusively required a broadband connection. Many computer and video games released since the mid-2000s do not even include the option to use dial-up. However, there are exceptions to this, such as ''[[Vendetta Online]]'', which can still run on a dial-up modem.\n\n===Using compression to exceed 56k===\n[[V.42|The V.42, V.42bis and V.44 standards]] allow modems to accept uncompressed data at a rate faster than the line rate. These algorithms use [[data compression]] to achieve higher throughput.\n\nFor instance, a 53.3 kbit/s connection with V.44 can transmit up to 53.3 \u00d7 6 = 320 kbit/s if the offered data stream can be compressed that much. However, the compressibility of data tends to vary considerably, for example, due to the transfer of already-compressed files (ZIP files, JPEG images, MP3 audio, MPEG video).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |title=Modem compression: V.44 against V.42bis |accessdate=2008-02-18 |author=Pavel Mitronov |publisher=Pricenfees.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202062749/https://www.pricenfees.com/digit-life-archives/modem-compression-v-44-v-42bis |archive-date=2017-02-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A modem might be sending compressed files at approximately 50 kbit/s, uncompressed files at 160 kbit/s, and pure text at 320 kbit/s, or any rate in this range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |accessdate=2008-02-18 |title=What You Need to Know about Modems |author=Karl Willdig |work=Fermilab Data Communications and Networking Group |publisher=Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070104124418/http://fndcg0.fnal.gov/Net/modm8-94.txt |archivedate=2007-01-04 }}</ref>\n\n====Compression by the ISP====\n{{Main article|Web accelerator}}\nAs telephone-based Internet lost popularity in the mid-2000s, some Internet service providers such as TurboUSA, [[Netscape]], CdotFree, and [[NetZero]] started using data compression to increase the perceived speed. As an example, EarthLink advertises \"surf the Web up to 7x faster\" using a compression program that squeezes images, text/html, and SWF flash animations prior to transmission across the phone line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthlink.net/dialup/|title=EarthLink Dial-Up Internet service \u2013 fast, reliable dialup access nationwide.|website=www.earthlink.net|access-date=2017-01-12}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-compression operates much more efficiently than the on-the-fly compression of V.44 modems. Typically website text is compacted to 5% thus increasing effective throughput to approximately 1000 kbit/s, and JPEG/GIF/PNG images are lossy-compressed to 15\u201320% (increasing throughput up to 300 kbit/s).\n\nThe drawback of this approach is a loss in quality, where the graphics acquire [[compression artifacts]] taking on a blurry or colorless appearance; however the perceived speed is dramatically improved. (If desired the user may choose to view uncompressed images instead, but at a much slower load rate.) Since streaming music and video are already compressed at the source, they are typically passed by the ISP unaltered.\n\n===List of dial-up speeds===\n{{See also|List of device bandwidths}}\nNote that the values given are maximum values, and actual values may be slower under certain conditions (for example, noisy phone lines).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-V/en |accessdate=2008-02-18 |title=Data communication over the telephone network |publisher=International Telecommunication Union}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:right;\"| Connection\n!

This feature did not require an [[Internet service provider]] account \u2013 instead, the device's internal modem dialed directly the server of the service provider. These devices may had experience diffuculties when operating on a [[VoIP]] line because the compression could alter the modem signal. Later, these devices moved to using a [[Ethernet]] connection to the user's Internet [[router]], which became a more convinient approach due to the grown popularity of broadband.

The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are perfect consonances because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered imperfect consonances because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.\n\n== Cadences ==\nThere are three cadences: Simple, Compound and Double. They are made with the scale degrees in the bass, \u2460 and \u2464.\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n
