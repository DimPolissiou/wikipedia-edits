Its international branches, Sega of America and Sega Europe, are respectively headquartered in [[Irvine, California]], and London.  Sega's arcade division existed as '''Sega Interactive Co., Ltd.''' from 2015 to 2020.  Sega is a subsidiary of '''Sega Group Corporation''', which is in turn a part of [[Sega Sammy Holdings]].  From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed [[video game console]]s.\n\nSega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}} on June 3, 1960. The company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd. after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]]. Sega developed its first coin-operated game with ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'' in the late 1960s. In an effort to become a [[Public company|publicly traded company]], Sega was sold to [[Gulf and Western Industries]] in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]], but struggled against competitors such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  In 1984, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] led a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].\n\nSega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. Although it was a distant third in Japan, the Genesis found major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], in the U.S. However, later in the decade, Sega suffered [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] such as the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a [[third-party developer]] and publisher, and was acquired by [[Sammy Corporation]] in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable.  Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, with Sega Corporation being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed to Sega Corporation.\n\nSega produces [[List of best-selling video game franchises|multi-million-selling game franchises]] including ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Total War (video game series)|Total War]]'', and ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]],'' and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates [[amusement arcade]]s and produces other entertainment products, including [[Sega Toys]]. As a company, Sega is retrospectively remembered for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations. In more recent years, it has been criticized for misguided business decisions and lack of creativity.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Sega}}\n\n===Origins and arcade success (1940\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|The Diamond 3 Star, a model of coin-operated slot machines produced by Sega in the 1950s|left|alt=Diamond 3 Star slot machines]]\nIn 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert formed Standard Games in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii.

a Japanese [[multinational corporation|multinational]] video game [[video game development|developer]] and publisher headquartered in [[Shinagawa]], Tokyo. Its international branches, Sega of America and Sega Europe, are respectively headquartered in [[Irvine, California]], and London.  Sega's arcade division existed as '''Sega Interactive Co., Ltd.''' from 2015 to 2020.  Sega is a subsidiary of '''Sega Group Corporation''', which is in turn a part of [[Sega Sammy Holdings]].  From 1983 until 2001, Sega also developed [[video game console]]s.\n\nSega was founded by Martin Bromley and Richard Stewart as {{nihongo foot|Nihon Goraku Bussan|\u65e5\u672c\u5a2f\u697d\u7269\u7523\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|Nihon goraku bussan kabushiki gaisha|extra=Japanese Amusement Products Co., Ltd.}} on June 3, 1960. The company became known as Sega Enterprises, Ltd. after acquiring Rosen Enterprises, an importer of [[Arcade game|coin-operated games]]. Sega developed its first coin-operated game with ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]'' in the late 1960s. In an effort to become a [[Public company|publicly traded company]], Sega was sold to [[Gulf and Western Industries]] in 1969. Following a downturn in the arcade business in the early 1980s, Sega began to develop video game consoles, starting with the [[SG-1000]] and [[Master System]], but struggled against competitors such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].  In 1984, Sega executives [[David Rosen (businessman)|David Rosen]] and [[Hayao Nakayama]] led a management buyout of the company with backing from [[SCSK|CSK Corporation]].\n\nSega released its next console, the [[Sega Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive outside North America), in 1988. Although it was a distant third in Japan, the Genesis found major success after the release of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' in 1991 and briefly outsold its main competitor, the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], in the U.S. However, later in the decade, Sega suffered [[List of commercial failures in video gaming|commercial failures]] such as the [[32X]], [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], and [[Dreamcast]] consoles. In 2001, Sega stopped manufacturing consoles to become a [[third-party developer]] and publisher, and was acquired by [[Sammy Corporation]] in 2004. In the years since the acquisition, Sega has been more profitable.  Sega Holdings Co. Ltd. was established in 2015, with Sega Corporation being renamed Sega Games Co., Ltd. and its arcade, entertainment, and toy divisions separated into other companies.  Sega Games and Sega Interactive were merged in 2020 and renamed to Sega Corporation.\n\nSega produces [[List of best-selling video game franchises|multi-million-selling game franchises]] including ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Total War (video game series)|Total War]]'', and ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]],'' and is the world's most prolific arcade game producer. It also operates [[amusement arcade]]s and produces other entertainment products, including [[Sega Toys]]. As a company, Sega is retrospectively remembered for its time supporting its own video game consoles, its creativity, and its innovations. In more recent years, it has been criticized for misguided business decisions and lack of creativity.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Sega}}\n\n===Origins and arcade success (1940\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slot machines at Wookey Hole Caves.JPG|thumb|The Diamond 3 Star, a model of coin-operated slot machines produced by Sega in the 1950s|left|alt=Diamond 3 Star slot machines]]\nIn 1940, American businessmen Martin Bromley, Irving Bromberg, and James Humpert formed Standard Games in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii.

Cannon, the captain of ''Robert E. Lee'', ensured victory by removing excess weight, carrying only a few passengers, and using prearranged barges to increase the speed of refueling.  ''Natchez'' finished the race several hours later, but had been delayed by fog for six hours, and had numerous passengers to weigh it down. She received a silver bowl trophy containing the name of the Robert E. On December 22, 1870 she collided with the Potomac opposite Natchez, Mississippi. The Lee sustained much damage and was run out on a sandbar until she could be raised and repaired.

He cites Johnny Farrell, second engineer of ''Natchez'': \"This old idea about the two boats preparing for days for the race, tearing down bulkheads, putting up wind sheaves, and a lot of other stuff, is not true. When I went aboard ''Robert E. Lee'', all they had done was to move the coal bunkers a little forward... On our boat there was absolutely no preparation whatever. There was no such thing as colors flying, bands playing, and the decks of both boats crowded with ladies and gentlemen.\" Way also writes that at Vicksburg, both boats took fuel flats in tow and emptied them under way.  In addition, both vessels advertised before the race that they would accept freight and passengers.<ref>Way, Frederick, Jr. ''She Takes the Horns: Steamboat Racing on Western Waters'', pp. 71\u201381, Young & Klein, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, 1953.</ref>\n\nTo this day no commercial boat has beaten the speed record set by ''Robert E. Lee'' during the race.<ref name=\"drawings\"/> However, ''Bogie'', a 1929 motor boat built by Leroy Craft, beat ''Robert E. Lee''{{'}}s record.<ref>''The Atlanta Constitution'' July 26, 1929</ref>\n\nIt usually ran between New Orleans and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], [[Mississippi]].

Lee (steamboat) 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Robert E. Lee'', another drawing by Samuel Ward Stanton]]\nOn December 22, 1870 she collided with the Potomac opposite Natchez, Mississippi. The Lee sustained much damage and was run out on a sandbar until she could be raised and repaired. She brought her record cotton cargo of 5741 bales to New Orleans in 1874. When she left New Orleans for Portland, Kentucky, for dismantling, mid-April, 1876, several thousand came to see her off, with many salutes en route to mark the closing of her career. Her hull was taken to Memphis for use as a wharf boat. Much of her equipment went into her successor, also known as the second ''Robert E Lee'' (1876\u20131882). She carried much of the equipment and furnishings from her predecessor..<ref>''The New York Times'', October 1, 1882</ref>\n\nA stern wheel replica named ''The Lt. Robert E. Lee'' was built in 1969 based on an old Corps of engineers hull. Moored as a floating restaurant in St. Louis, this boat was destroyed by fire in 2010. It was not a replica of the original ''Robert E. Lee'', which was a larger [[side-wheel steamer]].\n[[File:Robert E Lee Steamboat.jpg|thumb|Steamboat ''Robert E. Lee'', by August Norieri]]\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In 1912 [[Lewis F. Muir]] and [[L. Wolfe Gilbert]] composed the song \"[[Waiting For The Robert E. Lee]]\", which describes the ''Robert E. Lee'' sailing to New Orleans. It was performed by [[Al Jolson]] in the 1927 film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''.\n*The boat is mentioned in the song \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\" by [[The Band]]. The word 'The', which indicates a reference to the steamboat, rather than the general, is unclear on the album version of the song, but is audible in the live performance on ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before The Flood]]'' and more so in ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.\n*The steamboat is also mentioned in the song \"I wanna go back to Dixie\" by [[Tom Lehrer]].\n*It is also mentioned in the song by The Bellamy Brothers, \"You Ain't Just Whistlin' Dixie.\"\n*The ''Robert E. Lee'' also features as a map in the [[Wild West]] [[First person shooter]] game [[Fistful of Frags]].\n*The successful French ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' comic book by [[Morris (cartoonist)|Morris]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] ''[[En remontant le Mississippi]]'' is a humorous depiction of the 1870 no-holds-barred race between the ''Robert E. Lee'' and ''Natchez'' steamboats (renamed respectively ''Abestos D. Plover'' and ''Daisy Belle'') in the comic.\n*The famous steamboat race is mentioned in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s vampires-along-the-Mississippi novel ''[[Fevre Dream]].''\n*The race between the Robert E.

Lee in Shreveport, LA IMG 3392.JPG|thumb|Replica of ''Robert E. Lee'' at the [[Louisiana State Exhibit Museum]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]]]\nIn the summer of 1870, ''Robert E. Lee'' won a famed steamboat race against ''Natchez'', going from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] to [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], a distance of {{convert|1154|mi|km}}, in 3 days, 18 hours and 14 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riverboatdaves.com/docs/nat.html |title=The Riverboats Natchez |website=Riverboat Dave's}}</ref> John W. Cannon, the captain of ''Robert E. Lee'', ensured victory by removing excess weight, carrying only a few passengers, and using prearranged barges to increase the speed of refueling.  ''Natchez'' finished the race several hours later, but had been delayed by fog for six hours, and had numerous passengers to weigh it down. She received a silver bowl trophy containing the name of the Robert E. On December 22, 1870 she collided with the Potomac opposite Natchez, Mississippi. The Lee sustained much damage and was run out on a sandbar until she could be raised and repaired.

He cites Johnny Farrell, second engineer of ''Natchez'': \"This old idea about the two boats preparing for days for the race, tearing down bulkheads, putting up wind sheaves, and a lot of other stuff, is not true. When I went aboard ''Robert E. Lee'', all they had done was to move the coal bunkers a little forward... On our boat there was absolutely no preparation whatever. There was no such thing as colors flying, bands playing, and the decks of both boats crowded with ladies and gentlemen.\" Way also writes that at Vicksburg, both boats took fuel flats in tow and emptied them under way.  In addition, both vessels advertised before the race that they would accept freight and passengers.<ref>Way, Frederick, Jr. ''She Takes the Horns: Steamboat Racing on Western Waters'', pp. 71\u201381, Young & Klein, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio, 1953.</ref>\n\nTo this day no commercial boat has beaten the speed record set by ''Robert E. Lee'' during the race.<ref name=\"drawings\"/> However, ''Bogie'', a 1929 motor boat built by Leroy Craft, beat ''Robert E. Lee''{{'}}s record.<ref>''The Atlanta Constitution'' July 26, 1929</ref>\n\nIt usually ran between New Orleans and [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], [[Mississippi]]. However, during spans of bad business, it would forsake Natchez and instead go to St. Louis or [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]].<ref name=\"drawings\"/>\n\n==Fate==\n[[File:Robert E. Lee (steamboat) 02.jpg|thumb|left|''Robert E. Lee'', another drawing by Samuel Ward Stanton]]\nOn December 22, 1870 she collided with the Potomac opposite Natchez, Mississippi. The Lee sustained much damage and was run out on a sandbar until she could be raised and repaired. She brought her record cotton cargo of 5741 bales to New Orleans in 1874. When she left New Orleans for Portland, Kentucky, for dismantling, mid-April, 1876, several thousand came to see her off, with many salutes en route to mark the closing of her career. Her hull was taken to Memphis for use as a wharf boat. Much of her equipment went into her successor, also known as the second ''Robert E Lee'' (1876\u20131882). She carried much of the equipment and furnishings from her predecessor..<ref>''The New York Times'', October 1, 1882</ref>\n\nA stern wheel steamer named ''Robert E. Lee'' was built in 1969 based on an old Corps of engineers hull. Moored as a floating restaurant in St. Louis, this boat was destroyed by fire in 2010. It was not a replica of the original ''Robert E. Lee'', which was a larger [[side-wheel steamer]].\n[[File:Robert E Lee Steamboat.jpg|thumb|Steamboat ''Robert E. Lee'', by August Norieri]]\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In 1912 [[Lewis F. Muir]] and [[L. Wolfe Gilbert]] composed the song \"[[Waiting For The Robert E. Lee]]\", which describes the ''Robert E. Lee'' sailing to New Orleans. It was performed by [[Al Jolson]] in the 1927 film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''.\n*The boat is mentioned in the song \"[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]\" by [[The Band]]. The word 'The', which indicates a reference to the steamboat, rather than the general, is unclear on the album version of the song, but is audible in the live performance on ''[[Before the Flood (album)|Before The Flood]]'' and more so in ''[[The Last Waltz]]''.\n*The steamboat is also mentioned in the song \"I wanna go back to Dixie\" by [[Tom Lehrer]].\n*It is also mentioned in the song by The Bellamy Brothers, \"You Ain't Just Whistlin' Dixie.\"\n*The ''Robert E. Lee'' also features as a map in the [[Wild West]] [[First person shooter]] game [[Fistful of Frags]].\n*The successful French ''[[Lucky Luke]]'' comic book by [[Morris (cartoonist)|Morris]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] ''[[En remontant le Mississippi]]'' is a humorous depiction of the 1870 no-holds-barred race between the ''Robert E. Lee'' and ''Natchez'' steamboats (renamed respectively ''Abestos D. Plover'' and ''Daisy Belle'') in the comic.\n*The famous steamboat race is mentioned in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s vampires-along-the-Mississippi novel ''[[Fevre Dream]].''\n*The race between the Robert E. Lee and Natchez is mentioned in the short story A Bear Hunt by William Faulkner, where a representation of the race is described as being on the collar of a shirt belonging to one of the characters and burnt by the cigar of another\n\n==See also==\n*[[Paddle steamer]]\n*[[Steam yacht]]\n*[[Steamboats of the Mississippi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Robert E.

The first, ''The Primal Screamer'', was a fictionalized semi-autobiographical novel with [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements. It was published in 1995 by Spare Change Books and received a second printing in 2002.

An exclusive micro-edition of 60 copies was also published, featuring an original piece of art, while all copies of the book contained a postcard with a handwritten excerpt from the book. The edition size reflected the number of Blinko's handwritten postcards, from which the text of the book was transcribed, and which were included in the book.
