Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century. [[Roslagen]] is located along the coast of the northern tip of the pink area marked ''\"Swedes and Goths\"''.]]\n\nThe etymology and semantic history of the word ''Rus{{'}}'' has been a highly contentious topic, on which debate is ongoing. This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described. This assumption has, however, been criticized in twenty-first-century scholarship.<ref>James E.

It has therefore been influential on modern history-writing, but it is also much later than the time it describes, and historians agree it primarily reflects the political and religious politics of the time of [[Mstislav I of Kiev]].\n\nHowever, the chronicle does include the texts of a series of Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaties from [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (911)|911]], [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (945)|945]], and [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine War (970\u2013971)|971]].<ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201397 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (pp. 66-67).</ref> The Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaties give a valuable insight into the names of the Rus'. Of the fourteen Rus' signatories to the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (907)|Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty]] in 907, all had Norse names. By the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty (945)]] in 945, some signatories of the Rus' had Slavic names while the vast majority had Norse names.<ref name=Duczko>{{harvnb|Duczko|2004|p=210}}</ref>\n\nThe Chronicle presents the following [[origin myth]] for the arrival of Rus' in the region of [[Novgorod]]: the Rus' were a group of [[Varangians]] 'who imposed tribute upon the [[Chuds]], the [[Slavs]], the [[Merians]], the [[Ves']], and the [[Krivichians]]' (a variety of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Volga Finns|Finnic]] peoples).\n\n{{quote|The tributaries of the Varangians drove them back beyond the sea and, refusing them further tribute,  set out to govern themselves. There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]]. On account of these Varangians, the district of Novgorod became known as the land of Rus'.<ref name=\"RPC\">''[https://archive.org/details/TheRussianPrimaryChronicle The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text'', ed. and trans. by Samuel Hazzard Cross and Olgerd P.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing center of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another centre of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions molded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

At the beginning of an important speech in 1749, later published as ''Origines gentis et nominis Russorum'' ('The Origins of the People and the Name of the Russians'), M\u00fcller argued that Russia owed its name and early ruling dynasty to ethnically Scandinavian Varangians.<ref name=\"auto11\">Serhii Plokhy, ''Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008), chapter 1.</ref><ref>Elena Melnikova, 'The \"Varangian Problem\": Science in the Grip of Ideology and Politics', in ''Russia's Identity in International Relations: Images, Perceptions, Misperceptions'', ed. by Ray Taras (Abingdon: Routledge, 2013), pp. 42-52 (p. 43).</ref> This statement caused anger in his Russian audience, and earned him much animosity during his professional career in Russia.<ref name=\"auto11\"/><ref name=\"auto10\"/> Scathing criticism from [[Mikhail Lomonosov|Lomonosov]], [[Stepan Krasheninnikov|Krasheninnikov]], and other Russian historians led to M\u00fcller being forced to suspend his work on the issue until Lomonosov's death.

Thus they are often referred to in English-language research as \"[[Viking]] Rus'\". The scholarly consensus <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/viking/the-vikings-at-home/|title=The Vikings at home|website=History Extra}}</ref> is that the Rus' people originated in what is currently coastal [[East Middle Sweden|eastern Sweden]] around the eighth century and that their name has the same origin as [[Roslagen]] in [[Sweden]] (with the older name being ''[[Roden, Sweden|Roden]]'').\n\nBasing themselves among [[Slavs]] and [[Volga Finns]] in the upper [[Volga region]], they formed a diaspora of traders and raiders exchanging furs and slaves for silk, silver and other commodities available to the east and south. Around the ninth century, on the river routes to the [[Black Sea]], they had an unclear but significant role in forming the principality of [[Kievan Rus]], gradually assimilating with local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic populations]]. They also extended their operations much further east and south, among the [[Bulgars]] and [[Khazars]], on the routes to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By around the eleventh century, the word ''Rus{{'}}'' was increasingly associated with the principality of Kiev, and the term ''[[Varangian]]'' was becoming more common as a term for Scandinavians traveling the river-routes.\n\nLittle, however, is certain about the Rus{{'}}. This is to a significant extent because, although Rus{{'}} people were active over a long period and vast distances, textual evidence for their activities is very sparse and almost never produced by contemporary Rus' people themselves. It is believed that writing was brought to the Rus by the Slavs for religious reasons, but this happened long after their early history. The word ''Rus{{'}}'' in the primary sources does not always mean the same thing as it does when used by today's scholars. Meanwhile, archaeological evidence and researchers' understanding of it is accumulating only gradually. As a trading diaspora, Rus' people intermingled extensively with Finnic, Slavic, and Turkic peoples and their customs and identity seem correspondingly to have varied considerably over time and space.\n\nThe other key reason for dispute about the origins of Rus' people is the likelihood that they had a role in ninth- to tenth-century state formation in eastern Europe (ultimately giving their name to [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]]), making them relevant to what are today seen as the national histories of [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Sweden]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Finland]] and [[Baltic states]]. \n\n== Key sources ==\n=== Etymology ===\n{{Main|Rus' (name)}}\n[[File:Europe 814.png|right|thumb|300px|[[Europe]] in the 9th century.

This is partly because of a widespread assumption that by identifying the linguistic origin of the name ''Rus{{'}}'', scholars can identify the origins of the people whom it described.

There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe. Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against the other. They said to themselves, \"Let us seek a prince who may rule over us, and judge us according to the Law\". They accordingly went overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known as Russes, just as some are called [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], and others [[Normans]], [[Angles|English]], and [[Gutes|Gotlanders]], for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the Krivichians and the Ves' then said to the people of Rus', \"Our land is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign over us\". Thus they selected three brothers, with their kinsfolk, who took with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located himself in Novgorod; the second, [[Sineus and Truvor|Sineus]], at [[Beloozero]]; and the third, [[Sineus and Truvor|Truvor]], in [[Izborsk]]. On account of these Varangians, the district of Novgorod became known as the land of Rus'.<ref name=\"RPC\">''[https://archive.org/details/TheRussianPrimaryChronicle The Russian Primary Chronicle: Laurentian Text'', ed. and trans. by Samuel Hazzard Cross and Olgerd P.

The Varangians (''Varyags'', in [[Old East Slavic language|Old East Slavic]]) are first mentioned by the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' as having exacted tribute from the Slavic and Finnic tribes in 859. It was the time of rapid expansion of the Vikings in Northern Europe; England began to pay [[Danegeld]] in 859, and the [[Curonians]] of [[Grobin]] faced an invasion by the Swedes at about the same date.\n\nIt has been argued that the word ''Varangian'', in its many forms, does not appear in primary sources until the eleventh century (though it does appear frequently in later sources describing earlier periods). This suggests that the term ''Rus{{'}}'' was used broadly to denote Scandinavians until it became too firmly associated with the now extensively Slavicised elite of Kievan Rus. At that point, the new term ''Varangian'' was increasingly preferred to name Scandinavians, probably mostly from what is currently Sweden,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|first2=Richard|last2=Oram|first3=Frederik|last3=Pedersen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Viking Empires|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2005|ISBN= 0-521-82992-5|pages=13\u201314}}</ref> plying the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black/Caspian Seas.<ref>Marika M\u00e4gi, ''In <i>Austrvegr</i>: The Role of the Eastern Baltic in Viking Age Communication Across the Baltic Sea'', The Northern World, 84 (Leiden: Brill, 2018), p. 195, citing Alf Thulin, 'The Rus' of Nestor's Chronicle', ''Mediaeval Scandinavia'', 13 (2000), 70-96.</ref>\n\nDue largely to geographic considerations, it is often argued that most of the Varangians who traveled and settled in the lands of eastern Baltic, modern Russian Federation and lands to the south came from the area of modern [[Sweden]].\n\nThe Varangians left a number of [[varangian runestones|rune stones]] in their native [[Sweden]] that tell of their journeys to what is today Russia, Ukraine, Greece, and Belarus. Most of these rune stones can be seen today, and are a telling piece of historical evidence. The [[Varangian runestones]] tell of many notable Varangian expeditions, and even account for the fates of individual warriors and travelers.\n\nIn Russian history, two cities are used to describe the beginnings of the country: Kiev and Novgorod.<ref name=\"auto9\">Duczko, Wladyslaw. Viking Rus\u202f: Studies on the Presence of Scandinavians in Eastern Europe. The Northern World. Leiden: Brill, 2004.</ref> In the first part of the eleventh century the former was already a Slav metropolis, rich and powerful, a fast growing centre of civilization adopted from Byzantium. The latter town, Novgorod, was another centre of the same culture but founded in different surroundings, where some old local traditions moulded this commercial city into a mighty oligarchic republic of a kind otherwise unknown in this part of Europe. These towns have tended to overshadow other places of a significance that they had acquired long before Kiev and Novgorod. The two original centers of Rus were Staraja Ladoga and Rurikovo Gorodishche, two points on the ends the Volkhov, a river running for 200 km between [[Lake Ilmen]] in the south to [[Lake Ladoga]] in the north<ref name=\"auto9\"/>. This was the territory that most probably was originally called by the Norsemen Gardar, a name that long after Viking Age was given much wider content and become Gardariki, denomination for whole Old Russian State. The area between the lakes was the original Rus, and it was from here its name was transferred to the Slav territories on the middle Dnieper, which eventually became \u201cRuskaja zemlja\u201d.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> The pre-history of the first territory of Rus has been sought in the developments around the mid eighth century, when Staraja Ladoga was founded as a trading place, serving the operations of Scandinavian hunters and dealers in furs obtained in the north-eastern forest zone of Eastern Europe. In the early period (the second part of the eighth and first part of the ninth century) Norse presence is only visible at Staraja Ladoga, and to a much lesser degree at a few other sites in the northern parts of Eastern Europe. The objects that represent Norse material culture of this period are rare outside Ladoga and mostly known as single finds. This rarity continues through the ninth century until the whole situation changes radically during the next century, when historians meet, at many places and in relatively large quantities, the material remains of a thriving Scandinavian culture.<ref name=\"auto9\"/> For a short period of time, some areas of Eastern Europe became as much part of the Norse world as were Danish and Norwegian territories in the West. The culture of the Rus contained Norse elements used as a manifestation of their Scandinavian background. These elements, which were current in tenth century Scandinavia, appear at various places in form of collections of many types of metal ornaments, mainly female but even male, such as weapons, decorated parts of horse bridle, and diverse objects embellished in current Norse art styles.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\n== Debate on the origins of the Rus' ==\nThe historiography of the origins of the Rus' is infamously contentious, due to its perceived importance for the legitimation of nation-building, imperialism, and independence movements within the Slavonic-speaking world, and for legitimating different political relationships between eastern and western European countries.

Lunt offer explanations that go beyond simplistic attempts to attribute 'ethnicity' on ''prima facie'' interpretation of literary, philological, and archaeological evidence. They view the Rus' as disparate, and often mutually antagonistic, clans of charismatic warriors and traders who formed wide-ranging networks across the North and Baltic Seas.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\">{{harvtxt|Pritsak|1981|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Lunt|1975|p=271}}</ref> They were a \"multi-ethnic, multilingual and non-territorial community of sea nomads and trading settlements\" that contained numerous Norsemen\u2014but equally Slavs, Balts, and Finns.<ref name=\"Pritsak 1981 14\"/>\n\nEvidence provided by the ''Primary Chronicle'', written some three centuries later, cannot be taken as an accurate ethnographic account; as tales of 'migration' from distant lands were common literary ''topoi'' used by rulers to legitimise their contemporary rule whilst at the same time differentiating themselves from their \"Baltic\" and \"Slavic\" subject tribes. Tolochko argues \"the story of the royal clan's journey is a device with its own function within the narrative of the chronicle. ...

This may have produced 'an essentially voluntary convergence of groupings in common pursuit of primary produce exchangeable for artifacts from afar'.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402, quoting p. 397).</ref> This fits well with the image of Rus' that dominates the Arabic sources, focusing further south and east, around the Black and Caspian Seas, the Caucasus and the Volga Bulghars.<ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (pp. 70-71).</ref> Yet this narrative, though plausible, contends with the 'top-down' image of state development implied by the ''Primary Chronicle'', archaeological assemblages indicating Scandinavian-style weapon-bearing elites on the Upper Volga, and evidence for slave-trading and violent destruction of fortified settlements.<ref>Jonathan Shepherd, 'Review Article: Back in Old Rus and the USSR: Archaeology, History and Politics', ''English Historical Review'', vol. 131 (no. 549) (2016), 384-405 {{DOI|10.1093/ehr/cew104}} (pp. 389-402).</ref><ref>Thorir Jonsson Hraundal, 'New Perspectives on Eastern Vikings/Rus in Arabic Sources', ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 10 (2014), 65\u201369 {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.5.1052}} (p. 71).</ref>\n\nNumerous artefacts of Scandinavian affinity have been found in northern Russia.

The Rus' appeared to emulate aspects of [[Khazar]] political organization\u2014hence the mention of a Rus' ''[[Khagan|chaganus]]'' in the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] court in 839 (''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'').

Devoid of any silver dirham finds in the 8th century AD, it was situated west of the profitable fur and silver trade networks that spanned from the Baltic to the Muslim lands, via the [[Volga region|Volga]]-[[Kama River|Kama]] basins. At the prime hill in Kiev, fortifications and other symbols of consolidation and power appear from the 9th century, thus preceding the literary appearance of 'Rus' in the middle Dnieper region. By the 10th century, the lowlands around Kiev had extensive 'Slavic' styled settlements, and there is evidence of growing trade with the Byzantine lands. This might have attracted Rus' movements, and a shift in power, from the north to Kiev.<ref>{{harvtxt|Franklin|1996|pp=90\u2013122}}</ref> Thus, Kiev does not appear to have evolved from the infrastructure of the Scandinavian trade networks, but rather it forcibly took them over, as evidenced by the destruction of numerous earlier trade settlements in the north, including the famous [[Staraya Ladoga|Staraja Ladoga]].<ref>Tolochko p. 186</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''The Annals of Saint-Bertin'', transl.

In the 1862 the Dutch East Indies government decided to build a new museum that would not only serve as an office but also could be used to house, preserve and display the collections.\n\n[[File:Gedung Gajah Museum Nasional.jpg|right|thumb|Gedung Gajah, the old wing of National Museum.]]\n\nThe Museum was officially opened in 1868 and popularly known as ''Gedung Gajah'' (Elephant Building) or sometimes called ''Gedung Arca'' (The house of Statues). It was called ''Gedung Gajah'' on account of the bronze elephant statue in the front yard \u2013 a gift to Batavia from King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam in 1871. It was also called ''Gedung Arca'' because a great variety of statues from different periods are on display in the house.\n\n[[File:Museum Nasional Courtyard.jpg|right|thumb|The [[peristyle]] (inner courtyard) of the National Museum, features [[Doric order]] Greek architecture.]]\n\nThe museum acquired its collection through many ways, among others were through scientific expeditions, excavations of archaeological sites, acquisition of private collections, gifts from distinguished patrons, objects donated by religious missions; such as ethnological artifacts acquired by Christian ''Zending'' and Catholic [[Missionary|Missions]], and also treasures acquired \u2014 or looted to be exact \u2014 from a numbers of Dutch East Indies military campaigns against indigenous kingdoms and polities in the archipelago.

Unfortunately, a fire in the exhibition hall demolished the Dutch East Indies' exhibition pavilion and destroyed most of the objects. The museum received some insurance money as compensation and the following year these funds were used to build the old ceramics room, the bronze room, and both treasure rooms on the second floor.\n\nIn February, 1950 the institution became the ''Lembaga Kebudayaan Indonesia'' (Indonesian Culture Council). On September 17, 1962 it was handed over to the Indonesian government and became known as ''Museum Pusat'' (Central Museum). By decree of the Minister of Education and Culture No. 092/0/1979 May 28, 1979 it was renamed the Museum Nasional.\n\nIn 1977, an agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands accede to return some of cultural treasures back to Indonesia. The prized treasures among others are the treasures of Lombok, the [[Nagarakretagama]] [[lontar]] manuscript, and the exquisite [[Prajnaparamita of Java]] statue.\nThese treasures were sent back from the Netherlands and now being kept in the National Museum of Indonesia.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\nIn 2007, a new building to the north side of existing building was opened, featuring many artifacts from prehistoric times to modern times. This new building, called ''Gedung Arca'' (Statue Building), provides a new exhibition wing. The old building is named as ''Gedung Gajah'' (Elephant Building).\n\nIn September 11, 2013, four precious golden artifacts from the 10th-century [[Medang Kingdom|Eastern Medang kingdom]] period was stolen from the museum. The items were first discovered in the ruins of the Jalatunda ancient royal bathing place and in the temples on the slopes of [[Mount Penanggungan]] in [[Mojokerto Regency]], East Java. The four missing artifacts were a dragon-shaped gold plaque, a scripted crescent-shaped gold plaque and one golden-silver Harihara plaque, as well as a small golden box.

It was called ''Gedung Gajah'' on account of the bronze elephant statue in the front yard \u2013 a gift to Batavia from King [[Chulalongkorn]] of Siam in 1871. It was also called ''Gedung Arca'' because a great variety of statues from different periods are on display in the house.\n\n[[File:Museum Nasional Courtyard.jpg|right|thumb|The [[peristyle]] (inner courtyard) of the National Museum, features [[Doric order]] Greek architecture.]]\n\nThe museum acquired its collection through many ways, among others were through scientific expeditions, excavations of archaeological sites, acquisition of private collections, gifts from distinguished patrons, objects donated by religious missions; such as ethnological artifacts acquired by Christian ''Zending'' and Catholic [[Missionary|Missions]], and also treasures acquired \u2014 or looted to be exact \u2014 from a numbers of Dutch East Indies military campaigns against indigenous kingdoms and polities in the archipelago.

The bridge gallery is located over the outdoor amphitheatre. The temporary exhibitions with certain themes often took place in this connecting gallery.

He is portrayed by [[Paul McGann]].\n\nThe character was introduced in the 1996 TV film ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]'', a [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilot|back-door pilot]] produced in an unsuccessful attempt to relaunch the series following its 1989 cancellation. While the Eighth Doctor initially had only one on-screen appearance, his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]], including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann. In 2013, the actor reprised the role in the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", which depicts the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]] (played by [[John Hurt]]).\n\nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien (a [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]]) who [[time travel in fiction|travels in time and space]] in his [[TARDIS]], frequently with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]].  At the end of life, the Doctor's body can [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]], but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.\n\nMcGann portrays the eighth such incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only companion in the television film is [[Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]), a medical doctor whose surgery is partly responsible for triggering his regeneration. In the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including self-styled \"Edwardian Adventuress\" [[Charley Pollard|Charley]], the alien [[Destrii]] and present-day humans [[Lucie Miller|Lucie]] and [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Sam]].\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|thumb|left|A deadly confrontation between the Doctor and the [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]].]]\n\nThe Eighth Doctor made his first television appearance in the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television film]], the first time the Doctor had returned to television screens since the end of the original series in 1989. Intended as a [[Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] for a new television series on the [[Fox Network]], the film drew 5.5% of the US audience, according to Nielsen Ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.tv/msg/d12b3e9f2de93c3e?dmode=source|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, it was received well, attracting over 9&nbsp;million viewers and generally positive reviews. It was also generally well received in Australia.<ref>''Data Extract'', 121, July/August 1996, and see [[Doctor Who in Australia]].</ref>\n\nAlthough the film failed to spark a new television series, the Eighth Doctor's adventures continued in various licensed [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media, notably [[BBC Books]]' ''[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' novels, audio plays from [[Big Finish Productions]], and the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip. These stories spanned the nine years between 1996 and the debut of the new television series in 2005. He is the longest-serving Doctor in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip. In the wake of the positive reaction to the revived television series in 2005, several of the Eighth Doctor's Big Finish audio dramas were also broadcast on [[BBC7]] radio in an edited form. The trailers for these broadcasts explained that these adventures took place before the destruction of [[Gallifrey]], the Doctor's homeworld, as described in the revived TV series. In 2007, BBC7 aired a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures, created specifically for radio broadcast. Paul McGann has continued to portray the Eighth Doctor in the various audio spinoffs.\n\nThe [[Whoniverse#Inclusion and continuity|continuity]] of the spin-off media with respect to the television series and to each other is open to interpretation. (The \"Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who\" on the BBC's classic ''Doctor Who'' website suggests this may be due to the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]].)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/guide.shtml |title=Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who |accessdate=8 February 2007 |format=[[Adobe Flash|Flash]] required |work=Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC}}</ref> It has been suggested that the Eighth Doctor's adventures in three different forms (novels, audio, and comics) take place in three separate continuities. The discontinuities were made explicit in the audio drama ''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |title=Zagreus |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |work=Doctor Who Reference Guide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129000300/http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |archivedate=29 January 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> In response, it has become increasingly common to consider the three ranges separately. The final ''Eighth Doctor Adventures'' novel, ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005&nbsp;novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'', obliquely references this split in timelines, even suggesting that the split results in the three alternative forms of the [[Ninth Doctor]] (a reference to the fact three different versions of the incarnation have appeared in various media). ''Mary's Story'', a 2009 audio story by Big Finish, contradicted these suggestions, as there the Doctor mentions his companions in order, with book companions before audio companions. In \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Doctor \"salutes\" five of his companions by name, all from the Big Finish audio productions.\n\n[[File:Past Doctors section.jpg|thumb|left|The Eighth Doctor appears as a sketch in \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\".]]\n\nDespite the fact the Eighth Doctor appeared on television only twice, he is the most prolific of all the Doctors (to date) in terms of number of individual stories published in novel, novella, short story and audio form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm |title=Doctor Who Reference Guide |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |date=30 January 2007}}</ref> In 2007, the Eighth Doctor finally made a second appearance (of sorts) within the television series' continuity. In the episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" he appears on-screen as a sketch (alongside other incarnations) in the book ''[[List of Doctor Who items#J|A Journal of Impossible Things]]'' by John Smith. In 2008 and 2010 he appeared again as a brief image in \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\" along with every other incarnation up to that time. In 2010's \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\", he is shown in a flashback with his first, second, third, fourth, ninth and tenth incarnations. In 2013's \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\", he is shown in a flashback along with the Doctor's other incarnations; he is also fleetingly seen running past companion [[Clara Oswald]] in the following episode, \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\", though his face is not shown. Later that year, McGann reprised the role for the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", a prelude to the show's [[The Day of the Doctor|50th anniversary special]]. This appearance marked the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/video/mini-episode-the-night-of-the-doctor/ | title=The Night of the Doctor | accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> \"The Night of the Doctor\" proved popular with fans of the series, some of whom petitioned the BBC to make a spin-off series starring the Eighth Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/online-petition-new-doctor-who-657189|title=Online Petition for New 'Doctor Who' Spin-Off Tops 9,000 Names|date=18 November 2013|author=Graeme McMillan|publisher=HollywoodReporter.com|work=Heat-vision|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231237/doctor-who-8-reasons-paul-mcganns-eighth-doctor-deserves-a-series|title=Doctor Who: 8 Reasons Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor Deserves a Series|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Ethan Lewis|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231124/doctor-who-petition-for-paul-mcgann-spinoff-passes-15000-signatures|title=Doctor Who: Petition For Paul McGann Spinoff Passes 15,000 Signatures!|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Bridget LaMonica|date=23 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nThe BBC's official website calls the Eighth Doctor an \"effortlessly charming, romantic figure\".

The site states that he is \"passionate, direct, sympathetic and emotionally accessible\", but notes that these traits are \"balanced by occasional feelings of self-doubt and weariness of his endless battles against evil.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/released/eighth-doctor-adventures|title=DOCTOR WHO \u2013 EIGHTH DOCTOR ADVENTURES \u2013 RELEASED ITEMS|publisher=Big Finish|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nDiscussing \"The Night of the Doctor\", McGann said, \"[Moffat's] instinctive take on the Eighth Doctor was exactly how I'd imagined this character to be, even way back, back in the 90s. You know, this... like a bruised nobility. I know it sounds wanky now, but... he's decent, but he's compromised. He's not a warrior, really, at all.

While transporting the remains of his longtime nemesis [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] to Gallifrey, the [[Seventh Doctor]] ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) is caught in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out in 1999 [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown, USA]]. He is taken to a hospital where surgeons, confused by his double heartbeat, attempt to correct a non-existent [[fibrillation]]. These efforts instead \"kill\" the Doctor, and he is taken to a morgue where after several hours\u2014due to the effect of anaesthetic on his alien biology\u2014he finally regenerates into his eighth incarnation (McGann). The Master manages to cheat death, and while the Doctor is on Earth his spirit takes over the body of a paramedic named Bruce ([[Eric Roberts]]). The Master (Roberts) then attempts to steal the Doctor's remaining lives by opening the [[Eye of Harmony]] inside the Doctor's time machine, the [[TARDIS]], nearly destroying the Earth in the process. However, the Doctor and his companion [[Grace Holloway|Dr Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]) are able to prevent the Earth's destruction, and the Master is sucked into the Eye.\n\nThe TV film did not lead to the commissioning of a revived television series, and while Eighth Doctor stories continued in other media, ''Doctor Who'' did not air again on television until 2005. After this, footage and stills from the TV film would be used in later episodes \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" (2008), \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\", \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\" (both 2010) and \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\" (2013).

The episode begins during the raging [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] between [[Dalek]]s and Time Lords when he is killed when attempting to save a young woman who rejects salvation at the hands of a Time Lord causing them both to die in a spaceship crash. He awakens in the company of the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q\u2013Z)#Sisterhood of Karn|Sisterhood of Karn]], who explain that he has died and been temporarily resurrected. They urge him to bring the war to an end, and give him a choice of elixirs to trigger his regeneration. Saluting his various companions from the Big Finish audio range, he drinks an elixir designed to produce a warrior, regenerating into the [[War Doctor]] ([[John Hurt]]) who declares himself to be the Doctor \"no more.\" In \"The Day of the Doctor,\" the Eighth Doctor joins all of the other incarnations of the Doctor in saving Gallifrey at the end of the Time War. He can be briefly seen on a screen in the War Room, though like the other past incarnations of the Doctor, this is achieved through archive footage.\n\n==Costume==\nThe Eighth Doctor initially wore a [[Wild Bill Hickok]] costume including a battleship grey [[cravat]] tie intended for a New Year's fancy dress party, which he liberated from the lockers at the San Francisco hospital he regenerated in. He completed it with a pair of black leather shoes taken from Grace Holloway's ex-boyfriend Brian to give him the appearance somewhere between a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] dandy and [[wild west]] gambler. By the time of \"The Night of the Doctor\" he sported a worn and bottle green [[moleskin]] [[overcoat]], a ruffled and midnight-blue [[ascot tie]], a bronze grey [[paisley (design)|paisley]] [[waistcoat]], [[leather]] [[gaiters]], and caramel brown [[US Cavalry|US Army Cavalry]] boots...corresponding with his overall weary appearance, presumably as a result of many experiences during the Time War.\n\n=== Big Finish costume ===\nIn 2010, Paul McGann revealed a new costume and [[sonic screwdriver]] for the Eighth Doctor which he indicated would be the new costume going forward. The cover and promotional photographs for the 2012 Big Finish story, ''Dark Eyes'' is, however, the first story to officially feature the new costume. The new outfit was originally premiered in 2010 at the [[Armageddon (convention)|Armageddon Pop Culture Expo]], along with a redesigned Sonic Screwdriver, courtesy of [[Weta Workshop]]. These changes were independently produced and were not affiliated with Big Finish Productions or the BBC, but were accepted as suitable for official use after the fact.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url= http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2010/10/new-eighth-doctor-costume-revealed.html\n | title= New Eighth Doctor costume revealed\n | first= Doctor Who\n | last= News\n | publisher=\n}}\n</ref>\nThe costume consists of a royal blue leather [[pea coat]], a white [[T-shirt]], navy blue [[jeans]] and brown shoes. In this outfit the Doctor also carries a brown [[messenger bag]].\n\n==Spin-off appearances==\n\n===Novels===\nAlmost as soon as he'd left San Francisco, the Doctor had another brief attack of amnesia, caused by a final trap of the Master's. To regain his memories, the Doctor was forced to visit all seven of his past selves and help them out with some crisis or another, at the same time acknowledging the responsibility his role gave him. Having regained his memories, the Doctor met a late twentieth-century [[Coal Hill School]] student named [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Samantha Jones]]; shortly after their encounter, the Doctor left her alone at a [[Greenpeace]] rally.\n\nFor a time, the Doctor adventured with an [[Ice Warrior]] named [[Ssard]] and a human woman named [[Stacy Townsend]], who fell in love with each other; some while after they parted ways with the Doctor, the two invited him to serve as best man at their wedding (''[[Placebo Effect (novel)|Placebo Effect]]''). He also, at some point, teamed up with his old companion [[Bernice Summerfield]], [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] and [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] to combat [[The Dying Days|an Ice Warrior occupation of Great Britain]].\n\n====Faction Paradox====\nEventually, three years after his departure and one hour after he left, the Doctor returned to the Greenpeace rally. With Sam collected, the pair spent a great period wandering together, facing dozens of adventures. During their travels, Sam and the Doctor became aware of a great war, looming in the future of Gallifrey, [[Time War (Doctor Who)#Eighth Doctor Adventures|between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified Enemy]], with dramatic and disturbing consequences. While exploring the issue of the war, the Doctor discovered that his Sam was not the original Samantha Jones; rather, her biodata had been manipulated by an outside agency with the intent to mould her into a prosaic distraction for him (''[[Alien Bodies]]''). Ultimately this plan proved a failure, as Sam developed into a much more strongly-willed companion than intended; at one point she spent three years avoiding the Doctor, so as to cope with a crush she had developed on him, but managed to survive and make a good life for herself in the future until she rejoined the Doctor as she could make more of a difference with him.\n\nThe close dynamic between the pair was shifted with the introduction of [[Fitz Kreiner]], a sixties bar singer incorrectly suspected of matricide. Fitz took on the role of a sort of younger brother to the Doctor, placing the Time Lord on as high a pedestal as Fitz had ever known. Eventually Fitz found himself abducted by [[Faction Paradox]], a \"time-travelling voodoo cult\", and brainwashed into their legions. When the Doctor realised that a Faction member he had encountered was a biomass copy of Fitz- a 'clone' created and shaped based on others' memories and perceptions of Fitz-, he used the TARDIS's telepathic circuits to restore Fitz's memories and identity to the clone, believing that the original Fitz was dead and reasoning that the clone would essentially be the real Fitz in every way that mattered.\n\nWith both Sam and Fitz gone \u2013 Sam's origins established as a temporal paradox caused by exposure to a scar in reality created when the Doctor regenerated, which the 'original' Sam was only exposed to because the Doctor met blonde Sam \u2013 the Doctor continued his travels with the clone Fitz (although he was treated as the real one and generally thought of himself as such) and [[Compassion (Doctor Who)|Compassion]], an ex-Faction agent implanted with an interface that the Doctor found compatible with his TARDIS. Unbeknownst to the Doctor, the Faction \u2013 with the aid of the original Fitz \u2013 had changed his history, drawing the [[Third Doctor]] to a planet he should never have visited and causing a chain of events that culminated in the Third Doctor regenerating ahead of schedule, allowing them to infect him with the Faction Paradox biodata virus. While his immune system would allow him to resist the virus for a time, it would gain a greater hold on him with each subsequent regeneration, until it would finally transform him into a faction member in his eighth incarnation (''[[Interference: Book One]] and [[Interference: Book Two|Two]]'').\n\nEventually, Compassion's implant, linked to the Doctor's TARDIS to prevent her being influenced by random local signals, triggered her unexpected mutation into a sentient Type 102 TARDIS, specifically the \"mother\" of the TARDISes that would be used in the pending War. With this knowledge, the Time Lords \u2013 led by [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]], now in her third incarnation \u2013 attempted to capture Compassion, intending to use her as breeding stock in preparation for the war. In response, and in light of the apparent destruction of his old TARDIS in a dimensional rift, the Doctor and Fitz retreated into Compassion and fled, the Doctor refusing to let his people enslave his friend in such a manner and resolving to keep on the run until he could find another way to deal with the issue of the War (''[[The Shadows of Avalon]]'').\n\nThe Doctor and Fitz travelled in Compassion for some time, until the machinations of Faction Paradox came to a head back on Gallifrey. As it turned out, in the new timeline triggered by the Doctor's infection, the Doctor was destined to become \"[[Grandfather Paradox (Doctor Who)|Grandfather Paradox]]\", the mythical founder of Faction Paradox. The only factor keeping the original sequence of events in play was the Doctor's TARDIS, which had rebuilt itself after its apparent destruction on Avalon, and had now materialised in a twisted form above Gallifrey, holding within itself the Doctor's original reality where he had regenerated on Metebelis III and never been infected ever since it sensed that something was wrong when the Third Doctor regenerated ahead of schedule.\n\nIn a final confrontation with his future self, the Doctor resolved the timeline conflict by channelling the TARDIS's built-up energies through its weapon systems, thereby destroying both the Faction Paradox fleet and Gallifrey itself. In so doing, the TARDIS was able to rewrite the altered timeline with the original one that it \"remembered\"; no longer able to contain both timelines as a result of its energy drain, one reality had to become 'real'. As a side effect, however, the Doctor's entire memory was erased, apparently from the trauma of the event (''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'').\n\n====Amnesia on Earth====\nTo give the Doctor time to recover and the TARDIS time to regenerate from the extensive damage it had suffered, Compassion dropped the Doctor off on Earth in the year 1889; she then delivered Fitz to 2001, with the intent that he wait for the Doctor to catch up to him. With that, Compassion departed for parts unknown. Back in 1889, meanwhile, the Doctor awoke in a railway carriage to discover no memory as to his real identity, and no possessions save a small, shapeless box\u2013 what was left of the TARDIS after its power loss\u2014 and a note, simply stating \"Meet me in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]', 8 February 2001. Fitz\".\n\nDespite his amnesia, the Doctor retained a wide general knowledge. However, he also showed an uncharacteristic callous streak, easily allowing others to die if he felt that they 'deserved' to perish (''[[The Burning (Doctor Who)|The Burning]]''). To contrast, he was capable of feeling unusually poignant warmth, even dating a woman in the 1980s, and adopting a young girl named [[Miranda (Doctor Who)|Miranda]], a Time Lady from the future (''[[Father Time (Doctor Who)|Father Time]]''). During this time, he often became involved in strange problems outside the norm, such as confronting an entity that was essentially sentient fire (''[[The Burning (novel)|The Burning]]''). He experienced a particular funk in the 1950s, feeling that his efforts to learn about his past were pointless, but his interest in life was re-inspired when he was recruited to defeat his old enemies the Players as they sought to escalate the Cold War (''[[Endgame (Doctor Who)|Endgame]]'').\n\nUnsure what \"St Louis\" was intended by the note, the Doctor created his own in London: the St Louis Bar and Restaurant. As 2001 rolled around, Fitz indeed turned up there to meet him. With the aid of new companion [[Anji Kapoor]], the Doctor and Fitz completed the TARDIS's regeneration, dealt with a race of invading aliens, then set back again to exploring time and space (''[[Escape Velocity (Doctor Who)|Escape Velocity]]'').\n\nWith his freedom restored, the Doctor chose to counteract his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered all manner of unusual beings \u2013 from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (''[[The Year of Intelligent Tigers]]''), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold \u2013 as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (''[[Eater of Wasps]]'') \u2013 he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever had happened to him had happened for a reason, and he might as well make use of the advantages it offered.\n\n====Sabbath and parallel times====\nOnly a few months after resuming his old lifestyle, the Doctor faced another radical change: the loss of his second heart.  As it happened, the heart served as a bond with Gallifrey; with the planet gone, the heart had begun to fester within the Doctor's body, pumping it with poison.\n\nA man named [[Sabbath (Doctor Who)|Sabbath]], an eighteenth-century secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised the blackened organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor of some of his higher Time Lord abilities, including his respiratory bypass system and his ability to metabolise toxins. It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers, including allowing Sabbath to travel further from Earth in his own time machine than he had previously been capable of. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm, returning to life after up to a day in a death-like state even after sustaining normally regeneration-inducing injuries such as getting his chest crushed by sandbags (though any injury sustained by the Doctor would weaken Sabbath).\n\nEventually, after a woman Sabbath loved sacrificed herself to save the Doctor from a malfunctioning time machine, Sabbath tore out the Doctor's second heart, allowing the Doctor to begin growing a new one.\n\nShortly after the restoration of his heart, the Doctor found himself locked in a desperate struggle with Sabbath as, along with his mysterious business associates, Sabbath hatched a plan to destroy all alternate realities. Sabbath believed that time travellers like the Doctor, every time they landed somewhere, created an alternate reality where they didn't show up, and that the universe was unable to support so many alternates without suffering damage; therefore, he attempted to trigger an explosion at Event One \u2013 the [[Big Bang]] \u2013 that would erase all alternate universes and leaving only one possible timeline. However, Sabbath's allies had been lying to him; in reality, Time would only split if absolutely necessary, and even then, it was nearly impossible to travel between alternate realities. In reality, Sabbath had been manipulated into creating a plan that would effectively wipe out free will itself, with the Doctor proving that Sabbath's perception was wrong when they found themselves in a situation that could only have occurred due to time travel in a single timeline.\n\nThe explosion at Event One was averted when the Doctor diverted the black light that would have triggered the explosion to 1898, but instead of reality collapsing into a single controllable timeline, what occurred was reality starting to 'slide' between histories, multiple parallel realities fighting to become the dominant one. Along with new companion [[Trix MacMillan|Trix]], the Doctor, Fitz and Anji travelled through the realities, including a world where the computer was never invented, a world where Earth was devastated by a strange even as all life aged forty years in 1843, and a world where humanity had time-travelling tours, with the Doctor being forced to erase at least two of these realities as he sought to restore the original timeline. During this adventure, the Doctor appeared to become a bit more cold and calculating, sacrificing an innocent man to escape a pocket universe and even leaving alternate versions of Fitz and Anji to die to preserve continuity. However, in the end, their sacrifices paid off, the Doctor managing to stabilise reality by resolving a paradox that had been hanging over them since the beginning of the crisis, and then, with Sabbath's help, they confronted his masters; the Council of Eight, mysterious beings who gained power by foreseeing likely future events and then ensuring that they came to pass. The Doctor, as a rogue element existing outside of Time, was the only unpredictable factor in their universe, and was thus the only person who could stop them. Ironically, it was Sabbath himself who gave the Doctor the edge needed to stop the Council; realising that one of the Council members expected Sabbath to shoot the Council member with a weapon designed to send the subject into the Time Vortex, Sabbath instead shot himself, condemning himself to eternal agony in the Time Vortex, but completely undoing the Council's plan and destroying their space station, simultaneously restoring the possibility of parallel worlds to the universe.\n\n====''The Gallifrey Chronicles''====\nSome while after this, the Doctor was captured by Marnal, one of the few surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005 novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'' ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.\n\n===Audio dramas===\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|date=June 2017|\n {{Cleanup-tense|section|present|date=April 2014}}\n}}\nPaul McGann first returned to his role as the Eighth Doctor in ''[[Storm Warning (audio drama)|Storm Warning]]'', the first in a series of audio plays, in which the Doctor lands on Earth in October 1930 aboard the doomed [[R101]] airship. Aboard the vessel, the Doctor meets a young adventuress called [[Charley Pollard]] (played by [[India Fisher]]). In the course of his adventure, the Doctor saves Charley's life and takes her aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. This was done in good faith, but the Doctor soon learns that Charley's rescue greatly and negatively effected the timestream.\n\nDespite established in-universe history partly relying upon her death on the R101, the Doctor is unable to return her to preserve the timeline, with Charley's continued existence forming a rough plot arc over two \"seasons\" of audio adventures as the Doctor discovers a series of minor historical anomalies caused by the damage to the timeline, such as the CIA existing in 1933 or [[Benjamin Franklin]] being president. The Doctor eventually learns that, due to Charley's survival, the universe has become infected with \"anti-time,\" leading to a conflict with the wraith-like Never People- individuals who were erased from history for crimes against reality and now seek to unleash the destructive anti-time against the universe- with the resolution of this conflict depicting the Doctor choosing to sacrifice himself and his TARDIS by absorbing anti-time energy, which seals the rift and preserves Charley's life but transforms him into the bogeyman Zagreus. Later restored to sanity but still infected with anti-time through the actions of Charley, his old companions Leela and Romana, and recreations of his immediate three preceding incarnations, the Doctor chooses again to sacrifice himself for the sake of Charley and the universe by removing himself from space and time. He enters a divergent universe for which he has no prior knowledge or frame of reference and in which there is no concept of linear time (''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''). Meanwhile, Charley stows away on his TARDIS, in a sense nullifying the Doctor's sacrifice by again placing herself in danger; for a time, this fact causes great friction between the characters and personal angst for the Doctor.\n\nFor another two seasons, the Doctor, Charley, and a new companion by the name of [[C'rizz]], explore the divergent universe, gradually unravelling a deep plot designed around the Doctor by [[Rassilon]], founder of Time Lord society, who had previously been trapped in anti-time by the Doctor for his role in the creation of Zagreus. Eventually, with the aid of his companions, the Doctor escapes the trap built for him, overcomes his emotional burden, learns that he has been purged of Zagreus, and returns to his normal universe with Charley and C'rizz (''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]'').\n\nFollowing that point, which coincided with the end of the official Big Finish \"seasons\" in light of the return of ''Doctor Who'' to television in 2005, the trio wanders freely. The only continuing plot element involved C'rizz, whose character exhibits unusual and potentially destructive psychological development. This development culminates in C'rizz's death (''[[Absolution (Doctor Who)|Absolution]]''), which inspires in Charley a desire to leave the Doctor's company. Due to amnesia brought on by a healing coma induced by a cyber-planner, the Eighth Doctor believes Charley has left him in 2008 [[Singapore]] (''[[The Girl Who Never Was]]''), when she is in fact displaced into the year 500,002, whence she is rescued by the [[Sixth Doctor]] (''[[The Condemned (Doctor Who audio)|The Condemned]]''). Believing that the Eighth Doctor died before their parting, Charley thus spends some time travelling with the Sixth Doctor, but their time together ends when an alien race called the Viyrans replace his memories of Charley with another woman, Mila, to preserve the timeline.\n\nStarting New Year's Eve 2006, a new audio series titled ''[[The Eighth Doctor Adventures (audio drama series)|The Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' featuring the Doctor and new companion [[Lucie Miller]] (played by [[Sheridan Smith]]) was broadcast on BBC7. A second series followed in 2007. A third season was streamed from the Big Finish website, and was available on CD. A fourth and final season started in 2009 with the Christmas episode ''[[Death in Blackpool]]'' which dealt with Lucie's departure. Also in December 2009, the standalone episode ''[[An Earthly Child]]'' was released, in which the Doctor visits his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] on Earth (following up on the events of the [[First Doctor]] adventure ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'') and meets his great-grandson Alex Campbell. In ''[[Situation Vacant]]'' the Doctor gains a new companion, [[Tamsin Drew]] \u2013 drawn from four prospective companions. This season puts the Eighth Doctor up against a new incarnation of [[The Monk (Doctor Who)|the Meddling Monk]], now travelling with Lucie Miller, but in the course of the season Tamsin is seduced to the Meddling Monk's way of thinking while Lucie finds the Monk's violence distasteful and re-joins the Doctor. When the Monk helps the Daleks launch an invasion of Earth, Tamsin, Lucie, and Alex are killed driving them off, although at the last minute the Monk betrays the Daleks to help save the Doctor and Susan.\n\nIn November 2012 Big Finish released a boxed set of four audio dramas called ''[[Dark Eyes (audio drama)|Dark Eyes]]'', whose stories take place after ''[[To the Death (audio drama)|To the Death]]''. The set also introduced a new companion, [[Molly O'Sullivan]] (played by [[Ruth Bradley]]), an Irish [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] nursing assistant in [[World War I]]. Here the Eighth Doctor changes his appearance, cutting his hair and changing into a WWI navy trench coat after his Victorian clothing is ruined.\n\nAn [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate]] version of the Eighth Doctor, from a timeline where the Seventh Doctor regenerates after being shot by the Nazis in the 1950s, was first mentioned in the audio drama ''[[Colditz (audio drama)|Colditz]]'', and appears (played by McGann) in ''[[Survival of the Fittest & Klein\u2019s Story#Klein\u2019s Story|Klein's Story]]''. Under the alias \"Schmidt,\" the Doctor teaches [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Klein|Klein]] how to pilot the TARDIS, thereby putting her in a position to inadvertently assist the Seventh Doctor in preventing this timeline from occurring (unable to go back himself as the TARDIS security protocols would prevent him from going somewhere where he was already).\n\nIn a trilogy of adventures, released in October through December 2011 as part of Big Finish's continuing monthly range, The Doctor travels with [[Mary Shelley (Doctor Who)|Mary Shelley]] (as played by [[Julie Cox]]), first acknowledged as a friend of the Eighth Doctor's in ''[[The Company of Friends]]''. The first story, ''[[The Silver Turk]]'', features the early breed of the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as seen in ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[The Witch from the Well]]'' tests the pair's relationship, and the trilogy concludes with ''[[Army of Death]]''.\n\nIn 2013, Big Finish released a special 50th Anniversary story, ''The Light at the End'', in which the Master ([[Geoffrey Beevers]]) implements a plot to trap and destroy all eight incarnations of the Doctor by keeping him on Gallifrey. The Eighth Doctor and Charley meet up with the Fourth Doctor ([[Tom Baker]]) and Leela ([[Louise Jameson]]), the Fifth Doctor ([[Peter Davison]]) and Nyssa ([[Sarah Sutton]]), the Sixth Doctor ([[Colin Baker]]) and Peri, and the Seventh Doctor ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) and Ace ([[Sophie Aldred]]). Working together with the First Doctor ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), Second Doctor ([[Frazer Hines]]), and Third Doctor (Tim Treloar)), they manage to break free of the Master's trap and prevent time from being rewritten so that the Doctor would never have left Gallifrey. Companions [[Susan Foreman|Susan]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]), [[Steven Taylor (Doctor Who)|Steven Taylor]] ([[Peter Purves]]), [[Sara Kingdom]] ([[Jean Marsh]]), [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] ([[Anneke Wills]]), [[Jamie McCrimmon]] ([[Frazer Hines]]), [[Zoe Heriot]] ([[Wendy Padbury]]), [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]), [[Tegan Jovanka]] ([[Janet Fielding]]), and [[Vislor Turlough|Turlough]] ([[Mark Strickson]]) also made appearances in the audio drama.\n\nIn the 2013 live action mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\", the Eighth Doctor saluted Charley, C'rizz, Lucie, Tamsin and Molly from the Big Finish range prior to his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]].\n\nFollowing the success of the first ''Dark Eyes'' boxed set, Big Finish released three more sets, continuing Molly's story and introducing [[Liv Chenka]] as a new companion (Chenka having previously met the Seventh Doctor in the audio ''Robophobia''). The Eighth Doctor goes on to appear in a four-CD, four-part miniseries, ''Doom Coalition'', which sees him, Liv, and new companion Helen Sinclair on the hunt for the insane Time Lord known as the Eleven, who suffers from a unique mental defect where all of his past personalities are active in his mind at once. In the course of the series, the Doctor peripherally interacts with the [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s future wife [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] (although she takes care to avoid directly interacting with the Eighth Doctor unless disguised) and at one point confronts an alliance between the Monk and the [[Weeping Angels]]. ''Doom Coalition'' concludes with the Doctor thwarting the plans of the titular Coalition, who are revealed to be a group of Time Lords led by the Doctor's old schoolfriend Padrac, with Padrac's latest consultations with the Matrix having driven him to the conclusion that the only way to save Gallifrey from 'prophecies' of its own destruction is to destroy the rest of the universe.\n\nBeginning in 2017, Big Finish began releasing two separate Eighth Doctor series of box sets in the form of ''Ravenous'' and ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War''. ''Ravenous'' is a series of four four-part box sets that serve as a direct sequel to ''Doom Coalition'', initially depicting the Doctor and Liv's efforts to find Helen after she is trapped with the Eleven, but subsequently progresses to depict their efforts to oppose the Ravenous, an ancient race who are essentially the natural predator of the Time Lords as they evolved to feed on the energy released when Time Lords regenerate (the Ravenous are described as being the reason humans fear clowns, as they essentially resemble clowns in their natural state). The series concludes with the Doctor indirectly working with three different incarnations of the Master- including the Master of the TV movie, the War Master and Missy, the latter two of whom do not meet the Doctor face-to-face- to essentially restore the Ravenous to their original state, having determined that they drain energy from Time Lords after an ancient Gallifreyan scientist accidentally stole much of their natural energy millennia ago. ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War'' is another series of four four-part box sets, set later in the Eighth Doctor's life during the early days of the Time War, depicting his efforts to protect those caught in the crossfire with the aid of his new companion Bliss, whose planet's history was undone when a Time Lord agent turned her planet into a weapons depot while her own history is in chaos due to the side-effects of the Time War. The third volume of ''Time War'' also sees the Doctor forced to face the [[Valeyard]] once again when his other self is recreated due to the Doctor being exposed to biology-manipulating technology while using a transmat, the two technologies somehow manifesting a new version of the Valeyard from the transmat after the Doctor departs.\n\n===Comic strips===\n\n====Unfinished business====\n\nIn the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strips, at an unstated time after his regeneration (and after an adventure in the 1930s involving [[Fey Truscott-Sade]] and psychic weasels), the Doctor revisited the town of Stockbridge. After being caught up in the games of the [[Celestial Toymaker]], he picked up a new companion in lively sci-fi fan [[Izzy Sinclair]]. The two of them were soon caught up in the machinations of the Doctor's old enemies the Threshold, a mercenary organisation. The Threshold attempted to manipulate the Doctor into stopping the Daleks gaining access to the multiverse (which would kill an artificial solar system as a side effect) and dying in the attempt, but were outmaneuvered. Unknown to him, they implanted a device in Fey Truscott-Sade so that they could use her as an unwilling spy when she next encountered the Doctor. She did so in 1939, assisting him and Izzy against the vampiric Varney; the Doctor was left infected with a deadly bacillus, and he had to be taken to Gallifrey to be cured, luring him into a battle against a Time Lord cult called the Final Chapter.\n\nWorking out that the Threshold were using Fey as a spy, the Doctor and his old comrade [[Shayde]] faked a regeneration. The Threshold was conned into believing they were facing a vulnerable new Doctor (Shayde in disguise), allowing the real Doctor to infiltrate their base. While he and his friends were too late to stop the Threshold from destroying every single spacecraft in the universe, they were able to bring about the organisation's destruction before it could profit. Fey returned to her time, having also bonded with Shayde to save his life.\n\nUnknowingly, the TARDIS had been taken over by the Master, who was manipulating events to gain the power of the omniversal Glory. The Doctor was specifically sent to times and places that would undermine him \u2013 discovering he had upset the course of Grace Holloway's life in 2001, encountering an alien race with motivations uncomfortably similar to his which caused death and horror in 17th Century Japan, and almost killing the benevolent [[Kroton (Cyberman)|Kroton]] by mistake. (A slight diversion between events saw the Doctor and Izzy team up with the actor [[Tom Baker]] and other 1970s television actors against [[Beep the Meep]] in 1979.)\n\nIn 17th Century Japan, the Doctor's attempt to save the life of samurai Katsura Sato, a friend of Izzy, left the man inadvertently immortal and thus robbed of both an honourable death and any sense of empathy. The Master later came for Sato, when he was mentally vulnerable, and gave him a fake religion to focus his mind on; Earth's history was altered as Sato, renamed Lord Morningstar, and his Church of the Glorious Dead conquered the planet, creating a technological advanced, highly brutal planet of jihadists. The Doctor, Izzy and Kroton wandered into their invasion of the museum planet Paradost; while the Doctor faced the Master over the Glory, Izzy and Kroton spent weeks on the occupied world. The Doctor was defeated, only for the Master discover he was not able to access the Glory, as instead Kroton and Sato had been the ones prophesied to battle for it. Kroton won the Glory, the Master was purged from the TARDIS and history was reverted, and the Doctor and Izzy took a well-earned break.\n\n====Destrii====\n\nDuring a battle against the body-stealing Ophidians and their gigantic snake-shaped techno-organic warship, the Doctor and Izzy encountered a brash and adventurous fish-woman called [[Destrii]]. While seemingly friendly and bonding with Izzy, Destrii was secretly on the run and she swapped bodies with Izzy to cover her escape; when Destrii was seemingly killed, Izzy seemed trapped within an alien body. The Doctor's next few journeys were spent trying to help her in this situation, both in coming to terms with the change and finding out what her new body's abilities were. [[Frida Kahlo]] helped Izzy mentally deal with the change, but the attempt at testing Izzy's abilities led her and the Doctor into a turbulent encounter with the humanised Daleks he had created in his [[Evil of the Daleks|second incarnation]]. Unable to prevent their tragic end \u2013 self-destructing to escape the machinations of the malevolent psychic Kata-Phobus -, the two of them were distracted and caught off-guard when Helioth and Hassana, two of the energy-beings called the Horde, abducted Izzy thinking she was Destrii.\n\nThe Doctor went on a relentless search to rescue his friend, with the help of Fey/Shayde and by forcing co-operation from Destrii, still alive in her stolen body. His quest led him to the planet Oblivion, a surreal and brutal world ruled by Destrii's mother, the Matriax. Izzy was rescued and returned to her original form, while Oblivion's court system and the menace of the Horde were both destroyed, leaving Destrii free to leave her world and explore the universe with her roguish uncle Jodafra. However, Izzy had decided she wanted to return home to her family, and the Doctor was left alone.\n\nFeeling slightly morose, the Doctor was cheered up by an unknowing encounter with his old companion [[Frobisher (Doctor Who)|Frobisher]] and went on several 'holiday' adventures on his own. He eventually re-encountered Destrii and Jodafra in America during the 19th Century, where the upcoming clash between [[General Custer]] and [[Chief Sitting Bull]] was interrupted by Jodafra's machinations involving the monstrous [[wendigo]]. Jodafra had made a deal with the creature: power in exchange for being fed children. Unable to stomach this and with the Doctor urging her to listen to the spark of decency in her, Destrii helped the Doctor stop her uncle. In revenge, she was left beaten and abandoned, and the Doctor took her in as a probationary companion. Together, the two of them teamed up with [[MI6]] and faced an invasion of early 21st Century Earth by time-travelling [[Cybermen]]; they were preparing to chemically overload the emotions of humans and thus make them willingly surrender to have their emotions removed by conversion. The Doctor destroyed them through use of the Time Vortex (similar to the later \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\"), almost surrendering to it but giving up its power to save Destrii.\n\nIn 2007, [[Panini Books]] published ''Doctor Who: The Flood'', the final collection of comic strips featuring the Eighth Doctor in ''Doctor Who Magazine''. The book includes the essay \"Flood Barriers\" by strip editor Clayton Hickman in which he reveals that [[Russell T Davies]] had authorised the comic strip to depict the regeneration of the Eighth Doctor into the [[Ninth Doctor]] at the end of the 2004\u20132005 arc, ''The Flood''. The cause of the regeneration would have been the Doctor's exposure to the Time Vortex in his efforts to destroy the Cybermen (the same cause that triggered the later Ninth to [[Tenth Doctor]] regeneration in ''Parting of the Ways''). Destrii would have witnessed the regeneration and would have continued to travel with the Ninth Doctor in a proposed ''Year One'' arc. However [[BBC Wales]] vetoed the ''Year One'' arc and indicated the Ninth Doctor could only be shown travelling with [[Rose Tyler]], Hickman and writer Scott Gray eventually decided not to depict the regeneration as they would have been unable to give Destrii a proper departure. The Panini collection includes the original script for the regeneration sequence, as well as never before published art showing the regeneration itself.<ref>{{Cite book\n\n|last=\n|first=\n|author2=\n|year=2007\n|title=Doctor Who: The Flood \u2013 The Complete Eighth Doctor Comic Strips Volume 4\n|location=London\n|publisher=[[Panini Books]]\n|isbn=978-1-905239-65-8\n|pages=216\u2013223\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor''===\nIn the ''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor'' comic series, the Eighth Doctor \u2013 from a point shortly before the Time War, as he is shown in the clothing and hairstyle he wore in \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" \u2013 is visiting an old holiday house of his where he encounters a young painter named Josie Day.

He is portrayed by [[Paul McGann]].\n\nThe character was introduced in the 1996 TV film ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]'', a [[Television pilot#Backdoor pilot|back-door pilot]] produced in an unsuccessful attempt to relaunch the series following its 1989 cancellation. While the Eighth Doctor initially had only one on-screen appearance, his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off media]], including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann. In 2013, the actor reprised the role in the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", which depicts the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]] (played by [[John Hurt]]).\n\nWithin the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien (a [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]]) who [[time travel in fiction|travels in time and space]] in his [[TARDIS]], frequently with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]].  At the end of life, the Doctor's body can [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]], but in doing so gains a new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality.\n\nMcGann portrays the eighth such incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His only companion in the television film is [[Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]), a medical doctor whose surgery is partly responsible for triggering his regeneration. In the continued adventures of the character depicted in audio dramas, novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other companions, including self-styled \"Edwardian Adventuress\" [[Charley Pollard|Charley]], the alien [[Destrii]] and present-day humans [[Lucie Miller|Lucie]] and [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Sam]].\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|thumb|left|A deadly confrontation between the Doctor and the [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]].]]\n\nThe Eighth Doctor made his first television appearance in the [[Doctor Who (film)|1996 ''Doctor Who'' television film]], the first time the Doctor had returned to television screens since the end of the original series in 1989. Intended as a [[Backdoor pilots|backdoor pilot]] for a new television series on the [[Fox Network]], the film drew 5.5% of the US audience, according to Nielsen Ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.sf.tv/msg/d12b3e9f2de93c3e?dmode=source|title=Google Groups|website=groups.google.com}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, it was received well, attracting over 9&nbsp;million viewers and generally positive reviews. It was also generally well received in Australia.<ref>''Data Extract'', 121, July/August 1996, and see [[Doctor Who in Australia]].</ref>\n\nAlthough the film failed to spark a new television series, the Eighth Doctor's adventures continued in various licensed [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media, notably [[BBC Books]]' ''[[Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' novels, audio plays from [[Big Finish Productions]], and the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strip. These stories spanned the nine years between 1996 and the debut of the new television series in 2005. He is the longest-serving Doctor in the ''Doctor Who Magazine'' comic strip. In the wake of the positive reaction to the revived television series in 2005, several of the Eighth Doctor's Big Finish audio dramas were also broadcast on [[BBC7]] radio in an edited form. The trailers for these broadcasts explained that these adventures took place before the destruction of [[Gallifrey]], the Doctor's homeworld, as described in the revived TV series. In 2007, BBC7 aired a new series of Eighth Doctor audio adventures, created specifically for radio broadcast. Paul McGann has continued to portray the Eighth Doctor in the various audio spinoffs.\n\nThe [[Whoniverse#Inclusion and continuity|continuity]] of the spin-off media with respect to the television series and to each other is open to interpretation. (The \"Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who\" on the BBC's classic ''Doctor Who'' website suggests this may be due to the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]].)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/guide.shtml |title=Beginner's Guide to Doctor Who |accessdate=8 February 2007 |format=[[Adobe Flash|Flash]] required |work=Doctor Who website |publisher=BBC}}</ref> It has been suggested that the Eighth Doctor's adventures in three different forms (novels, audio, and comics) take place in three separate continuities. The discontinuities were made explicit in the audio drama ''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |title=Zagreus |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |work=Doctor Who Reference Guide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129000300/http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_bf50.htm |archivedate=29 January 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> In response, it has become increasingly common to consider the three ranges separately. The final ''Eighth Doctor Adventures'' novel, ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005&nbsp;novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'', obliquely references this split in timelines, even suggesting that the split results in the three alternative forms of the [[Ninth Doctor]] (a reference to the fact three different versions of the incarnation have appeared in various media). ''Mary's Story'', a 2009 audio story by Big Finish, contradicted these suggestions, as there the Doctor mentions his companions in order, with book companions before audio companions. In \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", the Doctor \"salutes\" five of his companions by name, all from the Big Finish audio productions.\n\n[[File:Past Doctors section.jpg|thumb|left|The Eighth Doctor appears as a sketch in \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\".]]\n\nDespite the fact the Eighth Doctor appeared on television only twice, he is the most prolific of all the Doctors (to date) in terms of number of individual stories published in novel, novella, short story and audio form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who.htm |title=Doctor Who Reference Guide |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Boies |first=Dominique |date=30 January 2007}}</ref> In 2007, the Eighth Doctor finally made a second appearance (of sorts) within the television series' continuity. In the episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" he appears on-screen as a sketch (alongside other incarnations) in the book ''[[List of Doctor Who items#J|A Journal of Impossible Things]]'' by John Smith. In 2008 and 2010 he appeared again as a brief image in \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" and \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\" along with every other incarnation up to that time. In 2010's \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\", he is shown in a flashback with his first, second, third, fourth, ninth and tenth incarnations. In 2013's \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\", he is shown in a flashback along with the Doctor's other incarnations; he is also fleetingly seen running past companion [[Clara Oswald]] in the following episode, \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\", though his face is not shown. Later that year, McGann reprised the role for the mini-episode \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", a prelude to the show's [[The Day of the Doctor|50th anniversary special]]. This appearance marked the Eighth Doctor's final adventure and his [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwho.tv/whats-new/video/mini-episode-the-night-of-the-doctor/ | title=The Night of the Doctor | accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref> \"The Night of the Doctor\" proved popular with fans of the series, some of whom petitioned the BBC to make a spin-off series starring the Eighth Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/online-petition-new-doctor-who-657189|title=Online Petition for New 'Doctor Who' Spin-Off Tops 9,000 Names|date=18 November 2013|author=Graeme McMillan|publisher=HollywoodReporter.com|work=Heat-vision|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231237/doctor-who-8-reasons-paul-mcganns-eighth-doctor-deserves-a-series|title=Doctor Who: 8 Reasons Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor Deserves a Series|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Ethan Lewis|date=27 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/doctor-who/231124/doctor-who-petition-for-paul-mcgann-spinoff-passes-15000-signatures|title=Doctor Who: Petition For Paul McGann Spinoff Passes 15,000 Signatures!|publisher=denofgeek.us|author=Bridget LaMonica|date=23 November 2013|accessdate=3 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nThe BBC's official website calls the Eighth Doctor an \"effortlessly charming, romantic figure\". The site states that he is both unguarded about his own background and candid about the future of those he meets, noting the irony in an \"open Doctor\" remaining such a closed book.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4GLP0JZNhRl46DS6jDX4fMr/the-eighth-doctor|title=The Eighth Doctor|publisher=BBC One|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Big Finish Productions]] website describes the Eighth Doctor as \"an enthusiastic figure who explores the universe for the sheer love of it\", always surviving on the strength of his excellent improvisational skills rather than preparing elaborate plans. The site states that he is \"passionate, direct, sympathetic and emotionally accessible\", but notes that these traits are \"balanced by occasional feelings of self-doubt and weariness of his endless battles against evil.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/ranges/released/eighth-doctor-adventures|title=DOCTOR WHO \u2013 EIGHTH DOCTOR ADVENTURES \u2013 RELEASED ITEMS|publisher=Big Finish|accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nDiscussing \"The Night of the Doctor\", McGann said, \"[Moffat's] instinctive take on the Eighth Doctor was exactly how I'd imagined this character to be, even way back, back in the 90s. You know, this... like a bruised nobility. I know it sounds wanky now, but... he's decent, but he's compromised. He's not a warrior, really, at all. There's a pacifist side to him, but he's a realist as well.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Benjamin | date=May 2014 |title=Physician, Heal Thyself... |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=472 |page=19}}</ref>\n\n==Television appearances==\n===TV movie===\nThe Eighth Doctor debuts in the TV film ''[[Doctor Who (1996 film)|Doctor Who]]''. While transporting the remains of his longtime nemesis [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] to Gallifrey, the [[Seventh Doctor]] ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) is caught in the crossfire of a gang shoot-out in 1999 [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco's Chinatown, USA]]. He is taken to a hospital where surgeons, confused by his double heartbeat, attempt to correct a non-existent [[fibrillation]]. These efforts instead \"kill\" the Doctor, and he is taken to a morgue where after several hours\u2014due to the effect of anaesthetic on his alien biology\u2014he finally regenerates into his eighth incarnation (McGann). The Master manages to cheat death, and while the Doctor is on Earth his spirit takes over the body of a paramedic named Bruce ([[Eric Roberts]]). The Master (Roberts) then attempts to steal the Doctor's remaining lives by opening the [[Eye of Harmony]] inside the Doctor's time machine, the [[TARDIS]], nearly destroying the Earth in the process. However, the Doctor and his companion [[Grace Holloway|Dr Grace Holloway]] ([[Daphne Ashbrook]]) are able to prevent the Earth's destruction, and the Master is sucked into the Eye.\n\nThe TV film did not lead to the commissioning of a revived television series, and while Eighth Doctor stories continued in other media, ''Doctor Who'' did not air again on television until 2005. After this, footage and stills from the TV film would be used in later episodes \"[[The Next Doctor]]\" (2008), \"[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]\", \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\" (both 2010) and \"[[Nightmare in Silver]]\" (2013). Edited archive footage in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" very briefly shows the Eighth Doctor sharing an adventure with the [[Second Doctor]] ([[Patrick Troughton]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/ |title=The Name of the Doctor Past References |publisher=The Doctor Who Site News |date= |accessdate=14 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Night of the Doctor\"/\"The Day of the Doctor\"===\nMcGann reprised the role for a [[webcast]] mini-episode, \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\", in 2013, which precedes the 50th anniversary special, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\". The episode begins during the raging [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]] between [[Dalek]]s and Time Lords when he is killed when attempting to save a young woman who rejects salvation at the hands of a Time Lord causing them both to die in a spaceship crash. He awakens in the company of the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q\u2013Z)#Sisterhood of Karn|Sisterhood of Karn]], who explain that he has died and been temporarily resurrected. They urge him to bring the war to an end, and give him a choice of elixirs to trigger his regeneration. Saluting his various companions from the Big Finish audio range, he drinks an elixir designed to produce a warrior, regenerating into the [[War Doctor]] ([[John Hurt]]) who declares himself to be the Doctor \"no more.\" In \"The Day of the Doctor,\" the Eighth Doctor joins all of the other incarnations of the Doctor in saving Gallifrey at the end of the Time War. He can be briefly seen on a screen in the War Room, though like the other past incarnations of the Doctor, this is achieved through archive footage.\n\n==Costume==\nThe Eighth Doctor initially wore a [[Wild Bill Hickok]] costume including a battleship grey [[cravat]] tie intended for a New Year's fancy dress party, which he liberated from the lockers at the San Francisco hospital he regenerated in. He completed it with a pair of black leather shoes taken from Grace Holloway's ex-boyfriend Brian to give him the appearance somewhere between a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] dandy and [[wild west]] gambler. By the time of \"The Night of the Doctor\" he sported a worn and bottle green [[moleskin]] [[overcoat]], a ruffled and midnight-blue [[ascot tie]], a bronze grey [[paisley (design)|paisley]] [[waistcoat]], [[leather]] [[gaiters]], and caramel brown [[US Cavalry|US Army Cavalry]] boots...corresponding with his overall weary appearance, presumably as a result of many experiences during the Time War.\n\n=== Big Finish costume ===\nIn 2010, Paul McGann revealed a new costume and [[sonic screwdriver]] for the Eighth Doctor which he indicated would be the new costume going forward. The cover and promotional photographs for the 2012 Big Finish story, ''Dark Eyes'' is, however, the first story to officially feature the new costume. The new outfit was originally premiered in 2010 at the [[Armageddon (convention)|Armageddon Pop Culture Expo]], along with a redesigned Sonic Screwdriver, courtesy of [[Weta Workshop]]. These changes were independently produced and were not affiliated with Big Finish Productions or the BBC, but were accepted as suitable for official use after the fact.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url= http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2010/10/new-eighth-doctor-costume-revealed.html\n | title= New Eighth Doctor costume revealed\n | first= Doctor Who\n | last= News\n | publisher=\n}}\n</ref>\nThe costume consists of a royal blue leather [[pea coat]], a white [[T-shirt]], navy blue [[jeans]] and brown shoes. In this outfit the Doctor also carries a brown [[messenger bag]].\n\n==Spin-off appearances==\n\n===Novels===\nAlmost as soon as he'd left San Francisco, the Doctor had another brief attack of amnesia, caused by a final trap of the Master's. To regain his memories, the Doctor was forced to visit all seven of his past selves and help them out with some crisis or another, at the same time acknowledging the responsibility his role gave him. Having regained his memories, the Doctor met a late twentieth-century [[Coal Hill School]] student named [[Sam Jones (Doctor Who)|Samantha Jones]]; shortly after their encounter, the Doctor left her alone at a [[Greenpeace]] rally.\n\nFor a time, the Doctor adventured with an [[Ice Warrior]] named [[Ssard]] and a human woman named [[Stacy Townsend]], who fell in love with each other; some while after they parted ways with the Doctor, the two invited him to serve as best man at their wedding (''[[Placebo Effect (novel)|Placebo Effect]]''). He also, at some point, teamed up with his old companion [[Bernice Summerfield]], [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]] and [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce|UNIT]] to combat [[The Dying Days|an Ice Warrior occupation of Great Britain]].\n\n====Faction Paradox====\nEventually, three years after his departure and one hour after he left, the Doctor returned to the Greenpeace rally. With Sam collected, the pair spent a great period wandering together, facing dozens of adventures. During their travels, Sam and the Doctor became aware of a great war, looming in the future of Gallifrey, [[Time War (Doctor Who)#Eighth Doctor Adventures|between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified Enemy]], with dramatic and disturbing consequences. While exploring the issue of the war, the Doctor discovered that his Sam was not the original Samantha Jones; rather, her biodata had been manipulated by an outside agency with the intent to mould her into a prosaic distraction for him (''[[Alien Bodies]]''). Ultimately this plan proved a failure, as Sam developed into a much more strongly-willed companion than intended; at one point she spent three years avoiding the Doctor, so as to cope with a crush she had developed on him, but managed to survive and make a good life for herself in the future until she rejoined the Doctor as she could make more of a difference with him.\n\nThe close dynamic between the pair was shifted with the introduction of [[Fitz Kreiner]], a sixties bar singer incorrectly suspected of matricide. Fitz took on the role of a sort of younger brother to the Doctor, placing the Time Lord on as high a pedestal as Fitz had ever known. Eventually Fitz found himself abducted by [[Faction Paradox]], a \"time-travelling voodoo cult\", and brainwashed into their legions. When the Doctor realised that a Faction member he had encountered was a biomass copy of Fitz- a 'clone' created and shaped based on others' memories and perceptions of Fitz-, he used the TARDIS's telepathic circuits to restore Fitz's memories and identity to the clone, believing that the original Fitz was dead and reasoning that the clone would essentially be the real Fitz in every way that mattered.\n\nWith both Sam and Fitz gone \u2013 Sam's origins established as a temporal paradox caused by exposure to a scar in reality created when the Doctor regenerated, which the 'original' Sam was only exposed to because the Doctor met blonde Sam \u2013 the Doctor continued his travels with the clone Fitz (although he was treated as the real one and generally thought of himself as such) and [[Compassion (Doctor Who)|Compassion]], an ex-Faction agent implanted with an interface that the Doctor found compatible with his TARDIS. Unbeknownst to the Doctor, the Faction \u2013 with the aid of the original Fitz \u2013 had changed his history, drawing the [[Third Doctor]] to a planet he should never have visited and causing a chain of events that culminated in the Third Doctor regenerating ahead of schedule, allowing them to infect him with the Faction Paradox biodata virus. While his immune system would allow him to resist the virus for a time, it would gain a greater hold on him with each subsequent regeneration, until it would finally transform him into a faction member in his eighth incarnation (''[[Interference: Book One]] and [[Interference: Book Two|Two]]'').\n\nEventually, Compassion's implant, linked to the Doctor's TARDIS to prevent her being influenced by random local signals, triggered her unexpected mutation into a sentient Type 102 TARDIS, specifically the \"mother\" of the TARDISes that would be used in the pending War. With this knowledge, the Time Lords \u2013 led by [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]], now in her third incarnation \u2013 attempted to capture Compassion, intending to use her as breeding stock in preparation for the war. In response, and in light of the apparent destruction of his old TARDIS in a dimensional rift, the Doctor and Fitz retreated into Compassion and fled, the Doctor refusing to let his people enslave his friend in such a manner and resolving to keep on the run until he could find another way to deal with the issue of the War (''[[The Shadows of Avalon]]'').\n\nThe Doctor and Fitz travelled in Compassion for some time, until the machinations of Faction Paradox came to a head back on Gallifrey. As it turned out, in the new timeline triggered by the Doctor's infection, the Doctor was destined to become \"[[Grandfather Paradox (Doctor Who)|Grandfather Paradox]]\", the mythical founder of Faction Paradox. The only factor keeping the original sequence of events in play was the Doctor's TARDIS, which had rebuilt itself after its apparent destruction on Avalon, and had now materialised in a twisted form above Gallifrey, holding within itself the Doctor's original reality where he had regenerated on Metebelis III and never been infected ever since it sensed that something was wrong when the Third Doctor regenerated ahead of schedule.\n\nIn a final confrontation with his future self, the Doctor resolved the timeline conflict by channelling the TARDIS's built-up energies through its weapon systems, thereby destroying both the Faction Paradox fleet and Gallifrey itself. In so doing, the TARDIS was able to rewrite the altered timeline with the original one that it \"remembered\"; no longer able to contain both timelines as a result of its energy drain, one reality had to become 'real'. As a side effect, however, the Doctor's entire memory was erased, apparently from the trauma of the event (''[[The Ancestor Cell]]'').\n\n====Amnesia on Earth====\nTo give the Doctor time to recover and the TARDIS time to regenerate from the extensive damage it had suffered, Compassion dropped the Doctor off on Earth in the year 1889; she then delivered Fitz to 2001, with the intent that he wait for the Doctor to catch up to him. With that, Compassion departed for parts unknown. Back in 1889, meanwhile, the Doctor awoke in a railway carriage to discover no memory as to his real identity, and no possessions save a small, shapeless box\u2013 what was left of the TARDIS after its power loss\u2014 and a note, simply stating \"Meet me in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]', 8 February 2001. Fitz\".\n\nDespite his amnesia, the Doctor retained a wide general knowledge. However, he also showed an uncharacteristic callous streak, easily allowing others to die if he felt that they 'deserved' to perish (''[[The Burning (Doctor Who)|The Burning]]''). To contrast, he was capable of feeling unusually poignant warmth, even dating a woman in the 1980s, and adopting a young girl named [[Miranda (Doctor Who)|Miranda]], a Time Lady from the future (''[[Father Time (Doctor Who)|Father Time]]''). During this time, he often became involved in strange problems outside the norm, such as confronting an entity that was essentially sentient fire (''[[The Burning (novel)|The Burning]]''). He experienced a particular funk in the 1950s, feeling that his efforts to learn about his past were pointless, but his interest in life was re-inspired when he was recruited to defeat his old enemies the Players as they sought to escalate the Cold War (''[[Endgame (Doctor Who)|Endgame]]'').\n\nUnsure what \"St Louis\" was intended by the note, the Doctor created his own in London: the St Louis Bar and Restaurant. As 2001 rolled around, Fitz indeed turned up there to meet him. With the aid of new companion [[Anji Kapoor]], the Doctor and Fitz completed the TARDIS's regeneration, dealt with a race of invading aliens, then set back again to exploring time and space (''[[Escape Velocity (Doctor Who)|Escape Velocity]]'').\n\nWith his freedom restored, the Doctor chose to counteract his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered all manner of unusual beings \u2013 from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (''[[The Year of Intelligent Tigers]]''), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold \u2013 as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (''[[Eater of Wasps]]'') \u2013 he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever had happened to him had happened for a reason, and he might as well make use of the advantages it offered.\n\n====Sabbath and parallel times====\nOnly a few months after resuming his old lifestyle, the Doctor faced another radical change: the loss of his second heart.  As it happened, the heart served as a bond with Gallifrey; with the planet gone, the heart had begun to fester within the Doctor's body, pumping it with poison.\n\nA man named [[Sabbath (Doctor Who)|Sabbath]], an eighteenth-century secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised the blackened organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor of some of his higher Time Lord abilities, including his respiratory bypass system and his ability to metabolise toxins. It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers, including allowing Sabbath to travel further from Earth in his own time machine than he had previously been capable of. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm, returning to life after up to a day in a death-like state even after sustaining normally regeneration-inducing injuries such as getting his chest crushed by sandbags (though any injury sustained by the Doctor would weaken Sabbath).\n\nEventually, after a woman Sabbath loved sacrificed herself to save the Doctor from a malfunctioning time machine, Sabbath tore out the Doctor's second heart, allowing the Doctor to begin growing a new one.\n\nShortly after the restoration of his heart, the Doctor found himself locked in a desperate struggle with Sabbath as, along with his mysterious business associates, Sabbath hatched a plan to destroy all alternate realities. Sabbath believed that time travellers like the Doctor, every time they landed somewhere, created an alternate reality where they didn't show up, and that the universe was unable to support so many alternates without suffering damage; therefore, he attempted to trigger an explosion at Event One \u2013 the [[Big Bang]] \u2013 that would erase all alternate universes and leaving only one possible timeline. However, Sabbath's allies had been lying to him; in reality, Time would only split if absolutely necessary, and even then, it was nearly impossible to travel between alternate realities. In reality, Sabbath had been manipulated into creating a plan that would effectively wipe out free will itself, with the Doctor proving that Sabbath's perception was wrong when they found themselves in a situation that could only have occurred due to time travel in a single timeline.\n\nThe explosion at Event One was averted when the Doctor diverted the black light that would have triggered the explosion to 1898, but instead of reality collapsing into a single controllable timeline, what occurred was reality starting to 'slide' between histories, multiple parallel realities fighting to become the dominant one. Along with new companion [[Trix MacMillan|Trix]], the Doctor, Fitz and Anji travelled through the realities, including a world where the computer was never invented, a world where Earth was devastated by a strange even as all life aged forty years in 1843, and a world where humanity had time-travelling tours, with the Doctor being forced to erase at least two of these realities as he sought to restore the original timeline. During this adventure, the Doctor appeared to become a bit more cold and calculating, sacrificing an innocent man to escape a pocket universe and even leaving alternate versions of Fitz and Anji to die to preserve continuity. However, in the end, their sacrifices paid off, the Doctor managing to stabilise reality by resolving a paradox that had been hanging over them since the beginning of the crisis, and then, with Sabbath's help, they confronted his masters; the Council of Eight, mysterious beings who gained power by foreseeing likely future events and then ensuring that they came to pass. The Doctor, as a rogue element existing outside of Time, was the only unpredictable factor in their universe, and was thus the only person who could stop them. Ironically, it was Sabbath himself who gave the Doctor the edge needed to stop the Council; realising that one of the Council members expected Sabbath to shoot the Council member with a weapon designed to send the subject into the Time Vortex, Sabbath instead shot himself, condemning himself to eternal agony in the Time Vortex, but completely undoing the Council's plan and destroying their space station, simultaneously restoring the possibility of parallel worlds to the universe.\n\n====''The Gallifrey Chronicles''====\nSome while after this, the Doctor was captured by Marnal, one of the few surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the [[Matrix (Doctor Who)|Matrix]] within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As ''[[The Gallifrey Chronicles (2005 novel)|The Gallifrey Chronicles]]'' ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.\n\n===Audio dramas===\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|date=June 2017|\n {{Cleanup-tense|section|present|date=April 2014}}\n}}\nPaul McGann first returned to his role as the Eighth Doctor in ''[[Storm Warning (audio drama)|Storm Warning]]'', the first in a series of audio plays, in which the Doctor lands on Earth in October 1930 aboard the doomed [[R101]] airship. Aboard the vessel, the Doctor meets a young adventuress called [[Charley Pollard]] (played by [[India Fisher]]). In the course of his adventure, the Doctor saves Charley's life and takes her aboard the TARDIS as his latest companion. This was done in good faith, but the Doctor soon learns that Charley's rescue greatly and negatively effected the timestream.\n\nDespite established in-universe history partly relying upon her death on the R101, the Doctor is unable to return her to preserve the timeline, with Charley's continued existence forming a rough plot arc over two \"seasons\" of audio adventures as the Doctor discovers a series of minor historical anomalies caused by the damage to the timeline, such as the CIA existing in 1933 or [[Benjamin Franklin]] being president. The Doctor eventually learns that, due to Charley's survival, the universe has become infected with \"anti-time,\" leading to a conflict with the wraith-like Never People- individuals who were erased from history for crimes against reality and now seek to unleash the destructive anti-time against the universe- with the resolution of this conflict depicting the Doctor choosing to sacrifice himself and his TARDIS by absorbing anti-time energy, which seals the rift and preserves Charley's life but transforms him into the bogeyman Zagreus. Later restored to sanity but still infected with anti-time through the actions of Charley, his old companions Leela and Romana, and recreations of his immediate three preceding incarnations, the Doctor chooses again to sacrifice himself for the sake of Charley and the universe by removing himself from space and time. He enters a divergent universe for which he has no prior knowledge or frame of reference and in which there is no concept of linear time (''[[Zagreus (Doctor Who audio)|Zagreus]]''). Meanwhile, Charley stows away on his TARDIS, in a sense nullifying the Doctor's sacrifice by again placing herself in danger; for a time, this fact causes great friction between the characters and personal angst for the Doctor.\n\nFor another two seasons, the Doctor, Charley, and a new companion by the name of [[C'rizz]], explore the divergent universe, gradually unravelling a deep plot designed around the Doctor by [[Rassilon]], founder of Time Lord society, who had previously been trapped in anti-time by the Doctor for his role in the creation of Zagreus. Eventually, with the aid of his companions, the Doctor escapes the trap built for him, overcomes his emotional burden, learns that he has been purged of Zagreus, and returns to his normal universe with Charley and C'rizz (''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]'').\n\nFollowing that point, which coincided with the end of the official Big Finish \"seasons\" in light of the return of ''Doctor Who'' to television in 2005, the trio wanders freely. The only continuing plot element involved C'rizz, whose character exhibits unusual and potentially destructive psychological development. This development culminates in C'rizz's death (''[[Absolution (Doctor Who)|Absolution]]''), which inspires in Charley a desire to leave the Doctor's company. Due to amnesia brought on by a healing coma induced by a cyber-planner, the Eighth Doctor believes Charley has left him in 2008 [[Singapore]] (''[[The Girl Who Never Was]]''), when she is in fact displaced into the year 500,002, whence she is rescued by the [[Sixth Doctor]] (''[[The Condemned (Doctor Who audio)|The Condemned]]''). Believing that the Eighth Doctor died before their parting, Charley thus spends some time travelling with the Sixth Doctor, but their time together ends when an alien race called the Viyrans replace his memories of Charley with another woman, Mila, to preserve the timeline.\n\nStarting New Year's Eve 2006, a new audio series titled ''[[The Eighth Doctor Adventures (audio drama series)|The Eighth Doctor Adventures]]'' featuring the Doctor and new companion [[Lucie Miller]] (played by [[Sheridan Smith]]) was broadcast on BBC7. A second series followed in 2007. A third season was streamed from the Big Finish website, and was available on CD. A fourth and final season started in 2009 with the Christmas episode ''[[Death in Blackpool]]'' which dealt with Lucie's departure. Also in December 2009, the standalone episode ''[[An Earthly Child]]'' was released, in which the Doctor visits his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] on Earth (following up on the events of the [[First Doctor]] adventure ''[[The Dalek Invasion of Earth]]'') and meets his great-grandson Alex Campbell. In ''[[Situation Vacant]]'' the Doctor gains a new companion, [[Tamsin Drew]] \u2013 drawn from four prospective companions. This season puts the Eighth Doctor up against a new incarnation of [[The Monk (Doctor Who)|the Meddling Monk]], now travelling with Lucie Miller, but in the course of the season Tamsin is seduced to the Meddling Monk's way of thinking while Lucie finds the Monk's violence distasteful and re-joins the Doctor. When the Monk helps the Daleks launch an invasion of Earth, Tamsin, Lucie, and Alex are killed driving them off, although at the last minute the Monk betrays the Daleks to help save the Doctor and Susan.\n\nIn November 2012 Big Finish released a boxed set of four audio dramas called ''[[Dark Eyes (audio drama)|Dark Eyes]]'', whose stories take place after ''[[To the Death (audio drama)|To the Death]]''. The set also introduced a new companion, [[Molly O'Sullivan]] (played by [[Ruth Bradley]]), an Irish [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] nursing assistant in [[World War I]]. Here the Eighth Doctor changes his appearance, cutting his hair and changing into a WWI navy trench coat after his Victorian clothing is ruined.\n\nAn [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate]] version of the Eighth Doctor, from a timeline where the Seventh Doctor regenerates after being shot by the Nazis in the 1950s, was first mentioned in the audio drama ''[[Colditz (audio drama)|Colditz]]'', and appears (played by McGann) in ''[[Survival of the Fittest & Klein\u2019s Story#Klein\u2019s Story|Klein's Story]]''. Under the alias \"Schmidt,\" the Doctor teaches [[List of companions in Doctor Who spin-offs#Klein|Klein]] how to pilot the TARDIS, thereby putting her in a position to inadvertently assist the Seventh Doctor in preventing this timeline from occurring (unable to go back himself as the TARDIS security protocols would prevent him from going somewhere where he was already).\n\nIn a trilogy of adventures, released in October through December 2011 as part of Big Finish's continuing monthly range, The Doctor travels with [[Mary Shelley (Doctor Who)|Mary Shelley]] (as played by [[Julie Cox]]), first acknowledged as a friend of the Eighth Doctor's in ''[[The Company of Friends]]''. The first story, ''[[The Silver Turk]]'', features the early breed of the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]] as seen in ''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[The Witch from the Well]]'' tests the pair's relationship, and the trilogy concludes with ''[[Army of Death]]''.\n\nIn 2013, Big Finish released a special 50th Anniversary story, ''The Light at the End'', in which the Master ([[Geoffrey Beevers]]) implements a plot to trap and destroy all eight incarnations of the Doctor by keeping him on Gallifrey. The Eighth Doctor and Charley meet up with the Fourth Doctor ([[Tom Baker]]) and Leela ([[Louise Jameson]]), the Fifth Doctor ([[Peter Davison]]) and Nyssa ([[Sarah Sutton]]), the Sixth Doctor ([[Colin Baker]]) and Peri, and the Seventh Doctor ([[Sylvester McCoy]]) and Ace ([[Sophie Aldred]]). Working together with the First Doctor ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), Second Doctor ([[Frazer Hines]]), and Third Doctor (Tim Treloar)), they manage to break free of the Master's trap and prevent time from being rewritten so that the Doctor would never have left Gallifrey. Companions [[Susan Foreman|Susan]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]), [[Vicki (Doctor Who)|Vicki]] ([[Maureen O'Brien]]), [[Steven Taylor (Doctor Who)|Steven Taylor]] ([[Peter Purves]]), [[Sara Kingdom]] ([[Jean Marsh]]), [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] ([[Anneke Wills]]), [[Jamie McCrimmon]] ([[Frazer Hines]]), [[Zoe Heriot]] ([[Wendy Padbury]]), [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]), [[Tegan Jovanka]] ([[Janet Fielding]]), and [[Vislor Turlough|Turlough]] ([[Mark Strickson]]) also made appearances in the audio drama.\n\nIn the 2013 live action mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\", the Eighth Doctor saluted Charley, C'rizz, Lucie, Tamsin and Molly from the Big Finish range prior to his regeneration into the [[War Doctor]].\n\nFollowing the success of the first ''Dark Eyes'' boxed set, Big Finish released three more sets, continuing Molly's story and introducing [[Liv Chenka]] as a new companion (Chenka having previously met the Seventh Doctor in the audio ''Robophobia''). The Eighth Doctor goes on to appear in a four-CD, four-part miniseries, ''Doom Coalition'', which sees him, Liv, and new companion Helen Sinclair on the hunt for the insane Time Lord known as the Eleven, who suffers from a unique mental defect where all of his past personalities are active in his mind at once. In the course of the series, the Doctor peripherally interacts with the [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s future wife [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] (although she takes care to avoid directly interacting with the Eighth Doctor unless disguised) and at one point confronts an alliance between the Monk and the [[Weeping Angels]]. ''Doom Coalition'' concludes with the Doctor thwarting the plans of the titular Coalition, who are revealed to be a group of Time Lords led by the Doctor's old schoolfriend Padrac, with Padrac's latest consultations with the Matrix having driven him to the conclusion that the only way to save Gallifrey from 'prophecies' of its own destruction is to destroy the rest of the universe.\n\nBeginning in 2017, Big Finish began releasing two separate Eighth Doctor series of box sets in the form of ''Ravenous'' and ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War''. ''Ravenous'' is a series of four four-part box sets that serve as a direct sequel to ''Doom Coalition'', initially depicting the Doctor and Liv's efforts to find Helen after she is trapped with the Eleven, but subsequently progresses to depict their efforts to oppose the Ravenous, an ancient race who are essentially the natural predator of the Time Lords as they evolved to feed on the energy released when Time Lords regenerate (the Ravenous are described as being the reason humans fear clowns, as they essentially resemble clowns in their natural state). The series concludes with the Doctor indirectly working with three different incarnations of the Master- including the Master of the TV movie, the War Master and Missy, the latter two of whom do not meet the Doctor face-to-face- to essentially restore the Ravenous to their original state, having determined that they drain energy from Time Lords after an ancient Gallifreyan scientist accidentally stole much of their natural energy millennia ago. ''The Eighth Doctor: The Time War'' is another series of four four-part box sets, set later in the Eighth Doctor's life during the early days of the Time War, depicting his efforts to protect those caught in the crossfire with the aid of his new companion Bliss, whose planet's history was undone when a Time Lord agent turned her planet into a weapons depot while her own history is in chaos due to the side-effects of the Time War. The third volume of ''Time War'' also sees the Doctor forced to face the [[Valeyard]] once again when his other self is recreated due to the Doctor being exposed to biology-manipulating technology while using a transmat, the two technologies somehow manifesting a new version of the Valeyard from the transmat after the Doctor departs.\n\n===Comic strips===\n\n====Unfinished business====\n\nIn the ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' comic strips, at an unstated time after his regeneration (and after an adventure in the 1930s involving [[Fey Truscott-Sade]] and psychic weasels), the Doctor revisited the town of Stockbridge. After being caught up in the games of the [[Celestial Toymaker]], he picked up a new companion in lively sci-fi fan [[Izzy Sinclair]]. The two of them were soon caught up in the machinations of the Doctor's old enemies the Threshold, a mercenary organisation. The Threshold attempted to manipulate the Doctor into stopping the Daleks gaining access to the multiverse (which would kill an artificial solar system as a side effect) and dying in the attempt, but were outmaneuvered. Unknown to him, they implanted a device in Fey Truscott-Sade so that they could use her as an unwilling spy when she next encountered the Doctor. She did so in 1939, assisting him and Izzy against the vampiric Varney; the Doctor was left infected with a deadly bacillus, and he had to be taken to Gallifrey to be cured, luring him into a battle against a Time Lord cult called the Final Chapter.\n\nWorking out that the Threshold were using Fey as a spy, the Doctor and his old comrade [[Shayde]] faked a regeneration. The Threshold was conned into believing they were facing a vulnerable new Doctor (Shayde in disguise), allowing the real Doctor to infiltrate their base. While he and his friends were too late to stop the Threshold from destroying every single spacecraft in the universe, they were able to bring about the organisation's destruction before it could profit. Fey returned to her time, having also bonded with Shayde to save his life.\n\nUnknowingly, the TARDIS had been taken over by the Master, who was manipulating events to gain the power of the omniversal Glory. The Doctor was specifically sent to times and places that would undermine him \u2013 discovering he had upset the course of Grace Holloway's life in 2001, encountering an alien race with motivations uncomfortably similar to his which caused death and horror in 17th Century Japan, and almost killing the benevolent [[Kroton (Cyberman)|Kroton]] by mistake. (A slight diversion between events saw the Doctor and Izzy team up with the actor [[Tom Baker]] and other 1970s television actors against [[Beep the Meep]] in 1979.)\n\nIn 17th Century Japan, the Doctor's attempt to save the life of samurai Katsura Sato, a friend of Izzy, left the man inadvertently immortal and thus robbed of both an honourable death and any sense of empathy. The Master later came for Sato, when he was mentally vulnerable, and gave him a fake religion to focus his mind on; Earth's history was altered as Sato, renamed Lord Morningstar, and his Church of the Glorious Dead conquered the planet, creating a technological advanced, highly brutal planet of jihadists. The Doctor, Izzy and Kroton wandered into their invasion of the museum planet Paradost; while the Doctor faced the Master over the Glory, Izzy and Kroton spent weeks on the occupied world. The Doctor was defeated, only for the Master discover he was not able to access the Glory, as instead Kroton and Sato had been the ones prophesied to battle for it. Kroton won the Glory, the Master was purged from the TARDIS and history was reverted, and the Doctor and Izzy took a well-earned break.\n\n====Destrii====\n\nDuring a battle against the body-stealing Ophidians and their gigantic snake-shaped techno-organic warship, the Doctor and Izzy encountered a brash and adventurous fish-woman called [[Destrii]]. While seemingly friendly and bonding with Izzy, Destrii was secretly on the run and she swapped bodies with Izzy to cover her escape; when Destrii was seemingly killed, Izzy seemed trapped within an alien body. The Doctor's next few journeys were spent trying to help her in this situation, both in coming to terms with the change and finding out what her new body's abilities were. [[Frida Kahlo]] helped Izzy mentally deal with the change, but the attempt at testing Izzy's abilities led her and the Doctor into a turbulent encounter with the humanised Daleks he had created in his [[Evil of the Daleks|second incarnation]]. Unable to prevent their tragic end \u2013 self-destructing to escape the machinations of the malevolent psychic Kata-Phobus -, the two of them were distracted and caught off-guard when Helioth and Hassana, two of the energy-beings called the Horde, abducted Izzy thinking she was Destrii.\n\nThe Doctor went on a relentless search to rescue his friend, with the help of Fey/Shayde and by forcing co-operation from Destrii, still alive in her stolen body. His quest led him to the planet Oblivion, a surreal and brutal world ruled by Destrii's mother, the Matriax. Izzy was rescued and returned to her original form, while Oblivion's court system and the menace of the Horde were both destroyed, leaving Destrii free to leave her world and explore the universe with her roguish uncle Jodafra. However, Izzy had decided she wanted to return home to her family, and the Doctor was left alone.\n\nFeeling slightly morose, the Doctor was cheered up by an unknowing encounter with his old companion [[Frobisher (Doctor Who)|Frobisher]] and went on several 'holiday' adventures on his own. He eventually re-encountered Destrii and Jodafra in America during the 19th Century, where the upcoming clash between [[General Custer]] and [[Chief Sitting Bull]] was interrupted by Jodafra's machinations involving the monstrous [[wendigo]]. Jodafra had made a deal with the creature: power in exchange for being fed children. Unable to stomach this and with the Doctor urging her to listen to the spark of decency in her, Destrii helped the Doctor stop her uncle. In revenge, she was left beaten and abandoned, and the Doctor took her in as a probationary companion. Together, the two of them teamed up with [[MI6]] and faced an invasion of early 21st Century Earth by time-travelling [[Cybermen]]; they were preparing to chemically overload the emotions of humans and thus make them willingly surrender to have their emotions removed by conversion. The Doctor destroyed them through use of the Time Vortex (similar to the later \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\"), almost surrendering to it but giving up its power to save Destrii.\n\nIn 2007, [[Panini Books]] published ''Doctor Who: The Flood'', the final collection of comic strips featuring the Eighth Doctor in ''Doctor Who Magazine''. The book includes the essay \"Flood Barriers\" by strip editor Clayton Hickman in which he reveals that [[Russell T Davies]] had authorised the comic strip to depict the regeneration of the Eighth Doctor into the [[Ninth Doctor]] at the end of the 2004\u20132005 arc, ''The Flood''. The cause of the regeneration would have been the Doctor's exposure to the Time Vortex in his efforts to destroy the Cybermen (the same cause that triggered the later Ninth to [[Tenth Doctor]] regeneration in ''Parting of the Ways''). Destrii would have witnessed the regeneration and would have continued to travel with the Ninth Doctor in a proposed ''Year One'' arc. However [[BBC Wales]] vetoed the ''Year One'' arc and indicated the Ninth Doctor could only be shown travelling with [[Rose Tyler]], Hickman and writer Scott Gray eventually decided not to depict the regeneration as they would have been unable to give Destrii a proper departure. The Panini collection includes the original script for the regeneration sequence, as well as never before published art showing the regeneration itself.<ref>{{Cite book\n\n|last=\n|first=\n|author2=\n|year=2007\n|title=Doctor Who: The Flood \u2013 The Complete Eighth Doctor Comic Strips Volume 4\n|location=London\n|publisher=[[Panini Books]]\n|isbn=978-1-905239-65-8\n|pages=216\u2013223\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor''===\nIn the ''Doctor Who: The Eighth Doctor'' comic series, the Eighth Doctor \u2013 from a point shortly before the Time War, as he is shown in the clothing and hairstyle he wore in \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" \u2013 is visiting an old holiday house of his where he encounters a young painter named Josie Day.

He was [[Zimbabwe]]'s first head of state after the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] that led to the country\u2019s  independence. In 1987, he stepped down as President and was succeeded by Prime Minister [[Robert Mugabe]], who became the country's [[executive president]]. In 1997, Banana was [[Outing|outed]] as a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]], and after a highly publicised trial, was convicted of 11 counts of [[sodomy]] and \"unnatural acts\", serving six months in prison.\n\nBanana was born in [[Esigodini|Essexvale]] (today Esigodini), a village in [[Matabeleland]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], to an [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] mother and a [[Lesotho|Mosotho]] father. He was educated at a mission school before studying at [[Epworth Theological College]] in [[Harare|Salisbury]] (today Harare). [[Ordination|Ordained]] in 1962, he worked as a Methodist minister and a school administrator between 1963 and 1966. He was elected Chairman of the [[Bulawayo]] Council of Churches in 1969, holding that position until 1971. From 1971 to 1973, he worked for the [[All Africa Conference of Churches]] and was also a member of the Advisory Committee of the [[World Council of Churches]]. He became involved in anti-colonial politics, embracing [[Black theology|black]] [[liberation theology]] and criticising the [[Rhodesia]]n government under [[Ian Smith]], which had [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|declared the country independent]] under white-minority rule in 1965. He became Vice-President of the [[Southern Rhodesia African National Congress|African National Congress]], but soon was forced to flee Rhodesia.

In response, Banana joined with fellow Methodist cleric Bishop [[Abel Muzorewa]] to form the [[United African National Council]] (UANC), which opposed the settlement. The proposed referendum was withdrawn and the UANC grew in prominence as a national political party. Initially, both [[Ndabaningi Sithole]]'s [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] and [[Joshua Nkomo]]'s [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] loosely aligned themselves with the UANC. Because both ZANU and ZAPU participated with guerrilla forces in the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], the UANC was the only legal black political party in Rhodesia, since it rejected violence. Banana served as the Vice-President of the UANC from 1971 to 1973.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"Bio\" /> \n\nAlthough Banana and the UANC were more moderate than ZANU or ZAPU, they still faced persecution from the government.

Banana was arrested on his return but was released a year later, kept under house arrest, and then allowed to participate in [[Abel Muzorewa]]'s plans for the country. However, he abandoned that effort and joined ZANU (led by [[Robert Mugabe]]), which was dedicated to overthrowing the Smith administration. Returning to Rhodesia in December 1976, Banana was arrested once more for his support of ZANU; upon the appointment of [[Christopher Soames, Baron Soames|Christopher Soames]] as British governor, he was released from prison.<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Canaan Banana |work=Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1446451/Canaan-Banana.html |date=11 November 2003 |accessdate=26 June 2008 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nUnder the country's new constitution, Banana became the first president in 1980.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> In 1982, a law was passed forbidding citizens from making jokes about his name.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/><ref name=\"economist\">{{cite news |title=Canaan Banana, clergyman, politician and rapist, died on November 10th, aged 67 | work=[[The Economist]]| url=http://www.economist.com/node/2246091 | date=27 November 2003 | accessdate=27 June 2016 | first= | last=}}</ref> In 1987, his largely ceremonial<ref name=\"timessodomy\">{{cite news |title=Zimbabwe's Ex-President Convicted of Sodomy | work=[[The New York Times]] (Archives) | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/27/world/zimbabwe-s-ex-president-convicted-of-sodomy.html | date=27 November 1998 | accessdate=8 July 2007 | first=Donald G. | last=McNeil Jr}}</ref> post was taken over by Mugabe, who made himself executive president.<ref name=\"LATimes1987\">[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-24/news/mn-6348_1_white-seats Zimbabwe Moves to Limit Whites' Role : Legislation Prepared to End a Guarantee of Parliament Seats], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 24 June 1987</ref> Banana then became a diplomat for the [[Organisation of African Unity]] and head of the religious department at the [[University of Zimbabwe]].
