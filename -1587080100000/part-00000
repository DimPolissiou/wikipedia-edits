During the 1960s, China Airlines was able to establish its first scheduled routes. In October 1962, a flight from Taipei to [[Hualien City|Hualien]] became the airline's first domestic service.<ref name=history>{{cite web | title= Company History | publisher = China Airlines | url = https://www.china-airlines.com/tw/en/about-us/history | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref> Later, with the introduction of [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] and [[Boeing 727-100]]s, the airlines introduced international flights to [[South Vietnam]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} With the airlines' first two Boeing 707 aircraft, trans-Pacific flights to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] via Tokyo were initiated on 2 February 1970. The expansion of the company's 707 fleet also permitted more services in Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and North America (via Japan and Hawaii). {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== International Expansion (1970\u20131995) ===\nFollowing the standard utilization of the wide-body 747 on the highly profitable Trans-Pacific \u2013 USA routes, China Airlines introduced its first two 747-100s (ex-[[Delta Air Lines]] aircraft) in 1976 and immediately placed them on its Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo-Honolulu-Los Angeles route. Shortly thereafter, four brand new Boeing 747SPs (Special Performance) were introduced in 1977. Due to political pressure, Japan ended its diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972, and all flights between Taiwan and Japan were stopped. The 747SP aircraft made it possible for China Airlines to fly daily nonstop services from Taipei to its North American destinations without stopping over in Japan. It also allowed the airlines to introduce flights to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[South Africa]]. In 1979, the airlines switched all operations from the smaller [[Taipei Songshan Airport]] to the newly built Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport (now [[Taoyuan International Airport]]). Following the introduction of 747-200s, the airlines introduced its first European destination, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1978, Japan allowed China Airlines to return to Tokyo International Airport at Haneda after relocating all other airlines at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, leaving China Airlines as the sole international operator at [[Haneda International Airport|Haneda]], which at the time was an exclusive domestic facility, the premise being that air carriers from the [[PRC|PR China]] and Taiwan were prevented from crossing paths at any Japanese airports. Eva Air joined China Airlines later on although both moved to New Tokyo (Now Narita International) with CAL moving on April 18, 2002.\n\nThe next 20 years saw sporadic but far-reaching growth for the company. Later, the airline inaugurated its own round-the-world flight: ([[Taipei]]-[[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]-[[New York City|New York]]-[[Amsterdam]]-[[Dubai]]-Taipei).{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} 1993 saw China Airlines listed on the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]]. Later CAL would place one of the largest orders for the new Boeing 747-400s. The new 747-400s and an earlier order with [[Airbus]] for over a dozen [[A300B4]] and A300-600Rs wide body regional jets allowed for addition destination growth. During the 1990s, China Airlines also bought the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and had to compete with a new competitor, EVA Air. They also found [[Mandarin Airlines|another airline]] to deal with the PRC-ROC dispute which borrowed aircraft from China Airlines itself.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Boeing 747-409, China Airlines AN0198833.jpg|alt=China Airlines Boeing 747-400 at Los Angeles International Airport (B-162).

As a result, in the mid-1990s, China Airlines subsidiary [[Mandarin Airlines]] took over some of its Sydney and Vancouver international routes. Starting from October 7, 1995, partly as a way to avoid the international controversy, China Airlines unveiled its \"plum blossom\" logo,<ref name=history /> replacing the [[flag of the Republic of China|national flag]], which had previously appeared on the tail fins ([[empennage]]), and the [[aircraft livery]] from the red-white-blue national colors on the fuselage of its aircraft.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/14/news/14iht-tainote_0.html|title=Taipei Notebook : A Flag-Carrier That Won't|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|date=1995-08-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The plum blossom (''[[Prunus mume]]'') is Taiwan's [[National Flower of the Republic of China|National Flower]].\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots. Due to the company's poor safety record in the 1990s, China Airlines began to change its pilot recruitment practices and the company began to actively recruit civilian-trained pilots with proven track records.  In addition, the company began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program. The company also modified its maintenance and operational procedures. These decisions were instrumental in the company's improved safety record, culminating in the company's recognition by the [[IATA Operational Safety Audit]] (IOSA).<ref>{{Cite press release  | title = China Airlines Once Again Passes Rigorous Safety Audit  | publisher = China Airlines  | date = 2009-03-18  | url = http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120228/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:B-18201 B747-400 China Airlines (6340376056).jpg|thumb|left|China Airlines [[Boeing 747-400]] at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in 2011.]]\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, China Airlines placed orders for various airliners including the [[Airbus A330]], [[Airbus A340]], [[Boeing 737-800]], and the [[Boeing 747-400]] (both the passenger and freighter version).\n\nDue to improving [[cross-strait relations]], the first [[cross-strait charter]] flights between Taiwan and China were introduced in 2003, with China Airlines' flight 585, operated by a Boeing 747-400, being the first Taiwanese flight to legally land in China. (The aircraft took off from [[Taoyuan Airport]], stopped over at [[Hong Kong Airport]], and landed at [[Shanghai Pudong Airport]].) In 2005, the first nonstop cross-strait charter flights were initiated, with China Airlines' flight 581 ([[Taoyuan Airport]] to [[Beijing Capital Airport]]) being the first flight of the program to depart from Taiwan. In 2008, the first regular weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China started operating, with daily charter flights introduced later in the year.

During the 1960s, China Airlines was able to establish its first scheduled routes. In October 1962, a flight from Taipei to [[Hualien City|Hualien]] became the airline's first domestic service.<ref name=history>{{cite web | title= Company History | publisher = China Airlines | url = https://www.china-airlines.com/tw/en/about-us/history | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref> Later, with the introduction of [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] and [[Boeing 727-100]]s, the airlines introduced international flights to [[South Vietnam]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} With the airlines' first two Boeing 707 aircraft, trans-Pacific flights to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] via Tokyo were initiated on 2 February 1970. The expansion of the company's 707 fleet also permitted more services in Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and North America (via Japan and Hawaii). {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== International Expansion (1970\u20131995) ===\nFollowing the standard utilization of the wide-body 747 on the highly profitable Trans-Pacific \u2013 USA routes, China Airlines introduced its first two 747-100s (ex-[[Delta Air Lines]] aircraft) in 1976 and immediately placed them on its Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo-Honolulu-Los Angeles route. Shortly thereafter, four brand new Boeing 747SPs (Special Performance) were introduced in 1977. Due to political pressure, Japan ended its diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1972, and all flights between Taiwan and Japan were stopped. The 747SP aircraft made it possible for China Airlines to fly daily nonstop services from Taipei to its North American destinations without stopping over in Japan. It also allowed the airlines to introduce flights to [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[South Africa]]. In 1979, the airlines switched all operations from the smaller [[Taipei Songshan Airport]] to the newly built Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport (now [[Taoyuan International Airport]]). Following the introduction of 747-200s, the airlines introduced its first European destination, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1978, Japan allowed China Airlines to return to Tokyo International Airport at Haneda after relocating all other airlines at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, leaving China Airlines as the sole international operator at [[Haneda International Airport|Haneda]], which at the time was an exclusive domestic facility, the premise being that air carriers from the [[PRC|PR China]] and Taiwan were prevented from crossing paths at any Japanese airports. Eva Air joined China Airlines later on although both moved to New Tokyo (Now Narita International) with CAL moving on April 18, 2002.\n\nThe next 20 years saw sporadic but far-reaching growth for the company. Later, the airline inaugurated its own round-the-world flight: ([[Taipei]]-[[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]]-[[New York City|New York]]-[[Amsterdam]]-[[Dubai]]-Taipei).{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} 1993 saw China Airlines listed on the [[Taiwan Stock Exchange]]. Later CAL would place one of the largest orders for the new Boeing 747-400s. The new 747-400s and an earlier order with [[Airbus]] for over a dozen [[A300B4]] and A300-600Rs wide body regional jets allowed for addition destination growth. During the 1990s, China Airlines also bought the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and had to compete with a new competitor, EVA Air. They also found [[Mandarin Airlines|another airline]] to deal with the PRC-ROC dispute which borrowed aircraft from China Airlines itself.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Boeing 747-409, China Airlines AN0198833.jpg|alt=China Airlines Boeing 747-400 at Los Angeles International Airport (B-162).

As a result, in the mid-1990s, China Airlines subsidiary [[Mandarin Airlines]] took over some of its Sydney and Vancouver international routes. Starting from October 7, 1995, partly as a way to avoid the international controversy, China Airlines unveiled its \"plum blossom\" logo,<ref name=history /> replacing the [[flag of the Republic of China|national flag]], which had previously appeared on the tail fins ([[empennage]]), and the [[aircraft livery]] from the red-white-blue national colors on the fuselage of its aircraft.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/14/news/14iht-tainote_0.html|title=Taipei Notebook : A Flag-Carrier That Won't|last=Murphy|first=Kevin|date=1995-08-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The plum blossom (''[[Prunus mume]]'') is Taiwan's [[National Flower of the Republic of China|National Flower]].\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots. Due to the company's poor safety record in the 1990s, China Airlines began to change its pilot recruitment practices and the company began to actively recruit civilian-trained pilots with proven track records.  In addition, the company began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program. The company also modified its maintenance and operational procedures. These decisions were instrumental in the company's improved safety record, culminating in the company's recognition by the [[IATA Operational Safety Audit]] (IOSA).<ref>{{Cite press release  | title = China Airlines Once Again Passes Rigorous Safety Audit  | publisher = China Airlines  | date = 2009-03-18  | url = http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120228/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/newsen/newsen000542.htm | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | accessdate = 22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:B-18201 B747-400 China Airlines (6340376056).jpg|thumb|left|China Airlines [[Boeing 747-400]] at [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in 2011.]]\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, China Airlines placed orders for various airliners including the [[Airbus A330]], [[Airbus A340]], [[Boeing 737-800]], and the [[Boeing 747-400]] (both the passenger and freighter version).\n\nDue to improving [[cross-strait relations]], the first [[cross-strait charter]] flights between Taiwan and China were introduced in 2003, with China Airlines' flight 585, operated by a Boeing 747-400, being the first Taiwanese flight to legally land in China. (The aircraft took off from [[Taoyuan Airport]], stopped over at [[Hong Kong Airport]], and landed at [[Shanghai Pudong Airport]].) In 2005, the first nonstop cross-strait charter flights were initiated, with China Airlines' flight 581 ([[Taoyuan Airport]] to [[Beijing Capital Airport]]) being the first flight of the program to depart from Taiwan. In 2008, the first regular weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China started operating, with daily charter flights introduced later in the year.
