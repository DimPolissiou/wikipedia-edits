He played for [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]], [[Stratford Town F.C.|Stratford Town]], [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]], [[Corinthian-Casuals F.C.|Corinthian-Casuals]], [[Cheshunt F.C.|Cheshunt]], [[Enfield Town F.C.|Enfield Town]], [[Gimon\u00e4s CK]] (Sweden) and [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]].\n\nHe joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in January 1990 and at the [[Victoria Ground]] Kelly was never a regular but did play in the [[1992 Football League Trophy Final]] victory over [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. After loan spells at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] he signed permanently with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and later played with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and made a return to [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]] before ending his career at [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]]. Throughout his career Kelly struggled with a [[Problem gambling|gambling addiction]] and ran up debts of over \u00a3300,000.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nKelly was born in [[Coventry]] and was one of seven children including his twin brother Mel.<ref name=\"RC\">{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Tony|title=Red Card|year=2013|publisher=Mereo Books|isbn=9781909544703}}</ref> They both went to the same school in the [[Tile Hill]] area of the city before they moved to [[Coundon, Coventry|Coundon]] on the other side of the city. After playing football with the school team Kelly and his brother joined a [[Sunday league football|Sunday League]] side, Coundon Cockerels managed by a Scotsman, Dave McLeod.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Two of his other brothers were also involved with football, Abby who played in non-league and [[Errington Kelly|Errington]] who made it as a professional.<ref name=\"RC\"/> He moved to Woodlands Secondary School and his PE teacher recommended him to play for the Coventry schoolboys.<ref name=\"RC\"/> At high school Kelly had to deal with racist abuse and often got into fights. Kelly became friends with boxer [[Errol Christie]] which made going to nightclubs easier.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nOne day his brother Errington, who was playing for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] set him and Mel up with a trial.<ref name=\"RC\"/> The pair travelled with Errington to [[Bristol]] where they met the Rovers manager [[Bobby Gould]] and after a couple of training sessions they played in a [[South East Counties League]] match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> However it was not enough for them to be offered a contract by Bristol Rovers.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Errington then asked his former manager [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]] who was now at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] if they could have a trial and he accepted. They both played and scored in a trial match against [[Mangotsfield United F.C.|Mangotsfield United]] which saw them both successfully offered a [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] at the club.<ref name=\"RC\"/> After meeting with the rest of the squad they moved into a lodgings paid by the club to accommodate youth team players and he was informed that his behavior would be closely monitored.\n\nKelly began to impress the coaches at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] and he began to train with the first team and on 16 October 1982 he was named in the squad for a league match away at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> He came on as a second-half substitute in a 1\u20131 draw and at the age of 16 years and 244 days he became Bristol City's youngest player. His record remained until it was broken by [[Marvin Brown]] in 1999. Kelly then played against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in a narrow 2\u20131 defeat. His brother Mel was struggling to make an impact and was released by the club in November 1982. It was at this time Kelly began to 'get too big for his boots' and began to show a poor attitude which did not go unnoticed by the management who sent him back to the youth team.<ref name=\"RC\"/> He earned a recall to the first team against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] on 28 December 1982 where he scored his first league goal in a 3\u20131 victory.<ref name=\"RC\"/> However, by 1983 he was not being asked to play and in May 1983 he was informed by Terry Cooper he was being released because of his \"rubbish attitude\" and so Kelly returned to his family in Coventry.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\n===Non-league football===\nAfter returning to Coventry, Kelly contacted local non-league sides [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]] and [[Bedworth United F.C.|Bedworth United]] in the hope of getting the chance to play football again and after a short trial he joined Nuneaton Borough.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Under the management of [[Graham Carr]] Nuneaton played in the [[Conference Premier|Alliance Premier League]] and it was hard for Kelly to establish himself in the first team and when Carr could not offer Kelly a long-term contract he wanted he parted amicably for [[Stratford Town F.C.|Stratford Town]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> At Stratford was his brother Abby and together they played in the [[Midland Football Combination|Midland Combination League]] whilst he also worked as a banqueting porter at the Hotel Leofric. In the summer of 1983 Kelly began to visit his brother, Mel who had moved to [[London]] and was now playing for [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]]. After starting the 1984\u201385 season with Stratford Kelly moved to London in March 1985 and got a job as a security guard in [[Dulwich]].<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nHe also began playing for Dulwich Hamlet whose first-team included [[Alan Pardew]], [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1964)|Andy Gray]] and [[Paul Harding (association footballer)|Paul Harding]] but Mel soon left for [[Corinthian-Casuals F.C.|Corinthian-Casuals]]. It was at this time Kelly began to get involved with gambling and would soon become an addiction.<ref name=\"RC\"/> In January 1987 he moved in with his sister, Pat in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] and signed for Corinthian-Casuals. On his 21st birthday Kelly was playing in an away match where he was sent-off for two bookable offences and in rage Kelly pushed the referee to the ground. Kelly was given a nine-month ban by the FA and he left Corinthian-Casuals and also decided to change his name from Nyrere to Tony.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nHe began playing with [[Cheshunt F.C.|Cheshunt]] where he finished the 1987\u201388 season as top-scorer and also changed his name again this time to Nyrere Anthony Okpara Kelly.<ref name=\"RC\"/> He then had a brief spell with [[Enfield Town F.C.|Enfield Town]] before joining [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]]. By now his brother [[Errington Kelly|Errington]] had moved to Sweden to play for [[Grebbestads IF]] and after Kelly went over to visit him he began writing to Swedish clubs's offering them his services. To his surprise St Albans received a loan offer from [[Swedish Football Division 2|Swedish Second Division]] side [[Gimon\u00e4s CK]] which Kelly quickly accepted.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nGimon\u00e4s is based in the city of [[Ume\u00e5]] and Kelly travelled there with the intentions of attracting the attentions of top-flight Swedish teams and teams back in England. Errington also managed to make the move to Gimon\u00e4s and the club under the management of [[Anders Johansson (footballer)|Anders Johansson]] had ambitions to aim for promotion to the [[Allsvenskan]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> However results were inconsistent and they ended the [[1989 Swedish football Division 2|season]] in 6th position. With his loan spell coming to an end St Albans decided against extended it and so Kelly returned to England in November 1989.<ref name=\"RC\"/> On his return to London, Kelly resumed his job at Eastern Electricity and also continued to go to betting shops and play for St Albans City.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nHis time in Sweden had alerted other clubs to his talents and he earned a trial at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. He had two training sessions with the Saints squad and played in a reserve match against [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] and whilst Kelly impressed the manager [[Chris Nicholl]] he could not justify paying the \u00a3100,000 St Albans wanted so Kelly returned to the club to have words with chairman Bernard Tominey. St Albans refused to lower their demands but decided they would accept \u00a340,000 from a club not in the First Division.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Kelly then played a trial match for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] but picked up an injury which scuppered any move. He was then told [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] were interested and that their manager [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] would be attending their next match against [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> Assistant manager [[Graham Paddon]] contacted Kelly the next day offering him a trial but Kelly refused and stated he wants a contract. Ball soon rang back and offered him a two and a half year deal for a fee of \u00a320,000 which St Albans accepted.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\n===Stoke City===\nKelly joined Stoke in January 1990 with the team struggling at the foot of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After he moved to [[Stoke-on-Trent]] from London he was shown around the [[Victoria Ground]] and was given free accommodation at a local hotel and he was also given a \u00a310,000 signing on fee but he spent most of it gambling. He made his debut for Stoke in the [[Potteries derby]] against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 3 February 1990 where he played 70 minutes in a goalless draw at [[Vale Park]]. In all he made nine appearances in [[1989\u201390 Stoke City F.C. season|1989\u201390]] as Stoke dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In [[1990\u201391 Stoke City F.C. season|1990\u201391]] Kelly struggled to become a regular in the side under [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] with most of his appearances coming off the substitute bench.<ref name=\"Stoke City Modern Era\"/> Ball was sacked by Stoke in February 1991 and was replaced by [[Lou Macari]] in June 1991.\n\nMacari's intense fitness sessions worked well with Kelly who made his biggest contribution in a Stoke shirt on 25 September 1991 when he scored a late equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] at [[Anfield]]. However his joy soon turned to despair as in the second leg a Kelly backpass was intercepted by [[Ian Rush]] and Liverpool went on to win 3\u20132. Stoke pushed for promotion in [[1991\u201392 Stoke City F.C. season|1991\u201392]] and they reached the [[Football League play-offs|play-offs]] where they lost to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. Three days later the two sides met again this time in the [[Football League Trophy]] [[1992 Football League Trophy Final|final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] a [[Mark Stein (footballer)|Mark Stein]] goal earning Stoke a 1\u20130 win. He played nine times in [[1992\u201393 Stoke City F.C. season|1992\u201393]] as Stoke won the Second Division title. His gambling addiction caused him to lose his form and after failing to play in [[1993\u201394 Stoke City F.C. season|1993\u201394]] Macari decided to move Kelly on. Whilst out of the side he spent time out on loan at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] (making six appearances scoring once) and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (making five appearances scoring once).<ref name=\"Stoke City Modern Era\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nKelly joined [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in September 1993 playing 37 times in [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] scoring eight goals and then helped the \"Shakers\" reach the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] play-offs in [[1995 Football League Third Division play-off Final|1995]] losing 2\u20130 to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in the final. He then signed for [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] for a fee of \u00a340,000 and he played in 38 matches in [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] as the Os finished in 21st position. In [[1996\u201397 in English football|1996\u201397]] he fell out with manager [[Pat Holland]] and was sent out on loan to [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] for whom he made three appearances.

He played for [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]], [[Stratford Town F.C.|Stratford Town]], [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]], [[Corinthian-Casuals F.C.|Corinthian-Casuals]], [[Cheshunt F.C.|Cheshunt]], [[Enfield Town F.C.|Enfield Town]], [[Gimon\u00e4s CK]] (Sweden) and [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]].\n\nHe joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in January 1990 and at the [[Victoria Ground]] Kelly was never a regular but did play in the [[1992 Football League Trophy Final]] victory over [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. After loan spells at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] he signed permanently with [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and later played with [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]], [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and made a return to [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]] before ending his career at [[Harlow Town F.C.|Harlow Town]]. Throughout his career Kelly struggled with a [[Problem gambling|gambling addiction]] and ran up debts of over \u00a3300,000.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nKelly was born in [[Coventry]] and was one of seven children including his twin brother Mel.<ref name=\"RC\">{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Tony|title=Red Card|year=2013|publisher=Mereo Books|isbn=9781909544703}}</ref> They both went to the same school in the [[Tile Hill]] area of the city before they moved to [[Coundon, Coventry|Coundon]] on the other side of the city. After playing football with the school team Kelly and his brother joined a [[Sunday league football|Sunday League]] side, Coundon Cockerels managed by a Scotsman, Dave McLeod.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Two of his other brothers were also involved with football, Abby who played in non-league and [[Errington Kelly|Errington]] who made it as a professional.<ref name=\"RC\"/> He moved to Woodlands Secondary School and his PE teacher recommended him to play for the Coventry schoolboys.<ref name=\"RC\"/> At high school Kelly had to deal with racist abuse and often got into fights. Kelly became friends with boxer [[Errol Christie]] which made going to nightclubs easier.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nOne day his brother Errington, who was playing for [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] set him and Mel up with a trial.<ref name=\"RC\"/> The pair travelled with Errington to [[Bristol]] where they met the Rovers manager [[Bobby Gould]] and after a couple of training sessions they played in a [[South East Counties League]] match against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> However it was not enough for them to be offered a contract by Bristol Rovers.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Errington then asked his former manager [[Terry Cooper (footballer born 1944)|Terry Cooper]] who was now at [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] if they could have a trial and he accepted. They both played and scored in a trial match against [[Mangotsfield United F.C.|Mangotsfield United]] which saw them both successfully offered a [[Youth Training Scheme|YTS]] at the club.<ref name=\"RC\"/> After meeting with the rest of the squad they moved into a lodgings paid by the club to accommodate youth team players and he was informed that his behavior would be closely monitored.\n\nKelly began to impress the coaches at [[Ashton Gate Stadium|Ashton Gate]] and he began to train with the first team and on 16 October 1982 he was named in the squad for a league match away at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> He came on as a second-half substitute in a 1\u20131 draw and at the age of 16 years and 244 days he became Bristol City's youngest player. His record remained until it was broken by [[Marvin Brown]] in 1999. Kelly then played against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] at [[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] in a narrow 2\u20131 defeat. His brother Mel was struggling to make an impact and was released by the club in November 1982. It was at this time Kelly began to 'get too big for his boots' and began to show a poor attitude which did not go unnoticed by the management who sent him back to the youth team.<ref name=\"RC\"/> He earned a recall to the first team against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] on 28 December 1982 where he scored his first league goal in a 3\u20131 victory.<ref name=\"RC\"/> However, by 1983 he was not being asked to play and in May 1983 he was informed by Terry Cooper he was being released because of his \"rubbish attitude\" and so Kelly returned to his family in Coventry.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\n===Non-league football===\nAfter returning to Coventry, Kelly contacted local non-league sides [[Nuneaton Town F.C.|Nuneaton Borough]] and [[Bedworth United F.C.|Bedworth United]] in the hope of getting the chance to play football again and after a short trial he joined Nuneaton Borough.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Under the management of [[Graham Carr]] Nuneaton played in the [[Conference Premier|Alliance Premier League]] and it was hard for Kelly to establish himself in the first team and when Carr could not offer Kelly a long-term contract he wanted he parted amicably for [[Stratford Town F.C.|Stratford Town]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> At Stratford was his brother Abby and together they played in the [[Midland Football Combination|Midland Combination League]] whilst he also worked as a banqueting porter at the Hotel Leofric. In the summer of 1983 Kelly began to visit his brother, Mel who had moved to [[London]] and was now playing for [[Dulwich Hamlet F.C.|Dulwich Hamlet]]. After starting the 1984\u201385 season with Stratford Kelly moved to London in March 1985 and got a job as a security guard in [[Dulwich]].<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nHe also began playing for Dulwich Hamlet whose first-team included [[Alan Pardew]], [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1964)|Andy Gray]] and [[Paul Harding (association footballer)|Paul Harding]] but Mel soon left for [[Corinthian-Casuals F.C.|Corinthian-Casuals]]. It was at this time Kelly began to get involved with gambling and would soon become an addiction.<ref name=\"RC\"/> In January 1987 he moved in with his sister, Pat in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] and signed for Corinthian-Casuals. On his 21st birthday Kelly was playing in an away match where he was sent-off for two bookable offences and in rage Kelly pushed the referee to the ground. Kelly was given a nine-month ban by the FA and he left Corinthian-Casuals and also decided to change his name from Nyrere to Tony.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nHe began playing with [[Cheshunt F.C.|Cheshunt]] where he finished the 1987\u201388 season as top-scorer and also changed his name again this time to Nyrere Anthony Okpara Kelly.<ref name=\"RC\"/> He then had a brief spell with [[Enfield Town F.C.|Enfield Town]] before joining [[St Albans City F.C.|St Albans City]]. By now his brother [[Errington Kelly|Errington]] had moved to Sweden to play for [[Grebbestads IF]] and after Kelly went over to visit him he began writing to Swedish clubs's offering them his services. To his surprise St Albans received a loan offer from [[Swedish Football Division 2|Swedish Second Division]] side [[Gimon\u00e4s CK]] which Kelly quickly accepted.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nGimon\u00e4s is based in the city of [[Ume\u00e5]] and Kelly travelled there with the intentions of attracting the attentions of top-flight Swedish teams and teams back in England. Errington also managed to make the move to Gimon\u00e4s and the club under the management of [[Anders Johansson (footballer)|Anders Johansson]] had ambitions to aim for promotion to the [[Allsvenskan]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> However results were inconsistent and they ended the [[1989 Swedish football Division 2|season]] in 6th position. With his loan spell coming to an end St Albans decided against extended it and so Kelly returned to England in November 1989.<ref name=\"RC\"/> On his return to London, Kelly resumed his job at Eastern Electricity and also continued to go to betting shops and play for St Albans City.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\nHis time in Sweden had alerted other clubs to his talents and he earned a trial at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. He had two training sessions with the Saints squad and played in a reserve match against [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] and whilst Kelly impressed the manager [[Chris Nicholl]] he could not justify paying the \u00a3100,000 St Albans wanted so Kelly returned to the club to have words with chairman Bernard Tominey. St Albans refused to lower their demands but decided they would accept \u00a340,000 from a club not in the First Division.<ref name=\"RC\"/> Kelly then played a trial match for [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] but picked up an injury which scuppered any move. He was then told [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] were interested and that their manager [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] would be attending their next match against [[Stevenage F.C.|Stevenage]].<ref name=\"RC\"/> Assistant manager [[Graham Paddon]] contacted Kelly the next day offering him a trial but Kelly refused and stated he wants a contract. Ball soon rang back and offered him a two and a half year deal for a fee of \u00a320,000 which St Albans accepted.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n\n===Stoke City===\nKelly joined Stoke in January 1990 with the team struggling at the foot of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After he moved to [[Stoke-on-Trent]] from London he was shown around the [[Victoria Ground]] and was given free accommodation at a local hotel and he was also given a \u00a310,000 signing on fee but he spent most of it gambling. He made his debut for Stoke in the [[Potteries derby]] against [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] on 3 February 1990 where he played 70 minutes in a goalless draw at [[Vale Park]]. In all he made nine appearances in [[1989\u201390 Stoke City F.C. season|1989\u201390]] as Stoke dropped into the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In [[1990\u201391 Stoke City F.C. season|1990\u201391]] Kelly struggled to become a regular in the side under [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball]] with most of his appearances coming off the substitute bench.<ref name=\"Stoke City Modern Era\"/> Ball was sacked by Stoke in February 1991 and was replaced by [[Lou Macari]] in June 1991.\n\nMacari's intense fitness sessions worked well with Kelly who made his biggest contribution in a Stoke shirt on 25 September 1991 when he scored a late equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] at [[Anfield]]. However his joy soon turned to despair as in the second leg a Kelly backpass was intercepted by [[Ian Rush]] and Liverpool went on to win 3\u20132. Stoke pushed for promotion in [[1991\u201392 Stoke City F.C. season|1991\u201392]] and they reached the [[Football League play-offs|play-offs]] where they lost to [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. Three days later the two sides met again this time in the [[Football League Trophy]] [[1992 Football League Trophy Final|final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] a [[Mark Stein (footballer)|Mark Stein]] goal earning Stoke a 1\u20130 win. He played nine times in [[1992\u201393 Stoke City F.C. season|1992\u201393]] as Stoke won the Second Division title. His gambling addiction caused him to lose his form and after failing to play in [[1993\u201394 Stoke City F.C. season|1993\u201394]] Macari decided to move Kelly on. Whilst out of the side he spent time out on loan at [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] (making six appearances scoring once) and [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (making five appearances scoring once).<ref name=\"Stoke City Modern Era\"/>\n\n===Later career===\nKelly joined [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] in September 1993 playing 37 times in [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] scoring eight goals and then helped the \"Shakers\" reach the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] play-offs in [[1995 Football League Third Division play-off Final|1995]] losing 2\u20130 to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in the final. He then signed for [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] for a fee of \u00a340,000 and he played in 38 matches in [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] as the Os finished in 21st position.

Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"utr\"> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]].

In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.

'''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]].

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs.

Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDamage caused by host immune system", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}

The company produced hundreds of early, widely distributed commercial moving pictures, including the first films starring [[Tom Mix]], [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Colleen Moore]], and [[Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle]]. Selig Polyscope also established [[Southern California]]'s first permanent movie studio, in the historic [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale district]] of Los Angeles.  Ending film production in 1918, the business, based on its film production animals, became an animal and prop supplier to other studios and a [[zoo]] and amusement park attraction in [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles]] until the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnheightsla.com/selig/|title=Lincolnheightsla.com|author=|date=|website=lincolnheightsla.com|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}\n[[Image:Fairylogue.jpg|thumb|right|Surviving hand-tinted still from ''The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays'' (1908), based on L. Frank Baum's Oz books]]\n[[File:Selig studio in Chicago.jpg|thumb|Selig studio in Chicago in 1916]]\n\nSelig had worked as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] and [[minstrel show]] operator on the west coast of [[California]]. Later on, in [[Chicago]] he entered the film business using his own photographic equipment, free from [[patent]] restrictions imposed through companies controlled by [[Thomas Edison]]. In 1896, with help from Union Metal Works and Andrew Schustek, he shot his first film, ''Tramp and the Dog''. He went on to successfully produce local actualities, [[slapstick]] comedies, early [[travelogue (films)|travelogue]]s and [[sponsored film|industrial film]]s (a major client was [[Armour and Company]]). In 1908 Selig Polyscope was involved in the production of ''[[The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays]]'', a touring \"multimedia\" attempt to bring [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[The Oz books|Oz books]] to a wider public (which played to full houses but was nonetheless a financial disaster for Baum). By 1909 Selig had studios making short features in Chicago and the [[Edendale, Los Angeles|Edendale district of Los Angeles]]. The company also distributed stock film footage and titles from other studios. That year, [[Roscoe Arbuckle]]'s first movie was a Selig comedy short. The company's early existence was fraught with legal turmoil over disputes with lawyers representing [[Thomas Edison]]'s interests. In 1909 Selig and several other studio heads settled with Edison by creating an alliance with the inventor. Effectively a [[cartel]], [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] dominated the industry for a few years until the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] (in 1913 and 1915) ruled the firm was an illegal [[monopoly]]. In 1910 Selig Polyscope produced a wholly new filmed version of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1910 film)|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''. The company produced the first commercial two-reel film, ''[[Damon and Pythias]]'', successfully distributed its pictures in Great Britain and maintained an office in London for several years before World War I. Although Selig Polyscope produced a wide variety of moving pictures, the company was most widely known for its wild animal shorts, historical subjects and early [[Western (genre)|western]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Edendale===\nAttracted by Southern California's mild, dry climate, varied geography for location shooting and isolation from Edison's legal representatives on the east coast, Selig set up his studio in [[Edendale, Los Angeles|Edendale]] in 1909 with director [[Francis Boggs]], who began the facility in a rented [[bungalow]] and quickly expanded, designing the studio's front entrance after [[Mission San Gabriel]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File: Selig Polyscope Company studio ca. 1910.jpg|thumb|left|Street view of the Selig Polyscope Company studio in Edendale, ca. 1910.]]\n\nAn early production there was ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]''. Edendale soon became Selig Polyscope's headquarters, but in 1911 Boggs was murdered by a Japanese gardener who also wounded Selig. The company produced hundreds of short features at Edendale, including many early westerns featuring [[Tom Mix]] (which were also shot at [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]). Selig Polyscope made dozens of highly successful short movies involving wild animals in exotic settings, including a popular re-creation of an African [[safari]] hunt by [[Teddy Roosevelt]]. In 1914 Selig made 14 short experimental \"[[talking pictures]]\" with Scottish actor [[Harry Lauder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/indexes/earlySoundFilms.html|title=Silent Era : Progressive Silent Film List|author=|date=|website=www.silentera.com|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The cliffhanger===\nIn 1913, through a collaborative partnership with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Selig produced ''[[The Adventures of Kathlyn]]'', introducing a dramatic [[Serial (film)|serial]] plot device which came to be known as the [[cliffhanger]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Each chapter's story was simultaneously published in the newspaper. A combination of wild animals, clever dramatic action and [[Kathlyn Williams]]' screen presence resulted in significant success. The ''Tribune''\u2019s circulation reportedly increased by 10% and both dance and cocktail were named after Williams, whose likeness was reportedly sold on over 50,000 [[postcard]]s.\n\n===V-L-S-E, Incorporated===\nIn 1915, Selig entered into an agreement with [[Vitagraph Studios]], [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]], and [[Essanay Studios]] to form a film distribution partnership known as [[Vitagraph_Studios#V-L-S-E, Incorporated|V-L-S-E, Incorporated]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyOhBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=V-L-S-E|title=The Movies in the Age of Innocence, 3d ed.|first=Edward|last=Wagenknecht|date=13 October 2014|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=9 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Selig zoo===\n[[Image:Selig zoo park.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional drawing for the planned Selig Zoo Park in East LA, with light rail connections, cars speeding towards the entrance and long lines depicted at the gate.

In 1917 Selig sold the Edendale facility to producer [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] and moved his movie studio to the zoo in East Los Angeles. Meanwhile, World War I cut severely into the substantial revenues Selig Polyscope had been garnering in [[Europe]] and the company shunned profitable movie industry trends, which had shifted towards [[drama]]tic (and more costly) full length [[feature film]]s. Selig Polyscope became insolvent and ceased operations in 1918. Mix signed with Fox back at Edendale and went on to even greater success as a [[wikt:matin\u00e9e|matin\u00e9e]] [[cowboy]] star. Movie studios rented animals and staged many shoots at the Selig zoo (sometimes later claiming they had been filmed in [[Africa]]). The First [[Tarzan]] movie (1918) was filmed there. In 1920 [[Louis B. Mayer]] rented his first studio space for Mayer Pictures at the site. Selig planned to develop it into a major tourist attraction, [[amusement park]] and popular resort named Selig Zoo Park with a [[Ferris wheel]], [[carousels]], mechanical rides, an enormous swimming pool with a sandy beach and a wave making machine, hotel, theatre, cinema, restaurants and thousands of daily visitors (more than 30 years before [[Disneyland]]). Only a single carousel was built. Selig Polyscope's extensive collection of props and furnishings were auctioned off at the zoo in 1923.\n\nSelig finally sold the zoo following a flood during the [[Great Depression]]. Some of the animals were donated to [[Los Angeles County]], forming a substantial addition to [[Griffith Park]] Zoo. The property was used as a [[Rat rod|jalopy]] racetrack during the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1955 the site was described as \"an inactive amusement park.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Los Angeles Times: Lionesses on archway of entrance to the Selig Zoo |url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz0002t4m5 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |website=UCLA Digital Library}}</ref>\n\nThroughout its history, names appearing on the zoo gate included:\n:Selig Zoo and Studio\n:Selig Zoo\n:Selig Jungle Zoo\n:Luna Park Zoo\n:California Zoological Gardens\n:Zoopark\n:Lincoln Amusement Park\n\nThe [[carousel]] survived on the site until 1976 when it was destroyed by fire.

Edendale soon became Selig Polyscope's headquarters, but in 1911 Boggs was murdered by a Japanese gardener who also wounded Selig. The company produced hundreds of short features at Edendale, including many early westerns featuring [[Tom Mix]] (which were also shot at [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]). Selig Polyscope made dozens of highly successful short movies involving wild animals in exotic settings, including a popular re-creation of an African [[safari]] hunt by [[Teddy Roosevelt]]. In 1914 Selig made 14 short experimental \"[[talking pictures]]\" with Scottish actor [[Harry Lauder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/indexes/earlySoundFilms.html|title=Silent Era : Progressive Silent Film List|author=|date=|website=www.silentera.com|accessdate=9 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===The cliffhanger===\nIn 1913, through a collaborative partnership with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Selig produced ''[[The Adventures of Kathlyn]]'', introducing a dramatic [[Serial (film)|serial]] plot device which came to be known as the [[cliffhanger]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Each chapter's story was simultaneously published in the newspaper. A combination of wild animals, clever dramatic action and [[Kathlyn Williams]]' screen presence resulted in significant success. The ''Tribune''\u2019s circulation reportedly increased by 10% and both dance and cocktail were named after Williams, whose likeness was reportedly sold on over 50,000 [[postcard]]s.\n\n===V-L-S-E, Incorporated===\nIn 1915, Selig entered into an agreement with [[Vitagraph Studios]], [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]], and [[Essanay Studios]] to form a film distribution partnership known as [[Vitagraph_Studios#V-L-S-E, Incorporated|V-L-S-E, Incorporated]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyOhBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=V-L-S-E|title=The Movies in the Age of Innocence, 3d ed.|first=Edward|last=Wagenknecht|date=13 October 2014|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=9 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Selig zoo===\n[[Image:Selig zoo park.jpg|thumb|right|Promotional drawing for the planned Selig Zoo Park in East LA, with light rail connections, cars speeding towards the entrance and long lines depicted at the gate.

In 1917 Selig sold the Edendale facility to producer [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] and moved his movie studio to the zoo in East Los Angeles. Meanwhile, World War I cut severely into the substantial revenues Selig Polyscope had been garnering in [[Europe]] and the company shunned profitable movie industry trends, which had shifted towards [[drama]]tic (and more costly) full length [[feature film]]s. Selig Polyscope became insolvent and ceased operations in 1918. Mix signed with Fox back at Edendale and went on to even greater success as a [[wikt:matin\u00e9e|matin\u00e9e]] [[cowboy]] star. Movie studios rented animals and staged many shoots at the Selig zoo (sometimes later claiming they had been filmed in [[Africa]]). The First [[Tarzan]] movie (1918) was filmed there. In 1920 [[Louis B. Mayer]] rented his first studio space for Mayer Pictures at the site. Selig planned to develop it into a major tourist attraction, [[amusement park]] and popular resort named Selig Zoo Park with a [[Ferris wheel]], [[carousels]], mechanical rides, an enormous swimming pool with a sandy beach and a wave making machine, hotel, theatre, cinema, restaurants and thousands of daily visitors (more than 30 years before [[Disneyland]]). Only a single carousel was built. Selig Polyscope's extensive collection of props and furnishings were auctioned off at the zoo in 1923.\n\nSelig finally sold the zoo following a flood during the [[Great Depression]]. Some of the animals were donated to [[Los Angeles County]], forming a substantial addition to [[Griffith Park]] Zoo. The property was used as a [[Rat rod|jalopy]] racetrack during the 1940s and early 1950s. In 1955 the site was described as \"an inactive amusement park.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Los Angeles Times: Lionesses on archway of entrance to the Selig Zoo |url=http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewItem.do?ark=21198/zz0002t4m5 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |website=UCLA Digital Library}}</ref>\n\nThroughout its history, names appearing on the zoo gate included:\n:Selig Zoo and Studio\n:Selig Zoo\n:Selig Jungle Zoo\n:Luna Park Zoo\n:California Zoological Gardens\n:Zoopark\n:Lincoln Amusement Park\n\nThe [[carousel]] survived on the site until 1976 when it was destroyed by fire.

Today, the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States [[National Trails System]], known as the '''Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail'''.\n\nThe Mormon Trail extends from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], which was the principal settlement of the [[Latter Day Saints]] from 1839 to 1846, to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], which was settled by [[Brigham Young]] and his followers beginning in 1847. From [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] to [[Fort Bridger]] in Wyoming, the trail follows much the same route as the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[California Trail]]; these trails are collectively known as the [[Emigrant Trail]].\n\nThe [[Mormon pioneer]] run began in 1846, when Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo. After leaving, they aimed to establish a new home for the church in the [[Great Basin]] and crossed Iowa. Along their way, some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants. During the winter of 1846\u201347, the emigrants wintered in Iowa, other nearby states, and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska, with the largest group residing in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters, Nebraska]]. In the spring of 1847, Young led the vanguard company to the [[Salt Lake Valley]], which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became [[Utah]].\n\nDuring the first few years, the emigrants were mostly former occupants of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah. Later, the emigrants increasingly comprised converts from the [[British Isles]] and Europe.\n\nThe trail was used for more than 20 years, until the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. Among the emigrants were the [[Mormon handcart pioneers]] of 1856\u201360. Two of the handcart companies, led by [[James G. Willie]] and Edward Martin, met disaster on the trail when they departed late and were caught by heavy snowstorms in Wyoming.\n\n==Background==\nUnder the leadership of [[Joseph Smith]], Latter Day Saints established several communities throughout the United States between 1830 and 1844, most notably in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]; [[Independence, Missouri]]; and Nauvoo, Illinois. However, the Saints were driven out of each of them in turn, due to conflicts with other settlers (see [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement]]). This included the actions of Missouri Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]], who issued [[Missouri Executive Order 44]], which called for the \"extermination\" of all Mormons in Missouri. Latter-day Saints were finally forced to abandon Nauvoo in 1846.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=53\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the movement had split into several denominations after [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] in 1844, most members aligned themselves with [[Brigham Young]] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Under Young's leadership, about 14,000 Mormon citizens of Nauvoo set out to find a new home in the West.<ref name=\"Hartley\">{{harvp|Hartley|1997}}</ref>\n\n==The Trek West==\n{{Main|Mormon pioneers}}\n[[File:Route of the Mormon pioneers from Nauvoo to Great Salt Lake (NBY 15555).jpg|thumb|Route of the Mormon pioneers from Nauvoo to Great Salt Lake]]\nAs the senior [[Apostle (Mormonism)|apostle]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] after Joseph Smith's death, Brigham Young assumed responsibility of the leadership of the church. He would later be sustained as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] and [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]].<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=198\u2013202, 255}}</ref>\n\nYoung now had to lead the Saints into the far west, without knowing exactly where to go or where they would end up. He insisted the Mormons should settle in a place no one else wanted and felt the isolated [[Great Basin]] would provide the Saints with many advantages.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=208\u2013215}}</ref>\n\nYoung reviewed information on the Great Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulted with [[Mountain man|mountain men]] and trappers, and met with Father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]], a [[Jesuit]] missionary familiar with the region. Young also organized a vanguard company to break trail to the [[Rocky Mountains]], evaluate trail conditions, find sources of water, and select a central gathering point in the Great Basin. A new route on the north side of the [[Platte River|Platte]] and [[North Platte River|North Platte]] rivers was chosen to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access, and campsites with travelers using the established [[Oregon Trail]] on the river's south side.\n\nThe Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions demanding that the Latter-day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846. A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them out if they failed to meet the May deadline.<ref>{{harvp|Bennett|1997|p=6}}</ref> To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref>\n\n=== Trek of 1846 ===\n[[File:Dateland-Mormon Battalion Trail-1846.jpg|thumb|250px|Mormon Battalion Trail Marker in Oatman Flats, Dateland, Arizona]] \nThe departure from Nauvoo began on February 4, 2020, under the leadership of Brigham Young. This early departure exposed them to the elements in the worst of winter. After crossing the [[Mississippi River]], the journey across [[Iowa Territory]] followed primitive territorial roads and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trails.\n\nYoung originally planned to lead an express company of about 300 men to the Great Basin during the summer of 1846. He believed they could cross Iowa and reach the [[Missouri River]] in four to six weeks. However, the actual trip across Iowa was slowed by rain, mud, swollen rivers, and poor preparation, and it required 16 weeks \u2013 nearly three times longer than planned.\n\nHeavy rains turned the rolling plains of southern Iowa into a quagmire of axle-deep mud. Furthermore, few people carried adequate provisions for the trip. The weather, general unpreparedness, and lack of experience in moving such a large group of people all contributed to the difficulties they endured.\n\nThe initial party reached the Missouri River on June 14. It was apparent that the Latter-day Saints could not make it to the Great Basin that season and would have to winter on the Missouri River.<ref>{{harvp|Bennett|1997|p=31\u201340}}</ref>\n\nSome of the emigrants established a settlement called [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Kanesville]] (present-day Council Bluffs) on the Iowa side of the river. Others moved across the river into the area of present-day [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and built a camp called [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Winter Quarters]].<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=234\u2013238, 247\u2013248}}</ref>\n\n=== The Vanguard Company of 1847 ===\n\n[[File:Wayside on Mormon Trail Nebraska.JPG|thumb|right|Historic Information along the National Historic Trail]]\nIn April 1847, chosen members of the vanguard company gathered, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into 14 military companies. A militia and night guard were formed. The company consisted of 143 men, including three black people and eight members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]], three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, draft animals, and livestock, and carried enough supplies to provision the group for one year. On April 5, the [[wagon train]] moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin.<ref name=\"Clayton\">{{Cite book |last= Clayton |first= William |authorlink= William Clayton (Mormon) |title= William Clayton's   Journal |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= Deseret News |year= 1921 |url= https://archive.org/details/williamclaytonsj00clay }}</ref>\n\nThe journey from [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Winter Quarters]] to [[Fort Laramie]] took six weeks; the company arrived at the fort on June 1. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the [[Mormon Battalion]], who had been excused due to illness and sent to winter in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], and a group of Church members from Mississippi. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at [[Fort Bridger]].<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|p=244}}</ref>\n\nYoung met [[mountain man]] [[Jim Bridger]] on June 28. They discussed routes into the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by 12 more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref name=\"Clayton\"/>\n\nNow facing a more rugged and hazardous trek, Young chose to follow the trail used by the [[Donner Party|Donner\u2013Reed party]] on their journey to California the previous year. As the vanguard company traveled through the rugged mountains, they divided into three sections. Young and several other members of the party suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a \"mountain fever\" induced by wood ticks. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther ahead on the designated route.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/>\n\n===Arrival and settlement===\nScouts [[Erastus Snow]] and [[Orson Pratt]] entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 21. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted. On July 24, Young first saw the valley from a \"sick\" wagon driven by his friend [[Wilford Woodruff]]. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared, \"This is the right place, drive on.\"<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=246\u2013247}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1847, Young and selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters to organize the companies scheduled for following years. By December 1847, more than 2,000 Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley, then in [[Mexico|Mexican]] territory.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|p=247}}</ref>\n\nFarming the uncultivated land was initially difficult, as the shares broke when they tried to plow the dry ground. Therefore, an [[irrigation]] system was designed and the land was flooded before plowing, and the resulting system provided supplemental moisture during the year.\n\n[[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] was laid out and designated as Church headquarters. Hard work produced a prosperous community. In their new settlement, entertainment was also important, and the first public building was a theater.\n\nIt did not take long, however, until the United States caught up with them, and in 1848, after the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]], the land in which they settled became part of the United States.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Fisher | first=Albert L. | contribution=Physical Geography of Utah | contribution-url=http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/g/GEOGRAPHY.html | editor-last=Powell | editor-first=Allan Kent | title=Utah History Encyclopedia | year=1994}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing migration===\n[[File:1859 nebraska.jpg|thumb|1859 map of route from Sioux City, Iowa, through Nebraska, to gold fields of Wyoming, following old Mormon trails.]]\nEach year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \"companies\", each company bearing the name of its leader and subdivided into groups of 10 and 50. The Saints traveled the trail broken by the vanguard company, splitting the journey into two sections. The first segment began in Nauvoo and ended in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]], near modern-day [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The second half of the journey took the Saints through the area that later became [[Nebraska]] and [[Wyoming]], before finishing their journey in the Salt Lake Valley in present-day [[Utah]]. The earlier groups used [[covered wagon]]s pulled by oxen to carry their supplies across the country. Some later companies used handcarts and traveled by foot.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/>\n\nBy 1849, many of the Latter-day Saints who remained in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford the costs of the wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the [[Perpetual Emigration Fund]], to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=279\u2013287}}</ref>\n\n=== Handcarts: 1856\u201360 ===\n{{Main|Mormon handcart pioneers}}\nIn 1856, the church inaugurated a system of [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcart companies]] in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different [[Mormon handcart pioneers|companies]], made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While not the first to use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=29\u201334, 193\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nThe handcarts were modeled after carts used by [[street sweeper]]s and were made almost entirely of wood. They were generally six to seven feet (183 to 213&nbsp;cm) long, wide enough to span a narrow wagon track, and could be alternately pushed or pulled. The small boxes affixed to the carts were three to four feet (91 to 122&nbsp;cm) long and eight inches (20&nbsp;cm) high. They could carry about 500 pounds (227&nbsp;kg), most of this weight consisting of trail provisions and a few personal possessions.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=53\u201355}}</ref>\n\nAll but two of the handcart companies successfully completed the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the [[Mormon handcart pioneers|Willie and Martin Companies]], respectively, had serious problems. The companies left [[Iowa City, Iowa]], in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day [[Casper, Wyoming]], and continued to cope with deep snow and storms for the remainder of the journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992}}</ref>\n\nThe handcart companies continued with more success until 1860, and traditional ox-and-wagon companies also continued for those who could afford the higher cost. After 1860, the church began sending wagon companies east each spring, to return to Utah in the summer with the emigrating Latter-day Saints. Finally, with the completion of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, future emigrants were able to travel by rail, and the era of the Mormon pioneer trail came to an end.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=191\u2013192}}</ref>\n\n==Sites along the trail==\n[[File:Mormon Trail 3.png|right|thumb|Map of Mormon Trail]]\n[[File:TEMPLE DE NAUVOO.jpg|thumb|[[Daguerreotype]] of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] as it appeared at the time of the [[Mormon]] exodus.]]\nThe following are major points along the trail at which the early Mormon pioneers stopped, established temporary camps, or used as landmarks and meeting places.

More refugees continued to cross into Iowa for a number of months many taking advantage of the freezing of the Mississippi river a few weeks later. The poorly prepared emigrants suffered from severe winter weather while camped there. Sugar Creek was the staging area for the westward trek across Iowa. Ultimately about 2,500 refugees and 500 wagons started west on March 1, 1846. Several thousand more would follow on later as they sold their property for what they could get and continued to leave [[Nauvoo, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Kimball_14\">{{harvp|Kimball|1979|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Sugar Creek |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n*'''Richardson's Point''' ({{convert|35|mi|0}} west) \u2013 The emigrants made their way past Croton and [[Farmington, Iowa|Farmington]] to ford the [[Des Moines River]] at [[Bonaparte, Iowa|Bonaparte]]. In early March 1846 the party was halted for 10 days by heavy rain at a wooded area known as Richardson's Point.

They enclosed and planted {{convert|715|acre|km2}} to supply food for later emigrants and established a village that is still in existence today. About 600 Latter-day Saints settled at Garden Grove. By 1852 they had moved on to Utah.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref name=\"Kimball_14\"/>\n*'''[[Mount Pisgah (Iowa)|Mount Pisgah]]''' ({{convert|153|mi|0}} west) \u2013 As they entered [[Potawatomi]] territory, the emigrants established another semi-permanent settlement that they named Mount Pisgah. Several thousand acres were cultivated and a settlement of about 700 Latter-day Saints thrived there from 1846 to 1852. Now the site is marked by a {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} park, which contains exhibits, historical markers, and a reconstructed log cabin.

The first emigrant company arrived on June 13, 1846. At this open area, where the [[Iowa School for the Deaf]] is now located, the LDS emigrant companies paused and camped, forming what was called the ''Grand Encampment.'' From this site on July 20, the [[Mormon Battalion]] departed for the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].<ref name=\"harvp|Kimball|1979|p=16\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Grand Encampment |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n*'''[[Thomas L. Kane|Kanesville]]''' (later [[Council Bluffs]]) ({{convert|265|mi|0}} west) \u2013 The emigrants established an important settlement and outfitting point at this site on the [[Missouri River]], originally known as Miller's Hollow. The emigrants renamed the settlement as ''Kanesville,'' honoring [[Thomas L. Kane]], a non-LDS attorney who was politically well connected and used his influence to assist the Latter-day Saints. From 1846 to 1852, it was an important LDS settlement and the outfitting point for companies traveling to present-day Utah. [[Orson Hyde]], an [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]] and ecclesiastical leader of the settlement, published a newspaper called the ''Frontier Guardian.'' In 1852 the major LDS settlements at Kanesville, Mount Pisgah, and Garden Grove were closed as the settlers moved on to Utah. After 1852, however, the Church continued to outfit and supply emigrant companies (mostly LDS converts coming from the [[British Isles]] and mainland [[Europe]]) at this community, now renamed ''Council Bluffs,'' until the mid-1860s, when the terminus of the First Transcontinental Railroad was extended to the west.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=247\u2013248}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Council Bluffs |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n\n===Nebraska===\n*'''[[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]]''' ({{convert|266|mi|0}} west)  \u2013 Although Brigham Young had originally planned to travel all the way to the Salt Lake Valley in 1846, the emigrants' lack of preparation had become apparent during their difficult crossing of Iowa. Furthermore, the departure of the Mormon Battalion left the emigrants short on manpower. Young decided to settle for the winter along the Missouri River. The emigrants were located on both sides of the river, but their settlement at Winter Quarters on the west side was the largest. There they built 700 dwellings where an estimated 3,500 Latter-day Saints spent the winter of 1846\u201347; many would also reside there during the winter of 1847\u201348. Conditions such as scurvy, consumption, chills and fever were common; the settlement recorded 359 deaths between September 1846 and May 1848. However, while at Winter Quarters the LDS emigrants were able to save or trade for the equipment and supplies that they would need to continue the westward trek. The settlement was later renamed [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]] and is now located in [[North Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=234\u2013238}}</ref>\n*'''[[Elkhorn River]]''' ({{convert|293|mi|0}} west)\n*'''[[Platte River]]''' ({{convert|305|mi|0}} west) \u2013 All emigrants leaving Missouri traveled along the [[Great Platte River Road]] for hundreds of miles. There was a prevailing opinion that the North side of the river was healthier, so most Latter-day Saints generally stuck to that side, which also separated them from unpleasant encounters with potential former enemies, like emigrants from Missouri or Illinois. In 1849, 1850 & 1852, traffic was so heavy along the Platte that virtually all feed was stripped from both sides of the river. The lack of food and the threat of disease made the journey along the Platte a deadly gamble.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Platte River |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref>\n*'''[[Loup River|Loup Fork]]''' ({{convert|352|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Crossing the Loup Fork was, like the Elkhorn, one of the early and very difficult crossings during the trek west from Council Bluffs.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Loup Fork |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>\n*'''[[Fort Kearny]]''' ({{convert|469|mi|0}} west) \u2013 This fort, named after [[Stephen Watts Kearny]], was established in June 1848. Another fort named after Kearny was established in May 1846, but was abandoned in May 1848. Due to this, the second Fort Kearny is sometimes called New Fort Kearny. The site for the fort was purchased from the Pawnee Indians for $2,000 in goods.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Fort Kearny |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>\n*'''Confluence Point''' ({{convert|563|mi|0}} west) \u2013 On May 11, 1847, three-fourths of a mile north of the confluence of the North and South Platte Rivers, a \"roadometer\" was attached to [[Heber C. Kimball]]'s wagon driven by Philo Johnson. Although they did not invent the device, the measurements of the version they used were accurate enough to be used by William Clayton in his famous ''Latter-day Saints' Emigrants' Guide''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Confluence Point |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>\n*'''Ash Hollow''' ({{convert|646|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Many passing diarists noted the beauty of Ash Hollow, although this was ruined by thousands of passing emigrants. The [[Sioux Indians]] were often on location and were at the site and General [[William S. Harney]]'s troops won a battle over the Sioux there in September 1855 \u2013 the Battle of Ash Hollow. The site is also the burial ground of many who died of cholera during the gold rush years.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Ash Hollow |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>\n*'''[[Chimney Rock National Historical Site|Chimney Rock]]''' ({{convert|718|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Chimney Rock is perhaps the most significant landmark on the Mormon Trail. Emigrants commented in their diaries that the landmark appeared closer than it actually was, and many sketched or painted it in their journals and carved their names into it.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Chimney Rock |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>\n*'''[[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]]''' ({{convert|738|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Hiram Scott was a Rocky Mountain Fur Company trapper abandoned on the bluff that now bears his name by his companions when he became ill. Accounts of his death are noted by almost all those who kept journals that traveled on the north side of the Platte. The grave of [[Rebecca Winters (pioneer)|Rebecca Winters]], a Latter-day Saint mother who fell victim to cholera in 1852, is also located near this site, although it has since been moved and rededicated.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Scotts Bluff |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>\n\n===Wyoming===\n[[File:IndependenceRock2.jpg|thumb|right|Independence Rock, a site along the Mormon Trail.]]\n*'''[[Fort Laramie]]''' ({{convert|788|mi|0}} west) \u2013 This old trading and military post served as a place for the emigrants to rest and restock provisions. The 1856 [[Mormon handcart pioneers|Willie Handcart Company]] was unable to obtain provisions at Fort Laramie, contributing to their subsequent tragedy when they ran out of food while encountering blizzard conditions along the Sweetwater River.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|p=101}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Fort Laramie |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n*'''Upper Platte/Mormon Ferry''' ({{convert|914|mi|0}} west) \u2013 The last crossing of the Platte River took place near modern [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]]. For several years  the Latter-day Saints operated a commercial ferry at the site, earning revenue from the Oregon- and California-bound emigrants. The ferry was discontinued in 1853 after a competing toll bridge was constructed. On October 19, 1856, the [[Mormon handcart pioneers|Martin Handcart Company]] forded the freezing river in mid-October, leading to exposure that would prove fatal to many members of the company.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=108\u2013109}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Upper Platte (Mormon) Ferry |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n*'''Red Butte''' ({{convert|940|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Red Butte was the most tragic site of the Mormon Trail. After crossing the Platte River, the Martin Handcart Company camped near Red Butte as heavy snow fell. Snow continued to fall for three days, and the company came to a halt as many emigrants died. For nine days the company remained there, while 56 persons died from cold or disease. Finally, on October 28, an advance team of three men from the Utah rescue party reached them.

The emigrants sometimes also celebrated their arrival at this landmark with a dance.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Independence Rock |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n[[File:DevilsGate1.JPG|thumb|left|Devil's Gate, a gorge on the Sweetwater River.]]\n*'''[[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]]''' ({{convert|970|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Devil's Gate was a narrow gorge cut through the rocks by the Sweetwater River. A small fort was located at Devil's Gate, which was unoccupied in 1856 when the Martin Handcart Company was rescued. The rescuers unloaded unnecessary equipment from the wagons so the weaker handcart emigrants could ride. A group of 19 men, led by [[Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon)|Daniel W.

At the same time, the members of the Willie Company reached the end of their supplies of flour. A small advance team from the rescue party found their camp and gave them a small amount of flour, but then pushed on to the east to try to locate the Martin Company. Captain James Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead through the snow to find the main rescue party and inform them of the Willie Company's peril. On October 23, with the help of the rescue party, the Willie Company pushed ahead through the biting wind and snow up Rocky Ridge, a rough {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the trail that ascends to a ridge in order to bypass a section of the Sweetwater River valley that is impassable.<ref>{{harvp|Bartholomew|Arrington|1981|pp=15\u201318}}</ref>\n*'''Rock Creek''' ({{convert|1048|mi|0}} west) \u2013 After their grueling 18-hour trek up Rocky Ridge, the Willie Handcart Company camped at the crossing of Rock Creek.

This was the site where the paths of the Oregon Trail, the [[California Trail]], and the Mormon Trail separated; the three trails ran in parallel from Missouri River to Fort Bridger. In 1855, the LDS Church bought the fort from Jim Bridger and Louis Vazquez for $8,000. During the [[Utah War]] in 1857, the Utah militia burned down the fort so that it would not fall into the hands of the advancing U.S. Army under General [[Albert Sidney Johnston|A.S.

The canyon became known as Parley's Canyon and the road he built as the \"Golden Pass Road,\" due to the large number of [[gold miner]]s who used it on their way to [[California]]. A cutoff was constructed through Silver Creek Canyon by 1862, diverting much of the traffic on what is today the route of [[Interstate 80|I-80]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Golden Pass Road |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-31}}</ref>\n*'''[[Emigration Canyon]]''' (Donner Hill) ({{convert|1283|mi|0}} west) \u2013 About a year before the Latter-day Saint emigrants, the [[Donner Party|Reed\u2013Donner wagon train]] carved the first road through the final geographic obstacle between Big Mountain and the Salt Lake Valley. About halfway through, the group changed course and went up and around the final constriction near the valley's mouth. The resulting exhaustingly brutal climb over rock and sage most likely contributed to the historic tragedy that befell the travelers three months and {{convert|600|mi|km}} to the west.

Settlement outside the Salt Lake Valley began as early as 1848, with a number of communities planted in the Weber valley to the north. Additional townsites were carefully chosen, with settlements placed near canyon mouths with access to dependable streams and stands of timber. Latter-day Saints founded more than 600 communities from Canada down into Mexico. As historian [[Wallace Stegner]] stated, the Latter-day Saints \"were one of the principal forces in the settlement of the West.\"<ref>{{harvp|Stegner|1992|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Salt Lake Valley |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-31}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Historic Sites of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}\n{{Portal|Latter Day Saint movement}}\n* [[Landmarks of the Nebraska Territory]]\n* [[Mormon handcart pioneers]]\n* [[Mormon Pioneer National Heritage Area]]\n* [[Mormon Trail (Canada)]]\n* [[Mormon Trail Center at Historic Winter Quarters]]\n* [[Mormonism]]\n* [[National Historic Trails Interpretive Center]]\n* [[Martin's Cove]]\n* [[Oregon-California Trails Association]]\n* [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]] in [[Utah]] on July 24\n* [[This Is The Place Heritage Park]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last= Allen |first= James B. |authorlink= James B.

Today, the Mormon Trail is a part of the United States [[National Trails System]], known as the '''Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail'''.\n\nThe Mormon Trail extends from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], which was the principal settlement of the [[Latter Day Saints]] from 1839 to 1846, to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], which was settled by [[Brigham Young]] and his followers beginning in 1847. From [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] to [[Fort Bridger]] in Wyoming, the trail follows much the same route as the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[California Trail]]; these trails are collectively known as the [[Emigrant Trail]].\n\nThe [[Mormon pioneer]] run began in 1846, when Young and his followers were driven from Nauvoo. After leaving, they aimed to establish a new home for the church in the [[Great Basin]] and crossed Iowa. Along their way, some were assigned to establish settlements and to plant and harvest crops for later emigrants. During the winter of 1846\u201347, the emigrants wintered in Iowa, other nearby states, and the unorganized territory that later became Nebraska, with the largest group residing in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters, Nebraska]]. In the spring of 1847, Young led the vanguard company to the [[Salt Lake Valley]], which was then outside the boundaries of the United States and later became [[Utah]].\n\nDuring the first few years, the emigrants were mostly former occupants of Nauvoo who were following Young to Utah. Later, the emigrants increasingly comprised converts from the [[British Isles]] and Europe.\n\nThe trail was used for more than 20 years, until the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. Among the emigrants were the [[Mormon handcart pioneers]] of 1856\u201360. Two of the handcart companies, led by [[James G. Willie]] and Edward Martin, met disaster on the trail when they departed late and were caught by heavy snowstorms in Wyoming.\n\n==Background==\nUnder the leadership of [[Joseph Smith]], Latter Day Saints established several communities throughout the United States between 1830 and 1844, most notably in [[Kirtland, Ohio]]; [[Independence, Missouri]]; and Nauvoo, Illinois. However, the Saints were driven out of each of them in turn, due to conflicts with other settlers (see [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement]]). This included the actions of Missouri Governor [[Lilburn Boggs]], who issued [[Missouri Executive Order 44]], which called for the \"extermination\" of all Mormons in Missouri. Latter-day Saints were finally forced to abandon Nauvoo in 1846.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=53\u2013222}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the movement had split into several denominations after [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] in 1844, most members aligned themselves with [[Brigham Young]] and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Under Young's leadership, about 14,000 Mormon citizens of Nauvoo set out to find a new home in the West.<ref name=\"Hartley\">{{harvp|Hartley|1997}}</ref>\n\n==The Trek West==\n{{Main|Mormon pioneers}}\n[[File:Route of the Mormon pioneers from Nauvoo to Great Salt Lake (NBY 15555).jpg|thumb|Route of the Mormon pioneers from Nauvoo to Great Salt Lake]]\nAs the senior [[Apostle (Mormonism)|apostle]] of the [[Quorum of the Twelve|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] after Joseph Smith's death, Brigham Young assumed responsibility of the leadership of the church. He would later be sustained as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] and [[Prophet, seer, and revelator|prophet]].<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=198\u2013202, 255}}</ref>\n\nYoung now had to lead the Saints into the far west, without knowing exactly where to go or where they would end up. He insisted the Mormons should settle in a place no one else wanted and felt the isolated [[Great Basin]] would provide the Saints with many advantages.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=208\u2013215}}</ref>\n\nYoung reviewed information on the Great Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulted with [[Mountain man|mountain men]] and trappers, and met with Father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]], a [[Jesuit]] missionary familiar with the region. Young also organized a vanguard company to break trail to the [[Rocky Mountains]], evaluate trail conditions, find sources of water, and select a central gathering point in the Great Basin. A new route on the north side of the [[Platte River|Platte]] and [[North Platte River|North Platte]] rivers was chosen to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access, and campsites with travelers using the established [[Oregon Trail]] on the river's south side.\n\nThe Quincy Convention of October 1845 passed resolutions demanding that the Latter-day Saints withdraw from Nauvoo by May 1846. A few days later, the Carthage Convention called for establishment of a militia that would force them out if they failed to meet the May deadline.<ref>{{harvp|Bennett|1997|p=6}}</ref> To try to meet this deadline and to get an early start on the trek to the Great Basin, the Latter-day Saints began leaving Nauvoo in February 1846.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref>\n\n=== Trek of 1846 ===\n[[File:Dateland-Mormon Battalion Trail-1846.jpg|thumb|250px|Mormon Battalion Trail Marker in Oatman Flats, Dateland, Arizona]] \nThe departure from Nauvoo began on February 4, 1846, under the leadership of Brigham Young. This early departure exposed them to the elements in the worst of winter. After crossing the [[Mississippi River]], the journey across [[Iowa Territory]] followed primitive territorial roads and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] trails.\n\nYoung originally planned to lead an express company of about 300 men to the Great Basin during the summer of 1846. He believed they could cross Iowa and reach the [[Missouri River]] in four to six weeks. However, the actual trip across Iowa was slowed by rain, mud, swollen rivers, and poor preparation, and it required 16 weeks \u2013 nearly three times longer than planned.\n\nHeavy rains turned the rolling plains of southern Iowa into a quagmire of axle-deep mud. Furthermore, few people carried adequate provisions for the trip. The weather, general unpreparedness, and lack of experience in moving such a large group of people all contributed to the difficulties they endured.\n\nThe initial party reached the Missouri River on June 14. It was apparent that the Latter-day Saints could not make it to the Great Basin that season and would have to winter on the Missouri River.<ref>{{harvp|Bennett|1997|p=31\u201340}}</ref>\n\nSome of the emigrants established a settlement called [[Council Bluffs, Iowa|Kanesville]] (present-day Council Bluffs) on the Iowa side of the river. Others moved across the river into the area of present-day [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and built a camp called [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Winter Quarters]].<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=234\u2013238, 247\u2013248}}</ref>\n\n=== The Vanguard Company of 1847 ===\n\n[[File:Wayside on Mormon Trail Nebraska.JPG|thumb|right|Historic Information along the National Historic Trail]]\nIn April 1847, chosen members of the vanguard company gathered, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into 14 military companies. A militia and night guard were formed. The company consisted of 143 men, including three black people and eight members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve]], three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, draft animals, and livestock, and carried enough supplies to provision the group for one year. On April 5, the [[wagon train]] moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin.<ref name=\"Clayton\">{{Cite book |last= Clayton |first= William |authorlink= William Clayton (Mormon) |title= William Clayton's   Journal |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= Deseret News |year= 1921 |url= https://archive.org/details/williamclaytonsj00clay }}</ref>\n\nThe journey from [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Winter Quarters]] to [[Fort Laramie]] took six weeks; the company arrived at the fort on June 1. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the [[Mormon Battalion]], who had been excused due to illness and sent to winter in [[Pueblo, Colorado]], and a group of Church members from Mississippi. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at [[Fort Bridger]].<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|p=244}}</ref>\n\nYoung met [[mountain man]] [[Jim Bridger]] on June 28. They discussed routes into the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by 12 more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref name=\"Clayton\"/>\n\nNow facing a more rugged and hazardous trek, Young chose to follow the trail used by the [[Donner Party|Donner\u2013Reed party]] on their journey to California the previous year. As the vanguard company traveled through the rugged mountains, they divided into three sections. Young and several other members of the party suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a \"mountain fever\" induced by wood ticks. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther ahead on the designated route.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/>\n\n===Arrival and settlement===\nScouts [[Erastus Snow]] and [[Orson Pratt]] entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 21. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted. On July 24, Young first saw the valley from a \"sick\" wagon driven by his friend [[Wilford Woodruff]]. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared, \"This is the right place, drive on.\"<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=246\u2013247}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1847, Young and selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters to organize the companies scheduled for following years. By December 1847, more than 2,000 Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley, then in [[Mexico|Mexican]] territory.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|p=247}}</ref>\n\nFarming the uncultivated land was initially difficult, as the shares broke when they tried to plow the dry ground. Therefore, an [[irrigation]] system was designed and the land was flooded before plowing, and the resulting system provided supplemental moisture during the year.\n\n[[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]] was laid out and designated as Church headquarters. Hard work produced a prosperous community. In their new settlement, entertainment was also important, and the first public building was a theater.\n\nIt did not take long, however, until the United States caught up with them, and in 1848, after the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]], the land in which they settled became part of the United States.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Fisher | first=Albert L. | contribution=Physical Geography of Utah | contribution-url=http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/g/GEOGRAPHY.html | editor-last=Powell | editor-first=Allan Kent | title=Utah History Encyclopedia | year=1994}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing migration===\n[[File:1859 nebraska.jpg|thumb|1859 map of route from Sioux City, Iowa, through Nebraska, to gold fields of Wyoming, following old Mormon trails.]]\nEach year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \"companies\", each company bearing the name of its leader and subdivided into groups of 10 and 50. The Saints traveled the trail broken by the vanguard company, splitting the journey into two sections. The first segment began in Nauvoo and ended in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]], near modern-day [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The second half of the journey took the Saints through the area that later became [[Nebraska]] and [[Wyoming]], before finishing their journey in the Salt Lake Valley in present-day [[Utah]]. The earlier groups used [[covered wagon]]s pulled by oxen to carry their supplies across the country. Some later companies used handcarts and traveled by foot.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/>\n\nBy 1849, many of the Latter-day Saints who remained in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford the costs of the wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the [[Perpetual Emigration Fund]], to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=279\u2013287}}</ref>\n\n=== Handcarts: 1856\u201360 ===\n{{Main|Mormon handcart pioneers}}\nIn 1856, the church inaugurated a system of [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcart companies]] in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different [[Mormon handcart pioneers|companies]], made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While not the first to use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=29\u201334, 193\u2013194}}</ref>\n\nThe handcarts were modeled after carts used by [[street sweeper]]s and were made almost entirely of wood. They were generally six to seven feet (183 to 213&nbsp;cm) long, wide enough to span a narrow wagon track, and could be alternately pushed or pulled. The small boxes affixed to the carts were three to four feet (91 to 122&nbsp;cm) long and eight inches (20&nbsp;cm) high. They could carry about 500 pounds (227&nbsp;kg), most of this weight consisting of trail provisions and a few personal possessions.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=53\u201355}}</ref>\n\nAll but two of the handcart companies successfully completed the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the [[Mormon handcart pioneers|Willie and Martin Companies]], respectively, had serious problems. The companies left [[Iowa City, Iowa]], in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day [[Casper, Wyoming]], and continued to cope with deep snow and storms for the remainder of the journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992}}</ref>\n\nThe handcart companies continued with more success until 1860, and traditional ox-and-wagon companies also continued for those who could afford the higher cost. After 1860, the church began sending wagon companies east each spring, to return to Utah in the summer with the emigrating Latter-day Saints. Finally, with the completion of the [[Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, future emigrants were able to travel by rail, and the era of the Mormon pioneer trail came to an end.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=191\u2013192}}</ref>\n\n==Sites along the trail==\n[[File:Mormon Trail 3.png|right|thumb|Map of Mormon Trail]]\n[[File:TEMPLE DE NAUVOO.jpg|thumb|[[Daguerreotype]] of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]] as it appeared at the time of the [[Mormon]] exodus.]]\nThe following are major points along the trail at which the early Mormon pioneers stopped, established temporary camps, or used as landmarks and meeting places. The sites are categorized by their location in respect to modern-day US states.\n\n===Illinois===\n* '''[[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]''' \u2013 Nauvoo was the starting point for the Mormon trail and the early home base for LDS migrants. They left because they were treated poorly by those who lived there. Brigham Young took a group of people through Illinois to Utah, not part of the United States\n\n===Iowa===\n*'''Sugar Creek''' ({{convert|7|mi|0}} west of Nauvoo) \u2013 Beginning with their first ferry crossing of the Mississippi River on February 4, 1846, months before many of them were ready, the Latter-day Saints started gathering at the frozen banks of Sugar Creek. More refugees continued to cross into Iowa for a number of months many taking advantage of the freezing of the Mississippi river a few weeks later. The poorly prepared emigrants suffered from severe winter weather while camped there. Sugar Creek was the staging area for the westward trek across Iowa. Ultimately about 2,500 refugees and 500 wagons started west on March 1, 1846. Several thousand more would follow on later as they sold their property for what they could get and continued to leave [[Nauvoo, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Kimball_14\">{{harvp|Kimball|1979|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Sugar Creek |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n*'''Richardson's Point''' ({{convert|35|mi|0}} west) \u2013 The emigrants made their way past Croton and [[Farmington, Iowa|Farmington]] to ford the [[Des Moines River]] at [[Bonaparte, Iowa|Bonaparte]]. In early March 1846 the party was halted for 10 days by heavy rain at a wooded area known as Richardson's Point. Some of the first deaths of the pioneers occurred at this location.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Richardson's Point |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n*'''Chariton River Crossing''' ({{convert|80|mi|0}} west) \u2013 The trail continues past the modern towns of Troy, [[Drakesville, Iowa|Drakesville]], and West Grove to reach the Chariton River. At this crossing, on March 27, Young organized the lead group of the migration, forming three camps of 100 families, each led by a captain. This military-style organization would be used for all subsequent Mormon emigrant companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Chariton River Crossing |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n*'''Locust Creek''' ({{convert|103|mi|0}} west) \u2013 The trail proceeds past [[Cincinnati, Iowa|Cincinnati]] to Locust Creek.

By 1852 they had moved on to Utah.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref name=\"Kimball_14\"/>\n*'''[[Mount Pisgah (Iowa)|Mount Pisgah]]''' ({{convert|153|mi|0}} west) \u2013 As they entered [[Potawatomi]] territory, the emigrants established another semi-permanent settlement that they named Mount Pisgah. Several thousand acres were cultivated and a settlement of about 700 Latter-day Saints thrived there from 1846 to 1852. Now the site is marked by a {{convert|9|acre|m2|adj=on}} park, which contains exhibits, historical markers, and a reconstructed log cabin. However, little remains from the 19th century except a cemetery memorializing the 300 to 800 emigrants who died there.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Kimball|1979|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n*'''[[Nishnabotna River|Nishnabotna River Crossing]]''' ({{convert|232|mi|0}} west) \u2013 From Mount Pisgah the trail proceeds past the modern towns of [[Orient, Iowa|Orient]], [[Bridgewater, Iowa|Bridgewater]], [[Massena, Iowa|Massena]] and [[Lewis, Iowa|Lewis]].

The emigrants renamed the settlement as ''Kanesville,'' honoring [[Thomas L. Kane]], a non-LDS attorney who was politically well connected and used his influence to assist the Latter-day Saints. From 1846 to 1852, it was an important LDS settlement and the outfitting point for companies traveling to present-day Utah. [[Orson Hyde]], an [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]] and ecclesiastical leader of the settlement, published a newspaper called the ''Frontier Guardian.'' In 1852 the major LDS settlements at Kanesville, Mount Pisgah, and Garden Grove were closed as the settlers moved on to Utah. After 1852, however, the Church continued to outfit and supply emigrant companies (mostly LDS converts coming from the [[British Isles]] and mainland [[Europe]]) at this community, now renamed ''Council Bluffs,'' until the mid-1860s, when the terminus of the First Transcontinental Railroad was extended to the west.<ref name=\"Hartley\"/><ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=247\u2013248}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Council Bluffs |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n\n===Nebraska===\n*'''[[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]]''' ({{convert|266|mi|0}} west)  \u2013 Although Brigham Young had originally planned to travel all the way to the Salt Lake Valley in 1846, the emigrants' lack of preparation had become apparent during their difficult crossing of Iowa. Furthermore, the departure of the Mormon Battalion left the emigrants short on manpower. Young decided to settle for the winter along the Missouri River. The emigrants were located on both sides of the river, but their settlement at Winter Quarters on the west side was the largest. There they built 700 dwellings where an estimated 3,500 Latter-day Saints spent the winter of 1846\u201347; many would also reside there during the winter of 1847\u201348. Conditions such as scurvy, consumption, chills and fever were common; the settlement recorded 359 deaths between September 1846 and May 1848. However, while at Winter Quarters the LDS emigrants were able to save or trade for the equipment and supplies that they would need to continue the westward trek. The settlement was later renamed [[Florence, Nebraska|Florence]] and is now located in [[North Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]].<ref>{{harvp|Allen|Leonard|1976|pp=234\u2013238}}</ref>\n*'''[[Elkhorn River]]''' ({{convert|293|mi|0}} west)\n*'''[[Platte River]]''' ({{convert|305|mi|0}} west) \u2013 All emigrants leaving Missouri traveled along the [[Great Platte River Road]] for hundreds of miles. There was a prevailing opinion that the North side of the river was healthier, so most Latter-day Saints generally stuck to that side, which also separated them from unpleasant encounters with potential former enemies, like emigrants from Missouri or Illinois. In 1849, 1850 & 1852, traffic was so heavy along the Platte that virtually all feed was stripped from both sides of the river. The lack of food and the threat of disease made the journey along the Platte a deadly gamble.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Platte River |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-22}}</ref>\n*'''[[Loup River|Loup Fork]]''' ({{convert|352|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Crossing the Loup Fork was, like the Elkhorn, one of the early and very difficult crossings during the trek west from Council Bluffs.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Loup Fork |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>\n*'''[[Fort Kearny]]''' ({{convert|469|mi|0}} west) \u2013 This fort, named after [[Stephen Watts Kearny]], was established in June 1848. Another fort named after Kearny was established in May 1846, but was abandoned in May 1848. Due to this, the second Fort Kearny is sometimes called New Fort Kearny. The site for the fort was purchased from the Pawnee Indians for $2,000 in goods.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Fort Kearny |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-24}}</ref>\n*'''Confluence Point''' ({{convert|563|mi|0}} west) \u2013 On May 11, 1847, three-fourths of a mile north of the confluence of the North and South Platte Rivers, a \"roadometer\" was attached to [[Heber C. Kimball]]'s wagon driven by Philo Johnson. Although they did not invent the device, the measurements of the version they used were accurate enough to be used by William Clayton in his famous ''Latter-day Saints' Emigrants' Guide''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Confluence Point |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-29}}</ref>\n*'''Ash Hollow''' ({{convert|646|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Many passing diarists noted the beauty of Ash Hollow, although this was ruined by thousands of passing emigrants. The [[Sioux Indians]] were often on location and were at the site and General [[William S. Harney]]'s troops won a battle over the Sioux there in September 1855 \u2013 the Battle of Ash Hollow. The site is also the burial ground of many who died of cholera during the gold rush years.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Ash Hollow |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>\n*'''[[Chimney Rock National Historical Site|Chimney Rock]]''' ({{convert|718|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Chimney Rock is perhaps the most significant landmark on the Mormon Trail. Emigrants commented in their diaries that the landmark appeared closer than it actually was, and many sketched or painted it in their journals and carved their names into it.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Chimney Rock |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>\n*'''[[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]]''' ({{convert|738|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Hiram Scott was a Rocky Mountain Fur Company trapper abandoned on the bluff that now bears his name by his companions when he became ill. Accounts of his death are noted by almost all those who kept journals that traveled on the north side of the Platte. The grave of [[Rebecca Winters (pioneer)|Rebecca Winters]], a Latter-day Saint mother who fell victim to cholera in 1852, is also located near this site, although it has since been moved and rededicated.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Scotts Bluff |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-30}}</ref>\n\n===Wyoming===\n[[File:IndependenceRock2.jpg|thumb|right|Independence Rock, a site along the Mormon Trail.]]\n*'''[[Fort Laramie]]''' ({{convert|788|mi|0}} west) \u2013 This old trading and military post served as a place for the emigrants to rest and restock provisions. The 1856 [[Mormon handcart pioneers|Willie Handcart Company]] was unable to obtain provisions at Fort Laramie, contributing to their subsequent tragedy when they ran out of food while encountering blizzard conditions along the Sweetwater River.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|p=101}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Fort Laramie |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n*'''Upper Platte/Mormon Ferry''' ({{convert|914|mi|0}} west) \u2013 The last crossing of the Platte River took place near modern [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]]. For several years  the Latter-day Saints operated a commercial ferry at the site, earning revenue from the Oregon- and California-bound emigrants. The ferry was discontinued in 1853 after a competing toll bridge was constructed. On October 19, 1856, the [[Mormon handcart pioneers|Martin Handcart Company]] forded the freezing river in mid-October, leading to exposure that would prove fatal to many members of the company.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=108\u2013109}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Upper Platte (Mormon) Ferry |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n*'''Red Butte''' ({{convert|940|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Red Butte was the most tragic site of the Mormon Trail. After crossing the Platte River, the Martin Handcart Company camped near Red Butte as heavy snow fell. Snow continued to fall for three days, and the company came to a halt as many emigrants died. For nine days the company remained there, while 56 persons died from cold or disease. Finally, on October 28, an advance team of three men from the Utah rescue party reached them. The rescuers encouraged them that help was on the way and urged the company to start moving on.<ref>{{harvp|Hafen|Hafen|1992|pp=110\u2013115}}</ref>\n*'''[[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]]''' ({{convert|964|mi|0}} west) \u2013 From the last crossing of the Platte, the trail heads directly southwest toward Independence Rock, where it meets and follows the Sweetwater River to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]]. To shorten the journey by avoiding the twists and turns of the river, the trail includes nine river crossings.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Sweetwater River |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/9thcrossing.htm|title=Ninth Crossing of the Sweetwater (Burnt Ranch)|publisher=Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n*'''[[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]]''' ({{convert|965|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Independence Rock was one of the trail's best known and most anticipated landmarks. Many emigrants carved their names on the rock; many of these carvings are still visible today. The emigrants sometimes also celebrated their arrival at this landmark with a dance.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Independence Rock |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2009-06-18}}</ref>\n[[File:DevilsGate1.JPG|thumb|left|Devil's Gate, a gorge on the Sweetwater River.]]\n*'''[[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]]''' ({{convert|970|mi|0}} west) \u2013 Devil's Gate was a narrow gorge cut through the rocks by the Sweetwater River. A small fort was located at Devil's Gate, which was unoccupied in 1856 when the Martin Handcart Company was rescued. The rescuers unloaded unnecessary equipment from the wagons so the weaker handcart emigrants could ride. A group of 19 men, led by [[Daniel Webster Jones (Mormon)|Daniel W.

At the same time, the members of the Willie Company reached the end of their supplies of flour. A small advance team from the rescue party found their camp and gave them a small amount of flour, but then pushed on to the east to try to locate the Martin Company. Captain James Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead through the snow to find the main rescue party and inform them of the Willie Company's peril. On October 23, with the help of the rescue party, the Willie Company pushed ahead through the biting wind and snow up Rocky Ridge, a rough {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} section of the trail that ascends to a ridge in order to bypass a section of the Sweetwater River valley that is impassable.<ref>{{harvp|Bartholomew|Arrington|1981|pp=15\u201318}}</ref>\n*'''Rock Creek''' ({{convert|1048|mi|0}} west) \u2013 After their grueling 18-hour trek up Rocky Ridge, the Willie Handcart Company camped at the crossing of Rock Creek.

This was the site where the paths of the Oregon Trail, the [[California Trail]], and the Mormon Trail separated; the three trails ran in parallel from Missouri River to Fort Bridger. In 1855, the LDS Church bought the fort from Jim Bridger and Louis Vazquez for $8,000. During the [[Utah War]] in 1857, the Utah militia burned down the fort so that it would not fall into the hands of the advancing U.S. Army under General [[Albert Sidney Johnston|A.S.

The canyon became known as Parley's Canyon and the road he built as the \"Golden Pass Road,\" due to the large number of [[gold miner]]s who used it on their way to [[California]]. A cutoff was constructed through Silver Creek Canyon by 1862, diverting much of the traffic on what is today the route of [[Interstate 80|I-80]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Pioneer Story / Trail Location / Golden Pass Road |publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/pioneer-trek |accessdate=2006-05-31}}</ref>\n*'''[[Emigration Canyon]]''' (Donner Hill) ({{convert|1283|mi|0}} west) \u2013 About a year before the Latter-day Saint emigrants, the [[Donner Party|Reed\u2013Donner wagon train]] carved the first road through the final geographic obstacle between Big Mountain and the Salt Lake Valley. About halfway through, the group changed course and went up and around the final constriction near the valley's mouth. The resulting exhaustingly brutal climb over rock and sage most likely contributed to the historic tragedy that befell the travelers three months and {{convert|600|mi|km}} to the west.

Settlement outside the Salt Lake Valley began as early as 1848, with a number of communities planted in the Weber valley to the north. Additional townsites were carefully chosen, with settlements placed near canyon mouths with access to dependable streams and stands of timber.

NJG&nbsp;1 was formed on 22 June 1940 in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\nBy the end of the war it was the most successful night fighter unit and had claimed some 2,311 victories by day and night, for some 676 aircrew killed in action.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}}\n\n== Background==\n[[Night fighter]] operations did not feature in [[Wehrmacht]] [[war games]] during 1935 and 1936. Little of the Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 concerned night fighting save for Section 253, which called for night fighting zones to be established, so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each other. [[Search light]]s were to be utilised in support of the pilots. Section 253 concluded that any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] ordered experimenting with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10-16}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15-16}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} Kammhuber established the [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI ''Gruppe'' was formed on 22 June 1940 from elements of I./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1|''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 1]] (ZG&nbsp;1) and IV./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26|''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 26]] (ZG&nbsp;26).  II. ''Gruppe'' was formed from IV./(N) ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] on 1 July 1940, although the ''Gruppe'' was redesignated III./NJG&nbsp;1. The second formaction occurred the same date, 1 July, from renaming Z./[[Kampfgeschwader 30|''Kampfgeschwader'' 30]] (''Zerst\u00f6rer''/KG&nbsp;30). On 7 September 1940 this ''Gruppe'' were redesignated as I./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2|''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' 2]] (NJG&nbsp;2), though it received personnel from I./ZG&nbsp;26. III. ''Gruppe'' was raised on 1 July also, from II./NJG&nbsp;1. IV./NJG&nbsp;1 was raised on 1 October 1942 from elements of II./NJG&nbsp;2.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] became the first [[Geschwaderkommodore]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}} ''[[Hauptmann]]'' [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], took command of I./NJG&nbsp;1, ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' [[Walter Ehle]], became the first permanent commander of II./NJG&nbsp;1, ''Hauptmann'' von Bothmer and ''Major'' [[Helmut Lent]] took command of III. and IV./NJG&nbsp;1 respectively.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nI./NJG&nbsp;1 set up base at [[Venlo Airfield]], where to remained from 18 March 1941 to 5 September 1944. 18,000 workers worked on the site which measured 1,180 [[hectares]]. The two take-off runways were {{convert|1,450|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, and a third {{convert|1,200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. 2,000 lamps were used for lighting and {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=off}} of roads led to workshops, command posts, and accommodation.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=29}} The formation of the night fighter wings brought together different kinds of pilots with different preferences. The crews of II./NJG&nbsp;1, which were formed from Z/KG&nbsp;30, preferred the [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Dornier Do 217]], which were regarded by Bf 110 pilots as \"lame ducks\" unsuitable for the role. These pilots preferred other qualities not prevalent in Zerstorer aircraft; spacious cockpits, a third man to act as lookout, longer endurance, auto-pilot, and more powerful armament. These pilots, in some cases, were advanced in years for a military aviator, often they were former [[Lufthansa]] pilots. These men did not adapt easily to the concept of controlled night fighting.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}} [[Werner Baake]] and [[Rudolf Schoenert]] were an examples of the ex-Lufhansa pilots that joined the Luftwaffe in 1941.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=125}}\n\n==World War II==\nIn the autumn, 1940 the Luftwaffe began long-range intruder operations (''Fernnachtjagd'') to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} The Luftwaffe signalling service were able to determine when Bomber Command operations were going to begin. Night fighters were ordered to patrol the German coast, fly to known Bomber Command bases and follow the bombers back to [[England]] along known routes.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} I./NJG&nbsp;2 became the sole intruder unit for this type of operation, but the results were expensive. The wing lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF claimed shot down.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} Over Europe, the German defences were limited in 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precise [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvanage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], and could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32-33}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf&nbsp;110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over {{convert|5,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. German pilots would have to detect the bomber early in order to be able to dive from much greater heights.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=32}} The introduction of newer radar variants, such as the [[Freya radar]], eventually improved the range and identification problems prevelant in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=33\u201354}}\n\nIn mid-1940, the [[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Stab]]/NJG&nbsp;1 was based at D\u00fcsseldorf and [[Deelen]] under Falck and equipped with three Bf&nbsp;110Bs. At B\u00f6nninghardt, I./NJG&nbsp;1 mustered 34 Bf&nbsp;110Cs and Ds with 22 operational. At D\u00fcsseldorf, II./NJG&nbsp;1 could field 11 Ju&nbsp;88Cs, four operational, and 10 Do&nbsp;17Zs, nine operational. At [[Cologne]], III/NJG&nbsp;1 still operated the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]; 13 Bf&nbsp;109Cs, four operational, three Bf 109Ds and one combat ready, 17 Bf 109Es were present with all but one operational.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=295}} On the night of 19/20 July, [[Werner Streib]], 2./NJG&nbsp;1, claimed one of the first aerial victories for NJG&nbsp;1; a [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] shot down at 02:15 near [[Saerbeck]]. Streib would become ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' II./NJG&nbsp;1 only two months later.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=10}} Only 42 British bombers were claimed shot down in 1940 by German night fighters.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}} Streib claimed 22 aerial victories in 1941, making him the most successful night fighter pilot of the year. [[Paul Gildner]] claimed 21, and Lent claimed 20, making him the third highest claimant in the Luftwaffe that year.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], who spent several days commanding I./NJG&nbsp;1 in 1940 during its formation, claimed 13.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226, 240}} At the end of 1941 [[Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer]] joined the wing. Schnaufer would become the most successful night fighter pilot in history, with 121 claims.{{sfn|Spick|1996|pp=3\u20134}} \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-659-6436-12, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bf 110G night fighter with radar. The 110 was the mainstay of NJG 1]]\nIn mid-1941, NJG&nbsp;1 began experimenting with [[Lichtenstein radar]], which had become operational.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] shot down six RAF bombers while flying a radar-installed [[Dornier Do 215]]B-5 between 10 August and 30 September 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=40}} The only Lichtenstein radar in service then became unserviceable for the next successes were not recorded until June 1942.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Lichtenstein was in shot supply until mid-1943, at which time 80 percent of night fighters had it. I./NJG&nbsp;1 and II./NJG&nbsp;2 were given priority for it because they shielded the approaches to the Ruhr.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=252}} The first Ju&nbsp;88C fighters, equipped with radar were delivered to II./NJG&nbsp;1 at [[Leeuwarden]] in February 1942. Only four sets arived and it took several weeks for them to become operational. The crews soon came to appreciate the device and were eager to secure it for their aircraft.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}} Other platforms were tested in NJG&nbsp;1 at this time. In March 1942 the [[Dornier Do 217]] J was also trialed in service with NJG&nbsp;1; however the lack of performance made the type unpopular with crews.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=45\u201346}}\n\nBecker developed his own tactics for attacking a bomber. He stalked the aircraft from the stern, just below the height shown on the radar. After sighting the bomber, he dived and accelerated to avoid being spotted by the tail gunner. Once underneath the enemy, Becker reduced the throttle and matched the speed of the unsuspecting pilot. Becker then climbed steadily to {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} from below the target before he pulled up and opened fire. Because the Do&nbsp;215 lost speed the bomber flew ahead and the through the stream of shells. With this method, the gun sight was rarely needed. These tactics were adopted by the night fighter force.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=41}}\n\nIn February 1942, [[Air Marshall]] [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Bomber Command. Harris became the driving force behind producing a powerful [[heavy bomber]] command to carry out his [[area bombing]] operations. The attacks on [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|L\u00fcbeck in March]] and [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne in May]] 1942 began the new phase in the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} Over L\u00fcbeck, NJG&nbsp;1 claimed only one bomber from seven claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} NJG&nbsp;1 claimed 21 bombers during the latter attack on Cologne on 30/31 May 1942 from the 32 claimed by German night fighter units.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} 41 bombers were lost.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=127}} One of the wing's first losses was [[Helmut Woltersdorf]], killed in June 1942 against an RAF night fighter.{{sfn|Hinchliffe|1999|p=xi}}\n\nBomber Command began routine 1,000-bomber raids over Germany from 30 May to 17 August 1942 using the [[bomber stream]] to swamp Kammhuber's defences. From August 1942, Bomber Command began introducing new navigation aids for its air fleets.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|pp=123\u2013178}} On 31 December 1942, Bomber Command utilised [[Pathfinder (RAF)|pathfinder]] [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s and Lancasters equipped with [[Oboe (navigation)|OBOE]] on a test raid to Dusseldorf.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=115}} Knacke made the last NJG&nbsp;1 claim of the year against the latter type.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=63}} 1942 proved to be successful in a tactical sense for German night fighters. Lent led the claims for the year with 42, [[Reinhold Knacke]] claimed 40, as did Becker while Gildner claimed 38.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} On the night of the 16/17 September 1942 Knacke became the first night fighter to claim [[ace in a day]] status when he claimed five bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=241}} In February 1943, several of the major \"experts\" were killed. Knacke was killed on day three.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|pp=78-79}} Becker was killed in action on a rare daylight interception against the [[United States Army Air Force]] (USAAF) [[Eighth Air Force]].{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=77}} Becker followed Gildner, killed two days before him.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|pp=78-79}}{{sfn|Hooton|1999|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\n===Battle of the Ruhr,  Hamburg and Peenem\u00fcnde===\nIn March 1943, Harris began his first concerted [[military campaign]] against a specific objective, known as the [[Battle of the Ruhr]]. Harris had 53 squadrons for the battle, and his pathfinders were now operating the [[H2S (radar)|H2S ground-mapping radar]]. The Air Marshal felt he had sufficient resources for a long offensive against the German industrial region.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=69}} On 5 March 1943, Falck commanded the command ''staffel'' from Deelen, Streib commanded I ''Gruppe'' from Venlo, Thimmig commanded III ''Gruppe'' from [[Leeuwarden]] ,and Lent IV ''Gruppe'' from [[Twente]]; all operated the Bf 110. II ''Gruppe'' under Ehler at [[Sint-Truiden]] operated the Bf 110 and Do 217.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=69}}\n[[File:The German Air Force in the Second World War HU108216.jpg|thumb|left|Do 217J night fighter. A handful saw service with NJG 1]]\nOn the first night, 5/6 March 1943, NJG&nbsp;1 claimed 10 bombers destroyed. Among the claimants were fighter pilots [[Manfred Meurer]], [[Herbert L\u00fctje]], [[Heinz Vinke]] and Lent all claimed. On 12/13 March NJG&nbsp;1 claimed 13, and repeated this again on 29/30 March. On 3/4 April the wing claimed 17. The success was not repeated until 27/28 April when its pilots submitted 10 claims.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=70-73, 76-77}} On 4/5 May NJG&nbsp;1 claimed 24 bombers destroyed and was the only Luftwaffe unit to report any successes that night. Among the pilots was [[Hans-Dieter Frank]] who would claim 55 aerial victories and briefly command I./NJG&nbsp;1 before his death in a collision with a colleague while flying a [[Heinkel He 219]]. The collision may have been caused by an attack on his fighter by [[Wing commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Bob Braham]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=76-77}} On 12/13 May the wing claimed 25, and on 13/14 May the pilots claimed another 26.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=79-80}} On 23/24 May a further 23 were claimed.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The attacks on Dortmund that night cost Bomber Command 38 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}} Over the next six days 58 bombers were claimed by the night of the 30/31 May.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=81-83}} The operation against [[Wuppertal]] on 29/30 May cost the British 33 aircraft.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=163}} 211 RAF bombers were claimed by NJG&nbsp;1 in June 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=84-91}} Total British losses were 277 for the month to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} During the campaign NJG&nbsp;1 was able to engage Bomber Command consistently. On one night the wing scrambled 50 night fighters, only one-sixth of the Luftwaffe force. Committal of further crews was not possible in Kammhuber's system which required rigid allocation of units to specific points on the line.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=46}} The Nazi [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], wrote in his diary on 14 May 1943 of German defences; \"during the night there was another exceptionally heavy raid on [[Duisburg]]....An unspeakable sorrow and great distress has come to the sorely tired city. Our technical development as regards [[submarine]] missions and air warfare is far inferior to that of the [[England|English]] and [[United States|American]]s. During the past five months the enemy has had the upper hand, almost everywhere he is defeating us in the air.\"{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=67}} \n\nBy the time the Ruhr campaign ended Bomber Command had suffered heavy losses to German night fighters and anti-aircraft defences. 1,099 were lost to all causes.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=141}} The Luftwaffe's defences were unable to prevent Bomber Command from severely disrupting German production. Steel production fell by 200,000 tons and the armaments industry was facing a steel shortfall of 400,000 tons.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} After doubling production in 1942, production of steel increased only by 20 percent in 1943. [[Adolf Hitler]] and his armaments minister [[Albert Speer]] were forced to cut planned increases in production. This disruption caused the ''zulieferungskrise'' (sub-components crisis). The increase of aircraft production for the Luftwaffe also came to an abrupt halt. Monthly production failed to increase between July 1943 and March 1944. [[Adam Tooze]] concludes; \"Bomber Command had stopped Speer's armaments miracle in its tracks.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} Production of [[locomotive]]s halted after March 1943 in the Ruhr along with ammunition fuses.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=134\u2013135}} Over 100,000 people were [[dehoused]] in [[Essen]], contributing to the inability to continue production at the [[Krupp]] plant.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=135}}\n\nLuftwaffe night pilots experienced the presence of long-range RAF night fighting aircraft for the first time over Germany. Radar-installed [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s and [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s provided indirect [[fighter escort]] to Bomber Command over the Ruhr. These crews came from [[Fighter Command]], and termed their operations as \"flower\" [[sortie]]s. These tactics required RAF pilots to fly to known German night fighter airfields and patrol them in an effort to destroy the Luftwaffe interceptors as they got airborne or landed. These operations were successful and accounted for German aircraft losses in June.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=90-94}} On 14 and 25 June 1943, NJG&nbsp;1 lost one and two Bf&nbsp;110s to RAF night fighters.{{sfn|Balss|1997|pp=157\u2013158}}{{cn|reason=no such book|date=April 2020}} In August 1943, Bomber Command's [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] against [[Peenem\u00fcnde]].

The objective was to disrupt or end [[U-boat]] production in the port city. The introduction of \"[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]\" blew a hole in German radar coverage and the [[bomber stream]]s, aided by OBOE and H2S radar were able to penetrate the defences to devastate the centre of the city. The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) system of radar-controlled night fighters slipping into the bomber stream and then using its own radar to pick out and engage individual bombers had gone. The effects of the raid, and the realisation German radar was temporarily blinded, led to the widespread use of the Wild Boar tactics over the summer, 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=95}} 791 bombers hit the city. German air defences accounted for only 1.5 percent of the attacking force. The Nazi leadership was shaken, and Kammhuber, who resisted calls to abandon the advanced ''Himmelbett'' system, was compelled to find technical solutions to the jamming of Freya, Liechtenstein and W\u00fcrzburg radars. Kammhuber regarded the Wild Boar solution as an emergency measure only.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=94-96}} NJG&nbsp;1 claimed only three from a total of 12 claimed by night fighter pilots in defence of the city\u2014[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 3|''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' 3]] claimed the rest.

[[Viktor von Lo\u00dfberg]]'s idea was for night fighters equipped with experimental SN-2 radar to cooperate with Y-control systems and \"sluice\" them into the bomber stream. Once there, the night fighters were ordered to transmit direction-finding signals to attract other night fighters. While semi-unguided, the radar operators and night fighter command retained some control over operations with success in August; amounting to 250 aircraft claimed shot down on all fronts. The success was offset by losses of 40 killed in the night fighter arm, with only 28 replacements in August. 61 twin-engine night fighters were lost during the month, but only 59 were replaced.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=101\u2013104, 106}} As one German historian noted, the advent of the frequent Mosquito intruder operations from October \"no airfield in Central Germany was safe.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=143}} NJG&nbsp;1 were engaged in daylight operations against the [[United States Army Air Force]] in August.

By June 1944, I ''Gruppe'' had 20 He&nbsp;219s, which proved expensive in time and effort; some 90,000 man-hours per aircraft in comparison to 30,000 on the Ju&nbsp;88C and G. A handful were delivered to II./NJG&nbsp;1.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=136, 245}} At the start of the battle, NJG&nbsp;1 was mostly still a Bf&nbsp;110 unit. Streib commanded Stab/NJG&nbsp;1 and the wing from Deelen. Meurer commanded I./NJG&nbsp;1 at Venlo which operated the Bf&nbsp;110 and He&nbsp;219. II.

The [[Schr\u00e4ge Musik]], pioneered in NJG&nbsp;2, was now in use in NJG&nbsp;1 during 1943 and 1944. Schnaufer, the leading night fighter in history, estimated he claimed 20 to 30 bombers using the upward firing cannon(s).{{sfn|Price|1973|p=203}} According to Schnaufer, many of the less experienced crew preferred the weapon system to the conventional front-pointing guns.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=203}} The method of attack was still dangerous, for British bombers carried heavy loads of fuel and explosives. A night fighter pilot could approach the bomber from below and fire into the fuel tanks and engines before making a violent evasive dive away from danger. The approach was possible as British bombers did not carry a [[ball turret]].{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=214}}\n\n1943 ended with pilots from NJG&nbsp;1 leading the claim charts. Lent was acknowledged to have 76 and led the Luftwaffe in this field. Streib's total stood at 63, Meurer 62 at his death, Schoenert 56, the deceased Frank, 55, the late Geiger 53, Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld 51, Becker, Gildner and Knacker\u2014all of whom had 44\u2014were killed in the year. Schnaufer and Vinke had claimed 42 and 37 respectively. [[Walter Ehle]], killed on 18 November became the earliest casualty of the battle over Berlin.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} At this time, German night fighters had abandoned the old wild boar operations along with the rigid beacon-based ''Himmelbett'' system for a simple practice of using their own radar to detect bombers once ground controllers led them to the bomber stream. When there, pilots were expected to fight until fuel or ammunition was expended. The tame boar method predominated in what was to become a successful period for the night fighter force.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=127}} \n\nIn the midst of the battle, I./NJG&nbsp;1 lost group commander Meurer\u2014with 65 claims\u2014the third highest scoring night fighter of the war at the time in January 1944. He utilised the Schr\u00e4ge Musik weapon too close to a British bomber which exploded and took Meurer with it.{{sfn|Price|1973|p=110}} In March 1944 another fighter leader, Egmont Prinz zur Lippe-Wei\u00dfenfeld was killed on day 12.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=236}} During the following weeks Bomber Command selected southwest Germany as its main area of operations, allowing for their return over neutral [[Switzerland]]. The Luftwaffe responded by transferring II. and III./NJG&nbsp;1 to France. III./NJG&nbsp;1 operated from [[Laon]] from 20 April. Night fighter operations over France proved costly for the Luftwaffe. Bomber Command flew on moonlit nights and were provided with strong Mosquito fighter support. Luftwaffe pilots hardly managed to engage the bomber streams.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=155, 159}}\n\nOn 23/24 March 1944, Harris authorised a sixteenth, and final attack upon Berlin nearly five weeks after the last; having postponed it from 21 March. 811 bombers set out, with 147 providing diversion raids to [[Le Havre]] in France. [[No. 105 Squadron RAF]] sent 12 Mosquitos to Twente, Venlo and Sint Truinden; all home to NJG 1 units. A further 17 Mosquitos were sent on pathfinder operations.{{sfn|Cooper|2013|pp=185-186}} NJG&nbsp;2 and 3 were to plan their interceptions along the transit routes near [[Sylt]].

Aerial resistance declined by day and night and a state of [[air supremacy]] was achieved by Allied air forces. The Luftwaffe's shortage of fuel to operate and provide sufficient training for fighter crews became apparent.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=166-167}} The OKL had not foreseen the collapse of its day and night fighter force and had assumed that Bomber Command would not resume deep-penetration raids for some time. Incredibly, the high command thought the Luftwaffe could prevent a landing in Western Europe. By June 1944, most night fighter units had been moved to the periphery of [[Luftflotte Reich]]'s territory in [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] and Western Europe. Only NJG 1 and 3 remained in Germany.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=168}}\n\nOn 31 May 1944 NJG&nbsp;1 reported the following strength; Stab with He 219 and Bf 110 contained two aircraft with one operational.

The collapse of the German front in Normandy in August necessitated NJG 1s evacuation of all ''staffel'' from the [[Low Countries]] in September 1944 to [[Munster]], [[Dortmund]], [[Dusseldorf]] ]and [[Fritzlar]]. The [[Wehrmacht]]'s hold on the eastern Netherlands allowed for the return of elements of NJG&nbsp;1 for operations in Twente in November 1944.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=170-171}} Stab/NJG&nbsp;1 relocated to [[Paderborn]], I./NJG&nbsp;1 to Munster, II./NJG&nbsp;1 to D\u00fcsseldorf, III./NJG&nbsp;1 to Fritzlar and IV./NJG&nbsp;1 to Dortmund. 2./NJG&nbsp;1 was detached and operated from Niedermendig. All ''gruppen'' were subordinated to the 3. Jagddivision.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=172-173}}\n\nThe OKL correctly surmised that high-frequency technology rather than the number and quality of night fighters would decide the next phase of the battle. They drew the wrong conclusions from their successes in early 1944 and wrongly assumed the straight forward devices such as Naxos, SN-2 and [[Flensburg radar detector]]s coupled with a high level of training would inflict severe damage on the enemy provided their secrets could be kept from the enemy and enough of them made available. Production was concentrated on SN-2, while centimetric radar came low on the list of priorities. The radar types in use, used long-wave radar waves which were prone to jamming and created high drag. The decision not to fit SN-2 to He&nbsp;219s caused high losses of the type. Only Ju 88 units received Naxos. In December 1944, a final concerted effort to regain the high-frequency lead was made in the SN-3 radar.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=176-178}} The Allied breakout from Normandy in August 1944 destroyed a significant portion of German early warning systems supporting the Kammhuber Line. This weakened day and night defences but did not leave them helpless. German Y-services continued to provide intelligence on impending air attacks.{{sfn|Hall|1998|p=143}} The Luftwaffe's hope of keeping German radar from the enemy failed. On 13 July 1944, a Ju 88G-1 equipped with the [[Flensburg radar detector]], landed in England in error and allowed the British to develop counter measures; the Germans never regained a lead in the radar field.{{sfn|Addison|Crang|2006|p=65}} \n\nIn equipment the German night fighter force remained capable. The Bf 110 may have been considered obsolete, but in the hands of experienced pilots it remained a formidable night fighter. The victory claims submitted by I./NJG&nbsp;1 (He&nbsp;219) and II./NJG&nbsp;1 (Bf&nbsp;110) have been analysed from June 1944 onward. Operating under the same conditions II/NJG 1 regularly shot down more bombers and the He 219-group. Nevertheles, Bf&nbsp;110G production was tapering off as Ju&nbsp;88G production increased to 339 in December 1944.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=185}} The technicians at [[Heinkel]] cooperated closely with operational units to produce modifications at request, but these were contradictory. In II./NJG&nbsp;1 pilots argued for a cannon of 30 mm calibre, only later to show a preference for 20 mms [owing to the low-muzzle velocity it required firing from short-range increasing the danger to the German crew]. When the crews complained about the two-man He 219, the manufacturer made modifications for a third member, only for the proposal to be dropped for a complete redesign with this in mind. When it was realised the He 219s performance over the RAF Mosquito proved insufficient the new [[Heinkel He 419]] \"Mosquito hunter\" was planned, but too late for production. I ''Gruppe'' had 20 He&nbsp;219A-0, A-2 and A-5s. The A-0 were brought up to latter standards.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=188-190}} II/NJG 1 operated small numbers of He 219s, but most pilots were not comfortable with the type and they found the performance was not significantly better than the Bf 110. The crews did not like being perched ahead of the engines and reiterated the drawback of the missing third member or \"lookout.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=190}} Nevertheless, pilots [[Ernst-Wilhelm Modrow]] and [[Heinz Str\u00fcning]] performed well in the He 219. Production of the Heinkel was phased out in January 1945 in favour of the Ju 88G\u2014by this time Str\u00fcning had been killed.{{sfn|Boiten|1999|p=147}}\n\nFrom July 1944 to May 1945, Bomber Command made 10 large raids per month. From October 1944 60-80 Mosquitos flew into Germany on an average of ten nights per month. The He&nbsp;219 pilots in NJG&nbsp;1 could do little to oppose them. In July 1944 NJG 1 He 219s claimed three of them; but only one near the British aircraft's operating height of {{convert|9,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Soon, the task of opposing the Mosquito intruders fell to single-engine units. Confounding operational issues further, distrust permeated between crews and ground controllers for jamming and the use of decoy aircraft made interceptions difficult. Pilots had no choice but to follow their directions because the only long-range radars, Naxos and Flensburg, became useless by July 1944, and SN-2 was beginning to show signs it had been compromised. The British tactics of flying below {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} caused so many contacts on the SN-2 screens it was difficult to identify and follow a specific target. Window and jamming made it very difficult for night fighters to find the bomber stream.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=200\u2013201}} The intruder danger became so acute by December that I./NJG&nbsp;1 reported operations on only six nights claiming one victory for six losses.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=205}}\n\nGermany's rapidly deteriorating military situation necessitated the use of the night fighters in roles for which they were not equipped or trained. In December 1944, the Wehrmacht and [[Waffen SS]] began the [[Ardennes Offensive]] to split the British and American armies and capture [[Antwerp]]. NJG&nbsp;1 and other units were ordered to provide [[close air support]] during the operation, at night. On 23/24 December 88 night fighters flew ground support missions between [[Liege]],  [[Sedan]] and [[Metz]], and in support of the [[Siege of Bastogne]]. 8/NJG 1 are known to have carried out strafing attacks near [[Maastricht]] on 17 December. III/NJG 1 reported the loss of one crew on 26 December 1944, as the land offensive came to a halt.{{sfn|Parker|1998|pp=207-208}}\n\n===1945: Destruction of the Kammhuber Line===\n[[File:Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Fighter Command C4212A.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|This gun sequence, taken from George Hardy's aircraft, shows a 11/NJG 1 Bf 110 piloted by [[Heinz Vinke]] shortly before it crashed killing the crew.]]\nThe [[Oil campaign of World War II|Allied bombing of Axis oil targets]] in 1944 had an enormous impact on the Wehrmacht.

Their loss to the Mosquito intruders of 100 Group were out of proportion to the psychological damage done.

[[No. 100 Group RAF]] Mosquitos were equipped with serrate radar allowing the RAF crews to home in on emissions created from German SN-2. Other Mosquitos were equipped with \"perfectos\" which sent interrogating pulses to trigger the IFF (identification friend or foe) in German fighters.

NJG&nbsp;1 was formed on 22 June 1940 in [[M\u00f6nchengladbach]].\nBy the end of the war it was the most successful night fighter unit and had claimed some 2,311 victories by day and night, for some 676 aircrew killed in action.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=239}}\n\n== Background==\n[[Night fighter]] operations did not feature in [[Wehrmacht]] [[war games]] during 1935 and 1936. Little of the Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 concerned night fighting save for Section 253, which called for night fighting zones to be established, so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each other. [[Search light]]s were to be utilised in support of the pilots. Section 253 concluded that any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The [[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]] ordered experimenting with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10-16}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15-16}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} Kammhuber established the [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI ''Gruppe'' was formed on 22 June 1940 from elements of I./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1|''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 1]] (ZG&nbsp;1) and IV./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 26|''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 26]] (ZG&nbsp;26).  II. ''Gruppe'' was formed from IV./(N) ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 2|''Jagdgeschwader'' 2]] on 1 July 1940, although the ''Gruppe'' was redesignated III./NJG&nbsp;1. The second formaction occurred the same date, 1 July, from renaming Z./[[Kampfgeschwader 30|''Kampfgeschwader'' 30]] (''Zerst\u00f6rer''/KG&nbsp;30). On 7 September 1940 this ''Gruppe'' were redesignated as I./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 2|''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' 2]] (NJG&nbsp;2), though it received personnel from I./ZG&nbsp;26. III. ''Gruppe'' was raised on 1 July also, from II./NJG&nbsp;1. IV./NJG&nbsp;1 was raised on 1 October 1942 from elements of II./NJG&nbsp;2.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] became the first [[Geschwaderkommodore]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=226}} ''[[Hauptmann]]'' [[G\u00fcnther Radusch]], took command of I./NJG&nbsp;1, ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' [[Walter Ehle]], became the first permanent commander of II./NJG&nbsp;1, ''Hauptmann'' von Bothmer and ''Major'' [[Helmut Lent]] took command of III. and IV./NJG&nbsp;1 respectively.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=226\u2013227}}\n\nI./NJG&nbsp;1 set up base at [[Venlo Airfield]], where to remained from 18 March 1941 to 5 September 1944. 18,000 workers worked on the site which measured 1,180 [[hectares]]. The two take-off runways were {{convert|1,450|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, and a third {{convert|1,200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. 2,000 lamps were used for lighting and {{convert|48|km|mi|abbr=off}} of roads led to workshops, command posts, and accommodation.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=29}} The formation of the night fighter wings brought together different kinds of pilots with different preferences. The crews of II./NJG&nbsp;1, which were formed from Z/KG&nbsp;30, preferred the [[Junkers Ju 88]], [[Dornier Do 17]] and [[Dornier Do 217]], which were regarded by Bf 110 pilots as \"lame ducks\" unsuitable for the role. These pilots preferred other qualities not prevalent in Zerstorer aircraft; spacious cockpits, a third man to act as lookout, longer endurance, auto-pilot, and more powerful armament. These pilots, in some cases, were advanced in years for a military aviator, often they were former [[Lufthansa]] pilots. These men did not adapt easily to the concept of controlled night fighting.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}} [[Werner Baake]] and [[Rudolf Schoenert]] were an examples of the ex-Lufhansa pilots that joined the Luftwaffe in 1941.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=125}}\n\n==World War II==\nIn the autumn, 1940 the Luftwaffe began long-range intruder operations (''Fernnachtjagd'') to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} The Luftwaffe signalling service were able to determine when Bomber Command operations were going to begin. Night fighters were ordered to patrol the German coast, fly to known Bomber Command bases and follow the bombers back to [[England]] along known routes.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} I./NJG&nbsp;2 became the sole intruder unit for this type of operation, but the results were expensive. The wing lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF claimed shot down.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} Over Europe, the German defences were limited in 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precise [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvanage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], and could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32-33}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf&nbsp;110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over {{convert|5,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

The increase of aircraft production for the Luftwaffe also came to an abrupt halt. Monthly production failed to increase between July 1943 and March 1944. [[Adam Tooze]] concludes; \"Bomber Command had stopped Speer's armaments miracle in its tracks.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=598}} Production of [[locomotive]]s halted after March 1943 in the Ruhr along with ammunition fuses.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|pp=134\u2013135}} Over 100,000 people were [[dehoused]] in [[Essen]], contributing to the inability to continue production at the [[Krupp]] plant.{{sfn|Cooper|1992|p=135}}\n\nLuftwaffe night pilots experienced the presence of long-range RAF night fighting aircraft for the first time over Germany.

The introduction of \"[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]\" blew a hole in German radar coverage and the [[bomber stream]]s, aided by OBOE and H2S radar were able to penetrate the defences to devastate the centre of the city. The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) system of radar-controlled night fighters slipping into the bomber stream and then using its own radar to pick out and engage individual bombers had gone. The effects of the raid, and the realisation German radar was temporarily blinded, led to the widespread use of the Wild Boar tactics over the summer, 1943.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=95}} 791 bombers hit the city. German air defences accounted for only 1.5 percent of the attacking force. The Nazi leadership was shaken, and Kammhuber, who resisted calls to abandon the advanced ''Himmelbett'' system, was compelled to find technical solutions to the jamming of Freya, Liechtenstein and W\u00fcrzburg radars.

[[Viktor von Lo\u00dfberg]]'s idea was for night fighters equipped with experimental SN-2 radar to cooperate with Y-control systems and \"sluice\" them into the bomber stream. Once there, the night fighters were ordered to transmit direction-finding signals to attract other night fighters. While semi-unguided, the radar operators and night fighter command retained some control over operations with success in August; amounting to 250 aircraft claimed shot down on all fronts. The success was offset by losses of 40 killed in the night fighter arm, with only 28 replacements in August. 61 twin-engine night fighters were lost during the month, but only 59 were replaced.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=101\u2013104, 106}} As one German historian noted, the advent of the frequent Mosquito intruder operations from October \"no airfield in Central Germany was safe.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=143}} NJG&nbsp;1 were engaged in daylight operations against the [[United States Army Air Force]] in August.

They drew the wrong conclusions from their successes in early 1944 and wrongly assumed the straight forward devices such as Naxos, SN-2 and [[Flensburg radar detector]]s coupled with a high level of training would inflict severe damage on the enemy provided their secrets could be kept from the enemy and enough of them made available. Production was concentrated on SN-2, while centimetric radar came low on the list of priorities. The radar types in use, used long-wave radar waves which were prone to jamming and created high drag. The decision not to fit SN-2 to He&nbsp;219s caused high losses of the type. Only Ju 88 units received Naxos. In December 1944, a final concerted effort to regain the high-frequency lead was made in the SN-3 radar.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=176-178}} The Allied breakout from Normandy in August 1944 destroyed a significant portion of German early warning systems supporting the Kammhuber Line. This weakened day and night defences but did not leave them helpless. German Y-services continued to provide intelligence on impending air attacks.{{sfn|Hall|1998|p=143}} The Luftwaffe's hope of keeping German radar from the enemy failed. On 13 July 1944, a Ju 88G-1 equipped with the [[Flensburg radar detector]], landed in England in error and allowed the British to develop counter measures; the Germans never regained a lead in the radar field.{{sfn|Addison|Crang|2006|p=65}} \n\nIn equipment the German night fighter force remained capable. The Bf 110 may have been considered obsolete, but in the hands of experienced pilots it remained a formidable night fighter. The victory claims submitted by I./NJG&nbsp;1 (He&nbsp;219) and II./NJG&nbsp;1 (Bf&nbsp;110) have been analysed from June 1944 onward. Operating under the same conditions II/NJG 1 regularly shot down more bombers and the He 219-group. Nevertheles, Bf&nbsp;110G production was tapering off as Ju&nbsp;88G production increased to 339 in December 1944.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=185}} The technicians at [[Heinkel]] cooperated closely with operational units to produce modifications at request, but these were contradictory. In II./NJG&nbsp;1 pilots argued for a cannon of 30 mm calibre, only later to show a preference for 20 mms [owing to the low-muzzle velocity it required firing from short-range increasing the danger to the German crew]. When the crews complained about the two-man He 219, the manufacturer made modifications for a third member, only for the proposal to be dropped for a complete redesign with this in mind. When it was realised the He 219s performance over the RAF Mosquito proved insufficient the new [[Heinkel He 419]] \"Mosquito hunter\" was planned, but too late for production. I ''Gruppe'' had 20 He&nbsp;219A-0, A-2 and A-5s. The A-0 were brought up to latter standards.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=188-190}} II/NJG 1 operated small numbers of He 219s, but most pilots were not comfortable with the type and they found the performance was not significantly better than the Bf 110. The crews did not like being perched ahead of the engines and reiterated the drawback of the missing third member or \"lookout.\"{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=190}} Nevertheless, pilots [[Ernst-Wilhelm Modrow]] and [[Heinz Str\u00fcning]] performed well in the He 219. Production of the Heinkel was phased out in January 1945 in favour of the Ju 88G\u2014by this time Str\u00fcning had been killed.{{sfn|Boiten|1999|p=147}}\n\nFrom July 1944 to May 1945, Bomber Command made 10 large raids per month. From October 1944 60-80 Mosquitos flew into Germany on an average of ten nights per month. The He&nbsp;219 pilots in NJG&nbsp;1 could do little to oppose them. In July 1944 NJG 1 He 219s claimed three of them; but only one near the British aircraft's operating height of {{convert|9,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Soon, the task of opposing the Mosquito intruders fell to single-engine units. Confounding operational issues further, distrust permeated between crews and ground controllers for jamming and the use of decoy aircraft made interceptions difficult. Pilots had no choice but to follow their directions because the only long-range radars, Naxos and Flensburg, became useless by July 1944, and SN-2 was beginning to show signs it had been compromised. The British tactics of flying below {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} caused so many contacts on the SN-2 screens it was difficult to identify and follow a specific target. Window and jamming made it very difficult for night fighters to find the bomber stream.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=200\u2013201}} The intruder danger became so acute by December that I./NJG&nbsp;1 reported operations on only six nights claiming one victory for six losses.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=205}}\n\nGermany's rapidly deteriorating military situation necessitated the use of the night fighters in roles for which they were not equipped or trained. In December 1944, the Wehrmacht and [[Waffen SS]] began the [[Ardennes Offensive]] to split the British and American armies and capture [[Antwerp]]. NJG&nbsp;1 and other units were ordered to provide [[close air support]] during the operation, at night. On 23/24 December 88 night fighters flew ground support missions between [[Liege]],  [[Sedan]] and [[Metz]], and in support of the [[Siege of Bastogne]]. 8/NJG 1 are known to have carried out strafing attacks near [[Maastricht]] on 17 December. III/NJG 1 reported the loss of one crew on 26 December 1944, as the land offensive came to a halt.{{sfn|Parker|1998|pp=207-208}}\n\n===1945: Destruction of the Kammhuber Line===\n[[File:Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Fighter Command C4212A.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|This gun sequence, taken from George Hardy's aircraft, shows a 11/NJG 1 Bf 110 piloted by [[Heinz Vinke]] shortly before it crashed killing the crew.]]\nThe [[Oil campaign of World War II|Allied bombing of Axis oil targets]] in 1944 had an enormous impact on the Wehrmacht. Oil production feel causing fuel shortages which limited the effectiveness of German land and air operations.{{sfn|Price|1991|pp=91-96}} By mid-1944 Speer warned that if the oil plants could not be protected, the Luftwaffe would run out of fuel.{{sfn|Murray|1983|pp=274-275}} The fuel shortage directly impacted the Luftwaffe night fighter defences. Training, already inadequate, was curtailed and the night fighters were not in a position to impose serious losses on Bomber Command after August 1944.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=144-145}} The remaining crews were regarded as among the Luftwaffe's most precious assets. Their loss to the Mosquito intruders of 100 Group were out of proportion to the psychological damage done. Thus, one historian writes, an air of \"Mosquito phobia\" took hold by mid-1944.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=144-145}} [[Hans-Heinz Augenstein]] was another member of a successful night fighter team to be killed by an intruder in December 1944.{{sfn|Bowman|Davy|2013|p=79}}\n\nAlong with fuel shortages the Luftwaffe night fighter force had to contend with technical setbacks by late 1944. [[No. 100 Group RAF]] Mosquitos were equipped with serrate radar allowing the RAF crews to home in on emissions created from German SN-2. Other Mosquitos were equipped with \"perfectos\" which sent interrogating pulses to trigger the IFF (identification friend or foe) in German fighters. When the German set replied, the signal betrayed the aircraft as hostile along with the bearing and range of the German crew.{{sfn|Price|1991|p=94}} Losses were sustained against the British intruders and were compounded when German crews switched off their sets which exposed them to friendly-fire.{{sfn|Price|1991|p=94}} On 10 January 1945, NJG 1 reported a strength of 20 Bf 110s (18 operational} in Stab/NJG 1, I ''Gruppe'', 64 He 219s (45 operational), 24 of 37 Bf&nbsp;110s combat ready in in II.

Immense quantities of earth had to be moved to secure these forms of surface and it was turned to account thus:- At the boundary of the fruit garden a thick retaining wall was built; in front of this the back wall for a range of glass running right across the garden was built leaving room for fruit rooms, sheds stoke holes etc. between the two walls.

Immense quantities of earth had to be moved to secure these forms of surface and it was turned to account thus:- At the boundary of the fruit garden a thick retaining wall was built; in front of this the back wall for a range of glass running right across the garden was built leaving room for fruit rooms, sheds stoke holes etc. between the two walls.
