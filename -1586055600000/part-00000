Using [[magnetoreception]] various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Description===\nAt any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the ''declination'' ({{math|<var>D</var>}}) or ''variation''. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the ''inclination'' ({{math|<var>I</var>}}) or ''[[magnetic dip]]''. The ''intensity'' ({{math|<var>F</var>}}) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in {{math|<var>X</var>}} (North), {{math|<var>Y</var>}} (East) and {{math|<var>Z</var>}} (Down) coordinates.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n[[File:XYZ-DIS magnetic field coordinates.svg|500px|thumb|center|Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field.]]\n\n====Intensity====\nThe intensity of the field is often measured in [[Gauss (unit)|gauss (G)]], but is generally reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1&nbsp;G = 100,000&nbsp;nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (\u03b3).<ref name=\"NGDC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml#What_are_the_magnetic_elements |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>   The [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] is the [[SI]] unit of the magnetic field,  The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000&nbsp;nT (0.25\u20130.65&nbsp;G). By comparison, a strong [[refrigerator magnet]] has a field of about {{convert|10000000|nT|G}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/magnetminute/tesla-transcript.html |last1=Palm |first1=Eric |title=Tesla |publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321234403/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/magnetminute/tesla-transcript.html |archive-date=21 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA map of intensity contours is called an ''isodynamic chart''. As the [[Earth's magnetic field#Geographical variation|World Magnetic Model]] shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.<ref name=\"renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733\" />\n\n====Inclination====\n{{main|Magnetic dip}}\nThe inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90\u00b0 (up) to 90\u00b0 (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the [[North Magnetic Pole]] and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0\u00b0) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole.

The inclination of the Earth's field is 90\u00b0 (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90\u00b0 (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe.  Movements of up to {{convert|40|km}} per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the [[Boothia Peninsula]] in 1831 to {{convert|600|km}} from [[Resolute Bay]] in 2001.<ref name=\"inconstant\" /> The ''magnetic equator'' is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).\n\nThe global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them.

This is a stream of charged particles leaving the [[solar corona|Sun's corona]] and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000&nbsp;kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF).<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\">{{harvnb|Merrill|2010}}, pages 126\u2013141</ref>\n\nThe solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The [[magnetopause]], the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10&nbsp;[[Earth radius|Earth radii]] out but the other side stretching out in a [[magnetotail]] that extends beyond 200&nbsp;Earth radii.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\nSunward of the magnetopause is the [[bow shock]], the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nInside the magnetosphere is the [[plasmasphere]], a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This region begins at a height of 60&nbsp;km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" /> There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10&nbsp;million [[Electronvolt|electron volts]] (MeV)). The inner belt is 1\u20132&nbsp;Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4\u20137&nbsp;Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.<ref>{{cite press release |last1=Darrouzet |first1=Fabien |last2=De Keyser |first2=Johan |last3=Escoubet |first3=C.

Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nSome of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a [[ring current]]. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" /> Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] and also emit [[X-rays]].<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\n\nThe varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as [[space weather]], are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called [[geomagnetic storm]]s, can occur when a [[coronal mass ejection]] erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; [[Halloween solar storms, 2003|the \"Halloween\" storm of 2003]] damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites.

In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nIn a perfect conductor (<math>\\sigma = \\infty\\;</math>), there would be no diffusion. By [[Lenz's law]], any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the ''frozen-in-field theorem''. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nThe motion of the fluid is sustained by [[convection]], motion driven by [[buoyancy]]. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called ''compositional convection''. A [[Coriolis effect]], caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.<ref name=Buffett2000/><ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nA dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a \"seed\" field to get it started.<ref name=MMMch8/> For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field.

The function changes sign each \u2113time it crosses one of these lines.]]\n[[File:VFPt four charges.svg|thumb|Example of a quadrupole field. This can also be constructed by moving two dipoles together.]]\n\nThe most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of [[spherical harmonics]]. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.<ref name=Wallace2003>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003}}, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such ''[[nodal line]]s'' is the absolute value of the ''order'' {{math|<var>m</var>}}. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the ''degree'' \u2113. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A ''[[Magnetic monopole|monopole]]'' is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A ''[[Magnetic dipole|dipole]]'' is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a ''[[quadrupole]]'' to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.<ref name=MMMch2>{{harvnb |Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996 |loc=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nSpherical harmonics can represent any [[scalar field]] (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a [[vector field]], but if it is expressed in Cartesian components {{math|<var>X, Y, Z</var>}}, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the ''[[magnetic potential]]''. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting  ''Gauss coefficient'' {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients \u2013 {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}}, and {{math|<var>h</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}} \u2013 determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10\u00b0 with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Radial dependence====\nSpherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>\u2113+1</sup>}} and one that ''increases'' with radius as {{math|<var>r</var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source ({{math|\u2113{{=}}1}}) drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>2</sup>}}. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>3</sup>}}. Quadrupole terms drop off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>4</sup>}}, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree {{math|14}} or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about {{convert|2000|km}} or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Global models====\nThe [[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]] maintains a standard global field model called the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]].

However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, [[Geomagnetic reversal|the Earth's field reverses]] and the North and [[South Magnetic Pole]]s respectively, abruptly switch places.

Using [[magnetoreception]] various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Description===\nAt any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the ''declination'' ({{math|<var>D</var>}}) or ''variation''. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the ''inclination'' ({{math|<var>I</var>}}) or ''[[magnetic dip]]''. The ''intensity'' ({{math|<var>F</var>}}) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in {{math|<var>X</var>}} (North), {{math|<var>Y</var>}} (East) and {{math|<var>Z</var>}} (Down) coordinates.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n[[File:XYZ-DIS magnetic field coordinates.svg|500px|thumb|center|Common coordinate systems used for representing the Earth's magnetic field.]]\n\n====Intensity====\nThe intensity of the field is often measured in [[Gauss (unit)|gauss (G)]], but is generally reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1&nbsp;G = 100,000&nbsp;nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma (\u03b3).<ref name=\"NGDC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/faqgeom.shtml#What_are_the_magnetic_elements |title=Geomagnetism Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>   The [[tesla (unit)|tesla]] is the [[SI]] unit of the magnetic field,  The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000&nbsp;nT (0.25\u20130.65&nbsp;G). By comparison, a strong [[refrigerator magnet]] has a field of about {{convert|10000000|nT|G}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/magnetminute/tesla-transcript.html |last1=Palm |first1=Eric |title=Tesla |publisher=National High Magnetic Field Laboratory |year=2011 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321234403/http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/education/tutorials/magnetminute/tesla-transcript.html |archive-date=21 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nA map of intensity contours is called an ''isodynamic chart''. As the [[Earth's magnetic field#Geographical variation|World Magnetic Model]] shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the [[South Atlantic Anomaly]] over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.<ref name=\"renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733\" />\n\n====Inclination====\n{{main article|Magnetic dip}}\nThe inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90\u00b0 (up) to 90\u00b0 (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the [[North Magnetic Pole]] and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0\u00b0) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a [[dip circle]].\n\nAn ''isoclinic chart'' (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown [[#Geographical variation|below]].\n\n====Declination====\n{{main article|Magnetic declination}}\nDeclination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with the direction of a [[celestial pole]]. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).\n\n===Geographical variation===\n<center>\nComponents of the Earth's magnetic field at the surface from the [[World Magnetic Model]] for 2015.<ref name=\"renamed_from_2010_on_20131022170733\">{{Cite report |last1=Chulliat |first1=A. |last2=Macmillan |first2=S. |last3=Alken |first3=P. |last4=Beggan |first4=C. |last5=Nair |first5=M. |last6=Hamilton |first6=B. |last7=Woods |first7=A. |last8=Ridley |first8=V. |last9=Maus  |first9=S. |last10=Thomson |first10=A. |date=2015 |title=The US/UK World Magnetic Model for 2015-2020 |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/data/WMM2015/WMM2015_Report.pdf |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center |accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n</center>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" align=\"center\" heights=\"155px\">\nFile:World Magnetic Field 2015.pdf|Intensity\nFile:World Magnetic Inclination 2015.pdf|Inclination\nFile:World Magnetic Declination 2015.pdf|Declination\n</gallery>\n\n===Dipolar approximation===\n[[File:Geomagnetisme.svg|thumb|The variation between magnetic north (N<sub>m</sub>) and \"true\" north (N<sub>g</sub>).]]\n{{see also|Dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field}}\nNear the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11\u00b0 with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.<ref name=\"NGDC\" /> The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar [[magnet]], with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anne |last=Casselman |title=The Earth Has More Than One North Pole |newspaper=Scientific American |date=28 February 2008 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-earth-has-more-than-one-north-pole |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet.

A magnet's  North pole is defined as the pole that is attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole when the magnet is suspended so it can turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).<ref name=\"Serway\">{{cite book  | last = Serway  | first = Raymond A. |author2=Chris Vuille | title = Essentials of college physics | publisher = Cengage Learning | year = 2006 | location = USA | page = 493 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8n4NCyRgUMEC&pg=PA493 | isbn = 978-0-495-10619-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Emiliani\">{{cite book  | last = Emiliani | first = Cesare | title = Planet Earth: Cosmology, Geology, and the Evolution of Life and Environment | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1992 | location = UK | page = 228 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MfAGpVq8gpQC&pg=PA228 | isbn = 978-0-521-40949-0}}</ref><ref name=\"Manners\">{{cite book  | last = Manners | first = Joy | title = Static Fields and Potentials | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2000 | location = USA | page = 148 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vJyqbRPsXYQC&pg=PA148 | isbn = 978-0-7503-0718-5}}</ref><ref name=\"Hyperphysics\">{{cite web | last = Nave | first = Carl R. | title = Bar Magnet | work = Hyperphysics | publisher = Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Georgia State Univ.  | year = 2010 | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hframe.html | accessdate = 2011-04-10}}</ref>  \n\nThe positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Wallace A. |last1=Campbell |title=\"Magnetic\" pole locations on global charts are incorrect |journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union |volume=77 |issue=36 |page=345 |year=1996 |doi=10.1029/96EO00237 |bibcode=1996EOSTr..77..345C |ref=harv|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2a7bc65d5bf4b4accd44f7ad6e787f1d4428e078 }}</ref> The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html |title=The Magnetic North Pole |publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819061122/http://deeptow.whoi.edu/northpole.html |archive-date=19 August 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90\u00b0 (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90\u00b0 (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe.  Movements of up to {{convert|40|km}} per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the [[Boothia Peninsula]] in 1831 to {{convert|600|km}} from [[Resolute Bay]] in 2001.<ref name=\"inconstant\" /> The ''magnetic equator'' is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).\n\nThe global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant [[Multipole expansion|non-dipolar]] contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Magnetosphere ==\n[[File:Magnetosphere Levels.svg|thumb|An artist's rendering of the structure of a magnetosphere. 1)&nbsp;Bow shock. 2)&nbsp;Magnetosheath. 3)&nbsp;Magnetopause. 4)&nbsp;Magnetosphere. 5)&nbsp;Northern tail lobe. 6)&nbsp;Southern tail lobe. 7)&nbsp;Plasmasphere.]]\n{{main article|Magnetosphere}}\n\nEarth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's [[corona]] and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000&nbsp;kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF).<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\">{{harvnb|Merrill|2010}}, pages 126\u2013141</ref>\n\nThe solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The [[magnetopause]], the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10&nbsp;[[Earth radius|Earth radii]] out but the other side stretching out in a [[magnetotail]] that extends beyond 200&nbsp;Earth radii.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\nSunward of the magnetopause is the [[bow shock]], the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nInside the magnetosphere is the [[plasmasphere]], a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This region begins at a height of 60&nbsp;km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" /> There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10&nbsp;million [[Electronvolt|electron volts]] (MeV)). The inner belt is 1\u20132&nbsp;Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4\u20137&nbsp;Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.<ref>{{cite press release |last1=Darrouzet |first1=Fabien |last2=De Keyser |first2=Johan |last3=Escoubet |first3=C.

Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" />\n\nSome of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a [[ring current]]. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" /> Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] and also emit [[X-rays]].<ref name=\"ParksIntro\" />\n\nThe varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as [[space weather]], are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called [[geomagnetic storm]]s, can occur when a [[coronal mass ejection]] erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; [[Halloween solar storms, 2003|the \"Halloween\" storm of 2003]] damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.<ref name=\"MerrillMagnetosphere\" /><ref>{{cite journal |first=Sten |last=Odenwald |title=The great solar superstorm of 1859 |journal=Technology Through Time |volume=70 |year=2010 |url=http://sunearthday.gsfc.nasa.gov/2010/TTT/70.php |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Time dependence ==\n\n===Short-term variations===\n[[File:Magnetic Storm Oct 2003.jpg|thumb|'''Background''': a set of traces from magnetic observatories showing a [[magnetic storm]] in 2000.<br /> '''Globe''': map showing locations of observatories and contour lines giving horizontal magnetic intensity in [[Micro-|\u03bc]] [[Tesla (unit)|T]].]]\n\nThe geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years.

This [[remanent magnetization]], or ''remanence'', can be acquired in more than one way. In [[lava flow]]s, the direction of the field is \"frozen\" in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a [[thermoremanent magnetization]]. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called ''detrital remanent magnetization''.<ref name=\"McElhinny2000\" />\n\nThermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, [[magma]] wells up from the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below.

In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nIn a perfect conductor (<math>\\sigma = \\infty\\;</math>), there would be no diffusion. By [[Lenz's law]], any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the ''frozen-in-field theorem''. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.<ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nThe motion of the fluid is sustained by [[convection]], motion driven by [[buoyancy]]. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called ''compositional convection''. A [[Coriolis effect]], caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.<ref name=Buffett2000/><ref name=MMMch8/>\n\nA dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a \"seed\" field to get it started.<ref name=MMMch8/> For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field.

If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions.\n\n====Spherical harmonics====\n{{see also|Multipole expansion}}\n[[File:Spherical harmonics positive negative.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of spherical harmonics on a sphere and their nodal lines. {{math|<var>P</var><sub>\u2113 <var>m</var></sub>}} is equal to 0 along {{math|<var>m</var>}} [[great circle]]s passing through the poles, and along {{math|\u2113-<var>m</var>}} circles of equal latitude. The function changes sign each \u2113time it crosses one of these lines.]]\n[[File:VFPt four charges.svg|thumb|Example of a quadrupole field. This can also be constructed by moving two dipoles together.]]\n\nThe most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of [[spherical harmonics]]. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.<ref name=Wallace2003>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003}}, p.&nbsp;1.</ref> Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such ''[[nodal line]]s'' is the absolute value of the ''order'' {{math|<var>m</var>}}. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the ''degree'' \u2113. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A ''[[Magnetic monopole|monopole]]'' is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A ''[[Magnetic dipole|dipole]]'' is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a ''[[quadrupole]]'' to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.<ref name=MMMch2>{{harvnb |Merrill|McElhinny|McFadden|1996 |loc=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nSpherical harmonics can represent any [[scalar field]] (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a [[vector field]], but if it is expressed in Cartesian components {{math|<var>X, Y, Z</var>}}, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the ''[[magnetic potential]]''. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting  ''Gauss coefficient'' {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients \u2013 {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>}}, {{math|<var>g</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}}, and {{math|<var>h</var><sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>}} \u2013 determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10\u00b0 with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Radial dependence====\nSpherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient {{math|<var>g<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} or {{math|<var>h<sub>m</sub></var><sup>\u2113</sup>}} can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>\u2113+1</sup>}} and one that ''increases'' with radius as {{math|<var>r</var><sup>\u2113</sup>}}. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\nThe remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source ({{math|\u2113{{=}}1}}) drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>2</sup>}}. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>3</sup>}}. Quadrupole terms drop off as {{math|1/<var>r</var><sup>4</sup>}}, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree {{math|14}} or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about {{convert|2000|km}} or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.<ref name=\"MMMch2\" />\n\n====Global models====\nThe [[International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy]] maintains a standard global field model called the [[International Geomagnetic Reference Field]]. It is updated every five years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites ([[\u00d8rsted (satellite)|\u00d8rsted]], [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]] and [[SAC-C]]) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finlay |first1=C.

Their leader Mayawati said that she wouldn't enter an electoral alliance with either the Congress or the BJP. She also accused both parties of misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation or the CBI and attempting to implicate her in the Taj Corridor Case.

Addressing a news conference, Owaisi said his party was compelled to take the decision due to \"the communal behaviour of [[Kiran Kumar Reddy]]'s government in [[Andhra Pradesh]]\". Giving a detailed account of communal riots in the state and Hyderabad since 2010, he alleged that the Congress government not only turned a blind eye to MIM's demands to withdraw cases against innocent Muslims and take action against the guilty but pandered to the [[Sangh Parivar]]. The MIM's decision came after the government allegedly allowed construction of a canopy over a temple abutting the historic [[Charminar]] in alleged violation of court orders to maintain status quo.

Their leader Mayawati said that she wouldn't enter an electoral alliance with either the Congress or the BJP. She also accused both parties of misusing the Central Bureau of Investigation or the CBI and attempting to implicate her in the Taj Corridor Case.

Addressing a news conference, Owaisi said his party was compelled to take the decision due to \"the communal behaviour of [[Kiran Kumar Reddy]]'s government in [[Andhra Pradesh]]\". Giving a detailed account of communal riots in the state and Hyderabad since 2010, he alleged that the Congress government not only turned a blind eye to MIM's demands to withdraw cases against innocent Muslims and take action against the guilty but pandered to the [[Sangh Parivar]]. The MIM's decision came after the government allegedly allowed construction of a canopy over a temple abutting the historic [[Charminar]] in alleged violation of court orders to maintain status quo.
