First opened in 1995 as a semi-chordial radius it is at present in process of being extended through the centre and northwards. At present the line has 34 kilometres of track and 23 stations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Plans===\nIn the early 1980s, the Moscow development plan put forward several ideas about solving the build-up that came as a result of the radial-ring alignment which has determined the development of the Moscow Metro since the mid-1950s. In the previous programme the radial lines, with an ever-increasing build-up of passengers, were forced to use the central transfer points and those on the ring, severely overcrowding the system.\n\nIn attempt to solve this problem, the future Lyublinskaya line was designed so that some of its transfer points would be outside the [[Koltsevaya line]]. This meant it would begin at the ring before extending south to the [[Kursky Rail Terminal]], [[Kalininskaya Line|Perovsky]], and [[Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line|Zhdanovsky]]. The ultimate goal of the line was to then bring the metro to the new developing districts of [[Maryino District|Maryino]] and [[Lyublino District|Lyublino]] in the south-east of Moscow.\n\nThe initial design when bringing the new line to the new districts was to follow Lyublinskaya Street, not far from the bank of the [[Moskva River]]. However, after several debates, this was altered and the line would continue westwards until it reached Volzhsky Boulevard and only then turn southwards towards the districts of Lyublino. Although this left out the possibility of railway transfer with Kurskaya, it did allow the metro to enter into the heart of the region more thoroughly.\n\n===1990s and later===\nThe change in plans, combined with the financial crises that beset the metro construction in the 1990s, meant that the first stage opened with delays. In late 1995 the first section finally opened, and a year later it would reach Maryino. Several problems were encountered with the construction, particularly for Dubrovka. This station was left incomplete due to nearby factories heating up the soil, which prevented the freezing of the underground water to allow the construction of an escalator tunnel. However, in the late 1990s, because of the financial crises which paralyzed most of the industries, the metro-builders were able to complete the station.\n\nDespite the delays, the line demonstrated some of the newest methods for metro-building. Deep-level stations were built on a monolithic concrete plate instead of a conventional tubular base. Also, the new wall-column design was introduced on two of the deep-level stations and a single-deck for the shallow ones. New finishing materials, such as a fibreglass vaults, were added to offer more reliable waterproofing.\n\nThe development of further extensions was for many years delayed and paralyzed by the lack of finances, and only in 2005 construction was resumed on the long-awaited second stage towards the city centre, with [[Trubnaya]] being the first to open on August 30, 2007. [[Sretensky Bulvar]] was opened on this section on December 29 the same year.\n\nThe second segment of a central extension was opened on June 19, 2010 (construction was resumed only in early 2007) and included two stations [[Dostoyevskaya (Moscow Metro)|Dostoyevskaya]] and [[Maryina Roshcha (Metro)|Maryina Roshcha]].\n\nIn a separate case, a three station extension from Maryino to Zyablikovo (Lyublinsky (southern) radius) began in 1997, but in 2000 the construction sites of the stations [[Borisovo (Moscow Metro)|Borisovo]], [[Shipilovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Shipilovskaya]], and [[Zyablikovo (Moscow Metro)|Zyablikovo]] was abandoned. The importance of this is that Zyablikovo will be a transfer to the [[Krasnogvardeyskaya (Moscow Metro)|Krasnogvardeyskaya]] station of the [[Zamoskvoretskaya line]]. In 2008 construction finally resumed and the stations were opened on 2 December 2011, together with the transfer to the Krasnogvardeyskaya station.\n\nThe extension of the line from Maryina Roshcha northwest to [[Petrovsko-Razumovskaya]] via [[Butyrskaya (Moscow Metro)|Butyrskaya]] and [[Fonvizinskaya (Moscow Metro)|Fonvizinskaya]] was originally planned to be opened in December 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax.ru/moscow/420845|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \"\u041e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f\", \"\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041b\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b\" \u0438 \"\u0421\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\" \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u043e\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0430 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430|date=29 January 2015|publisher=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> The projected opening date was later shifted to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazeta-marfino.ru/?p=4586|title=\u041e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438 \"\u0411\u0443\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\" \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434|date=25 June 2015|publisher=Marfino.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> The stations were opened on 16 September 2016.

[[81-717/714]] (including .5 and .5M modifications) wagons are used since the opening of the line. In 1998-2004 some new [[81-720/721]] (and .1) \"Yauza\" trains were received, but now their production is stopped. Some \"Yauza\" trains (except the original, which were retired) are still in service, but all the new rolling stock used on the line are 81-717/714.5/.5M and 81-717/714.6.\n\nSubway car types used on the line over the years:\n\n-Series 81-717.5: 1995 - present \n\n-Series 81-717.5M: 1995 - present\n\n-Series 81-720/721: 1998 - 2008\n\n-Series 81-720.1/721.1: 2005 - 2019\n\n-Series 81-717.6: 2011 - present \n\n-Series 81-760/761: 2016 (one train)\n\n==Future plans==\nThe line will continue northwards to the residential districts of Beskudnikovo, Degunino and Lianozovo. It is believed that the full radius will be operational by 2022, and by this time an extension to the [[Severny District, Moscow|Severny District]], beyond the [[MKAD]] (Moscow Circle Road), might be realised, although this might be in the form of light metro.\n\nIn early November 2017, it became known that between the stations [[Kozhukhovskaya]] and [[Pechatniki (Moscow Metro)|Pechatniki]] of the Lublin radius, a new station [[Yuzhny Port]] could be built, which will be located in the industrial zone. The decision on the construction of the station will be made depending on the financing of this project by private investors.\n\nIn the Fall of 2019, [[Andrey Bochkarev]] confirmed that the station is planned to be built before the end of 2023. According to the targeted investment program of Moscow from 2021 to 2023, 7 billion rubles will be allocated for the construction of the station with the working name [[Yuzhny Port]].\n\n[[Na\u00e7\u00f5es Subdesenvolvidas Aprendem Geopol\u00edtica de Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Habitacional]\n\n\u00cdndia,Somalia,Brasil e Etc,Povos,aprenderam,At\u00e9 Estados Atrasados,devido 500 Anos,Descoloniza\u00e7\u00e3o,foram privilegiados,com Expressos Papiros.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML |display=title,inline}}\n*[http://urbanrail.net/eu/ru/mos/img/line-10.htm Photos and descriptions on Robert Schwandl's UrbanRail site]\n\n{{Moscow Metro Lines}}\n{{Moscow Metro|line10=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lyublinsko Dmitrovskaya line}}\n[[Category:Moscow Metro lines]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1995]]\n[[Category:Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rail line\n| name                            = {{MOSMETRO-bull|10|text=1}}\n| image                           = Line 10 (Moscow).svg\n| image_width                     = 325\n| caption                         = \n| type                            = [[Rapid transit]]\n| system                          = [[Moscow Metro]]\n| status                          = \n| locale                          = [[Moscow]]\n| start                           = [[Seligerskaya]] (North)\n| end                             = [[Zyablikovo (Moscow Metro)|Zyablikovo]] (South East)\n| stations                        = 23\n| daily_ridership                 = \n| open                            = 28 December 1995\n| close                           = \n| owner                           = Moskovsky Metropoliten\n| operator                        = Moskovsky Metropoliten\n| character                       = Underground\n| stock                           = 81-717.5/714.5<br />81-717.5M/714.5M<br />81-720.1/721.1<br />81-717.6/714.6\n| linelength                      = {{convert|38.3|km}}\n| tracklength                     = \n| tracks                          = \n| gauge                           = {{RailGauge|1520mm|lk=on}}\n| electrification                 = [[Third rail]]\n| speed                           = \n| elevation                       = \n| map                             = {{Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya line RDT}}\n| map_state                       = \n}}\n\nThe '''Lyublinsko\u2013Dmitrovskaya line''' ({{lang-ru|\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0414\u043c\u0438\u0301\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0301\u043d\u0438\u044f}}, {{IPA-ru|l\u02b2u\u02c8bl\u02b2insk\u0259 \u02c8dm\u02b2itr\u0259fsk\u0259j\u0259 \u02c8l\u02b2in\u02b2\u026aj\u0259|IPA}}) ('''Line 10''') is a line of the [[Moscow Metro]].

First opened in 1995 as a semi-chordial radius it is at present in process of being extended through the centre and northwards. At present the line has 34 kilometres of track and 23 stations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Plans===\nIn the early 1980s, the Moscow development plan put forward several ideas about solving the build-up that came as a result of the radial-ring alignment which has determined the development of the Moscow Metro since the mid-1950s. In the previous programme the radial lines, with an ever-increasing build-up of passengers, were forced to use the central transfer points and those on the ring, severely overcrowding the system.\n\nIn attempt to solve this problem, the future Lyublinskaya line was designed so that some of its transfer points would be outside the [[Koltsevaya line]]. This meant it would begin at the ring before extending south to the [[Kursky Rail Terminal]], [[Kalininskaya Line|Perovsky]], and [[Tagansko-Krasnopresnenskaya Line|Zhdanovsky]]. The ultimate goal of the line was to then bring the metro to the new developing districts of [[Maryino District|Maryino]] and [[Lyublino District|Lyublino]] in the south-east of Moscow.\n\nThe initial design when bringing the new line to the new districts was to follow Lyublinskaya Street, not far from the bank of the [[Moskva River]]. However, after several debates, this was altered and the line would continue westwards until it reached Volzhsky Boulevard and only then turn southwards towards the districts of Lyublino. Although this left out the possibility of railway transfer with Kurskaya, it did allow the metro to enter into the heart of the region more thoroughly.\n\n===1990s and later===\nThe change in plans, combined with the financial crises that beset the metro construction in the 1990s, meant that the first stage opened with delays. In late 1995 the first section finally opened, and a year later it would reach Maryino. Several problems were encountered with the construction, particularly for Dubrovka. This station was left incomplete due to nearby factories heating up the soil, which prevented the freezing of the underground water to allow the construction of an escalator tunnel. However, in the late 1990s, because of the financial crises which paralyzed most of the industries, the metro-builders were able to complete the station.\n\nDespite the delays, the line demonstrated some of the newest methods for metro-building. Deep-level stations were built on a monolithic concrete plate instead of a conventional tubular base. Also, the new wall-column design was introduced on two of the deep-level stations and a single-deck for the shallow ones. New finishing materials, such as a fibreglass vaults, were added to offer more reliable waterproofing.\n\nThe development of further extensions was for many years delayed and paralyzed by the lack of finances, and only in 2005 construction was resumed on the long-awaited second stage towards the city centre, with [[Trubnaya]] being the first to open on August 30, 2007. [[Sretensky Bulvar]] was opened on this section on December 29 the same year.\n\nThe second segment of a central extension was opened on June 19, 2010 (construction was resumed only in early 2007) and included two stations [[Dostoyevskaya (Moscow Metro)|Dostoyevskaya]] and [[Maryina Roshcha (Metro)|Maryina Roshcha]].\n\nIn a separate case, a three station extension from Maryino to Zyablikovo (Lyublinsky (southern) radius) began in 1997, but in 2000 the construction sites of the stations [[Borisovo (Moscow Metro)|Borisovo]], [[Shipilovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Shipilovskaya]], and [[Zyablikovo (Moscow Metro)|Zyablikovo]] was abandoned. The importance of this is that Zyablikovo will be a transfer to the [[Krasnogvardeyskaya (Moscow Metro)|Krasnogvardeyskaya]] station of the [[Zamoskvoretskaya line]]. In 2008 construction finally resumed and the stations were opened on 2 December 2011, together with the transfer to the Krasnogvardeyskaya station.\n\nThe extension of the line from Maryina Roshcha northwest to [[Petrovsko-Razumovskaya]] via [[Butyrskaya (Moscow Metro)|Butyrskaya]] and [[Fonvizinskaya (Moscow Metro)|Fonvizinskaya]] was originally planned to be opened in December 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interfax.ru/moscow/420845|title=\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \"\u041e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f\", \"\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041b\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b\" \u0438 \"\u0421\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\" \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u043e\u044e\u0442 \u0434\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0430 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430|date=29 January 2015|publisher=[[Interfax]]|language=Russian|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> The projected opening date was later shifted to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazeta-marfino.ru/?p=4586|title=\u041e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438 \"\u0411\u0443\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\" \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 2016 \u0433\u043e\u0434|date=25 June 2015|publisher=Marfino.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=7 October 2015}}</ref> The stations were opened on 16 September 2016.

[[81-717/714]] (including .5 and .5M modifications) wagons are used since the opening of the line. In 1998-2004 some new [[81-720/721]] (and .1) \"Yauza\" trains were received, but now their production is stopped. Some \"Yauza\" trains (except the original, which were retired) are still in service, but all the new rolling stock used on the line are 81-717/714.5/.5M and 81-717/714.6.\n\nSubway car types used on the line over the years:\n\n-Series 81-717.5: 1995 - present \n\n-Series 81-717.5M: 1995 - present\n\n-Series 81-720/721: 1998 - 2008\n\n-Series 81-720.1/721.1: 2005 - 2019\n\n-Series 81-717.6: 2011 - present \n\n-Series 81-760/761: 2016 (one train)\n\n==Future plans==\nThe line will continue northwards to the residential districts of Beskudnikovo, Degunino and Lianozovo. It is believed that the full radius will be operational by 2022, and by this time an extension to the [[Severny District, Moscow|Severny District]], beyond the [[MKAD]] (Moscow Circle Road), might be realised, although this might be in the form of light metro.\n\nIn early November 2017, it became known that between the stations [[Kozhukhovskaya]] and [[Pechatniki (Moscow Metro)|Pechatniki]] of the Lublin radius, a new station [[Yuzhny Port]] could be built, which will be located in the industrial zone. The decision on the construction of the station will be made depending on the financing of this project by private investors.\n\nIn the Fall of 2019, [[Andrey Bochkarev]] confirmed that the station is planned to be built before the end of 2023. According to the targeted investment program of Moscow from 2021 to 2023, 7 billion rubles will be allocated for the construction of the station with the working name [[Yuzhny Port]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Attached KML |display=title,inline}}\n*[http://urbanrail.net/eu/ru/mos/img/line-10.htm Photos and descriptions on Robert Schwandl's UrbanRail site]\n\n{{Moscow Metro Lines}}\n{{Moscow Metro|line10=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lyublinsko Dmitrovskaya line}}\n[[Category:Moscow Metro lines]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1995]]\n[[Category:Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line| ]]\n", "name_user": "138.121.152.45", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFuture plans:Adicionou, novos per\u00edodo, de Estudo devido,Crescimento intelectual de Moscow,no Cultural das nac\u00f5es, e Etnias Arquitet\u00f4nicas.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya_line"}
