{"title_page": "What Is Spiritism?", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n\n[[File:Qu'est-ce que.jpg|right|thumb|French edition, 1868.]]\n\n'''What Is Spiritism?''' (''Qu'Est-ce Que le Spiritisme'' in French) is a brief introduction to [[Spiritism]] written by [[Allan Kardec]] in 1859, which is about a quarter of the length of [[The Spirits Book]]. Modern editions are augmented by a brief [[biography]] of the author, written by [[Henri Sausse]], in 1896 which is mostly focused on his role in the [[History of Spiritism]].\n\nThe book is structured as a series of [[:wikt:conference|conference]]s about Spiritism, intended to quench the public curiosity and dismiss false notions about the doctrine. It is not intended as an initiation and is not seen by Spiritists as strictly canonical but it is very important to understand Kardec's own motivations and commitment to the cause of Spiritism, as the book was entirely penned by himself, without ''spiritual help''. Its central subjects are the following.\n\n==Criticism of Spiritism==\nKardec tries to address the most common theses argued against [[Spiritism]] regarding it as a form of [[charlatan]]ism. He counters the critics with the following:\n\n* Spiritism is not a religion and is not interested on [[proselitism|proselitising]].\n* Spiritism is not for everyone, only for those who are ready to accept it.\n* Spiritism will survive religion because it is not based on blind faith.\n* Spiritism does not extort money from followers, everything is taught for free.\n* Charges of [[charlatan]]ism will not affect Spiritism because charlatans are moved by selfishness and usually want to make a stash, so they expose themselves by their own deeds. The public will eventually learn to tell the ''black sheep'' apart.\n\n==Skepticism==\nKardec tries to address [[skeptic]]al views of Spiritism, regarding its doctrinary uniformity and validity, its scientific character and the novelty of its concepts.\n\n* The terms Spiritism and Spiritist are necessary to differ them from generic [[Spiritualism]]. They are not vain [[neologism]]s.\n* The existing of offshoot Spiritist groups is not undesirable, but a consequence of the spreading of the doctrine. Kardec does not claim any form of leadership, except on moral grounds (as the author of the books that first established Spiritism as a coherent doctrine), and does not expect Spiritism to survive him as \"Kardecism\". The only problem is when some group purporting to be \"Spiritist\" spreads false doctrine.\n* Spiritism is not [[superstition]]. It is a rational explanation of natural phenomena which [[science]] cannot assess.\n* Spiritism is not [[witchcraft]].\n* Spiritism is not inherently dangerous for mental sanity, not if one is aware of the risks and acts with responsibility.\n\n==Opposition of the Church==\nConfronting the criticism wielded by the [[Catholic Church]], Kardec argues that religious diversity is important and that the existence of only one religion in the [[Middle Ages]] was a fertile ground for the [[Inquisition]] and [[culture|cultural]] backwardness.\n\nDiversity is also important because the coexistence of different doctrines may help people who disagree with one specific doctrine to find one that suits them better.

This variation in water level alternately compresses and decompresses trapped air above, which causes air to flow backwards and forwards through a pair of contra-rotating turbines.\n\n==Decommissioning==\n[[File:200- MG 1771.jpg |thumb|left|LIMPET with all installations removed except the wave chamber (8&nbsp;August 2018)]]\nThe plant has been decommissioned, and as of 2018 all installations except the concrete construction making up the wave chamber have been removed.\n\n==Related installations==\nBased on this design, a 16 turbine plant was built in the Bay of Biscay in Spain, the [[Mutriku Breakwater Wave Plant]], which was fully operational and handed over to the company in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/News/Inverness-firm-alunches-first-tidal-wave-project-16112011.htm| title=Inverness firm hands over the world's first full life wave power plant| publisher=Inverness Courier| date=17 November 2011| access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scotland|Water|Renewable energy}}}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110220031301/http://www.wavegen.co.uk/pdf/LIMPET%20publishable%20report.pdf Islay LIMPET wave power plant (Wavegen website)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090804132537/http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/WelcometoSustainableDevelopmentatQueens/RelatedResearch/LIMPET/ LIMPET at Queen's University Belfast]\n\n{{Energy in the United Kingdom|sources}}\n{{Renewable energy by country}}\n{{Sustainable development in Scotland}}\n\n[[Category:Islay]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Argyll and Bute]]\n[[Category:Wave farms in Scotland]]\n", "name_user": "Archon 2488", "label": "safe", "comment": "hyphenate", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islay_LIMPET"}
