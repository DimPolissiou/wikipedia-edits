Critics perceived these last-minute changes as signs that the CBC had underestimated viewer interest in the Pan Am Games.<ref name=torstar-cbclive/><ref name=np-resources/>\n\nCBC Sports head of programming Trevor Pilling explained that the large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that \"I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task.\"<ref name=torstar-cbclive/><ref name=np-resources/>\n\nWhile the ''[[National Post]]'' also felt that budget cuts faced by the CBC in recent years, including those imposed following the loss of its [[Hockey Night in Canada|national broadcast rights]] to the [[National Hockey League]] to [[Rogers Media]], may have also had an impact\u2014with a CBC spokesperson arguing that \"resources\" were a factor, Pilling denied that this was the case, arguing that it was \"about the planning, It is about making good, sound business decisions\", and promised that there would be extensive coverage of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=torstar-cbclive>{{cite news|title=CBC head of sports defends Pan Am Games coverage: Mudhar|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/panamgames/2015/07/24/cbc-head-of-sports-defends-pan-am-games-coverage-mudhar.html|accessdate=August 19, 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref><ref name=np-resources>{{cite news|title='Resources are a factor' in Pan Am Games broadcasts, CBC says after facing criticism for gaps in coverage|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/cbc-following-staffing-cuts-in-sports-criticized-for-gaps-in-pan-am-games-coverage-for-sure-resources-are-a-factor|accessdate=August 19, 2015|work=National Post}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|\n30em|\nrefs=\n<ref name=GlobeAndMail2015-07-03>\n{{cite news\n| url         = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/glamour-pride-and-cash-why-cities-compete-to-put-on-a-sports-spectacle/article25256020/\n| title       =  Glamour, pride and cash: Why cities compete to put on a sports spectacle\n| work   = [[The Globe and Mail]]\n| author      = Dakshana Bascaramurty\n| date        = July 3, 2015\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150721122858/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/glamour-pride-and-cash-why-cities-compete-to-put-on-a-sports-spectacle/article25256020/\n| archivedate = July 21, 2015\n| accessdate  = July 16, 2015\n| url-status     = live\n| quote       = Winnipeg \u2013 the only other Canadian city ever to be a Pan Am host, which it has done twice \u2013 had a modest goal as well as a modest budget.\n}} <!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20150716234309/http://license.icopyright.net/user/viewFreeUse.act?fuid=MTk5NzE1Njg%3D -->\n</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|2015 Pan American Games}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.toronto2015.org/}}\n* [https://archive-it.org/collections/5421 Toronto 2015 Pan Am & Parapan American Games] \u2013 Web archive collected by the University of Toronto Libraries\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[2011 Pan American Games|Guadalajara]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=XVII [[Pan American Games]] <br /> [[Toronto]]|years=(2015)}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[2019 Pan American Games|Lima]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Sports|Canada|Ontario}}\n<!--Navigation boxes-->\n{{Pan American Games}}\n\n[[Category:2015 Pan American Games| ]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events in Canada]]\n[[Category:Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in multi-sport events|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in Toronto|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in North American sport|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in Canadian sports|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:July 2015 sports events in Canada|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:International sports competitions in Toronto]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|17th edition of the Pan American Games}}\n{{Redirect|Toronto 2015|the Parapan American Games|2015 Parapan American Games}}\n{{good article}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=June 2015}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox Pan American Games| 2015 | Pan American |\n| image       = 2015 Pan American Games logo.svg\n| image_size  = 250\n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| host_city   = [[Toronto]], Canada\n| motto       = ''United We Play''\n| nations     = 41\n| athletes    = 6,132\n| events      = 364 in 36 [[Pan American Games sports|sports]]\n| opening     = July 10\n| closing     = July 26\n| opened_by   = [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[David Johnston]]\n| cauldron    = [[Steve Nash]]\n| stadium     = [[Rogers Centre|Pan Am Dome]]\n| prev        = [[2011 Pan American Games|2011 Guadalajara]]\n| next        = [[2019 Pan American Games|2019 Lima]]\n}}\n{{Pan American Games series|2015}}\nThe '''2015 Pan American Games''' ({{lang-fr|Jeux Panam\u00e9ricains de 2015}}), officially the '''XVII Pan American Games''' and commonly known as the '''Toronto 2015 Pan-Am Games''' ({{lang-fr|Jeux panam\u00e9ricains de 2015 \u00e0 Toronto|links=no}}), were a major international [[multi-sport event]] celebrated in the tradition of the [[Pan American Games]], as governed by [[Pan American Sports Organization]] (PASO).

Most events were streamed online, and pay television channel [[Sportsnet]] aired the soccer tournaments on television, but events in some sports received only limited online coverage, or were not broadcast at all. Part-way through the Games, the CBC expanded its primetime coverage block, while broadcasts of a semi-final game in men's basketball on Sportsnet and the baseball finals online were added at the last minute. Critics perceived these last-minute changes as signs that the CBC had underestimated viewer interest in the Pan Am Games.<ref name=torstar-cbclive/><ref name=np-resources/>\n\nCBC Sports head of programming Trevor Pilling explained that the large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that \"I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task.\"<ref name=torstar-cbclive/><ref name=np-resources/>\n\nWhile the ''[[National Post]]'' also felt that budget cuts faced by the CBC in recent years, including those imposed following the loss of its [[Hockey Night in Canada|national broadcast rights]] to the [[National Hockey League]] to [[Rogers Media]], may have also had an impact\u2014with a CBC spokesperson arguing that \"resources\" were a factor, Pilling denied that this was the case, arguing that it was \"about the planning, It is about making good, sound business decisions\", and promised that there would be extensive coverage of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].<ref name=torstar-cbclive>{{cite news|title=CBC head of sports defends Pan Am Games coverage: Mudhar|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/panamgames/2015/07/24/cbc-head-of-sports-defends-pan-am-games-coverage-mudhar.html|accessdate=August 19, 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref><ref name=np-resources>{{cite news|title='Resources are a factor' in Pan Am Games broadcasts, CBC says after facing criticism for gaps in coverage|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/cbc-following-staffing-cuts-in-sports-criticized-for-gaps-in-pan-am-games-coverage-for-sure-resources-are-a-factor|accessdate=August 19, 2015|work=National Post}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|\n30em|\nrefs=\n<ref name=GlobeAndMail2015-07-03>\n{{cite news\n| url         = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/glamour-pride-and-cash-why-cities-compete-to-put-on-a-sports-spectacle/article25256020/\n| title       =  Glamour, pride and cash: Why cities compete to put on a sports spectacle\n| work   = [[The Globe and Mail]]\n| author      = Dakshana Bascaramurty\n| date        = July 3, 2015\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150721122858/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/glamour-pride-and-cash-why-cities-compete-to-put-on-a-sports-spectacle/article25256020/\n| archivedate = July 21, 2015\n| accessdate  = July 16, 2015\n| url-status     = live\n| quote       = Winnipeg \u2013 the only other Canadian city ever to be a Pan Am host, which it has done twice \u2013 had a modest goal as well as a modest budget.\n}} <!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20150716234309/http://license.icopyright.net/user/viewFreeUse.act?fuid=MTk5NzE1Njg%3D -->\n</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|2015 Pan American Games}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.toronto2015.org/}}\n* [https://archive-it.org/collections/5421 Toronto 2015 Pan Am & Parapan American Games] \u2013 Web archive collected by the University of Toronto Libraries\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[2011 Pan American Games|Guadalajara]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=XVII [[Pan American Games]] <br /> [[Toronto]]|years=(2015)}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[2019 Pan American Games|Lima]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Sports|Canada|Ontario}}\n<!--Navigation boxes-->\n{{Pan American Games}}\n\n[[Category:2015 Pan American Games| ]]\n[[Category:Multi-sport events in Canada]]\n[[Category:Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in Toronto]]\n[[Category:2015 in multi-sport events|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in Ontario|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in North American sport|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:2015 in Canadian sports|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:July 2015 sports events in Canada|Pan American Games]]\n[[Category:International sports competitions in Toronto]]\n", "name_user": "KingSkyLord", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Pan_American_Games"}

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:Cutter Huron-2.jpg|thumb|1883 sailing yacht, ''Huron'', a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]]]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:Cutter Huron-2.jpg|thumb|1883 sailing yacht, ''Huron'', a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]]]]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.
