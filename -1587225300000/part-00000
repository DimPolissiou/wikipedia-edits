The date is the anniversary of the [[Battle of Villalar]], in which Castilian rebels called Comuneros were dealt a crushing defeat by the royalist forces of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] on April 23, 1521.\n\nCommemoration of the Battle of Villalar was closely associated with liberal politics in Spain from the late 18th century until the 1970s, as conservatives generally sympathized with the royal government.  With the [[Spanish transition to democracy|demise of General Franco's government]], the day has broadened to a more general celebration of [[Castilian nationalism]] rather than only liberal politics.  The government of [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] established April 23 as an official holiday in 1986, although festivals have been held yearly since a decade earlier at [[Villalar de los Comuneros|Villalar]].\n\nApril 23 is the same day as [[St. George's Day]], with there being some crossover between the two holidays.\n\n\nOn the Le\u00f3n day 19 April if your name are Le\u00f3n you will get 100kr on the Le\u00f3n day.\n\n==Origins==\n{{see also|Revolt of the Comuneros}}\nThe birth of the [[Battle of Villalar]] as a rallying symbol for Spanish liberals dates back to the late 17th and early 18th centuries.  Le\u00f3n del Arroyal, an illustrious economist and protoliberal, stated that Villalar was \"the last breath of Castilian freedom\" in the latter half of the 18th century.  The Castilian Comuneros received their first major recognition during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', the three years of liberal government from 1820-1823.  Resistance fighter [[Juan Mart\u00edn D\u00edez]] ''\"El Empecinado\"'' organized an expedition to Villalar to search for the remains of Padilla, Bravo, and Maldonado, the executed leaders of the revolt.  These events took its climax with a festival and celebration of the Comuneros Revolt in the plaza of Villalar on April 23, 1821.  Members of left-leaning secret societies often referenced the revolt in their names, such as \"Los Comuneros\" or \"Sons of Padilla.\"  They also employed the purple banner, the flag flown by the comuneros rebels.  While dormant for a time after the [[List of Spanish monarchs#House of Bourbon|Bourbon Restoration to the Spanish throne]], occasional recognition of Villalar and the Comuneros came from some of the short-lived liberal governments of the period.  For instance, President [[Francisco Pi y Margall]] of the [[First Spanish Republic]] stated that \"Castile was among the first nations of Spain who lost their freedoms in Villalar under the first king of the House of Austria.\"\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century there were other attempts to celebrate at Villalar. Among them was a proposal by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zorita D\u00edez, a liberal deputy for Valladolid, who made a special request for funds to commemorate the [[Battle of Villalar]].  There were also various requests and preparations to celebrate the fourth centenary of the Battle in 1923; the city council of [[Palencia]] proposed in early 1923 that \"on next April 23, all the representatives of Castile go to the fields of Villalar and swear upon the Castilian Holy Grail, at the scene of the Fall... On the same day and at the same time all the cities of Castile dedicate a minute of silence to the heroes of Villalar.\"  Little came of these attempts to celebrate April 23, however.\n\n==History and official recognition==\n[[Image:Villalar-2005.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The 2005 celebration in Villalar]]\nBy the early 70s, much of the reputation of the Comuneros had been rehabilitated after generally positive portrayals by historians such as [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Maravall]], [[Juan Ignacio Guti\u00e9rrez Nieto]], and [[Joseph P\u00e9rez]]. In 1976, a gathering of about 400 people met at Villalar.  While they were violently dispersed by the [[Guardia Civil]], the meeting the next year was far larger, with almost 20,000 attendees to celebrate the Battle and organize Castilian groups.  The meetings continued on an unofficial basis until 1986, when the government of the then-recently recognized autonomous community of [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] granted its official stamp of approval.\n\nOn 22 April 1987, a sixteen years-old [[Punk subculture|punk]] died in Villalar, during a fight between punks and [[Heavy metal subculture|heavys]] at the town. The victim was stab-wounded twice.<ref>[http://elpais.com/diario/1987/04/24/espana/546213618_850215.html Un joven 'punk' muere apu\u00f1alado en una reyerta en Villalar de los Comuneros] [[El Pa\u00eds]], 24 April 1987 {{in lang|es}}</ref> The killer was detained on April 27, and recognized the aggression.<ref>[http://elpais.com/diario/1987/04/28/espana/546559224_850215.html Detenido el presunto autor de la muerte de un joven 'punk' en Villalar de los Comuneros] El Pa\u00eds, 28 April 1987 {{in lang|es}}</ref> On late September that year, the aggressor hanged himself to death in [[Villanubla]] Prison, [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]], allegedly due to a [[Depression (mood)|depression]] episode.<ref>[http://elpais.com/diario/1987/09/29/espana/559868415_850215.html Abierta una investigaci\u00f3n sobre la muerte en la c\u00e1rcel del presunto asesino de un joven en Villalar] El Pa\u00eds, 29 September 1987 {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\n==Modern observance==\n[[Image:Villalar-2006.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The 2006 floral offering to the Comuneros in Villalar]]\nThe acts normally begin on the evening of April 22, with performances by musical groups and a zone of free camping for the night.

The date is the anniversary of the [[Battle of Villalar]], in which Castilian rebels called Comuneros were dealt a crushing defeat by the royalist forces of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] on April 23, 1521.\n\nCommemoration of the Battle of Villalar was closely associated with liberal politics in Spain from the late 18th century until the 1970s, as conservatives generally sympathized with the royal government.  With the [[Spanish transition to democracy|demise of General Franco's government]], the day has broadened to a more general celebration of [[Castilian nationalism]] rather than only liberal politics.  The government of [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] established April 23 as an official holiday in 1986, although festivals have been held yearly since a decade earlier at [[Villalar de los Comuneros|Villalar]].\n\nApril 23 is the same day as [[St. George's Day]], with there being some crossover between the two holidays.\n\n==Origins==\n{{see also|Revolt of the Comuneros}}\nThe birth of the [[Battle of Villalar]] as a rallying symbol for Spanish liberals dates back to the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

generations of the iPhone use Apple's [[iOS]] mobile operating system software. The [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.\n\nThe [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]]. The iPhone has [[Wi-Fi]] and can connect to [[cellular network]]s. An iPhone can [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive [[email|emails]], [[web browser|browse the web]], send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]], record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive [[visual voicemail]]. [[video camera|Shooting video]] also became a standard feature with the [[iPhone 3GS]]. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading [[mobile app]]s. {{As of|2017|1}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contained more than 2.2&nbsp;million applications available for the iPhone.\n\nApple has released thirteen [[Comparison of Apple iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the thirteen major releases of the [[iOS]] operating system. The [[IPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone and established design precedents, such as a placement of certain buttons that has persisted throughout all releases to date. The first iPhone also set a screen size that was maintained for the next four iterations. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] network support and was followed by the [[iPhone 3GS]] with improved hardware, the [[iPhone 4]] with a metal chassis, higher display resolution, and front-facing camera, and the [[iPhone 4S]] with improved hardware and the voice assistant [[Siri]]. The [[iPhone 5]] featured a taller, {{convert|4|in|mm}} display and Apple's newly introduced [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. In 2013, Apple released the [[iPhone 5S]] with improved hardware and a [[Touch ID|fingerprint reader]] (marketed as 'Touch ID'), and the lower-cost [[iPhone 5C]], a version of the 5 with a plastic body, instead of metal one. The 5C was also available in many colors. They were followed by the larger [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]], with models featuring {{convert|4.7|and|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} displays. The [[iPhone 6S]] was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for [[3D Touch|pressure-sensitive touch inputs]], as well as the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|iPhone SE]]\u2014which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 7|iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus]], which add water resistance, improved system, and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack found on previous models. The [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The [[iPhone X]] was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera, and a new facial recognition system, named [[Face ID]], but having no home button, and therefore, no [[Touch ID]]. In September 2018, Apple released 3 new iPhones, which are the [[iPhone XS]], an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, [[iPhone XS Max]], a larger variant with the series' biggest display {{as of|2018|lc=y}} and [[iPhone XR]], a lower-end version of the iPhone X. On September 10, 2019, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are [[iPhone 11 Pro]], [[iPhone 11 Pro Max]], and the lower-end [[iPhone 11]]. On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation [[iPhone SE (2nd generation)|iPhone SE]] as a successor to both the original iPhone SE and the iPhone 8, featuring hardware from the 11 and 11 Pro in a design nearly identical to the iPhone 8.\n\nThe first-generation iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise. The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|most valuable publicly traded companies]].\n\nAs of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.<ref name=\"Lifewire\"/>\n\n==History and

Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.\n\nThe original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages ([[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]]. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was introduced in iPhone OS 2 for the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. [[Compass]] was added in iPhone OS 3 for the iPhone 3GS. FaceTime and Game Center were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as a new version of Maps called Apple Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources, and YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application starting from that version. iOS 7 introduced a modern flat design for the interface and added a motion-based parallax feature to give the device a quasi-3D effect. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with [[Apple News|News]] and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]]. iOS 10 introduces Home and dedicated a page on the home screen for the widgets. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduces Measure, an app that uses [[Augmented reality|AR]] technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an [[Apple A9|A9]] chip or newer.\n\nDocked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142319/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.<ref name=\"Update 1.1.3\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230427/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|archivedate=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]], [[iPhone 3G|3G]], [[iPhone 4|4]] and [[iPhone 4S|4S]]; The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C|5C]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]], and [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|SE (1st)]] hold up to twenty-four icons; while the [[iPhone 6]] and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.<ref name=\"3.0 official\"/><ref name=\"3.0 Macworld\"/>\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface [[Physics engine|simulates the physics]] of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes ''upwards'', as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Siracusa Frontier\">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=The Frontier|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2007/06/the-frontier/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Apple's Mousetrap\">{{cite web|last1=Agger|first1=Michael|title=Apple's Mousetrap|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/apples_mousetrap.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Phone===\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including [[FaceTime]] on supported models. The screen is [[Proximity sensor|automatically disabled]] when held close to the face.]]\nThe iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out and fades back in when the call has ended.\n\nThe [[proximity sensor]] shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches.

The user can reply with a message, or set a reminder to call them back at a later time.<ref>{{cite web|title=iOS 6 Preview|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multimedia===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]]. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.\n\nUsers can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].<ref name=\"Voice_Control\"/>\n\nThe iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 8, 2008 |title=What is Gapless Playback? |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.\n\nThe iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone.

The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera.

The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.\n\nAssistiveTouch helps to adapt the [[Multi-touch|Multi-Touch]] screen of an iOS device to a user's unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures, like rotate and shake, are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a [[wheelchair]].<ref name=\"Accessibility \u2013 iOS \u2013 Apple\"/>\n\nGuided Access helps people with [[autism]] or other [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention]] and [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory challenges]] stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.\n\nIn 2019 Apple began developing satellites so that the iPhone could skip wireless carriers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Axon |first1=Samuel |title=Report: Apple is developing satellites so the iPhone can skip wireless carriers |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/report-apple-is-developing-satellites-so-the-iphone-can-skip-wireless-carriers/?bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369 |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=26 December 2019 |language=en-us |date=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\n{{See also|List of iOS devices#iPhone}}\n25 different iPhone models have been produced.

The \"iPhone\" term was registered by Gradiente in 2000, 7 years before Apple's release of its first iPhone.

\"deceive\" or \"cause confusion\" among consumers.\n\nApple lost the trademark battle to Solid Group in a 2015 decision made by IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the \"iPhone\" and the \"MyPhone\". \"This is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of

generations of the iPhone use Apple's [[iOS]] mobile operating system software. The [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.\n\nThe [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]]. The iPhone has [[Wi-Fi]] and can connect to [[cellular network]]s. An iPhone can [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive [[email|emails]], [[web browser|browse the web]], send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]], record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive [[visual voicemail]]. [[video camera|Shooting video]] also became a standard feature with the [[iPhone 3GS]]. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading [[mobile app]]s. {{As of|2017|1}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contained more than 2.2&nbsp;million applications available for the iPhone.\n\nApple has released thirteen [[Comparison of Apple iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the thirteen major releases of the [[iOS]] operating system. The [[IPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone and established design precedents, such as a placement of certain buttons that has persisted throughout all releases to date. The first iPhone also set a screen size that was maintained for the next four iterations. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] network support and was followed by the [[iPhone 3GS]] with improved hardware, the [[iPhone 4]] with a metal chassis, higher display resolution, and front-facing camera, and the [[iPhone 4S]] with improved hardware and the voice assistant [[Siri]]. The [[iPhone 5]] featured a taller, {{convert|4|in|mm}} display and Apple's newly introduced [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. In 2013, Apple released the [[iPhone 5S]] with improved hardware and a [[Touch ID|fingerprint reader]] (marketed as 'Touch ID'), and the lower-cost [[iPhone 5C]], a version of the 5 with a plastic body, instead of metal one. The 5C was also available in many colors. They were followed by the larger [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]], with models featuring {{convert|4.7|and|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} displays. The [[iPhone 6S]] was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for [[3D Touch|pressure-sensitive touch inputs]], as well as the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|iPhone SE]]\u2014which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 7|iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus]], which add water resistance, improved system, and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack found on previous models. The [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The [[iPhone X]] was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera, and a new facial recognition system, named [[Face ID]], but having no home button, and therefore, no [[Touch ID]]. In September 2018, Apple released 3 new iPhones, which are the [[iPhone XS]], an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, [[iPhone XS Max]], a larger variant with the series' biggest display {{as of|2018|lc=y}} and [[iPhone XR]], a lower-end version of the iPhone X. On September 10, 2019, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are [[iPhone 11 Pro]], [[iPhone 11 Pro Max]], and the lower-end [[iPhone 11]]. On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation [[iPhone SE (2nd generation)|iPhone SE]] as a successor to both the original iPhone SE and the iPhone 8, featuring hardware from the 11 and 11 Pro in a design nearly identical to the iPhone 8.\n\nThe first-generation iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise. The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's [[List of public corporations by market

While [[iOS 8]] required over 4.5&nbsp;GB, [[iOS 9|its successor]] required only 1.3&nbsp;GB.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Lory |last1=Gil |first2=Daniel |last2=Bader |first3=Serenity |last3=Caldwell |first4=Rene |last4=Ritchie |title=iOS 10 FAQ: Everything you need to know |url=http://www.imore.com/ios-10-faq |website=iMore |date=September 7, 2016 |accessdate=May 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Interface===\nThe [[Graphical user interface|interface]] is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. iPhone applications normally run one at a time. Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play. Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications.<ref>applications</ref> However, the apps never ran in the background. Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.\n\nThe original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages ([[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]]. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was introduced in iPhone OS 2 for the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. [[Compass]] was added in iPhone OS 3 for the iPhone 3GS. FaceTime and Game Center were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as a new version of Maps called Apple Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources, and YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application starting from that version. iOS 7 introduced a modern flat design for the interface and added a motion-based parallax feature to give the device a quasi-3D effect. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with [[Apple News|News]] and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]]. iOS 10 introduces Home and dedicated a page on the home screen for the widgets. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduces Measure, an app that uses [[Augmented reality|AR]] technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an [[Apple A9|A9]] chip or newer.\n\nDocked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142319/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.<ref name=\"Update 1.1.3\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230427/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|archivedate=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]], [[iPhone 3G|3G]], [[iPhone 4|4]] and [[iPhone 4S|4S]]; The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C|5C]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]], and [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|SE (1st)]] hold up to twenty-four icons; while the [[iPhone 6]] and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.<ref name=\"3.0 official\"/><ref name=\"3.0 Macworld\"/>\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface [[Physics engine|simulates the physics]] of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes ''upwards'', as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Siracusa Frontier\">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=The Frontier|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2007/06/the-frontier/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Apple's Mousetrap\">{{cite web|last1=Agger|first1=Michael|title=Apple's Mousetrap|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/apples_mousetrap.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Phone===\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including [[FaceTime]] on supported models. The screen is [[Proximity sensor|automatically disabled]] when held close to the face.]]\nThe iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out and fades back in when the call has ended.\n\nThe [[proximity sensor]] shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches. The iPhone does not support [[Videophone|video calling]] or [[videoconferencing]] on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen.<ref>{{cite web |first=Donald |last=Melanson |title=Mirror-based video conferencing developed for iPhone |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/08/13/mirror-based-video-conferencing-developed-for-iphone/ |work=[[Engadget]] |date=August 13, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe iPhone 4 supports video calling using either the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls [[FaceTime]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/facetime.html|title=Apple&nbsp;\u2013 iPhone 4&nbsp;\u2013 One-tap video calling with FaceTime on iPhone 43|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}</ref> Voice control, introduced in the iPhone 3GS, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial it.<ref name=\"Voice_Control\">{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/voice-control.html|title=iPhone: Make calls and play music using voice control|date=June 10, 2009|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610213018/http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/voice-control.html|archivedate=June 10, 2009}}</ref> The first two models only support [[voice command device|voice dialing]] through third-party applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137421/2008/12/voicedialers.html|title=Review: iPhone voice dialers|last=Tessler|first=Franklin|date=December 12, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe iPhone includes a [[visual voicemail]] (in some countries)<ref name=\"VV_abroad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/iphone-3g-carriers-apple-vary-on-visual-voicemail|title=iPhone 3G carriers, Apple vary on Visual Voicemail|last=Starrett|first=Charles|date=June 11, 2008|work=iLounge|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}</ref> feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail.

Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be three to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or [[infinite loop|loop continuously]].

The user can reply with a message, or set a reminder to call them back at a later time.<ref>{{cite web|title=iOS 6 Preview|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multimedia===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]]. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.\n\nUsers can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].<ref name=\"Voice_Control\"/>\n\nThe iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 8, 2008 |title=What is Gapless Playback? |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.\n\nThe iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone. The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but since 2012, it can be used on a cellular data network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#thu-27-wifi|title=The Reason It's Called the Wi-Fi Music Store|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=January 6, 2008|first=John|last=Gruber|work=[[Daring Fireball]]|authorlink=John Gruber }}</ref>\n\nThe iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows PC.\n\n===Internet connectivity===\n[[File:Safari on iOS 12 iPhone X Landscape.png|thumb|Wikipedia on the iPhone [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]] in landscape mode]]\n\nInternet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area [[Wi-Fi]] or a wide area [[GSM]] or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] network, both second-generation ([[2G]]) wireless data standards.

The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.\n\nAssistiveTouch helps to adapt the [[Multi-touch|Multi-Touch]] screen of an iOS device to a user's unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures, like rotate and shake, are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a [[wheelchair]].<ref name=\"Accessibility \u2013 iOS \u2013 Apple\"/>\n\nGuided Access helps people with [[autism]] or other [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention]] and [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory challenges]] stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.\n\nIn 2019 Apple began developing satellites so that the iPhone could skip wireless carriers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Axon |first1=Samuel |title=Report: Apple is developing satellites so the iPhone can skip wireless carriers |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/report-apple-is-developing-satellites-so-the-iphone-can-skip-wireless-carriers/?bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369 |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=26 December 2019 |language=en-us |date=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\n{{See also|List of iOS devices#iPhone}}\n25 different iPhone models have been produced.

James Album''''' is the [[Eponym|eponymous]] fourth studio album by British [[electronic music|electronic]] musician Richard D. James, under his [[pseudonym]] [[Aphex Twin]]. In the United Kingdom, the album was released on 4&nbsp;November 1996 through [[Warp (record label)|Warp]]. In the United States, it was released on 28&nbsp;January 1997 by [[Sire Records]], with the ''[[Girl/Boy EP|Girl/Boy]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] included as bonus tracks. A reissue on [[Phonograph record|vinyl]] was released on 18 September 2012.\n\n''Richard D. James Album'' was composed by James on his [[Macintosh]] computer, and took longer to complete than his previous efforts. The album features faster [[breakbeat]]s and [[Programming (music)|drum programming]] which draw influence from [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]], combined with lush [[String section|string arrangements]], unstable [[time signature]]s, and slow [[Ambient music|ambient]] melodies reminiscent of James' earlier work. The bonus tracks feature [[Modulation (music)|modulated]] vocals by James.\n\n''Richard D. James Album'' was less successful in the United Kingdom than James' two previous albums ''[[Selected Ambient Works Volume II]]'' (1994) and ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'' (1995). However, the album still charted in the UK, peaking at number 62 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] for one week. It also peaked at number 20 in the US [[Top Heatseekers Albums|Top Heatseekers]] list, becoming James' first to do so. The album received acclaim from music critics, and ''[[NME]]'' listed it as the 20th best album of the year.\n\n==Background and production==\nIn 1995, Richard James released his third album, ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'', to critical acclaim. In the following year, James and fellow electronic musician [[Mike Paradinas]] released a collaboration album, ''[[Expert Knob Twiddlers]]'', to lukewarm critical response. In August 1996, James released a solo [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Girl/Boy EP|Girl/Boy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aphex Twin The Contrarian|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/aphex_twin-contrarian|work=[[Exclaim!]]|last=Turenne|first=Martin|date=1 April 2003|accessdate=12 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703002122/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/aphex_twin-contrarian|archivedate=3 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luke Vibert 2.JPG|thumb|right|The breakbeats on ''Richard D.

James Album''''' is the [[Eponym|eponymous]] fourth studio album by British [[electronic music|electronic]] musician Richard D. James, under his [[pseudonym]] [[Aphex Twin]]. In the United Kingdom, the album was released on 4&nbsp;November 1996 through [[Warp (record label)|Warp]]. In the United States, it was released on 28&nbsp;January 1997 by [[Sire Records]], with the ''[[Girl/Boy EP|Girl/Boy]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] included as bonus tracks. A reissue on [[Phonograph record|vinyl]] was released on 18 September 2012.\n\n''Richard D. James Album'' was composed by James on his [[Macintosh]] computer, and took longer to complete than his previous efforts. The album features faster [[breakbeat]]s and [[Programming (music)|drum programming]] which draw influence from [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] and [[drum and bass]], combined with lush [[String section|string arrangements]], unstable [[time signature]]s, and slow [[Ambient music|ambient]] melodies reminiscent of James' earlier work. The bonus tracks feature [[Modulation (music)|modulated]] vocals by James.\n\n''Richard D. James Album'' was less successful in the United Kingdom than James' two previous albums ''[[Selected Ambient Works Volume II]]'' (1994) and ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'' (1995). However, the album still charted in the UK, peaking at number 62 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] for one week. It also peaked at number 20 in the US [[Top Heatseekers Albums|Top Heatseekers]] list, becoming James' first to do so. The album received acclaim from music critics, and ''[[NME]]'' listed it as the 20th best album of the year.\n\n==Background and production==\nIn 1995, Richard James released his third album, ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'', to critical acclaim. In the following year, James and fellow electronic musician [[Mike Paradinas]] released a collaboration album, ''[[Expert Knob Twiddlers]]'', to lukewarm critical response. In August 1996, James released a solo [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Girl/Boy EP|Girl/Boy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aphex Twin The Contrarian|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/aphex_twin-contrarian|work=[[Exclaim!]]|last=Turenne|first=Martin|date=1 April 2003|accessdate=12 October 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703002122/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/aphex_twin-contrarian|archivedate=3 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luke Vibert 2.JPG|thumb|right|The breakbeats on ''Richard D.

Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref> More recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s. Mezze may be as simple as raw or [[pickled vegetables]], [[hummus]], [[baba ghanouj]] and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated [[seafood]], skewered meats, a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. Family cuisine offers also a range of dishes, such as stews (or yakhneh), which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with [[meat]] and rice vermicelli. Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Lebanese meal, there is also [[dessert]], such as [[baklava]] and [[coffee]].

Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref> More recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s. Mezze may be as simple as raw or [[pickled vegetables]], [[hummus]], [[baba ghanouj]] and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated [[seafood]], skewered meats, a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. Family cuisine offers also a range of dishes, such as stews (or yakhneh), which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with [[meat]] and rice vermicelli. Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Lebanese meal, there is also [[dessert]], such as [[baklava]] and [[coffee]].

{"title_page": "Semigroup with involution", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[abstract algebra]], a '''semigroup with involution''' or a '''*-semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] equipped with an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[anti-automorphism]], which\u2014roughly speaking\u2014brings it closer to a [[group (mathematics)|group]] because this involution, considered as [[unary operator]], exhibits certain fundamental properties of the operation of taking the inverse in a group: uniqueness, double application \"cancelling itself out\", and the same interaction law with the binary operation as in the case of the group inverse. It is thus not a surprise that any group is a semigroup with involution. However, there are significant natural examples of semigroups with involution that are not groups.\n\nAn example from [[linear algebra]] is the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] [[monoid]] of [[Real number|real]] square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of order&nbsp;''n'' (called the [[full linear monoid]]). The [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends a matrix to its [[transpose]] is an involution because the transpose is well defined for any matrix and obeys the law {{nowrap|1=(''AB'')<sup>T</sup> = ''B''<sup>T</sup>''A''<sup>T</sup>}}, which has the same form of interaction with multiplication as taking inverses has in the [[general linear group]] (which is a subgroup of the full linear monoid). However, for an arbitrary matrix, ''AA''<sup>T</sup> does not equal the identity element (namely the [[diagonal matrix]]). Another example, coming from [[formal language]] theory, is the [[free semigroup]] generated by a [[nonempty set]] (an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]), with string [[concatenation]] as the binary operation, and the involution being the map which [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reverse]]s the [[linear order]] of the letters in a string. A third example, from basic [[set theory]], is the set of all [[binary relation]]s between a set and itself, with the involution being the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]].\n\nSemigroups with involution appeared explicitly named in a 1953 paper of [[Viktor Wagner]] (in Russian) as result of his attempt to bridge the theory of semigroups with that of [[semiheap]]s.<ref name=\"Hollings2014\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|year=2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=265}}</ref>\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet ''S'' be a [[semigroup]] with its binary operation written multiplicatively. An involution in ''S'' is a [[unary operation]] * on ''S'' (or, a transformation * : ''S'' \u2192 ''S'',  ''x'' \u21a6 ''x''*) satisfying the following conditions:\n# For all ''x'' in ''S'', (''x''*)* = ''x''.\n# For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'' we have (''xy'')* = ''y''*''x''*.\n\nThe semigroup ''S'' with the involution * is called a semigroup with involution.\n\nSemigroups that satisfy only the first of these axioms belong to the larger class of [[U-semigroup]]s.\n\nIn some applications, the second of these axioms has been called [[antidistributive]].<ref name=\"BrinkKahl1997\">{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|page=4}}</ref> Regarding the natural philosophy of this axiom, [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.S.M. Coxeter]] remarked that it \"becomes clear when we think of [x] and [y] as the operations of putting on our socks and shoes, respectively.\"<ref>H.S.M. Coxeter, ''Introduction to Geometry'', p. 33</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n# If ''S'' is a [[commutative]] semigroup then the [[identity function|identity map]] of S is an involution.\n# If ''S'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] then the inversion map * : ''S'' \u2192 ''S''  defined by ''x''* = ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> is an involution. Furthermore, on an [[abelian group]] both this map and the one from the previous example are involutions satisfying the axioms of semigroup with involution.<ref name=\"BergChristensen2012\">{{cite book|author1=C. van den Berg|author2=J.

As noted in the previous example, the inversion map is not necessarily the only map with this property in an inverse semigroup. There may well be other involutions that leave all idempotents invariant; for example the identity map on a commutative regular, hence inverse, semigroup, in particular, an abelian group. A [[regular semigroup]] is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if it admits an involution under which each idempotent is an invariant.<ref>Munn, Lemma 1</ref>\n# Underlying every [[C*-algebra]] is a *-semigroup. An important [[C*-algebra#Finite-dimensional C*-algebras|instance]] is the algebra ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') of ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''[[Complex number|C]]''', with the [[conjugate transpose]] as involution.\n# {{anchor|ex5}} If ''X'' is a set, the set of all [[binary relation]]s on ''X'' is a *-semigroup with the * given by the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]]. This is an example of a *-semigroup which is not a regular semigroup.\n# {{anchor|ex6}} If X is a set, then the set of all finite sequences (or [[String (computer science)|strings]]) of members of X forms a [[free monoid]] under the operation of concatenation of sequences, with sequence reversal as an involution.\n# {{anchor|ex7}} A [[rectangular band]] on a Cartesian product of a set ''A'' with itself, i.e. with elements from ''A'' \u00d7 ''A'', with the semigroup product defined as (''a'', ''b'')(''c'', ''d'') = (''a'', ''d''), with the involution being the order reversal of the elements of a pair (''a'', ''b'')* = (''b'', ''a''). This semigroup is also a [[regular semigroup]], as all bands are.<ref name=\"Nordahl and Scheiblich\">Nordahl and Scheiblich</ref>\n\n==Basic concepts and properties==\nAn element ''x'' of a semigroup with involution is sometimes called ''hermitian'' (by analogy with a [[Hermitian matrix]]) when it is left invariant by the involution, meaning ''x''* = ''x''. Elements of the form ''xx''* or ''x''*''x'' are always hermitian, and so are all powers of a hermitian element. As noted in the examples section, a semigroup ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]] and admits an involution such that every idempotent is hermitian.<ref>Easdown, David, and W. D. Munn. \"On semigroups with involution.\" Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 48.01 (1993): 93\u2013100.</ref>\n\nCertain basic concepts may be defined on *-semigroups in a way that parallels the notions stemming from a [[Regular semigroup|regular element in a semigroup]]. A ''partial isometry'' is an element ''s''  such that ''ss''*''s'' = ''s''; the set of partial isometries of a semigroup ''S'' is usually abbreviated PI(''S'').<ref>Lawson, p. 116</ref> A ''projection'' is an idempotent element ''e'' that is also hermitian, meaning that ''ee'' = ''e'' and ''e''* = ''e''. Every projection is a partial isometry, and for every partial isometry ''s'', ''s''*''s'' and ''ss''* are projections. If ''e'' and ''f'' are projections, then ''e'' = ''ef'' if and only if ''e'' = ''fe''.<ref name=\"L117\">Lawson, p. 117</ref>\n\nPartial isometries can be [[partial order|partially ordered]] by ''s'' \u2264 ''t'' defined as holding whenever ''s'' = ''ss''*''t'' and ''ss''* = ''ss''*''tt''*.<ref name=\"L117\"/> Equivalently, ''s'' \u2264 ''t'' if and only if  ''s'' = ''et'' and ''e'' = ''ett''* for some projection ''e''.<ref name=\"L117\"/> In a *-semigroup, PI(''S'') is an [[ordered groupoid]] with the [[Partial groupoid|partial product]] given by ''s''&sdot;''t'' = ''st'' if ''s''*''s'' = ''tt''*.<ref>Lawson, p. 118</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\nIn terms of examples for these notions, in the *-semigroup of binary relations on a set, the partial isometries are the relations that are [[difunctional]]. The projections in this *-semigroup are the [[partial equivalence relation]]s.<ref>Lawson p.122 and p.35</ref>\n\nThe [[partial isometry|partial isometries]] in a C*-algebra are exactly those defined in this section. In the case of ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') more can be said. If ''E'' and ''F'' are projections, then ''E'' \u2264 ''F'' if and only if [[Image (mathematics)|im]]''E'' \u2286 im''F''. For any two projection, if ''E'' \u2229 ''F'' = ''V'', then the unique projection ''J'' with image ''V'' and kernel the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''V'' is the meet of ''E'' and ''F''. Since projections form a meet-[[semilattice]], the partial isometries on ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') form an inverse semigroup with the product <math>A(A^*A\\wedge BB^*)B</math>.<ref>Lawson p.120</ref>\n\nAnother simple example of these notions appears in the next section.\n\n== Notions of regularity ==\nThere are two related, but not identical notions of regularity in *-semigroups. They were introduced nearly simultaneously by Nordahl & Scheiblich (1978) and respectively Drazin (1979).<ref>Crvenkovic and Dolinka</ref>\n\n=== Regular *-semigroups (Nordahl & Scheiblich) ===\nAs mentioned in the [[#Examples|previous examples]], [[inverse semigroup]]s are a subclass of *-semigroups. It is also textbook knowledge that an inverse semigroup can be characterized as a regular semigroup in which any two idempotents commute. In 1963, [[Boris M. Schein]] showed that the following two axioms provide an analogous characterization of inverse semigroups as a [[Variety (universal algebra)|subvariety]] of *-semigroups:\n\n* ''x'' = ''xx''*''x''\n* (''xx''*)(''x''*''x'') = (''x''*''x'')(''xx''*)\n\nThe first of these looks like the definition of a regular element, but is actually in terms of the involution. Likewise, the second axiom appears to be describing the commutation of two idempotents. It is known however that regular semigroups do not form a variety because their class does not contain [[free object]]s (a result established by [[D. B. McAlister]] in 1968). This line of reasoning motivated Nordahl and Scheiblich to begin in 1977 the study of the (variety of) *-semigroups that satisfy only the first these two axioms; because of the similarity in form with the property defining regular semigroups, they named this variety regular *-semigroups.\n\nIt is a simple calculation to establish that a regular *-semigroup is also a regular semigroup because ''x''* turns out to be an inverse of ''x''. The rectangular band from [[#ex7|Example 7]] is a regular *-semigroup that is not an inverse semigroup.<ref name=\"Nordahl and Scheiblich\"/> It is also easy to verify that in a regular *-semigroup the product of any two projections is an idempotent.<ref>Nordahl and Scheiblich, Theorem 2.5</ref> In the aforementioned rectangular band example, the projections are elements of the form (''x'', ''x'') and [like all elements of a band] are idempotent. However, two different projections in this band need not commute, nor is their product necessarily a projection since (''a'', ''a'')(''b'', ''b'') = (''a'', ''b'').\n\nSemigroups that satisfy only ''x''** = ''x'' = ''xx''*''x'' (but not necessarily the antidistributivity of * over multiplication) have also been studied under the name of [[I-semigroup]]s.\n\n====P-systems====\nThe problem of characterizing when a regular semigroup is a regular *-semigroup (in the sense of Nordahl & Scheiblich) was addressed by M. Yamada (1982). He defined a '''P-system''' F(S) as subset of the idempotents of S, denoted as usual by E(S). Using the usual notation V(''a'') for the inverses of ''a'', F(S) needs to satisfy the following axioms:\n\n# For any ''a'' in S, there exists a unique a\u00b0 in V(''a'') such that ''aa''\u00b0 and ''a''\u00b0''a'' are in F(S)\n# For any ''a'' in S, and b in F(S), ''a\u00b0ba'' is in F(S), where \u00b0 is the well-defined operation from the previous axiom\n# For any ''a'', ''b'' in F(S), ''ab'' is in E(S); note: not necessarily in F(S)\n\nA regular semigroup S is a *-regular semigroup, as defined by Nordahl & Scheiblich, if and only if it has a p-system F(S). In this case F(S) is the set of projections of S with respect to the operation \u00b0 defined by F(S). In an [[inverse semigroup]] the entire semilattice of idempotents is a p-system. Also, if a regular semigroup S has a p-system that is multiplicatively closed (i.e. subsemigroup), then S is an inverse semigroup. Thus, a p-system may be regarded as a generalization of the semilattice of idempotents of an inverse semigroup.\n\n===*-regular semigroups (Drazin)===\n{{anchor|Drazin}}\n{{expand section|clarify motivation for studying these|date=April 2015}}\nA semigroup ''S'' with an involution * is called a '''*-regular semigroup''' (in the sense of Drazin) if for every ''x'' in ''S'', ''x''* is ''H''-equivalent to some inverse of ''x'', where ''H'' is the [[Green's relations|Green's relation]] ''H''. This defining property can be formulated in several equivalent ways. Another is to say that every [[Green's relations#The L.2C R.2C and J relations|''L''-class]] contains a projection. An axiomatic definition is the condition that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exists an element ''x''\u2032 such that {{nowrap|1=''x''\u2032''xx''\u2032 = ''x''\u2032}}, {{nowrap|1=''xx''\u2032''x'' = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=(''xx''\u2032)* = ''xx''\u2032}}, {{nowrap|1=(''x''\u2032''x'')* = ''x''\u2032''x''}}. [[Michael P. Drazin]] first proved that given ''x'', the element ''x''\u2032 satisfying these axioms is unique. It is called the Moore\u2013Penrose inverse of ''x''. This agrees with the classical definition of the [[Moore\u2013Penrose inverse]] of a square matrix.\n\nOne motivation for studying these semigroups is that they allow generalizing the Moore\u2013Penrose inverse's properties from {{tmath|\\R }} and {{tmath|\\C }} to more general sets.\n\nIn the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] semigroup ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''C'') of square matrices of order ''n'', the map which assigns a matrix ''A'' to its [[Hermitian conjugate]] ''A''* is an involution. The semigroup ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''C'') is a *-regular semigroup with this involution. The Moore\u2013Penrose inverse of A in this *-regular semigroup is the classical Moore\u2013Penrose inverse of ''A''.\n\n==Free semigroup with involution ==\nAs with all varieties, the [[category theory|category]] of semigroups with involution admits [[free object]]s. The construction of a free semigroup (or monoid) with involution is based on that of a [[free semigroup]] (and respectively that of a free monoid). Moreover, the construction of a [[free group]] can easily be derived by refining the construction of a free monoid with involution.<ref name=\"L51\">Lawson p. 51</ref>\n\nThe [[Generator (mathematics)|generators]] of a free semigroup with involution are the elements of the union of two ([[equinumerous]]) [[disjoint sets]] in [[Bijection|bijective correspondence]]: <math>Y=X\\sqcup X^\\dagger</math>. (Here the notation <math>\\sqcup\\,</math> emphasized that the union is actually a [[disjoint union]].) In the case were the two sets are finite, their union ''Y'' is sometimes called an ''[[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] with involution''<ref name=\"EhrenfeuchtHarju1999\">{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Ehrenfeucht|author2=T.

Thus, the semigroup <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> with the map <math>{ }^\\dagger\\,</math> is a semigroup with involution, called a '''free semigroup with involution''' on ''X''.<ref name=\"L172\">Lawson p. 172</ref> (The irrelevance of the concrete identity of <math>X^\\dagger</math> and of the bijection <math>\\theta</math> in this choice of terminology is explained below in terms of the universal property of the construction.) Note that unlike in [[#ex6|Example 6]], the involution ''of every letter'' is a distinct element in an alphabet with involution, and consequently the same observation extends to a free semigroup with involution.\n\nIf in the above construction instead of <math>Y^+\\,</math> we use the [[free monoid]]  <math>Y^*=Y^+\\cup\\{\\varepsilon\\}</math>, which is just the free semigroup extended with the [[empty word]] <math>\\varepsilon\\,</math> (which is the [[identity element]] of the [[monoid]] <math>Y^*\\,</math>), and suitably extend the involution with <math>\\varepsilon^\\dagger = \\varepsilon</math>,\nwe obtain a '''free monoid with involution'''.<ref name=\"Lipscomb1996\"/>\n\nThe construction above is actually the only way to extend a given map <math>\\theta\\,</math> from <math>X\\,</math> to <math>X^\\dagger\\,</math>, to an involution on <math>Y^+\\,</math> (and likewise on <math>Y^*\\,</math>). The qualifier \"free\" for these constructions is justified in the usual sense that they are [[universal algebra|universal construction]]s. In the case of the free semigroup with involution, given an arbitrary semigroup with involution <math>S\\,</math> and a map <math>\\Phi:X\\rightarrow S</math>, then a [[semigroup homomorphism]] <math>\\overline\\Phi:(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+\\rightarrow S</math> exists such that <math>\\Phi = \\iota \\circ \\overline\\Phi</math>, where <math>\\iota : X \\rightarrow (X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> is the [[inclusion map]] and [[composition of functions]] is taken in [[Function composition#Alternative notations|diagram order]].<ref name=\"L172\"/> The construction of <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> as a semigroup with involution is unique up to [[isomorphism]]. An analogous argument holds for the free monoid with involution in terms of [[monoid homomorphism]]s and the uniqueness up to isomorphism of the construction of <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^*</math> as a monoid with involution.\n\nThe construction of a [[free group]] is not very far off from that of a free monoid with involution. The additional ingredient needed is to define a notion of [[reduced word]] and a [[rewriting]] rule for producing such words simply by deleting any adjacent pairs of letter of the form <math>xx^\\dagger</math> or <math>x^\\dagger x</math>. It can be shown than the order of rewriting (deleting) such pairs does not matter, i.e. any order of deletions produces the same result.<ref name=\"L51\"/> (Otherwise put, these rules define a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] rewriting system.) Equivalently, a free group is constructed from a free monoid with involution by taking the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient]] of the latter by the [[Congruence relation|congruence]] <math>\\{ (yy^\\dagger, \\varepsilon) : y\\in Y\\}</math>, which is sometimes called the '''Dyck congruence'''\u2014in a certain sense it generalizes [[Dyck language]] to multiple kinds of \"parentheses\" However simplification in the Dyck congruence takes place regardless of order. For example, if \")\" is the inverse of \"(\", then <math>()=)(=\\varepsilon</math>; the one-sided congruence that appears in the Dyck language proper <math>\\{ (xx^\\dagger, \\varepsilon) : x\\in X\\}</math>, which instantiates only to <math>()=\\varepsilon</math> is (perhaps confusingly) called the '''Shamir congruence'''. The quotient of a free monoid with involution by the Shamir congruence is not a group, but a monoid <!--with involution?-->; nevertheless it has been called the '''free half group''' by its first discoverer\u2014[[Eli Shamir]]\u2014although more recently it has been called the '''involutive monoid''' generated by ''X''.<ref name=\"Sakarovitch\"/><ref name=\"DrosteKuich2009\">{{cite book|editors=Manfred Droste, Werner Kuich, Heiko Vogler|title=Handbook of Weighted Automata|year=2009|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-01492-5|page=271|authors=Ion Petre and [[Arto Salomaa]]|chapter=Algebraic Systems and Pushdown Automata}}</ref> (This latter choice of terminology conflicts however with the use of \"involutive\" to denote any semigroup with involution\u2014a practice also encountered in the literature.<ref name=\"Neeb2000\">{{cite book|author=Karl-Hermann Neeb|title=Holomorphy and Convexity in Lie Theory|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-015669-0|page=21}}</ref><ref name=\"BeltramettiCassinelli2010\">{{cite book|author1=Enrico G.

It is thus not a surprise that any group is a semigroup with involution. However, there are significant natural examples of semigroups with involution that are not groups.\n\nAn example from [[linear algebra]] is the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] [[monoid]] of [[Real number|real]] square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of order&nbsp;''n'' (called the [[full linear monoid]]). The [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends a matrix to its [[transpose]] is an involution because the transpose is well defined for any matrix and obeys the law {{nowrap|1=(''AB'')<sup>T</sup> = ''B''<sup>T</sup>''A''<sup>T</sup>}}, which has the same form of interaction with multiplication as taking inverses has in the [[general linear group]] (which is a subgroup of the full linear monoid). However, for an arbitrary matrix, ''AA''<sup>T</sup> does not equal the identity element (namely the [[diagonal matrix]]). Another example, coming from [[formal language]] theory, is the [[free semigroup]] generated by a [[nonempty set]] (an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]), with string [[concatenation]] as the binary operation, and the involution being the map which [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reverse]]s the [[linear order]] of the letters in a string. A third example, from basic [[set theory]], is the set of all [[binary relation]]s between a set and itself, with the involution being the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]].\n\nSemigroups with involution appeared explicitly named in a 1953 paper of [[Viktor Wagner]] (in Russian) as result of his attempt to bridge the theory of semigroups with that of [[semiheap]]s.<ref name=\"Hollings2014\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|year=2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=265}}</ref>\n\n==Formal definition==\nLet ''S'' be a [[semigroup]] with its binary operation written multiplicatively.

As noted in the previous example, the inversion map is not necessarily the only map with this property in an inverse semigroup. There may well be other involutions that leave all idempotents invariant; for example the identity map on a commutative regular, hence inverse, semigroup, in particular, an abelian group. A [[regular semigroup]] is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if it admits an involution under which each idempotent is an invariant.<ref>Munn, Lemma 1</ref>\n# Underlying every [[C*-algebra]] is a *-semigroup.

This semigroup is also a [[regular semigroup]], as all bands are.<ref name=\"Nordahl and Scheiblich\">Nordahl and Scheiblich</ref>\n\n==Basic concepts and properties==\nAn element ''x'' of a semigroup with involution is sometimes called ''hermitian'' (by analogy with a [[Hermitian matrix]]) when it is left invariant by the involution, meaning ''x''* = ''x''. Elements of the form ''xx''* or ''x''*''x'' are always hermitian, and so are all powers of a hermitian element. As noted in the examples section, a semigroup ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]] and admits an involution such that every idempotent is hermitian.<ref>Easdown, David, and W. D. Munn. \"On semigroups with involution.\" Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 48.01 (1993): 93\u2013100.</ref>\n\nCertain basic concepts may be defined on *-semigroups in a way that parallels the notions stemming from a [[Regular semigroup|regular element in a semigroup]]. A ''partial isometry'' is an element ''s''  such that ''ss''*''s'' = ''s''; the set of partial isometries of a semigroup ''S'' is usually abbreviated PI(''S'').<ref>Lawson, p. 116</ref> A ''projection'' is an idempotent element ''e'' that is also hermitian, meaning that ''ee'' = ''e'' and ''e''* = ''e''. Every projection is a partial isometry, and for every partial isometry ''s'', ''s''*''s'' and ''ss''* are projections. If ''e'' and ''f'' are projections, then ''e'' = ''ef'' if and only if ''e'' = ''fe''.<ref name=\"L117\">Lawson, p. 117</ref>\n\nPartial isometries can be [[partial order|partially ordered]] by ''s'' \u2264 ''t'' defined as holding whenever ''s'' = ''ss''*''t'' and ''ss''* = ''ss''*''tt''*.<ref name=\"L117\"/> Equivalently, ''s'' \u2264 ''t'' if and only if  ''s'' = ''et'' and ''e'' = ''ett''* for some projection ''e''.<ref name=\"L117\"/> In a *-semigroup, PI(''S'') is an [[ordered groupoid]] with the [[Partial groupoid|partial product]] given by ''s''&sdot;''t'' = ''st'' if ''s''*''s'' = ''tt''*.<ref>Lawson, p. 118</ref>\n\n=== Examples ===\nIn terms of examples for these notions, in the *-semigroup of binary relations on a set, the partial isometries are the relations that are [[difunctional]]. The projections in this *-semigroup are the [[partial equivalence relation]]s.<ref>Lawson p.122 and p.35</ref>\n\nThe [[partial isometry|partial isometries]] in a C*-algebra are exactly those defined in this section. In the case of ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') more can be said. If ''E'' and ''F'' are projections, then ''E'' \u2264 ''F'' if and only if [[Image (mathematics)|im]]''E'' \u2286 im''F''. For any two projection, if ''E'' \u2229 ''F'' = ''V'', then the unique projection ''J'' with image ''V'' and kernel the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''V'' is the meet of ''E'' and ''F''. Since projections form a meet-[[semilattice]], the partial isometries on ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') form an inverse semigroup with the product <math>A(A^*A\\wedge BB^*)B</math>.<ref>Lawson p.120</ref>\n\nAnother simple example of these notions appears in the next section.\n\n== Notions of regularity ==\nThere two related, but not identical notions of regularity in *-semigroups. They were introduced nearly simultaneously by Nordahl & Scheiblich (1978) and respectively Drazin (1979).<ref>Crvenkovic and Dolinka</ref>\n\n=== Regular *-semigroups (Nordahl & Scheiblich) ===\nAs mentioned in the [[#Examples|previous examples]], [[inverse semigroup]]s are a subclass of *-semigroups. It is also textbook knowledge that an inverse semigroup can be characterized as a regular semigroup in which any two idempotents commute. In 1963, [[Boris M. Schein]] has published the following two axioms providing an analogous characterization of inverse semigroups as a [[Variety (universal algebra)|subvariety]] of *-semigroups:\n\n* ''x'' = ''xx''*''x''\n* (''xx''*)(''x''*''x'') = (''x''*''x'')(''xx''*)\n\nThe first of these looks like the definition of a regular element, but is actually in terms of the involution. Likewise, the second axiom appears to be describing the commutation of two idempotents. It is known however that regular semigroups do not form a variety because their class does not contain [[free object]]s (a result established by [[D. B. McAlister]] in 1968). This line of reasoning motivated Nordahl and Scheiblich to begin in 1977 the study of the (variety of) *-semigroups that satisfy only the first these two axioms; because of the similarity in form with the property defining regular semigroups, they named this variety regular *-semigroups.\n\nIt is a simple calculation to establish that a regular *-semigroup is also a regular semigroup because ''x''* turns out to be an inverse of ''x''. The rectangular band from [[#ex7|Example 7]] is a regular *-semigroup that is not an inverse semigroup.<ref name=\"Nordahl and Scheiblich\"/> It is also easy to verify that in a regular *-semigroup the product of any two projections is an idempotent.<ref>Nordahl and Scheiblich, Theorem 2.5</ref> In the aforementioned rectangular band example, the projections are elements of the form (''x'', ''x'') and [like all elements of a band] are idempotent. However, two different projections in this band need not commute, nor is their product necessarily a projection since (''a'', ''a'')(''b'', ''b'') = (''a'', ''b'').\n\nSemigroups that satisfy only ''x''** = ''x'' = ''xx''*''x'' (but not necessarily the antidistributivity of * over multiplication) have also been studied under the name of [[I-semigroup]]s.\n\n====P-systems====\nThe problem of characterizing when a regular semigroup is a regular *-semigroup (in the sense of Nordahl & Scheiblich) was addressed by M. Yamada (1982). He defined a '''P-system''' F(S) as subset of the idempotents of S, denoted as usual by E(S). Using the usual notation V(''a'') for the inverses of ''a'', F(S) needs to satisfy the following axioms:\n\n# For any ''a'' in S, there exists a unique a\u00b0 in V(''a'') such that ''aa''\u00b0 and ''a''\u00b0''a'' are in F(S)\n# For any ''a'' in S, and b in F(S), ''a\u00b0ba'' is in F(S), where \u00b0 is the well-defined operation from the previous axiom\n# For any ''a'', ''b'' in F(S), ''ab'' is in E(S); note: not necessarily in F(S)\n\nA regular semigroup S is a *-regular semigroup, as defined by Nordahl & Scheiblich, if and only if it has a p-system F(S). In this case F(S) is the set of projections of S with respect to the operation \u00b0 defined by F(S). In an [[inverse semigroup]] the entire semilattice of idempotents is a p-system. Also, if a regular semigroup S has a p-system that is multiplicatively closed (i.e. subsemigroup), then S is an inverse semigroup. Thus, a p-system may be regarded as a generalization of the semilattice of idempotents of an inverse semigroup.\n\n===*-regular semigroups (Drazin)===\n{{anchor|Drazin}}\n{{expand section|clarify motivation for studying these|date=April 2015}}\nA semigroup ''S'' with an involution * is called a '''*-regular semigroup''' (in the sense of Drazin) if for every ''x'' in ''S'', ''x''* is ''H''-equivalent to some inverse of ''x'', where ''H'' is the [[Green's relations|Green's relation]] ''H''. This defining property can be formulated in several equivalent ways. Another is to say that every [[Green's relations#The L.2C R.2C and J relations|''L''-class]] contains a projection. An axiomatic definition is the condition that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exists an element ''x''\u2032 such that {{nowrap|1=''x''\u2032''xx''\u2032 = ''x''\u2032}}, {{nowrap|1=''xx''\u2032''x'' = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=(''xx''\u2032)* = ''xx''\u2032}}, {{nowrap|1=(''x''\u2032''x'')* = ''x''\u2032''x''}}. [[Michael P. Drazin]] first proved that given ''x'', the element ''x''\u2032 satisfying these axioms is unique. It is called the Moore\u2013Penrose inverse of ''x''. This agrees with the classical definition of the [[Moore\u2013Penrose inverse]] of a square matrix.\n\nOne motivation for studying these semigroups is that they allow generalizing the Moore\u2013Penrose inverse's properties from {{tmath|\\R }} and {{tmath|\\C }} to more general sets.\n\nIn the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] semigroup ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''C'') of square matrices of order ''n'', the map which assigns a matrix ''A'' to its [[Hermitian conjugate]] ''A''* is an involution. The semigroup ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''C'') is a *-regular semigroup with this involution. The Moore\u2013Penrose inverse of A in this *-regular semigroup is the classical Moore\u2013Penrose inverse of ''A''.\n\n==Free semigroup with involution ==\nAs with all varieties, the [[category theory|category]] of semigroups with involution admits [[free object]]s. The construction of a free semigroup (or monoid) with involution is based on that of a [[free semigroup]] (and respectively that of a free monoid). Moreover, the construction of a [[free group]] can easily be derived by refining the construction of a free monoid with involution.<ref name=\"L51\">Lawson p. 51</ref>\n\nThe [[Generator (mathematics)|generators]] of a free semigroup with involution are the elements of the union of two ([[equinumerous]]) [[disjoint sets]] in [[Bijection|bijective correspondence]]: <math>Y=X\\sqcup X^\\dagger</math>. (Here the notation <math>\\sqcup\\,</math> emphasized that the union is actually a [[disjoint union]].) In the case were the two sets are finite, their union ''Y'' is sometimes called an ''[[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] with involution''<ref name=\"EhrenfeuchtHarju1999\">{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Ehrenfeucht|author2=T.

Thus, the semigroup <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> with the map <math>{ }^\\dagger\\,</math> is a semigroup with involution, called a '''free semigroup with involution''' on ''X''.<ref name=\"L172\">Lawson p. 172</ref> (The irrelevance of the concrete identity of <math>X^\\dagger</math> and of the bijection <math>\\theta</math> in this choice of terminology is explained below in terms of the universal property of the construction.) Note that unlike in [[#ex6|Example 6]], the involution ''of every letter'' is a distinct element in an alphabet with involution, and consequently the same observation extends to a free semigroup with involution.\n\nIf in the above construction instead of <math>Y^+\\,</math> we use the [[free monoid]]  <math>Y^*=Y^+\\cup\\{\\varepsilon\\}</math>, which is just the free semigroup extended with the [[empty word]] <math>\\varepsilon\\,</math> (which is the [[identity element]] of the [[monoid]] <math>Y^*\\,</math>), and suitably extend the involution with <math>\\varepsilon^\\dagger = \\varepsilon</math>,\nwe obtain a '''free monoid with involution'''.<ref name=\"Lipscomb1996\"/>\n\nThe construction above is actually the only way to extend a given map <math>\\theta\\,</math> from <math>X\\,</math> to <math>X^\\dagger\\,</math>, to an involution on <math>Y^+\\,</math> (and likewise on <math>Y^*\\,</math>). The qualifier \"free\" for these constructions is justified in the usual sense that they are [[universal algebra|universal construction]]s. In the case of the free semigroup with involution, given an arbitrary semigroup with involution <math>S\\,</math> and a map <math>\\Phi:X\\rightarrow S</math>, then a [[semigroup homomorphism]] <math>\\overline\\Phi:(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+\\rightarrow S</math> exists such that <math>\\Phi = \\iota \\circ \\overline\\Phi</math>, where <math>\\iota : X \\rightarrow (X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> is the [[inclusion map]] and [[composition of functions]] is taken in [[Function composition#Alternative notations|diagram order]].<ref name=\"L172\"/> The construction of <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^+</math> as a semigroup with involution is unique up to [[isomorphism]]. An analogous argument holds for the free monoid with involution in terms of [[monoid homomorphism]]s and the uniqueness up to isomorphism of the construction of <math>(X\\sqcup X^\\dagger)^*</math> as a monoid with involution.\n\nThe construction of a [[free group]] is not very far off from that of a free monoid with involution. The additional ingredient needed is to define a notion of [[reduced word]] and a [[rewriting]] rule for producing such words simply by deleting any adjacent pairs of letter of the form <math>xx^\\dagger</math> or <math>x^\\dagger x</math>. It can be shown than the order of rewriting (deleting) such pairs does not matter, i.e. any order of deletions produces the same result.<ref name=\"L51\"/> (Otherwise put, these rules define a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] rewriting system.) Equivalently, a free group is constructed from a free monoid with involution by taking the [[quotient (universal algebra)|quotient]] of the latter by the [[Congruence relation|congruence]] <math>\\{ (yy^\\dagger, \\varepsilon) : y\\in Y\\}</math>, which is sometimes called the '''Dyck congruence'''\u2014in a certain sense it generalizes [[Dyck language]] to multiple kinds of \"parentheses\" However simplification in the Dyck congruence takes place regardless of order. For example, if \")\" is the inverse of \"(\", then <math>()=)(=\\varepsilon</math>; the one-sided congruence that appears in the Dyck language proper <math>\\{ (xx^\\dagger, \\varepsilon) : x\\in X\\}</math>, which instantiates only to <math>()=\\varepsilon</math> is (perhaps confusingly) called the '''Shamir congruence'''. The quotient of a free monoid with involution by the Shamir congruence is not a group, but a monoid <!--with involution?-->; nevertheless it has been called the '''free half group''' by its first discoverer\u2014[[Eli Shamir]]\u2014although more recently it has been called the '''involutive monoid''' generated by ''X''.<ref name=\"Sakarovitch\"/><ref name=\"DrosteKuich2009\">{{cite book|editors=Manfred Droste, Werner Kuich, Heiko Vogler|title=Handbook of Weighted Automata|year=2009|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-01492-5|page=271|authors=Ion Petre and [[Arto Salomaa]]|chapter=Algebraic Systems and Pushdown Automata}}</ref> (This latter choice of terminology conflicts however with the use of \"involutive\" to denote any semigroup with involution\u2014a practice also encountered in the literature.<ref name=\"Neeb2000\">{{cite book|author=Karl-Hermann Neeb|title=Holomorphy and Convexity in Lie Theory|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-015669-0|page=21}}</ref><ref name=\"BeltramettiCassinelli2010\">{{cite book|author1=Enrico G.

Prior to Chomsky's propaganda model, [[George Orwell]] noted: \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\" /> This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.. \n\nThere is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of \"traditional\" [[mainstream media]]) are turning more readily to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regard to the [[Leveson Inquiry]].<ref name=\"lse0\">{{cite web | title=Leveson: Bloggers vs the Press | website=Media Policy Project | date=7 December 2012 | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/12/07/leveson-bloggers-vs-the-press/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}</ref> \n\n[[File:The_Leveson_Love_Triangle_Leveson-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Leveson Love Triangle: Favours and reciprocities of the politico-media complex depicted by the [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/programme Media Policy Project] of the [[London School of Economics]]]]\n\n==Early media institutions==\nBefore [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented [[movable type]] in 1450, most information was delivered by [[town criers]], ministers from the pulpit or bartenders.

The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.<ref>Lindholm, p. 33</ref>\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', 1939]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34</ref> In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34-35</ref> After the hero of ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}</ref>\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\"<ref>Neuman et al., 1992, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;IV</ref> They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\"<ref>Gitlin, 1980, p.&nbsp;7</ref> Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\"<ref>Entman, 1993, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around them (Goffman, 1974, p.&nbsp;21) and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;156</ref><ref name=\"Semetko\">Semetko, Holli A. and Valkenburg, Patti M. \u201cFraming European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.\u201d Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.</ref>\n\nNews frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&nbsp;\u2013 such as its organization, content, or structure&nbsp;\u2013 make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.<ref>Price et al., 1997, p.&nbsp;486</ref> Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/>\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\"<ref name=\"Semetko\"/><ref>Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p.&nbsp;70; emphasis in the original</ref> The results of Semetko and Valkenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/> After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\n==Internet==\n\n===Impact on political media===\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.<ref>{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&pg=PP1}}</ref> It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}</ref> However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.<ref name=name>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&pg=PT350}}</ref>\n\nThe relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhaps less than flattering, maybe 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).\n<ref name=\"mpsexpenses\">\n{{Cite news\n | title = MPs accused of Wikipedia expenses 'cover-up'\n | work=Daily Telegraph\n  | date = 8 May 2010\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7696484/MPs-accused-of-Wikipedia-expenses-cover-up.html\n | accessdate =15 August 2011\n | first1=Rebecca\n | last1=Lefort\n | first2=Ben\n | last2=Leapman\n}}</ref>\n\nFor example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom).

Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics.

Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day.

Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the \"two sectors\" represent an \"innocent fraud\")<ref name=\"galbraith\">{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May\u2013June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget.

It\u2019s not specifically military.}}</ref> and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.\n\nUsing the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.<ref name=\"chomsky2\">{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280</ref> He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/> He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua Franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{Main|Propaganda}}\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\">Furhammar, p. 152.</ref> Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\nSuch British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\n[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from \"[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]\", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{Original research inline|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A.

He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}</ref>\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\"<ref>Neuman et al., 1992, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;IV</ref> They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\"<ref>Gitlin, 1980, p.&nbsp;7</ref> Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\"<ref>Entman, 1993, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around them (Goffman, 1974, p.&nbsp;21) and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;156</ref><ref name=\"Semetko\">Semetko, Holli A. and Valkenburg, Patti M. \u201cFraming European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.\u201d Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.</ref>\n\nNews frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&nbsp;\u2013 such as its organization, content, or structure&nbsp;\u2013 make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.<ref>Price et al., 1997, p.&nbsp;486</ref> Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/>\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\"<ref name=\"Semetko\"/><ref>Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p.&nbsp;70; emphasis in the original</ref> The results of Semetko and Valkenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/> After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\n==Internet==\n\n===Impact on political media===\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.<ref>{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&pg=PP1}}</ref> It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}</ref> However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.<ref name=name>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&pg=PT350}}</ref>\n\nThe relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhaps less than flattering, maybe 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).\n<ref name=\"mpsexpenses\">\n{{Cite news\n | title = MPs accused of Wikipedia expenses 'cover-up'\n | work=Daily Telegraph\n  | date = 8 May 2010\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7696484/MPs-accused-of-Wikipedia-expenses-cover-up.html\n | accessdate =15 August 2011\n | first1=Rebecca\n | last1=Lefort\n | first2=Ben\n | last2=Leapman\n}}</ref>\n\nFor example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom).

Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics.

Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day.

Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the \"two sectors\" represent an \"innocent fraud\")<ref name=\"galbraith\">{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May\u2013June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget.

It\u2019s not specifically military.}}</ref> and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.\n\nUsing the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.<ref name=\"chomsky2\">{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.
