McKinsey's recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its \"good hands\" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out \"boxing gloves.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yourlawyer.com/articles/title/allstate-state-farm-other-bad-faith-insurance-companies-rack-up-record-profits-by-cheating-customers |title=Allstate, State Farm, Other Bad Faith Insurance Companies Rack up Record Profits by Cheating Customers |publisher=Parker Waichman LLP |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe book was reviewed by ''Business Week'' magazine.<ref name=bw>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm |title= In Tough Hands At Allstate  |publisher=Business Week |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2010-07-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714054219/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>  According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were \"unfounded and unproven.\" Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying \"exaggerated and fraudulent claims\" and that its \"processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits.\"<ref name=bw/>\n\nCourt decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, \"Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents.\" On the other hand, the article also states that \"Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'\"  While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.<ref name=bw/>\n\n===Use of Colossus===\nMany criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called \"Colossus\" to process claims.

The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting its assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible.{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/09/insurance.hardball/index.html |title=Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims |publisher=CNN |date=2007-02-09 |url-status = live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324210950/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/02/09/insurance.hardball/index.html |archivedate=2010-03-24 |df= }}</ref>  In 2010 Allstate commanded 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://autoinsurancetips.com/good-deal-auto-insurance-how-find-best-affordable-coverage|title=A Good Deal on Auto Insurance: How to Find the Best Affordable Coverage|publisher=AutoInsuranceTips.com|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114072340/http://autoinsurancetips.com/good-deal-auto-insurance-how-find-best-affordable-coverage|archivedate=2010-01-14|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Homeowners claims===\nThe PBS television program ''Now'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Now - PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/333/index.html |title= Home Insurance 9-1-1 |publisher=PBS.org |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2010-07-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100620160029/http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/333/index.html| archivedate= 20 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref> in conjunction with ''Bloomberg Markets'' magazine, did an expos\u00e9 regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.\n\n===Catastrophe exposure management===\nAllstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in [[hurricane]]-prone [[Florida]].

McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as [[Enron]]) to maximize profits. McKinsey's recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its \"good hands\" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out \"boxing gloves.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yourlawyer.com/articles/title/allstate-state-farm-other-bad-faith-insurance-companies-rack-up-record-profits-by-cheating-customers |title=Allstate, State Farm, Other Bad Faith Insurance Companies Rack up Record Profits by Cheating Customers |publisher=Parker Waichman LLP |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe book was reviewed by ''Business Week'' magazine.<ref name=bw>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm |title= In Tough Hands At Allstate  |publisher=Business Week |date=2006-05-01 |accessdate=2010-07-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100714054219/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_18/b3982072.htm| archivedate= 14 July 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref>  According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were \"unfounded and unproven.\" Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying \"exaggerated and fraudulent claims\" and that its \"processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits.\"<ref name=bw/>\n\nCourt decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, \"Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents.\" On the other hand, the article also states that \"Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'\"  While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.<ref name=bw/>\n\n===Use of Colossus===\nMany criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called \"Colossus\" to process claims.  In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used.  It also agreed to standardize its use of the software.

It can be reached locally from downtown B\u00fchl via two ancient roads: B\u00fchlertalstrasse, which extends from Main Street (Haupstra\u00dfe) in Southern B\u00fchl alongside the B\u00fcllot, and the B\u00fchler Seite, which extends from Main Street in B\u00fchl alongside the Northern opposite bank of the B\u00fcllot, closely following the river bed. Most of the houses of Altschweier are located on one, sometimes on both sides of those two roads, the main arteries of the village. An additional 20th century county road connects B\u00fchl with Altschweier extending even further into the B\u00fchl Valley and the Black Forest. It is the fastest way to reach Altschweier coming from the Autobahn A5 without having to drive through B\u00fchl. The L83 is crossing the B3 just North of B\u00fchl, it then cuts through hills over a deep valley, eventually reaching the lower Altschweier valley. It is then heading further East, changing from a flat road to a steeply-inclined mountain road, eventually reaching the peaks of the Black Forest, the latter a major touristic region.\n\n== Economy ==\nDue to its location, Altschweier has the benefits of being at almost the same altitude as B\u00fchl with similar temperatures year around, but protected from cold winds by the mountains from the North and East surrounding the village like a horseshoe, reaching altitudes of up to {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. The hills and their high quality soil offer perfect conditions for growing a variety of fruits. Wine is grown in the steep hills facing South; the sun can penetrate the dense leaves much better, which results in improved levels of sugar and alcohol, respectively, critical for a good wine. This has elevated the region to one of the top wine growing regions in Germany, with [[Pinot noir]] (Sp\u00e4tburgunder) and [[Riesling]] the predominant grape varieties grown. Several other fruits were and are still grown in Altschweier, plums among the most successful commercial fruits, the so-called B\u00fchler Fr\u00fch-[[Zwetschge]], besides strawberries. Wine and plums are only able to support a much reduced number of full-time farmers today compared with previous centuries. Some run their farms or what's left over half-time or as a hobby. \nAltschweier always was and still is a rural village. In the past the majority of the inhabitants were involved in farming. Grapes were grown since medieval times. The population of Altschweier was much smaller then, possibly only one or two hundred people, originally farmers skilled in wine making and other related crafts. The making and selling of wine still is a major source of income for the inhabitants of Altschweier. In the region, wine making wasn't limited to Altschweier though, but also to other towns and villages alongside the foothills or the Western flank of the Black Forest mountains, a wine region called the [[Ortenau]]. The name Ortenau for the wine region should not be confused with the Ortenau County, even though there's some substantial overlap between the wine region Ortenau and the political region of the [[Ortenaukreis]] and the historic region Ortenau. The larger historic region of Ortenau, formerly Mortenau during the early days of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was a region settled by [[Alemans]], reaching from the rivers of Bleich in the South to the Murg in the North, the Black Forest forming a natural border to the East, the Rhine river a natural border to the West. The Ortenau/Mortenau was settled by a tribe of Germanic origin around 600 A.D. The language spoken in Altschweier is German, the dialect is [[Alemanic German]] or Alemannisch, a Germanic language which is shared with the Alsace in France and Switzerland. Since these countries share the same German dialect, an independent Wiki page exists featuring this dialect as a separate 'language' besides German.\n\nThe water power of the B\u00fcllot was used in the past to drive the turbines of several mills, cereal mills, oil mills, and saw mills, for the manufacturing of flour and oil needed for food and wood required by carpenters, respectively. The water was also used to keep the furnaces heated to convert iron ore to iron. The mills and iron plant are long gone. Hydro-power is only rarely used for commercial milling nowadays and not enough to generate hydroelectric power. Remains of a few of the mills and artificial canals are still visible, one of them actually used as a museum to display the art of milling, the so-called Rohrhirsch-M\u00fchle, named after its last owner. \nThe water of the B\u00fcllot was also used in the past to ferment the [[hemp]] plant and to run mills to produce finished hemp, ready to be woven into fabrics made from hemp fibers. Besides wine, hemp was another major source of income from agriculture for the region in the past. It has completely lost its significance with the rise of cotton imported from other countries in the early 19th century. \nAll these small-scale industrial activities have ceased to exist; there is no industry left over in Altschweier. \nA substantial fraction of the population of Altschweier is employed in the nearby town of B\u00fchl, working for the local industry as blue-collar workers, and elsewhere, in local administrations, schools, shops, as teachers, engineers, architects, bankers, etc. Altschweier has become a residential area with apartment houses interlaced with old farm houses, some of them 300 years and older, still inhabited and used. The sound of tractors can be heard once in a while; the noises and smell of cows, pigs, horses or chicken however have stopped. Meat and milk are purchased at local shops and supermarkets in the area.\n\nThe incline and decline of the local industry, bad or good years for farmers due to reoccurring changes in climate and times of war and peace have had their impact on the population, with waves of immigrants populating the region or emigrants leaving the region for better opportunities.\n\n== History ==\nAs the name ''Weier'' implies the origin of the village (= villa = weier) was an agglomerate of a few individual estates/villas or farms, loosely connected. Over time these farms grew together, eventually named after the largest estate, which was presumably owned by a person named Alger or Adalger. The name of the town appeared as Algeswilre in 1265 A.D. for the first time in records. It can be assumed that the village is much older. The history of the village of Altschweier is well documented in two books.<ref>{{cite book|title=Altschweier|last1=Huber|first=Arnold}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Altschweier - Gestern und Heute|first=Suso|last=Gartner}}</ref> Both authors have tried not only to cover the history in general, but moreover with the history of the village and nearby town of B\u00fchl an integral part, somehow interweaved into the political history of the region and country, but also with the local history, which has had its impact on the village itself and its inhabitants/citizens. The information was extracted from old documents, church registers, maps, etc. The authors have included family names of villagers, drawings, photos, lists of the majors, families, occupations, emigrants, etc., which makes the books a valuable source for local people with an interest in history, but also for people from abroad, searching for their family roots.\n\nThe religion of the area and the ecclesiastical history is also covered in the books mentioned above. Due to the history of the area, Altschweier was split in two parts for many centuries, the Northern part belonging to the parish of St. Peter and Paul in B\u00fchl, the so-called \"B\u00fchler Seite\", the Southern part belonging to the parish of St. Maria in Kappelwindeck, the so-called \"Kappler Seite\". The division of the village has its roots in the political history of the area, ownership by different local and regional aristocrat families and rulers, the margraves of Baden and the knights of [[Windeck Castle (B\u00fchl)|Windeck Castle]] as the most important rulers, respectively, the B\u00fcllot river serving as a border to mark the territories, which also had its impact on its ecclesiastical status. The majority of the population of Altschweier is Roman Catholic. Altschweier has become an independent parish in 1869 after finishing the construction of the church, the latter consecrated St. Gallus. Due to people moving to Altschweier, the village has a small, but sizable population of beliefs other than Catholics and Lutherans/Protestants.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.buehl.de B\u00fchl/Baden] \n*[http://www.altschweier.de Altschweier]\n*Genealogical information about Altschweier can be found at http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/B\u00fchl_(Baden) and at http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/Kappelwindeck\n\n{{Coord|48|42|N|8|10|E|display=title|region:DE_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n'''Altschweier'''  is a [[Germany|German]] village to the East of the town of [[B\u00fchl (Baden)]].
