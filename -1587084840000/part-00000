As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other [[Doctor Who spin-offs|''Doctor Who'' spin-offs]]. In the programme's narrative, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] is a centuries-old [[Time Lord]] alien from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who [[Time travel in fiction|travels in time]] in his [[TARDIS]], frequently with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]]. At the end of life, the Doctor can [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change, and a new actor assumes the role. Tennant's portrayal of the Doctor is of an outwardly charismatic and charming adventurer whose likable and easygoing attitude can quickly turn to righteous fury when provoked.\n\nThis incarnation's companions include working class shop assistant [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), medical student [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and fiery [[temporary work|temp worker]] [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]). He eventually parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008 series finale, \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", after which he attempts to travel alone for the duration of the [[Doctor Who (2008\u20132010 specials)|2008\u20132010 specials]] before being accompanied by Donna Noble's grandfather [[Wilfred Mott]] ([[Bernard Cribbins]]) on his final adventure in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n==Overview==\nExecutive producer [[Russell T Davies]] revived ''Doctor Who'' after a 16-year absence with the premiere of \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\" in 2005. Following the BBC's announcement of a second series being commissioned, the story broke that [[Christopher Eccleston]], who played the titular [[Ninth Doctor]], would not be returning for the second series. On 16 April 2005, the BBC announced that David Tennant had been selected for the role of the Tenth Doctor.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Tennant is tenth Doctor Who |publisher=BBC |date=16 April 2005 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/16/tennant.shtml |accessdate=17 January 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206071854/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/16/tennant.shtml |archivedate=6 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His first appearance in the series was for 20 seconds following the Ninth Doctor's regeneration at the end of \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\". His first full episode as the Doctor, barring an appearance in a \"[[Doctor Who: Children in Need|mini-episode]]\" during the 2005 [[Children in Need]] show, was the 2005 Christmas Special, \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\". He then appeared in the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|2006]], [[Doctor Who (series 3)|2007]] and [[Doctor Who (series 4)|2008 series]]. Rather than a traditional series run, 2009 and early 2010 featured Tennant in a series of four specials. He also guest-starred in the 2009 two-part ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' story ''[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]''. Tennant also appears in two animated serials ''[[The Infinite Quest]]'' and ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]''. In 2013, Tennant reprised his role as the Doctor for the 50th anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\".\n\n==Personality==\nThe Tenth Doctor speaks with an [[Estuary English]] accent, rather than the [[Lancashire dialect]] (Christopher Eccleston's own accent) that the Ninth Doctor used, the [[Received Pronunciation]] of most earlier Doctors, or Tennant's natural [[Scottish English]]. David Tennant told ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' magazine in 2006 that Russell T Davies had asked him to drop his natural Scottish accent, because he felt \"we'd like to not go for another obvious regional accent, because I suppose they'd done that\".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/i-agreed-to-drop-scots-accent-for-doctor-who-tennant-1-488554 | title = I agreed to drop Scots accent for Doctor Who \u2014 Tennant | date = 3 April 2006 | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] | accessdate = 8 July 2015 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150709062926/http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/i-agreed-to-drop-scots-accent-for-doctor-who-tennant-1-488554 | archivedate = 9 July 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  In a 23 December interview on [[BBC Radio 1]], Tennant explained that a line had been scripted for the Christmas special explaining that the newly regenerated Doctor had imprinted on [[Rose Tyler]]'s accent, \"like a chick hatching from an egg\", but the line was cut from the final episode.\n\nThe depictions of the personalities of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors shared certain similarities<ref>{{cite web |author=James T.

However, this incarnation was happy to have sideburns and to have more hair than his previous incarnation. He wears his own brown hair in various ways throughout the series: unstyled in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\", a 1950s-style quiff in \"[[The Idiot's Lantern]]\", and flattened forwards in \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\" and \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", but mainly styled it in a spiked up fashion throughout most of the series, with this style being described by friend and later one-time companion Wilfred Mott as being a, \"Modern style sort of hair.

He also occasionally sports a pair of Red-Cyan 3D glasses, both as a joke and for practical reasons. The Tenth Doctor's costume became so popular that it has spawned numerous recreations (including a BBC-licensed replica of the Tenth Doctor's overcoat by AbbyShot Clothiers<ref>\"[http://uberscifigeek.com/?p=8917 Doctor Who Fashion Line from AbbyShot Clothiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717132002/http://uberscifigeek.com/?p=8917 |date=17 July 2011 }}\", UberSciFiGeek.com, 12 March 2010</ref> and a white/red version worn by Tennant when he co-hosted [[Comic Relief]]), and has been cited by costume designer Louise Page as the costume she is most proud of from her time on ''Doctor Who''.<ref>Doctor Who Magazine #418, February 2010</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nThe Ninth Doctor ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerated]] into the Tenth Doctor at the climax of the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|first series]] (2005) finale, \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\"; he re-introduces himself to his companion [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) in a [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|''Children in Need'' mini-episode]] called \"Born Again\". In the 2005 Christmas special, \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\", he is in a comatose state for most of the episode, following his regeneration. After eventually waking up, he defeats the alien [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Sycorax|Sycorax]] and saves Earth; in the process, he loses a hand, which regrows owing to his recent regeneration. Amongst other [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second series]] (2006) adventures, The Doctor and Rose save [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] ([[Pauline Collins]]) from a [[Werewolf (Doctor Who)#Tooth and Claw|werewolf]] in \"[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]\", resulting in the creation of the anti-alien [[Torchwood Institute]]. In \"[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]\", The Doctor shares an adventure with two former companions, journalist [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]) and robot dog [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] (voiced by [[John Leeson]]), before taking on Rose's boyfriend [[Mickey Smith|Mickey]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) as a second companion. The TARDIS slips through a crack in the Time Vortex causing them to be stranded on a parallel Earth, where they encounter the [[Cybermen]] in the episode, \"[[Rise of the Cybermen]]\". After saving parallel Earth, Mickey decides to stay and help stop the Cybermen around the world despite The Doctor telling him he can never return in \"[[The Age of Steel]]\". He and Rose become stranded on a planet orbiting around a black hole in \"[[The Impossible Planet]]\" where The Beast is waiting, with a Torchwood team. While there, in \"[[The Satan Pit]]\", The Beast taunts The Doctor and Rose about Rose's death. During the 2012 Olympic Games in \"[[Fear Her]]\", The Doctor picks up the Olympic flame and carries it to the end, starting the Games. The series finale takes place in contemporary London, where modern-day Torchwood is the scene for war between the evil alien [[Dalek]]s and parallel-universe [[cyborg]]s the Cybermen; saving the Earth costs The Doctor Rose, who is stranded in a parallel universe, along with Mickey and her mother, in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\".\n\nIn the closing scene of \"Doomsday\", a mysterious bride called [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) inexplicably appears in his TARDIS. The 2006 Christmas special, \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\" sees The Doctor and bride-to-be Donna save the Earth; Donna saves The Doctor from going too far in his revenge against the alien [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q\u2013Z)#R|Racnoss]] and declines his offer of companionship. In the [[Doctor Who (series 3)|third series]] (2007), The Doctor takes on [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]) as his new companion. Together, they witness the mysterious [[Face of Boe]] ([[Struan Rodger]]) prophecy to The Doctor that \"you are not alone\", in \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". They are rejoined by former companion [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) in a three-episode adventure beginning with \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\", where presumed-deceased archenemy and fellow Time Lord [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] ([[John Simm]]) becomes [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and enslaves The Doctor for one year. Martha's plan sees The Doctor infused with the world's psychic energies, and he easily defeats The Master, who seemingly refuses to regenerate and dies in The Doctor's arms. Following this adventure, in the [[d\u00e9nouement]] of series finale \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\", Jack and Martha both depart the TARDIS, and The Doctor is shocked to see what appears to be the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] crash into it. Set moments prior, another ''[[Children in Need]]'' mini-episode, \"[[Time Crash]]\", features a brief encounter between Tennant's Tenth Doctor and the [[Fifth Doctor]] ([[Peter Davison]]), containing [[meta-joke|meta-humour]] surrounding the fact David Tennant had watched and loved Davison's Doctor as a child. In parallel with the third series, Tennant lends his voice to the animated serial ''[[The Infinite Quest]].''\n\nThe 2007 Christmas special, \"[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]\", sees The Doctor and a waitress, [[Astrid Peth]] ([[Kylie Minogue]]), save the Earth from the impending crash of the starship ''Titanic''; Astrid dies heroically, and The Doctor encounters [[Wilfred Mott]] ([[Bernard Cribbins]]) for the first time. In the premiere episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 4)|fourth series]] (2008), \"[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partner in Crime]]\", The Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble, Wilfred's granddaughter, who becomes his regular companion. In \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\", the alien [[Ood]] prophesy the Tenth Doctor's demise. Martha accompanies them for three episodes; in two, entitled \"[[The Sontaran Stratagem]]\" and \"[[The Poison Sky]]\", The Doctor battles the war-hungry alien [[Sontarans]], and last of which sees him become a father of sorts to [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]] ([[Georgia Moffett]]), in \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\". He meets archaeologist and future companion [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] ([[Alex Kingston]]) for the first time from his perspective in the two-parter, \"[[Silence in the Library]]\" and \"[[Forest of the Dead]]\"; she dies, but he stores her consciousness to a hard drive to live on forever, after accepting that one day she will come to mean a lot to him. After Donna encounters Rose in a parallel world in \"[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]\", The Doctor realises that Rose's words to Donna \u2014 \"Bad Wolf\" \u2014 must herald the end of the world. In finale episodes \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (which cross over with spin-offs ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''), The Doctor and Donna reunite with former companions Rose, Sarah Jane, Martha, Jack, and Mickey to save the universe from [[Davros]] ([[Julian Bleach]]), the creator of the Daleks. The Doctor was fatally wounded during the event, aborting in mid-regeneration to maintain his current self while transferring the residual energies in his previously severed hand. This resulted in a metacrisis that created a half-human Doctor who would live with Rose in the parallel universe while imbuing Donna with a Time Lord's mind, forcing The Doctor to erase his companion's memories to save her life and leaving her with her family. A ''[[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|Doctor Who Prom]]'' mini-episode, \"[[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]]\", features a lone Doctor composing his musical ''Ode to the Universe'' before being interrupted by the small alien [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Graske|Graske]] ([[Jimmy Vee]]).\n\nIn lieu of a 2009 series, Tennant appears as the Tenth Doctor, without a regular companion, in several special episodes over the course of 2008 and 2009, the last of which aired on New Year's Day, 2010.  In the Christmas special \"[[The Next Doctor]]\", The Doctor mistakenly believes he has met a later incarnation of himself in an amnesiac Londoner ([[David Morrissey]]), with whom he saves [[Victorian-era]] London. \"[[Planet of the Dead]]\" (Easter 2009) features jewel thief [[Lady Christina de Souza]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) as The Doctor's one-off companion, and The Doctor is presented with a prophecy of his imminent death. Tennant makes a crossover appearance in a ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' two-parter, \u201c[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]\u201d, in which a powerful being known as [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures creatures and aliens#The Trickster|The Trickster]] ([[Paul Marc Davis]]) also alludes to the Tenth Doctor's impending demise. In \"[[The Waters of Mars]]\", The Doctor tries to alter history and avert the death of one-off companion Adelaide Brooke ([[Lindsay Duncan]]); when she commits suicide, he begins to feel his mortality weigh down upon him. In the animated serial ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'', The Doctor is joined by two one-off companions in 1950s [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. In the two-part send-off \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\", The Doctor confronts the Ood about their original prophecy and is led to contemporary Earth where, in the second part, the again-resurrected Master restores Gallifrey and the Time Lords to existence, although he redeems himself by assisting The Doctor to defeat Time Lord President [[Rassilon]] ([[Timothy Dalton]]) before disappearing alongside the other Time Lords. The Doctor sacrifices his life to save Wilfred, exposing himself to 500,000 [[rad (unit)|rads]] of deadly radiation and triggering his [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]]. He holds it back and is shown visiting several companions.{{ref label|A|a|none}} He gives Donna a winning lottery ticket on her wedding day, buying it with money he borrowed from her late father in the past, saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran sniper, saves Sarah Jane's son [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]] ([[Tommy Knight]]) from a car, introduces Jack to a romantic interest ([[Russell Tovey]]), and finally, just before regenerating into the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]), he informs Rose in 2005 that she is about to have a \"great year\". As he begins regenerating once in the TARDIS, his last words are \"I don't want to go\".\n\nTennant reprised the role for the show's 50th anniversary in \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" (2013), appearing alongside the Eleventh Doctor and a forgotten past incarnation, the [[War Doctor]], played by [[John Hurt]]. In the special, in which we view scenes from the Tenth Doctor's time taking place between \"The Waters of Mars\" and \"The End of Time\", The Doctor unintentionally marries [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Joanna Page]]) while luring out a [[Zygon]]. He helps the other Doctors in saving Gallifrey at the Time War's conclusion, but will not retain memories of the event.  His final words are, once again \"I don't want to go\" after being told that he will die on Trenzalore.\n\n====Spoofs====\nDavid Tennant has also made numerous cameo appearances as The Doctor outside of ''Doctor Who'', frequently in [[Doctor Who spoofs|spoof appearances]]. Singer and actress [[Charlotte Church]] spoofs ''Doctor Who'' alongside an actor playing the Tenth Doctor in her own ''[[The Charlotte Church Show]]'' (2006). In an appearance on ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'' in 2007, Tennant plays a female companion to the Tenth Doctor ([[Justin Lee Collins]]) on the Pink Planet, where they are confronted by the alien Gay Lord ([[Alan Carr]]). When the show became ''The Sunday Night Project'', Catherine Tate appeared in a [[skit comedy|skit]] playing the Tenth Doctor. Tennant starred opposite Catherine Tate in her own ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]'' special (2007) as [[Lauren Cooper]]'s (Tate) teacher Mr. Logan, who Cooper teases for his resemblance to The Doctor; eventually, he reveals himself to be the Tenth Doctor and shrinks Cooper into a 5\" Rose Tyler [[action figure]]. In the final episode of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' (December 2007), a brief scene shows The Doctor and an unidentified [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wren]] companion attacked by Schlong, a slug-like alien played by [[Andy Millman]] ([[Ricky Gervais]]). The Tenth Doctor is also featured in political satire; in a 2007 episode of ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', when faced by the question of [[Gordon Brown]]'s succession, [[Tony Blair]] (impressionist [[Jon Culshaw]]) regenerates into David Tennant after promising \"[[New Labour]] is all about renewal\", later vowing 100 more years of power. Tennant modifies his first line in \"The Parting of the Ways\" (\"New teeth, that's weird\"), to \"New Labour, that's weird\" and proceeds to address the public in a Tony Blair impression resembling Culshaw's. Tennant also guest-voiced his incarnation of The Doctor in an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' (2016). He later played the role in full costume for a sketch with [[The Muppets]] in a live performance at [[The O2 Arena]] in 2018.\n\n===Literature===\nAs the face of the ''Doctor Who'' franchise for 2005\u20132010, the Tenth Doctor appears extensively in ''Doctor Who'' spin-off media; in the majority of these series, the character simply takes after the place of the Ninth Doctor, and in turn is replaced by the Eleventh following the debut of [[Doctor Who (series 5)|the 2010 series]]. Novels featuring the Tenth Doctor are all published by [[BBC Books]]. The character appears in [[New Series Adventures]] novels spanning from ''[[The Stone Rose]]'' (April 2006) to ''[[The Krillitane Storm]]'' (September 2009). A number ''Decide Your Destiny'' novels were published between July 2007 and March 2008, as well as five books published as a part of [[Quick Reads Initiative]], a government-sponsored [[adult literacy]] project. BBC Children's Books released their own 10-part series, ''The Darksmith Legacy'', supported by an interactive tie-in website. Additionally, short stories are frequently published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'', ''The Doctor Who Storybook'' series (2007\u20132010 editions), the BBC website, and annuals and suchlike; one example is the story \"The Lodger\" by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], later adapted into an Eleventh Doctor [[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|television episode of the same name]]. National newspapers ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' have each published one Christmas-themed Tenth Doctor short story. Additionally, the Tenth Doctor appears in a novelisation of his ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' crossover appearance. The Tenth Doctor also appears extensively in comic books, replacing the Ninth Doctor in those published in ''Doctor Who Magazine'',  and the younger-audience ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who: Battles in Time]]''. American comic book publisher initially published a 2008 Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones miniseries between January and June 2006. This was later followed by a truly ongoing Tenth Doctor series in July 2009, set during the 2008\u20132010 specials and lasting sixteen issues before relaunching with the Eleventh Doctor. In stories set after \"Journey's End\", The Doctor is accompanied by numerous one-off and recurring companions who do not feature in the television series.\n\nOutside of ''Doctor Who'' literature, penciller Georges Jeanty includes a cameo of the Tenth Doctor and Rose in a panel of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' story arc \"[[No Future for You]]\". The Tenth Doctor was utilised in the American [[Satire|satirical]] political [[cartoon strip]], ''[[This Modern World]]''. Arriving in 2003, the Doctor hints to Sparky the Wonder Penguin (the strip's main character) that in five years' time, the next [[President of the United States|President]] could be [[Barack Obama|a black man, with the middle name Hussein, whose father was a Muslim]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/comics/tomo/2008/06/10/tomo/ |title=This Modern World: The Week that Was |first=Tom |last=Tomorrow |date=10 June 2008 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613051405/http://www.salon.com/comics/tomo/2008/06/10/tomo/ |archive-date=13 June 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> The character also appeared in a story arc of the webcomic ''[[PvP (webcomic)|PvP]]'', in which character Brent Sienna hallucinates materialising in the TARDIS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pvponline.com/2009/01/19/stowaway/ |title=Stowaway |website=[[PvP]] |first=Scott |last=Kurtz |author-link=Scott Kurtz |date=19 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122014439/http://pvponline.com/2009/01/19/stowaway |archive-date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Audio drama===\nAs is the case with the BBC Books novels, the Tenth Doctor replaced the Ninth as the face of the [[List of Doctor Who audiobooks|''Doctor Who'' audiobook series]], beginning with ''[[Pest Control (Doctor Who)|Pest Control]]'' in May 2008 and ending with ''[[Dead Air (Doctor Who)|Dead Air]]'' in March 2010. The majority are read by David Tennant, save one read by Michelle Ryan and two by Catherine Tate. A number of Tenth Doctor novels were also abridged to become audiobooks, again featuring David Tennant's voice alongside other cast members such as Freema Agyeman and television series guest stars such as Georgia Moffett, [[Reggie Yates]] and [[Anthony Head]]; the last of these scheduled is ''[[Judgement of the Judoon]]'', for December 2010.\n\nOn 26 October 2015, it was announced Tennant would reprise his role for [[Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures|The Tenth Doctor Adventures]], a series of full-cast audio stories produced by [[Big Finish Productions]]. The first volume of stories had the reprise of Catherine Tate as Donna Noble, consisting of ''Technophobia'', ''Time Reaver'', and ''Death and the Queen'', which were released in May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/doctor-who-the-tenth-doctor-adventures|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]]|date=26 October 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041439/http://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/doctor-who-the-tenth-doctor-adventures|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The second volume of stories saw Billie Piper reprise her role as Rose Tyler alongside Tennant, the stories consisted of ''Infamy of the Zaross'' (with Camille Coduri as Jackie Tyler), ''Sword of the Chevalier'', and ''Cold Vengeance'', which were released in November 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/doctor-who---the-tenth-doctor|title=Doctor Who - The Tenth Doctor and Rose Return!|date=15 May 2017|website=Big Finish|access-date=16 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521115221/https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/doctor-who---the-tenth-doctor|archivedate=21 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A third volume has been announced for release in May 2019, once again with Catherine Tate as Donna Noble, in the stories ''No Place'' (with as Jacqueline King as Sylvia Noble and Bernard Cribbins as Wilfred Mott), ''One Mile Down'' and ''The Creeping Death''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/tenth-doctor-volume-3 |title=Tenth Doctor Volume 3 |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA series of audiobooks featuring the Tenth Doctor was also produced by Big Finish, [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The Tenth Doctor Chronicles (2018\u2013)|The Tenth Doctor Chronicles]]. The first volume, read by Jacob Dudman, was released in April 2018, with the stories ''The Taste of Death'', ''Backtrack'', ''Wild Pastures'' (with Jacqueline King as Sylvia Noble) and ''Last Chance'' (with Michelle Ryan as Lady Christina de Souza).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/the-tenth-doctor-chronicles-1629 |title=The Tenth Doctor Chronicles |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther characters from the tenth doctor era have reprised their roles for Big Finish. In 2018, Camille Coduri narrated two short trips set on ''Pete's World''\" with the Metacrisis Doctor: ''The Siege of Big Ben'' and ''Flight into Hull''. The characters of Jenny (from \"The Doctor's Daughter\") and Lady Christina de Souza (from \"Planet of the Dead\") received their own boxsets in 2018 as well as \"The Tales of New Earth\". Beginning in 2016, Big Finish have also released two boxsets titled \"The Churchill Years\" in which [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Ian McNeice]]) encountered the Tenth Doctor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Video games===\nThe Tenth Doctor, as well as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], appear as playable characters that users could purchase for free from the Avatar Shop within [[Roblox]] for a limited time, which also featured the Pting as a shoulder accessory, and the [[TARDIS]] in the form of a backpack. These items were added as part of a sponsorship between the Roblox Corporation and the [[BBC]] to promote the series finale of [[Doctor Who (series 12)|Series 12]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=play-tenth-thirteenth-doctor-roblox-tardis-pting |title=Play as the Tenth or Thirteenth Doctor on Roblox}}</ref>\n\nIt is currently unknown as to why The Tenth Doctor was added as part of this promotion, despite not even being associated with series twelve, although it is speculated to be due to the fact that the character is widely considered to be one of the best doctors from within the show\u2019s fandom.\n\n==Reception==\nThe Tenth Doctor has been extremely popular amongst the [[Doctor Who fandom|''Doctor Who'' fandom]]. He received critical acclaim for his complexity and humanity and is considered one of the greatest incarnations of the character.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/08/19/doctor-who-why-is-david-tennant-still-the-nations-favourite-doctor-3929038/ |title=Doctor Who: Why is David Tennant still the nation\u2019s favourite Doctor? |date=19 August 2013 |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |first=Dan |last=Wilson |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709051046/http://metro.co.uk/2013/08/19/doctor-who-why-is-david-tennant-still-the-nations-favourite-doctor-3929038/ |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalSpy2013\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a512907/doctor-who-at-50-is-david-tennant-the-greatest-doctor-of-all.html |title='Doctor Who' at 50: Is David Tennant the greatest Doctor of all? |website=Digital Spy |date=6 September 2013 |first=Morgan |last=Jeffery |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709001832/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/news/a512907/doctor-who-at-50-is-david-tennant-the-greatest-doctor-of-all.html |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-28/david-tennants-debut-voted-best-doctor-who-christmas-special |title=David Tennant\u2019s debut voted best Doctor Who Christmas special |date=28 December 2014 |first=Huw |last=Fullerton |journal=Radio Times |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709124833/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-12-28/david-tennants-debut-voted-best-doctor-who-christmas-special |archivedate=9 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The BBC went as far as to consider ending the show in 2010, thinking it would fail without Tennant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-could-have-ended-with-tennant-63467.htm |title=Doctor Who Could Have Ended With Tennant |website=Doctor Who TV |date=27 May 2014 |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725062226/http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-could-have-ended-with-tennant-63467.htm |archivedate=25 July 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2006, readers of ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' voted Tennant's Doctor \"Best Doctor\" over perennial favourite [[Tom Baker]].<ref name=\"best\">{{cite news |title=David Tennant named 'best Dr Who' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6211584.stm |work=BBC News |date=6 December 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122030355/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6211584.stm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He also won the [[National Television Awards]] award for Most Popular Actor in 2006 and 2007, and the award for Outstanding Drama Performance in 2008 and 2010.

Doctor]]\n| next incarnation        = [[Eleventh Doctor]]\n\n}}\nThe '''Tenth Doctor''' is an incarnation of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], the protagonist of the [[BBC]] [[Science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'', who is played by [[David Tennant]] in three series as well as nine specials.  As with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other [[Doctor Who spin-offs|''Doctor Who'' spin-offs]]. In the programme's narrative, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] is a centuries-old [[Time Lord]] alien from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who [[Time travel in fiction|travels in time]] in his [[TARDIS]], frequently with [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]]. At the end of life, the Doctor can [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] his body; in doing so, his physical appearance and personality change, and a new actor assumes the role. Tennant's portrayal of the Doctor is of an outwardly charismatic and charming adventurer whose likable and easygoing attitude can quickly turn to righteous fury when provoked.\n\nThis incarnation's companions include working class shop assistant [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), medical student [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and fiery [[temporary work|temp worker]] [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]). He eventually parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008 series finale, \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\", after which he attempts to travel alone for the duration of the [[Doctor Who (2008\u20132010 specials)|2008\u20132010 specials]] before being accompanied by Donna Noble's grandfather [[Wilfred Mott]] ([[Bernard Cribbins]]) on his final adventure in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n==Overview==\nExecutive producer [[Russell T Davies]] revived ''Doctor Who'' after a 16-year absence with the premiere of \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\" in 2005. Following the BBC's announcement of a second series being commissioned, the story broke that [[Christopher Eccleston]], who played the titular [[Ninth Doctor]], would not be returning for the second series. On 16 April 2005, the BBC announced that David Tennant had been selected for the role of the Tenth Doctor.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Tennant is tenth Doctor Who |publisher=BBC |date=16 April 2005 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/16/tennant.shtml |accessdate=17 January 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206071854/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/04_april/16/tennant.shtml |archivedate=6 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His first appearance in the series was for 20 seconds following the Ninth Doctor's regeneration at the end of \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\". His first full episode as the Doctor, barring an appearance in a \"[[Doctor Who: Children in Need|mini-episode]]\" during the 2005 [[Children in Need]] show, was the 2005 Christmas Special, \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\". He then appeared in the [[Doctor Who (series 2)|2006]], [[Doctor Who (series 3)|2007]] and [[Doctor Who (series 4)|2008 series]]. Rather than a traditional series run, 2009 and early 2010 featured Tennant in a series of four specials. He also guest-starred in the 2009 two-part ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' story ''[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]''. Tennant also appears in two animated serials ''[[The Infinite Quest]]'' and ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]''. In 2013, Tennant reprised his role as the Doctor for the 50th anniversary special \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\".\n\n==Personality==\nThe Tenth Doctor speaks with an [[Estuary English]] accent, rather than the [[Lancashire dialect]] (Christopher Eccleston's own accent) that the Ninth Doctor used, the [[Received Pronunciation]] of most earlier Doctors, or Tennant's natural [[Scottish English]]. David Tennant told ''[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]]'' magazine in 2006 that Russell T Davies had asked him to drop his natural Scottish accent, because he felt \"we'd like to not go for another obvious regional accent, because I suppose they'd done that\".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/i-agreed-to-drop-scots-accent-for-doctor-who-tennant-1-488554 | title = I agreed to drop Scots accent for Doctor Who \u2014 Tennant | date = 3 April 2006 | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] | accessdate = 8 July 2015 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150709062926/http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/i-agreed-to-drop-scots-accent-for-doctor-who-tennant-1-488554 | archivedate = 9 July 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>  In a 23 December interview on [[BBC Radio 1]], Tennant explained that a line had been scripted for the Christmas special explaining that the newly regenerated Doctor had imprinted on [[Rose Tyler]]'s accent, \"like a chick hatching from an egg\", but the line was cut from the final episode.\n\nThe depictions of the personalities of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors shared certain similarities<ref>{{cite web |author=James T.

However, this incarnation was happy to have sideburns and to have more hair than his previous incarnation. He wears his own brown hair in various ways throughout the series: unstyled in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\", a 1950s-style quiff in \"[[The Idiot's Lantern]]\", and flattened forwards in \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\" and \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", but mainly styled it in a spiked up fashion throughout most of the series, with this style being described by friend and later one-time companion Wilfred Mott as being a, \"Modern style sort of hair.

According to an interview on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', David Tennant and Russell T Davies got the idea for the Tenth Doctor's costume from an outfit [[Jamie Oliver]] had worn on ''Parkinson'' just after Tennant had taken the role.<ref name=\"parkinson\">{{Cite episode | title = Episode 26.1 | series = [[Parkinson (TV series)]] | network= ITV | station = ITV1 | location = London | airdate = 5 May 2007}}</ref> David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of the buttons he fastened on his jacket in different episodes.

He also occasionally sports a pair of Red-Cyan 3D glasses, both as a joke and for practical reasons. The Tenth Doctor's costume became so popular that it has spawned numerous recreations (including a BBC-licensed replica of the Tenth Doctor's overcoat by AbbyShot Clothiers<ref>\"[http://uberscifigeek.com/?p=8917 Doctor Who Fashion Line from AbbyShot Clothiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717132002/http://uberscifigeek.com/?p=8917 |date=17 July 2011 }}\", UberSciFiGeek.com, 12 March 2010</ref> and a white/red version worn by Tennant when he co-hosted [[Comic Relief]]), and has been cited by costume designer Louise Page as the costume she is most proud of from her time on ''Doctor Who''.<ref>Doctor Who Magazine #418, February 2010</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nThe Ninth Doctor ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerated]] into the Tenth Doctor at the climax of the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|first series]] (2005) finale, \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\"; he re-introduces himself to his companion [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) in a [[Doctor Who: Children in Need|''Children in Need'' mini-episode]] called \"Born Again\". In the 2005 Christmas special, \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\", he is in a comatose state for most of the episode, following his regeneration. After eventually waking up, he defeats the alien [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Sycorax|Sycorax]] and saves Earth; in the process, he loses a hand, which regrows owing to his recent regeneration. Amongst other [[Doctor Who (series 2)|second series]] (2006) adventures, The Doctor and Rose save [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] ([[Pauline Collins]]) from a [[Werewolf (Doctor Who)#Tooth and Claw|werewolf]] in \"[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]\", resulting in the creation of the anti-alien [[Torchwood Institute]]. In \"[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]\", The Doctor shares an adventure with two former companions, journalist [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]) and robot dog [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] (voiced by [[John Leeson]]), before taking on Rose's boyfriend [[Mickey Smith|Mickey]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) as a second companion. The TARDIS slips through a crack in the Time Vortex causing them to be stranded on a parallel Earth, where they encounter the [[Cybermen]] in the episode, \"[[Rise of the Cybermen]]\". After saving parallel Earth, Mickey decides to stay and help stop the Cybermen around the world despite The Doctor telling him he can never return in \"[[The Age of Steel]]\". He and Rose become stranded on a planet orbiting around a black hole in \"[[The Impossible Planet]]\" where The Beast is waiting, with a Torchwood team. While there, in \"[[The Satan Pit]]\", The Beast taunts The Doctor and Rose about Rose's death. During the 2012 Olympic Games in \"[[Fear Her]]\", The Doctor picks up the Olympic flame and carries it to the end, starting the Games. The series finale takes place in contemporary London, where modern-day Torchwood is the scene for war between the evil alien [[Dalek]]s and parallel-universe [[cyborg]]s the Cybermen; saving the Earth costs The Doctor Rose, who is stranded in a parallel universe, along with Mickey and her mother, in \"[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]\".\n\nIn the closing scene of \"Doomsday\", a mysterious bride called [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) inexplicably appears in his TARDIS. The 2006 Christmas special, \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\" sees The Doctor and bride-to-be Donna save the Earth; Donna saves The Doctor from going too far in his revenge against the alien [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q\u2013Z)#R|Racnoss]] and declines his offer of companionship. In the [[Doctor Who (series 3)|third series]] (2007), The Doctor takes on [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]) as his new companion. Together, they witness the mysterious [[Face of Boe]] ([[Struan Rodger]]) prophecy to The Doctor that \"you are not alone\", in \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". They are rejoined by former companion [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) in a three-episode adventure beginning with \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\", where presumed-deceased archenemy and fellow Time Lord [[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] ([[John Simm]]) becomes [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and enslaves The Doctor for one year. Martha's plan sees The Doctor infused with the world's psychic energies, and he easily defeats The Master, who seemingly refuses to regenerate and dies in The Doctor's arms. Following this adventure, in the [[d\u00e9nouement]] of series finale \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\", Jack and Martha both depart the TARDIS, and The Doctor is shocked to see what appears to be the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] crash into it. Set moments prior, another ''[[Children in Need]]'' mini-episode, \"[[Time Crash]]\", features a brief encounter between Tennant's Tenth Doctor and the [[Fifth Doctor]] ([[Peter Davison]]), containing [[meta-joke|meta-humour]] surrounding the fact David Tennant had watched and loved Davison's Doctor as a child. In parallel with the third series, Tennant lends his voice to the animated serial ''[[The Infinite Quest]].''\n\nThe 2007 Christmas special, \"[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]\", sees The Doctor and a waitress, [[Astrid Peth]] ([[Kylie Minogue]]), save the Earth from the impending crash of the starship ''Titanic''; Astrid dies heroically, and The Doctor encounters [[Wilfred Mott]] ([[Bernard Cribbins]]) for the first time. In the premiere episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 4)|fourth series]] (2008), \"[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partner in Crime]]\", The Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble, Wilfred's granddaughter, who becomes his regular companion. In \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\", the alien [[Ood]] prophesy the Tenth Doctor's demise. Martha accompanies them for three episodes; in two, entitled \"[[The Sontaran Stratagem]]\" and \"[[The Poison Sky]]\", The Doctor battles the war-hungry alien [[Sontarans]], and last of which sees him become a father of sorts to [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]] ([[Georgia Moffett]]), in \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\". He meets archaeologist and future companion [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] ([[Alex Kingston]]) for the first time from his perspective in the two-parter, \"[[Silence in the Library]]\" and \"[[Forest of the Dead]]\"; she dies, but he stores her consciousness to a hard drive to live on forever, after accepting that one day she will come to mean a lot to him. After Donna encounters Rose in a parallel world in \"[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]\", The Doctor realises that Rose's words to Donna \u2014 \"Bad Wolf\" \u2014 must herald the end of the world. In finale episodes \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\" (which cross over with spin-offs ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''), The Doctor and Donna reunite with former companions Rose, Sarah Jane, Martha, Jack, and Mickey to save the universe from [[Davros]] ([[Julian Bleach]]), the creator of the Daleks. The Doctor was fatally wounded during the event, aborting in mid-regeneration to maintain his current self while transferring the residual energies in his previously severed hand. This resulted in a metacrisis that created a half-human Doctor who would live with Rose in the parallel universe while imbuing Donna with a Time Lord's mind, forcing The Doctor to erase his companion's memories to save her life and leaving her with her family. A ''[[Doctor Who Prom (2008)|Doctor Who Prom]]'' mini-episode, \"[[Music of the Spheres (Doctor Who)|Music of the Spheres]]\", features a lone Doctor composing his musical ''Ode to the Universe'' before being interrupted by the small alien [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Graske|Graske]] ([[Jimmy Vee]]).\n\nIn lieu of a 2009 series, Tennant appears as the Tenth Doctor, without a regular companion, in several special episodes over the course of 2008 and 2009, the last of which aired on New Year's Day, 2010.  In the Christmas special \"[[The Next Doctor]]\", The Doctor mistakenly believes he has met a later incarnation of himself in an amnesiac Londoner ([[David Morrissey]]), with whom he saves [[Victorian-era]] London. \"[[Planet of the Dead]]\" (Easter 2009) features jewel thief [[Lady Christina de Souza]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) as The Doctor's one-off companion, and The Doctor is presented with a prophecy of his imminent death. Tennant makes a crossover appearance in a ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' two-parter, \u201c[[The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith]]\u201d, in which a powerful being known as [[List of The Sarah Jane Adventures creatures and aliens#The Trickster|The Trickster]] ([[Paul Marc Davis]]) also alludes to the Tenth Doctor's impending demise. In \"[[The Waters of Mars]]\", The Doctor tries to alter history and avert the death of one-off companion Adelaide Brooke ([[Lindsay Duncan]]); when she commits suicide, he begins to feel his mortality weigh down upon him. In the animated serial ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'', The Doctor is joined by two one-off companions in 1950s [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. In the two-part send-off \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\", The Doctor confronts the Ood about their original prophecy and is led to contemporary Earth where, in the second part, the again-resurrected Master restores Gallifrey and the Time Lords to existence, although he redeems himself by assisting The Doctor to defeat Time Lord President [[Rassilon]] ([[Timothy Dalton]]) before disappearing alongside the other Time Lords. The Doctor sacrifices his life to save Wilfred, exposing himself to 500,000 [[rad (unit)|rads]] of deadly radiation and triggering his [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]]. He holds it back and is shown visiting several companions.{{ref label|A|a|none}} He gives Donna a winning lottery ticket on her wedding day, buying it with money he borrowed from her late father in the past, saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran sniper, saves Sarah Jane's son [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]] ([[Tommy Knight]]) from a car, introduces Jack to a romantic interest ([[Russell Tovey]]), and finally, just before regenerating into the [[Eleventh Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]), he informs Rose in 2005 that she is about to have a \"great year\". As he begins regenerating once in the TARDIS, his last words are \"I don't want to go\".\n\nTennant reprised the role for the show's 50th anniversary in \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" (2013), appearing alongside the Eleventh Doctor and a forgotten past incarnation, the [[War Doctor]], played by [[John Hurt]]. In the special, in which we view scenes from the Tenth Doctor's time taking place between \"The Waters of Mars\" and \"The End of Time\", The Doctor unintentionally marries [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Joanna Page]]) while luring out a [[Zygon]]. He helps the other Doctors in saving Gallifrey at the Time War's conclusion, but will not retain memories of the event.  His final words are, once again \"I don't want to go\" after being told that he will die on Trenzalore.\n\n====Spoofs====\nDavid Tennant has also made numerous cameo appearances as The Doctor outside of ''Doctor Who'', frequently in [[Doctor Who spoofs|spoof appearances]]. Singer and actress [[Charlotte Church]] spoofs ''Doctor Who'' alongside an actor playing the Tenth Doctor in her own ''[[The Charlotte Church Show]]'' (2006). In an appearance on ''[[The Friday Night Project]]'' in 2007, Tennant plays a female companion to the Tenth Doctor ([[Justin Lee Collins]]) on the Pink Planet, where they are confronted by the alien Gay Lord ([[Alan Carr]]). When the show became ''The Sunday Night Project'', Catherine Tate appeared in a [[skit comedy|skit]] playing the Tenth Doctor. Tennant starred opposite Catherine Tate in her own ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]'' special (2007) as [[Lauren Cooper]]'s (Tate) teacher Mr. Logan, who Cooper teases for his resemblance to The Doctor; eventually, he reveals himself to be the Tenth Doctor and shrinks Cooper into a 5\" Rose Tyler [[action figure]]. In the final episode of ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'' (December 2007), a brief scene shows The Doctor and an unidentified [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wren]] companion attacked by Schlong, a slug-like alien played by [[Andy Millman]] ([[Ricky Gervais]]). The Tenth Doctor is also featured in political satire; in a 2007 episode of ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', when faced by the question of [[Gordon Brown]]'s succession, [[Tony Blair]] (impressionist [[Jon Culshaw]]) regenerates into David Tennant after promising \"[[New Labour]] is all about renewal\", later vowing 100 more years of power. Tennant modifies his first line in \"The Parting of the Ways\" (\"New teeth, that's weird\"), to \"New Labour, that's weird\" and proceeds to address the public in a Tony Blair impression resembling Culshaw's. Tennant also guest-voiced his incarnation of The Doctor in an episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' (2016). He later played the role in full costume for a sketch with [[The Muppets]] in a live performance at [[The O2 Arena]] in 2018.\n\n===Literature===\nAs the face of the ''Doctor Who'' franchise for 2005\u20132010, the Tenth Doctor appears extensively in ''Doctor Who'' spin-off media; in the majority of these series, the character simply takes after the place of the Ninth Doctor, and in turn is replaced by the Eleventh following the debut of [[Doctor Who (series 5)|the 2010 series]]. Novels featuring the Tenth Doctor are all published by [[BBC Books]]. The character appears in [[New Series Adventures]] novels spanning from ''[[The Stone Rose]]'' (April 2006) to ''[[The Krillitane Storm]]'' (September 2009). A number ''Decide Your Destiny'' novels were published between July 2007 and March 2008, as well as five books published as a part of [[Quick Reads Initiative]], a government-sponsored [[adult literacy]] project. BBC Children's Books released their own 10-part series, ''The Darksmith Legacy'', supported by an interactive tie-in website. Additionally, short stories are frequently published in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'', ''The Doctor Who Storybook'' series (2007\u20132010 editions), the BBC website, and annuals and suchlike; one example is the story \"The Lodger\" by [[Gareth Roberts (writer)|Gareth Roberts]], later adapted into an Eleventh Doctor [[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|television episode of the same name]]. National newspapers ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' have each published one Christmas-themed Tenth Doctor short story. Additionally, the Tenth Doctor appears in a novelisation of his ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' crossover appearance. The Tenth Doctor also appears extensively in comic books, replacing the Ninth Doctor in those published in ''Doctor Who Magazine'',  and the younger-audience ''[[Doctor Who Adventures]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who: Battles in Time]]''. American comic book publisher initially published a 2008 Tenth Doctor and Martha Jones miniseries between January and June 2006. This was later followed by a truly ongoing Tenth Doctor series in July 2009, set during the 2008\u20132010 specials and lasting sixteen issues before relaunching with the Eleventh Doctor. In stories set after \"Journey's End\", The Doctor is accompanied by numerous one-off and recurring companions who do not feature in the television series.\n\nOutside of ''Doctor Who'' literature, penciller Georges Jeanty includes a cameo of the Tenth Doctor and Rose in a panel of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'' story arc \"[[No Future for You]]\". The Tenth Doctor was utilised in the American [[Satire|satirical]] political [[cartoon strip]], ''[[This Modern World]]''. Arriving in 2003, the Doctor hints to Sparky the Wonder Penguin (the strip's main character) that in five years' time, the next [[President of the United States|President]] could be [[Barack Obama|a black man, with the middle name Hussein, whose father was a Muslim]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/comics/tomo/2008/06/10/tomo/ |title=This Modern World: The Week that Was |first=Tom |last=Tomorrow |date=10 June 2008 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613051405/http://www.salon.com/comics/tomo/2008/06/10/tomo/ |archive-date=13 June 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> The character also appeared in a story arc of the webcomic ''[[PvP (webcomic)|PvP]]'', in which character Brent Sienna hallucinates materialising in the TARDIS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pvponline.com/2009/01/19/stowaway/ |title=Stowaway |website=[[PvP]] |first=Scott |last=Kurtz |author-link=Scott Kurtz |date=19 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122014439/http://pvponline.com/2009/01/19/stowaway |archive-date=22 January 2009 |accessdate=8 July 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Audio drama===\nAs is the case with the BBC Books novels, the Tenth Doctor replaced the Ninth as the face of the [[List of Doctor Who audiobooks|''Doctor Who'' audiobook series]], beginning with ''[[Pest Control (Doctor Who)|Pest Control]]'' in May 2008 and ending with ''[[Dead Air (Doctor Who)|Dead Air]]'' in March 2010. The majority are read by David Tennant, save one read by Michelle Ryan and two by Catherine Tate. A number of Tenth Doctor novels were also abridged to become audiobooks, again featuring David Tennant's voice alongside other cast members such as Freema Agyeman and television series guest stars such as Georgia Moffett, [[Reggie Yates]] and [[Anthony Head]]; the last of these scheduled is ''[[Judgement of the Judoon]]'', for December 2010.\n\nOn 26 October 2015, it was announced Tennant would reprise his role for [[Doctor Who: The Tenth Doctor Adventures|The Tenth Doctor Adventures]], a series of full-cast audio stories produced by [[Big Finish Productions]].

In 2018, Camille Coduri narrated two short trips set on ''Pete's World''\" with the Metacrisis Doctor: ''The Siege of Big Ben'' and ''Flight into Hull''. The characters of Jenny (from \"The Doctor's Daughter\") and Lady Christina de Souza (from \"Planet of the Dead\") received their own boxsets in 2018 as well as \"The Tales of New Earth\".

At 12:30, III. ''Gruppe'' was scrambled. Approximately one hour later, the ''Gruppe'' intercepted the flight of 50 to 60 [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers and 25 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers.

In total, 291 B-17s from the [[1st Strategic Aerospace Division|1st]] and [[3rd Air Division]], escorted by two fighter groups, were sent on the mission. The USAAF suffered heavy losses that day. III.

At 10:57, 20 aircraft from III. ''Gruppe'' took off at Leipheim and were initially ordered to [[Wiesbaden-Erbenheim]]. While the flight was still airborne, the ''Gruppe'' received further instructions and were vectored to intercept the USAAF bombers on their return from the target area. In the vicinity of Volkel in [[North Brabant]], Netherlands, III. ''Gruppe'' came under attack of approximately 20 to 30 [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighters. In this engagement, III.

He was one of the most successful pilots on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]; being credited with 108 aerial victories. He claimed 104 over the Eastern Front and four four-engine bombers over the Western Front.{{sfn|Spick|1996|p=232}} He may have been the pilot that shot down Soviet female ace [[Yekaterina Budanova]]. Bitsch was [[killed in action]] against [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) fighters on 15 March 1944.\n\n==World War II==\nWorld War II in Europe had begun on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. In July 1941, Bitsch served with III.

He claimed two Russian Yak-4 twin-engine fighters which were shot down on 24 June 1942 to claim his 9th and 10th victories. In July, he claimed 15 victories, including his 20th 'kill' which he shot down on 13 July.

Bitsch recorded his 50th victory on 19 March 1943 three&nbsp;km South of Stary. On 1 June 1943, Bitsch succeeded ''Oberleunant'' [[Franz Beyer (pilot)|Franz Beyer]] who was transferred to IV.

''Gruppe'' was ordered to relocate to [[Bad W\u00f6rishofen]] in southern Germany.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|1996|p=271}} On 1 October, the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) attacked German aircraft production, approaching from the south, targeting the [[:de: Wiener Neust\u00e4dter Flugzeugwerke|''Wiener Neustadt Flugzeugwerke'']] (WNF) in [[Wiener Neustadt]] and other targets at [[Friedrichshafen]]. At 12:30, III. ''Gruppe'' was scrambled. Approximately one hour later, the ''Gruppe'' intercepted the flight of 50 to 60 [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] bombers and 25 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers. In aerial combat which in parts was fought in Swiss airspace, III.

In total, 291 B-17s from the [[1st Strategic Aerospace Division|1st]] and [[3rd Air Division]], escorted by two fighter groups, were sent on the mission. The USAAF suffered heavy losses that day. III. ''Gruppe'' claimed eighteen aerial victories and ''Heraussch\u00fcsse'' that day.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|1996|pp=276\u2013277}} A B-17 destroyed at 14:45 was credited to Bitsch.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|1996|p=501}} On 19 December, the [[15th Expeditionary Mobility Task Force|Fifteenth Air Force]] targeted the railroad transportation infrastructure at [[Insbruck]] as well as [[Messerschmitt]] aircraft manufacting sites at [[Augsburg]]. III.

At 10:57, 20 aircraft from III. ''Gruppe'' took off at Leipheim and were initially ordered to [[Wiesbaden-Erbenheim]]. While the flight was still airborne, the ''Gruppe'' received further instructions and were vectored to intercept the USAAF bombers on their return from the target area. In the vicinity of Volkel in [[North Brabant]], Netherlands, III. ''Gruppe'' came under attack of approximately 20 to 30 [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighters. In this engagement, III.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, ''[[Historische Zeitschrift]]'' and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.<ref>Louis L.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army.

Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War.

In the 1790s, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]\ninvaded, annexed, and subsequently [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the [[Piast Concept]]. It held there was a Polish utopia during the [[Piast dynasty|Piast Dynasty]] a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democracy Party]], known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by [[Roman Dmowski]]. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dictator [[Josef Stalin]] at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]].

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.  The key episode was the [[Russo-Japanese War|decisive defeat of Russia]] by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia.<ref>Rotem Kowner, ed., ''The impact of the Russo-Japanese war'' (Routledge, 2006).</ref> In China [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the [[Kuomintang]] (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n:from this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.<ref>Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism: Its Meaning and History'' (1955) p. 87.</ref>\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism.<ref>Shakhar Rahav, ''The Rise of Political Intellectuals in Modern China: May Fourth Societies and the Roots of Mass-Party Politics'' (Oxford UP, 2015).</ref> The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to historian Patricia Ebrey:\n:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], [[warlordism]], autocracy, [[patriarchy]], and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271</ref>\n:\n\n==== Greece ====\n{{Main articles|Greek nationalism}}\nNationalist [[Irredentism|irredentist]] movements Greek advocating for [[Enosis]] (unity of ethnincally Greek states with the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of [[Cyprus]], as well as the [[Megali Idea]], the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as [[Crete]], [[Ionia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Northern Epirus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Thrace]] among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish war of 1919]]. \n\nThe [[4th of August Regime|4th of August regime]] was a [[Fascism|fascist]] or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and led by Greek general [[Ioannis Metaxas]] from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] respectively. It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).

Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the 'national community' as they define it.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country. They did succeed by uniting several [[South Slavs|south Slavic]] people into [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.<ref>Ivo Banac, ''The National Question in Yugoslavia'' (Cornell University Press, 1984).</ref>\n\n===Anti-colonial nationalism===\n[[File:Crowd demonstrates against Great Britain in Cairo.jpg|thumb|Crowd demonstrates against Britain in [[Cairo]] on 23 October 1951 as tension continued to mount in the dispute between Egypt and Britain over control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].]]\nThis form of nationalism came about during the [[decolonization]] of the post war periods. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. It also appeared in the non-Russian territories of the Tsarist empire and later, the USSR, where Ukrainianists and Islamic Marxists condemned Russian Bolshevik rule in their territories as a renewed Russian imperialism. This form of nationalism took many guises, including the peaceful passive resistance movement led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in the Indian subcontinent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Moyra|title=Politics Review|url=http://moodle.collyers.ac.uk/file.php/465/Politics_Review_articles/nationalism_expansionistanddesrtuctive.pdf|publisher=Politics Review|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBenedict Anderson argued that anti-colonial nationalism is grounded in the experience of literate and bilingual indigenous intellectuals fluent in the language of the imperial power, schooled in its \"national\" history, and staffing the colonial administrative cadres up to but not including its highest levels.

The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. However, even in that early stage there was an ideological critique of nationalism which has developed into several forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and anti-nationalism. The [[Islamic revival]] of the 20th century also produced an [[Islamism|Islamist]] critique of the nation-state.

When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862.

In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''lev\u00e9e en masse'') with a call to service:<blockquote>Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service.

Defeat in war, with a loss in territory, was a powerful force in nationalism.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, ''[[Historische Zeitschrift]]'' and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.<ref>Louis L.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life (he was perhaps a trigamist) and personal finances...were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.| R.J.B. Bosworth, ''Italy and the Wider World: 1860\u20131960'', 2013, Routledge, p.29, {{ISBN|978-1-134-78088-4}} }}\nMeanwhile, a third major group emerged that was hostile to nationalism as radical socialist elements became a force in the industrial [[Northern Italy|North]], and they too rejected liberalism. Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War.

In the 1790s, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]\ninvaded, annexed, and subsequently [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the [[Piast Concept]]. It held there was a Polish utopia during the [[Piast dynasty|Piast Dynasty]] a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democracy Party]], known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by [[Roman Dmowski]]. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dictator [[Josef Stalin]] at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]].

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.  The key episode was the [[Russo-Japanese War|decisive defeat of Russia]] by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia.<ref>Rotem Kowner, ed., ''The impact of the Russo-Japanese war'' (Routledge, 2006).</ref> In China [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the [[Kuomintang]] (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n:from this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.<ref>Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism: Its Meaning and History'' (1955) p. 87.</ref>\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism.<ref>Shakhar Rahav, ''The Rise of Political Intellectuals in Modern China: May Fourth Societies and the Roots of Mass-Party Politics'' (Oxford UP, 2015).</ref> The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to historian Patricia Ebrey:\n:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], [[warlordism]], autocracy, [[patriarchy]], and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271</ref>\n:\n\n==== Greece ====\n{{Main articles|Greek nationalism}}\nNationalist [[Irredentism|irredentist]] movements Greek advocating for [[Enosis]] (unity of ethnincally Greek states with the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of [[Cyprus]], as well as the [[Megali Idea]], the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as [[Crete]], [[Ionia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Northern Epirus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Thrace]] among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish war of 1919]]. \n\nThe [[4th of August Regime|4th of August regime]] was a [[Fascism|fascist]] or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and led by Greek general [[Ioannis Metaxas]] from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] respectively. It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

Many scholars believe that the development of nationalism in Europe (and subsequently the modern nation-state) was due to the threat of war. \"External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat\".<sup>[[Nationalism#cite note-herbst-war-and-state-62|[62]]]</sup> With increased external threats, the state's extractive capacities increase.

They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 \"[[What is a Nation?]]\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily [[plebiscite]]\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.<ref name=\"blackwell\"/>\n\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).  Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient.

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country. They did succeed by uniting several [[South Slavs|south Slavic]] people into [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.<ref>Ivo Banac, ''The National Question in Yugoslavia'' (Cornell University Press, 1984).</ref>\n\n===Anti-colonial nationalism===\n[[File:Crowd demonstrates against Great Britain in Cairo.jpg|thumb|Crowd demonstrates against Britain in [[Cairo]] on 23 October 1951 as tension continued to mount in the dispute between Egypt and Britain over control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].]]\nThis form of nationalism came about during the [[decolonization]] of the post war periods. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. It also appeared in the non-Russian territories of the Tsarist empire and later, the USSR, where Ukrainianists and Islamic Marxists condemned Russian Bolshevik rule in their territories as a renewed Russian imperialism.

(see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2 August 2008|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place. More abstractly, nationalism is \"power-hunger tempered by self-deception\".<ref name=NonN>George Orwell, [http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism], [http://orwell.ru orwell.ru].</ref>\n\nFor Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:\n\n{{quote|There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]]. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist [[Bertrand Russell]] criticizes nationalism for diminishing the individual's capacity to judge his or her fatherland's foreign policy.<ref>''Russell Speaks His Mind'', 1960.

He became a TV sports producer, and later a news journalist and producer, and managing editor on network affiliates, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], and [[RT America]] of the Russian state-owned TV network [[RT (TV network)|RT]]. He received a [[Edward R. Murrow Award (Radio Television Digital News Association)|National Edward R. Murrow Award]] in 2002.\n\nSwann created a news segment called ''Reality Check'' in association with [[WXIX-TV|Fox 19 in Cincinnati]] and [[WGCL-TV|CBS46 in Atlanta]], in which he covered \"issues other media is not looking at\" and uncritically presented [[alt-right]] [[conspiracy theories]]. He garnered praise for a 2012 in-person interview with President [[Barack Obama]] about the so-called \"[[Disposition Matrix|kill list]]\" which is used to direct [[drone strike]]s against American citizens, like [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]. In a manner reminiscent of right-wing conspiracy websites, Swann reported on [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting]], questioned the truth of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], presented [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], and the false claims of a cover-up by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] of data related to the [[MMR vaccine and autism]]. He has also questioned the [[use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War]], whether United States had a role in the development of [[ISIL]], and other controversial topics. \n\nIn 2017, after his employer, CBS affiliate 46 in Atlanta, aired a ''Reality Check'' which presented the false ( - Who declared the [[Pizzagate]] scandel as false? -\n\nAnyone can alter this information and manipulate the narrative. )\n\n [[Pizzagate]] conspiracy theory as potentially true, Swann was forced by WGCL to bring down his ''Truth in Media'' website and all of his social media. About a year later, he was fired when WGCL learned that Swann was planning to relaunch ''Truth in Media''.\n\n== Education ==\nSwann was homeschooled with nine brothers and sisters in [[El Paso, Texas]], and earned a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1993, at the age of 15, and a master's degree in History from [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]] in 1994, at the age of 16.<ref name=Kiesewetter2010>{{cite news |last1=Kiesewetter |first1=John |title=Precocious Texan climbed ranks to anchor |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |page=C5 |date=December 13, 2010 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/103123983|url-access=limited |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}  Abridged version at {{cite web | title=Meet Ben Swann, New Fox19 Anchor | url=http://cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2010/12/13/meet-ben-swann-new-fox19-anchor/ | publisher=Cincinnati.com | date=December 13, 2010 | accessdate=January 13, 2012| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601045640/http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2010/12/13/meet-ben-swann-new-fox19-anchor/|archivedate= June 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"fox19\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/13590367/fox19-names-ben-swann-as-new-co-anchor/ |title=FOX19 names Ben Swann as new co-anchor |publisher=[[WXIX-TV|FOX19]] |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n===Early work===\nSwann's initial and ongoing interest has been to be a church leader.

Swann asked the President direct questions about the so-called presidential \"[[Disposition Matrix|kill list]]\" which had been used to direct [[drone strike]]s against terrorism suspects, and the legality of the list including U.S. citizens, like [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] and teenage son [[Abdulrahman al-Awlaki]].

He became a TV sports producer, and later a news journalist and producer, and managing editor on network affiliates, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], and [[RT America]] of the Russian state-owned TV network [[RT (TV network)|RT]]. He received a [[Edward R. Murrow Award (Radio Television Digital News Association)|National Edward R. Murrow Award]] in 2002.\n\nSwann created a news segment called ''Reality Check'' in association with [[WXIX-TV|Fox 19 in Cincinnati]] and [[WGCL-TV|CBS46 in Atlanta]], in which he covered \"issues other media is not looking at\" and uncritically presented [[alt-right]] [[conspiracy theories]]. He garnered praise for a 2012 in-person interview with President [[Barack Obama]] about the so-called \"[[Disposition Matrix|kill list]]\" which is used to direct [[drone strike]]s against American citizens, like [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]. In a manner reminiscent of right-wing conspiracy websites, Swann reported on [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting]], questioned the truth of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], presented [[9/11 conspiracy theories]], and the false claims of a cover-up by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] of data related to the [[MMR vaccine and autism]]. He has also questioned the [[use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War]], whether United States had a role in the development of [[ISIL]], and other controversial topics. \n\nIn 2017, after his employer, CBS affiliate 46 in Atlanta, aired a ''Reality Check'' which presented the false [[Pizzagate]] conspiracy theory as potentially true, Swann was forced by WGCL to bring down his ''Truth in Media'' website and all of his social media. About a year later, he was fired when WGCL learned that Swann was planning to relaunch ''Truth in Media''.\n\n== Education ==\nSwann was homeschooled with nine brothers and sisters in [[El Paso, Texas]], and earned a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1993, at the age of 15, and a master's degree in History from [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]] in 1994, at the age of 16.<ref name=Kiesewetter2010>{{cite news |last1=Kiesewetter |first1=John |title=Precocious Texan climbed ranks to anchor |work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] |page=C5 |date=December 13, 2010 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/103123983|url-access=limited |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}  Abridged version at {{cite web | title=Meet Ben Swann, New Fox19 Anchor | url=http://cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2010/12/13/meet-ben-swann-new-fox19-anchor/ | publisher=Cincinnati.com | date=December 13, 2010 | accessdate=January 13, 2012| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601045640/http://www2.cincinnati.com/blogs/tv/2010/12/13/meet-ben-swann-new-fox19-anchor/|archivedate= June 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"fox19\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/13590367/fox19-names-ben-swann-as-new-co-anchor/ |title=FOX19 names Ben Swann as new co-anchor |publisher=[[WXIX-TV|FOX19]] |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n===Early work===\nSwann's initial and ongoing interest has been to be a church leader. At the age of 15 he became a youth pastor at his local Baptist Church in [[Canutillo, Texas|Canutillo]] in [[El Paso County, Texas]]. At the age of 19, he began preaching at revivals in Texas. Unable to find a position as a pastor in El Paso, he followed a suggestion from one of his brothers to gain a job in TV news. At that time, four of his brothers worked in television.<ref name=\"Martinez\" /> Three were news cameramen.<ref name=Kiesewetter2010/> He worked for a period of time for [[KDBC-TV]]. In 1998, he moved to [[KFOX-TV]] to work as a news cameraman.<ref name=\"Martinez\" />\n\nAfter working in [[Portland, Oregon]], as an assistant pastor, Swann returned to the Fox station KFOX in El Paso as a sports producer.<ref name=\"Martinez\" /> He then filmed, edited, and reported his own news and sports stories. Swan became a morning co-anchor and managing editor at the station.<ref name=Kiesewetter2010/><ref name=\"fox19\" /> In 2008, he became an evening news anchor for the [[KTSM-TV|NBC affiliate KTSM-TV]].<ref name=Kiesewetter2010/><ref name=\"fox19\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Media Watch: Swann Flies to a New Station|url=http://archive.newspapertree.com/features/2108-media-watch-swann-flies-to-a-new-station|work=Newspaper Tree|publisher=EPmediagroup.com|author=NPT Staff|location=El Paso, TX|date=February 8, 2008|accessdate=January 31, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203222814/http://archive.newspapertree.com/features/2108-media-watch-swann-flies-to-a-new-station|archivedate=February 3, 2016}}</ref> He won regional Emmy Awards in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lonestaremmy.org/awards/emmys/archives/2005-lone-star-emmy-awardees/|title=Outstanding New Segment: Breaking News/Single Story|publisher=[[Lone Star Emmy Awards|Lone Star Chapter]] of the [[NATAS]]|work=2005 Lone Star Emmy Awardees|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref> and 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lonestaremmy.org/awards/emmys/archives/2009-lone-star-emmy-nominations/|title=News Special|publisher=[[Lone Star Emmy Awards|Lone Star Chapter]] of the [[NATAS]]|work=2009 Lone Star Emmy Nominations|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref> as well as a [[Edward R.

The series reflected Swann's [[libertarian]] views and his advocacy of [[Ron Paul]]'s positions.<ref name=wald /> One theme of Swann's ''Reality Check'' was Ron Paul's presidential campaign, with his goal of providing fairer coverage for Paul than the conservative or liberal national press, including an episode about the racist \"[[Ron Paul newsletters]]\" which contradicted the findings of ''[[The New Republic]]'' columnist [[James Kirchick]] who broke the story.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wemple |first=Erik |authorlink=Erik Wemple |title=Cincinnati anchor goes deep on Paul campaign |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/cincinnati-anchor-goes-deep-on-paul-campaign/2012/01/19/gIQAN4WWBQ_blog.html |url-access=limited |accessdate=May 3, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130209100346/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/cincinnati-anchor-goes-deep-on-paul-campaign/2012/01/19/gIQAN4WWBQ_blog.html |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |quote='Reality Check'\u2019s\u2009probing of national political issues is working for Fox 19....

In it, Swann was able to obtain a 7-minute one-on-one interview with President [[Barack Obama]] while on an election campaign stop in Ohio - a rare opportunity for a local news reporter. Swann asked the President direct questions about the so-called presidential \"[[Disposition Matrix|kill list]]\" which had been used to direct [[drone strike]]s against terrorism suspects, and the legality of the list including U.S. citizens, like [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] and teenage son [[Abdulrahman al-Awlaki]]. Answering Swann's questions, Obama responded by saying news reports about the list have never been confirmed by him and  that [[drone strikes in Yemen]] would help bring [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|U.S. soldiers stationed in Afghanistan]] home sooner.<ref name=\"CJR\" /><ref name=Weigel/> Several journalism and civil liberties watchdogs praised Swann's [[fact-checking]] work on the segment, such as [[Conor Friedersdorf]] of ''[[The Atlantic]]'',<ref name=\"Friedersdorf\">{{cite news |last1=Friedersdorf |first1=Conor |authorlink1=Conor Friedersdorf |title=Better Than Fact-Checking: An Ohio Reporter Speaks Truth to Power |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/better-than-fact-checking-an-ohio-reporter-speaks-truth-to-power/261995/ |accessdate=11 April 2019 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref name=\"Greenwald\">{{cite news |last1=Greenwald |first1=Glenn |authorlink1=Glenn Greenwald |title=Obama campaign brags about its whistleblower persecutions (Update) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/obama-campaign-brags-about-whistleblower-persecutions |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Byron Tau]] of ''[[Politico]]'',<ref name=\"Tau\">{{cite news |last1=Tau |first1=Byron |authorlink1=Byron Tau |title=Obama won't talk about drones |url=https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/09/obama-wont-talk-about-drones-134493 |accessdate=11 April 2019 |work=[[Politico]] |date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'',<ref name=\"Mirkinson\">{{cite news |last1=Mirkinson |first1=Jack |title=Ben Swann, Local Ohio Reporter, Grills Obama On 'Kill List' (VIDEO) |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ben-swann-local-ohio-repo_n_1861943 |accessdate=11 April 2019 |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=September 6, 2012 |department=Media}}</ref> and the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]''.<ref name=\"CJR\">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=T.
