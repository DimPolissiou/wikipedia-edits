{"title_page": "Density functional theory", "text_new": "{{Electronic structure methods}}\n\n'''Density-functional theory''' ('''DFT''') is a computational [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] modelling method used in [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[materials science]] to investigate the [[electronic structure]] (or [[nuclear structure]]) (principally the [[ground state]]) of [[Many-body problem|many-body systems]], in particular atoms, molecules, and the [[condensed phase]]s. Using  this theory, the properties of a many-electron system can be determined by using [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]], i.e. functions of another [[Function (mathematics)|function]].  In the case of DFT, these are functionals of the spatially dependent [[electronic density|electron density]]. DFT is among the most popular and versatile methods available in [[condensed-matter physics]], [[computational physics]], and [[computational chemistry]].\n\nDFT has been very popular for calculations in [[solid-state physics]] since the 1970s. However, DFT was not considered accurate enough for calculations in [[quantum chemistry]] until the 1990s, when the approximations used in the theory were greatly refined to better model the [[Exchange interaction|exchange]] and [[Electronic correlation|correlation]] interactions. Computational costs are relatively low when compared to traditional methods, such as exchange only [[Hartree\u2013Fock method|Hartree\u2013Fock theory]] and [[post-Hartree\u2013Fock|its descendants]] that include electron correlation. Since, DFT has become an important tool for methods of [[nuclear spectroscopy]] such as [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]] or [[perturbed angular correlation]], in order to understand the reason of specific [[electric field gradient]]s in crystals.\n\nDespite recent improvements, there are still difficulties in using density functional theory to properly describe: [[intermolecular force|intermolecular interactions]] (of critical importance to understanding chemical reactions), especially [[van der Waals force]]s (dispersion); charge transfer excitations; transition states, global potential energy surfaces, dopant interactions and some [[strongly correlated material|strongly correlated]] systems; and in calculations of the [[band gap]] and [[ferromagnetism]] in [[semiconductor]]s.<ref name=\"dftmag\">{{cite journal| last1=Assadi| first1=M.

In contemporary DFT techniques the electronic structure is evaluated using a potential acting on the system\u2019s electrons. This DFT potential is constructed as the sum of external potentials {{math|''V''<sub>ext</sub>}}, which is  determined solely by the structure and the elemental composition of the system, and an effective potential {{math|''V''<sub>eff</sub>}}, which represents interelectronic interactions. Thus, a problem for a representative supercell of a material with {{math|''n''}} electrons can be studied as a set of {{math|''n''}} one-electron [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger-like equations]], which are also known as [[Kohn\u2013Sham equations]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Hanaor| first1=D.

It set down the groundwork for reducing the many-body problem of {{math|''N''}} electrons with {{math|3''N''}} spatial coordinates to three spatial coordinates, through the use of [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] of the electron density. This theorem has since been extended to the time-dependent domain to develop [[time-dependent density functional theory]] (TDDFT), which can be used to describe excited states.\n\nThe second H\u2013K theorem defines an energy functional for the system and proves that the correct ground state electron density minimizes this energy functional.\n\nIn work that later won them the [[Nobel prize in chemistry]], the H\u2013K theorem was further developed by [[Walter Kohn]] and [[Lu Jeu Sham]] to produce [[Kohn\u2013Sham equations|Kohn\u2013Sham DFT]] (KS DFT). Within this framework, the intractable [[many-body problem]] of interacting electrons in a static external potential is reduced to a tractable problem of noninteracting electrons moving in an effective [[potential]]. The effective potential includes the external potential and the effects of the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb interactions]] between the electrons, e.g., the [[exchange interaction|exchange]] and [[electron correlation|correlation]] interactions. Modeling the latter two interactions becomes the difficulty within KS DFT. The simplest approximation is the [[local-density approximation]] (LDA), which is based upon exact exchange energy for a uniform [[Fermi gas|electron gas]], which can be obtained from the [[Thomas\u2013Fermi model]], and from fits to the correlation energy for a uniform electron gas. Non-interacting systems are relatively easy to solve as the wavefunction can be represented as a [[Slater determinant]] of [[molecular orbitals|orbitals]]. Further, the [[kinetic energy]] functional of such a system is known exactly. The exchange\u2013correlation part of the total energy functional remains unknown and must be approximated.\n\nAnother approach, less popular than KS DFT but arguably more closely related to the spirit of the original H\u2013K theorems, is [[orbital-free density functional theory]] (OFDFT), in which approximate functionals are also used for the kinetic energy of the noninteracting system.\n\n==Derivation and formalism==\nAs usual in many-body electronic structure calculations, the nuclei of the treated molecules or clusters are seen as fixed (the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]]), generating a static external potential {{math|''V''}} in which the electrons are moving. A [[Stationary state|stationary electronic state]] is then described by a [[wavefunction]] {{math|\u03a8({{vec|''r''<sub>1</sub>}},\u2026,{{vec|''r<sub>N</sub>''}})}} satisfying the many-electron time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]\n\n:<math> \\hat H \\Psi = \\left[{\\hat T}+{\\hat V}+{\\hat U}\\right]\\Psi = \\left[\\sum_i^N \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_i}\\nabla_i^2\\right) + \\sum_i^N V\\left(\\vec r_i\\right) + \\sum_{i<j}^N U\\left(\\vec r_i, \\vec r_j\\right)\\right] \\Psi = E \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere, for the {{math|''N''}}-electron system, {{math|''\u0124''}} is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], {{math|''E''}} is the total energy, {{math|''T\u0302''}} is the kinetic energy, {{math|''V\u0302''}} is the potential energy from the external field due to positively charged nuclei, and {{math|''\u00db''}} is the electron\u2013electron interaction energy. The operators {{math|''T\u0302''}} and {{math|''\u00db''}} are called universal operators as they are the same for any {{math|''N''}}-electron system, while {{math|''V\u0302''}} is system-dependent. This complicated many-particle equation is not separable into simpler single-particle equations because of the interaction term {{math|''\u00db''}}.\n\nThere are many sophisticated methods for solving the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation based on the expansion of the wavefunction in [[Slater determinant]]s. While the simplest one is the [[Hartree\u2013Fock]] method, more sophisticated approaches are usually categorized as [[post-Hartree\u2013Fock]] methods. However, the problem with these methods is the huge computational effort, which makes it virtually impossible to apply them efficiently to larger, more complex systems.\n\nHere DFT provides an appealing alternative, being much more versatile as it provides a way to systematically map the many-body problem, with {{math|''\u00db''}}, onto a single-body problem without {{math|''\u00db''}}. In DFT the key variable is the electron density {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, which for a [[Normalisable wave function|normalized]] {{math|\u03a8}} is given by\n\n:<math>n\\left(\\vec r\\right) = N \\int{\\mathrm d}^3r_2 \\cdots \\int{\\mathrm d}^3r_N \\, \\Psi^*\\left(\\vec r,\\vec r_2,\\dots,\\vec r_N\\right) \\Psi\\left(\\vec r,\\vec r_2,\\dots,\\vec r_N\\right).</math>\n\nThis relation can be reversed, i.e., for a given ground-state density {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>({{vec|''r''}})}} it is possible, in principle, to calculate the corresponding ground-state wavefunction {{math|\u03a8<sub>0</sub>({{vec|''r''<sub>1</sub>}},\u2026,{{vec|''r<sub>N</sub>''}})}}. In other words, {{math|\u03a8}} is a unique [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}},<ref name='Hohenberg1964' />\n:<math>\\Psi_0 = \\Psi[n_0]</math>\n\nand consequently the ground-state [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of an observable {{math|''\u00d4''}} is also a functional of {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}}\n\n:<math> O[n_0] = \\left\\langle \\Psi[n_0] \\left| \\hat O \\right| \\Psi[n_0] \\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ground-state energy is a functional of {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}}\n\n:<math>E_0 = E[n_0] = \\left\\langle \\Psi[n_0] \\left| \\hat T + \\hat V + \\hat U \\right| \\Psi[n_0] \\right\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere the contribution of the external potential <math>\\left\\langle \\Psi[n_0] \\left| \\hat V \\right| \\Psi[n_0] \\right\\rangle</math> can be written explicitly in terms of the ground-state density <math>n_0</math>:\n\n:<math>V[n_0] = \\int V\\left(\\vec r\\right) n_0(\\vec r) \\,{\\mathrm d}^3r. </math>\n\nMore generally, the contribution of the external potential <math>\\left\\langle \\Psi \\left| \\hat V \\right| \\Psi \\right\\rangle</math> can be written explicitly in terms of the density <math>n</math>:\n\n:<math>V[n] = \\int V(\\vec r) n(\\vec r)\\,{\\mathrm d}^3r. </math>\n\nThe functionals {{math|''T''[''n'']}} and {{math|''U''[''n'']}} are called universal functionals, while {{math|''V''[''n'']}} is called a non-universal functional, as it depends on the system under study. Having specified a system, i.e., having specified {{math|''V\u0302''}}, one then has to minimize the functional\n\n:<math> E[n] = T[n]+ U[n] + \\int V(\\vec r) n(\\vec r) \\,{\\mathrm d}^3r </math>\n\nwith respect to {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, assuming one has reliable expressions for {{math|''T''[''n'']}} and {{math|''U''[''n'']}}. A successful minimization of the energy functional will yield the ground-state density {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}} and thus all other ground-state observables.\n\nThe variational problems of minimizing the energy functional {{math|''E''[''n'']}} can be solved by applying the Lagrangian method of undetermined multipliers.<ref name='Kohn1965'>{{cite journal|title=Self-consistent equations including exchange and correlation effects|journal=Physical Review|year=1965|first=W.| last=Kohn|last2=Sham |first2=L.

Here, {{math|''V''<sub>XC</sub>}} includes all the many-particle interactions. Since the Hartree term and {{math|''V''<sub>XC</sub>}} depend on {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, which depends on the {{math|''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>''}}, which in turn depend on {{math|''V''<sub>s</sub>}}, the problem of solving the Kohn\u2013Sham equation has to be done in a self-consistent (i.e., [[iteration|iterative]]) way. Usually one starts with an initial guess for {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, then calculates the corresponding {{math|''V''<sub>s</sub>}} and solves the Kohn\u2013Sham equations for the {{math|''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>''}}. From these one calculates a new density and starts again. This procedure is then repeated until convergence is reached. A non-iterative approximate formulation called [[Harris functional]] DFT is an alternative approach to this.\n\n'''Notes'''\n\n# The one-to-one correspondence between electron density and single-particle potential is not so smooth. It contains kinds of non-analytic structure. {{math|''E''<sub>s</sub>[''n'']}} contains kinds of singularities, cuts and branches. This may indicate a limitation of our hope for representing exchange\u2013correlation functional in a simple analytic form.\n# It is possible to extend the DFT idea to the case of the [[Green's function (many-body theory)|Green function]] {{math|''G''}} instead of the density {{math|''n''}}. It is called as [[Luttinger\u2013Ward functional]] (or kinds of similar functionals), written as {{math|''E''[''G'']}}. However, {{math|''G''}} is determined not as its minimum, but as its extremum. Thus we may have some theoretical and practical difficulties.\n# There is no one-to-one correspondence between one-body [[density matrix]] {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}},{{vec|''r''\u2032}})}} and the one-body potential {{math|''V''({{vec|''r''}},{{vec|''r''\u2032}})}}. (Remember that all the eigenvalues of {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}},{{vec|''r''\u2032}})}} are 1.) In other words, it ends up with a theory similar to the Hartree\u2013Fock (or hybrid) theory.\n\n==Relativistic density functional theory (ab initio functional forms)==\nThe same theorems can be proven in the case of relativistic electrons, thereby providing generalization of DFT for the relativistic case. Unlike the nonrelativistic theory, in the relativistic case it is possible to derive a few exact and explicit formulas for the relativistic density functional.\n\nLet one consider an electron in a hydrogen-like ion obeying the relativistic [[Dirac equation]]. The Hamiltonian {{math|''H''}} for a relativistic electron moving in the Coulomb potential can be chosen in the following form ([[atomic units]] are used):\n\n:<math>H=c(\\vec{\\alpha} \\cdot \\vec{p})+eV+mc^2\\beta,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''V'' {{=}} \u2212{{sfrac|''eZ''|''r''}}}} is the Coulomb potential of a pointlike nucleus, {{math|{{vec|''p''}}}} is a momentum operator of the electron, and {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''c''}} are the [[elementary charge]], [[electron mass]] and the [[speed of light]] respectively, and finally {{math|{{vec|''\u03b1''}}}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} are a set of Dirac 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2 matrices:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\vec{\\alpha}&=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\vec{\\sigma} \\\\ \\vec{\\sigma} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\\\ \n\\beta&=\\begin{pmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ 0 & -I \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo find out the [[eigenfunction]]s and corresponding energies, one solves the eigenfunction equation\n\n:<math>H\\Psi=E\\Psi,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u03a8 {{=}} (\u03a8(1), \u03a8(2), \u03a8(3), \u03a8(4))<sup>T</sup>}} is a four-component [[wavefunction]] and {{math|''E''}} is the associated eigenenergy. It is demonstrated in Brack (1983)<ref>{{cite journal|title=Virial theorems for relativistic spin-{{1/2}} and spin-0 particles|first=M. |last=Brack |journal = Physical Review D|volume = 27|issue=8 |page = 1950|year = 1983|doi=10.1103/physrevd.27.1950|bibcode=1983PhRvD..27.1950B|url=https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/12408/1/46.pdf }}</ref> that application of the [[virial theorem]] to the eigenfunction equation produces the following formula for the eigenenergy of any bound state:\n\n:<math>E=mc^2\\left\\langle \\Psi \\left| \\beta \\right| \\Psi \\right\\rangle\n=mc^2\\int\\left|\\Psi(1)\\right|^2+\\left|\\Psi(2)\\right|^2-\\left|\\Psi(3)\\right|^2-\\left|\\Psi(4)\\right|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau,</math>\n\nand analogously, the virial theorem applied to the eigenfunction equation with the square of the Hamiltonian<ref>{{cite arxiv |title=About density functional theory interpretation|first=K. |last=Koshelev |eprint= 0812.2919 |year = 2015|class=quant-ph }}</ref> yields\n\n:<math>E^2=m^2c^4+emc^2\\left\\langle \\Psi \\left| V\\beta \\right| \\Psi \\right\\rangle</math>.\n\nIt is easy to see that both of the above formulae represent density functionals. The former formula can be easily generalized for the multi-electron case.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|title=Alpha variation problem and ''q''-factor definition|first=K. |last=Koshelev  |eprint= 0707.1146 |year = 2007|class=physics.atom-ph  }}</ref>\n\nOne may observe that both of the functionals written above don't have extremals, of course, if a reasonably\nwide set of functions is allowed for variation. Nevertheless, it is possible to design a density functional with desired extremal properties out of those ones. Let us make it in the following way:\n\n:<math>F[n]={1\\over{mc^2}}\\left (mc^2\\int n d\\tau-\\sqrt{m^2c^4+emc^2\\int Vn d\\tau} \\right )^2+\\delta_{n,n_e}mc^2\\int n d\\tau</math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''n<sub>e</sub>''}} in Kronecker delta symbol of the second term denotes any extremal for the functional represented by the first term of the functional {{math|''F''}}. The second term amounts to zero for any function which is not an extremal for the first term of functional {{math|''F''}}. To proceed further we'd like to find Lagrange equation for this functional. In order to do this, we\nshould allocate a linear part of functional increment when the argument function is altered.\n\n:<math>F[n_e+\\delta n]={1\\over{mc^2}}\\left (mc^2\\int (n_e+\\delta n) d\\tau-\\sqrt{m^2c^4+emc^2\\int V(n_e+\\delta n) d\\tau} \\right )^2</math>\n\nDeploying written above equation it is easy to find the following formula for functional derivative\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta F[n_e]}{\\delta n}=2A-\\frac{2B^2+AeV(\\tau_0)}{B}+eV(\\tau_0)</math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} stay for {{math|''mc<sup>2</sup>\u222b n<sub>e</sub> d\u03c4''}} and {{math|''\u221am<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup>+emc<sup>2</sup>\u222bVn<sub>e</sub>d\u03c4''}} respectively. And finally {{math|''V(\u03c4<sub>0</sub>)''}} is a value of potential in\nsome point, specified by support of variation function {{math|''\u03b4n''}} which is supposed to be infinitesimal. To advance toward Lagrange equation we equate functional derivative to zero and after simple algebraic manipulations arrive to the following equation.\n\n:<math>2B(A-B)=eV(\\tau_0)(A-B)</math>\n\nApparently this equation could have solution only if {{math|''A''}} is equal to {{math|''B''}}. This last condition provides us with Lagrange\nequation for functional {{math|''F''}}, which could be finally written down in the following form.\n\n:<math>\\left (mc^2\\int n d\\tau \\right )^2={m^2c^4+emc^2\\int Vn d\\tau}</math>\n\nSolutions of this equation represent extremals for functional {{math|''F''}}. It's easy to see that all real densities,\nthat is densities corresponding to the bound states of the system in question, are solutions of written above equation, which could be called the Kohn\u2013Sham equation in this particular case. Looking back onto the definition of the functional {{math|''F''}} we clearly see that the functional produces energy of the system for appropriate density, because the first term amounts to zero for such density and the\nsecond one delivers the energy value.\n\n==Approximations (exchange\u2013correlation functionals)==\nThe major problem with DFT is that the exact functionals for exchange and correlation are not known except for the [[Fermi gas|free electron gas]].

In such a situation, the one-to-one mapping between the ground-state electron density and wavefunction is lost. Generalizations to include the effects of magnetic fields have led to two different theories: current density functional theory (CDFT) and magnetic field density functional theory (BDFT). In both these theories, the functional used for the exchange and correlation must be generalized to include more than just the electron density. In current density functional theory, developed by [[Giovanni Vignale|Vignale]] and Rasolt,<ref name=\"vignale\" /> the functionals become dependent on both the electron density and the paramagnetic current density.

Specifically, DFT computational methods are applied for synthesis-related systems and processing parameters. In such systems, experimental studies are often encumbered by inconsistent results and non-equilibrium conditions. Examples of contemporary DFT applications include studying the effects of dopants on phase transformation behavior in oxides, magnetic behavior in dilute magnetic semiconductor materials, and the study of magnetic and electronic behavior in ferroelectrics and [[Magnetic semiconductor|dilute magnetic semiconductors]].<ref name=\"dftmag\" /><ref>{{cite journal| last1=Segall| first1=M.

In solid state calculations, the local density approximations are still commonly used along with [[plane wave]] basis sets, as an electron gas approach is more appropriate for electrons which are delocalised through an infinite solid. In molecular calculations, however, more sophisticated functionals are needed, and a huge variety of exchange\u2013correlation functionals have been developed for chemical applications. Some of these are inconsistent with the uniform electron gas approximation; however, they must reduce to LDA in the electron gas limit. Among physicists, one of the most widely used functionals is the revised Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof exchange model (a direct generalized gradient parameterization of the free electron gas with no free parameters); however, this is not sufficiently calorimetrically accurate for gas-phase molecular calculations. In the chemistry community, one popular functional is known as BLYP (from the name Becke for the exchange part and Lee, Yang and Parr for the correlation part). Even more widely used is B3LYP, which is a [[hybrid functional]] in which the exchange energy, in this case from Becke's exchange functional, is combined with the exact energy from Hartree\u2013Fock theory. Along with the component exchange and correlation fun\u0441tionals, three parameters define the hybrid functional, specifying how much of the exact exchange is mixed in. The adjustable parameters in hybrid functionals are generally fitted to a 'training set' of molecules. Although the results obtained with these functionals are usually sufficiently accurate for most applications, there is no systematic way of improving them (in contrast to some of the traditional [[wavefunction]]-based methods like [[configuration interaction]] or [[coupled cluster]] theory). In the current DFT approach it is not possible to estimate the error of the calculations without comparing them to other methods or experiments.\n\n'''''DFT calculation on MOFs:'''''\n\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are a class of hybrid organic-inorganic materials with high surface area, a permanent porosity with sizeable internal pore volume and tunable pore sizes. They have a wide range of potential applications; these are taking as the superior catalyst to fulfil the fundamental challenge in the modern chemistry.\u00a0 MOFs are constructed by interlinking metal ions or, more generally, metal-containing units with organic linkers. Through coordination bonds, they were thus creating crystalline frameworks. Due to the variety of the structural and chemical elements, some MOFs show unexpected characteristics, which sometimes cannot be adequately assessed experimentally. Theoretical approaches have been intensively employed in this case to investigate the systems at the atomic level. Computational modelling on these catalysts will offer many potentials to sort out the possibilities, ideas of synthetic planning and characterization and kinetics of the reaction.\n\nWe examine the heterogeneous hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions by the quantum chemical calculations. From the calculation, we examine the kinetics of these reactions (as mentioned above), characterize the metal-metal interaction in the bimetallic system and get the ideas about the reactive nodes in the framework. Even though there are several challenges for modelling the catalytic activity by reasoning the electronic effect between the interaction of two metal ions; nevertheless, it can successfully overcome this challenge.\u00a0 It has studied in bimetallic CuRhBTC successfully.\n\nOne of the critical challenges in the calculation is the reliability and cost of the calculation. Density functional theory (DFT) is primarily applied in material sciences. MOFs is most promise catalyst in which transition metals are used to design the catalyst. It is a challenge to approach degenerate and non-degenerate electronic configuration of partially filled 3d orbitals. DFT can produce a highly accurate result in lower cost. Besides the theory choosing the functionals is one of the challenges in the calculations.\u00a0 B3LYP functionals are unreliable calculation for the transition metal chemistry; however, both MO6-L and MO6 very suitable for the application in transition metal chemistry. Both give better performance than other basis sets. MO6-2X has improved performance but not suitable for the transition metal chemistry. MOF-HF also not suitable for the transition metal chemistry, which is less accurate than MO6-L and MO6. Thus, it is not possible to study reaction mechanisms using conventional MM methods.\u00a0 For structurally well-defined and small enough systems, DFT calculations are a convincing approach, especially in the field of localized catalytic reactions. It needs to outline the suitability of DFT techniques to study catalysis in MOFs materials through examples from the recent literature. In our previous research, DFT study used to model guest metal ions as active sites in the catalyst and to identify the favourable mechanism for the dissociation and absorption of the reactant on the guest metal ions. Based on these researches, we can try to use to model M (n+) ions in MM'BTC and mechanism of hydrogenation of propylene will be studied. For the hydroformylation, the reaction will be modelled for the Bimetallic framework to determine the reaction steps, Activation energies (reaction barrier) which provide the information about the rate-limiting steps. These steps will provide catalytic activity on MOFs nodes.(by Narayan Acharya)\n\n==Thomas\u2013Fermi model==\nThe predecessor to density functional theory was the '''[[Thomas\u2013Fermi model]]''', developed independently by both [[Llewellyn Thomas|Thomas]] and [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] in 1927.

An exchange energy functional was added by [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in 1928.\n\nHowever, the Thomas\u2013Fermi\u2013Dirac theory remained rather inaccurate for most applications. The largest source of error was in the representation of the kinetic energy, followed by the errors in the exchange energy, and due to the complete neglect of [[electron correlation]].\n\n[[Edward Teller|Teller]] (1962) showed that Thomas\u2013Fermi theory cannot describe molecular bonding. This can be overcome by improving the kinetic energy functional.\n\nThe kinetic energy functional can be improved by adding the [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker|von Weizs\u00e4cker]] (1935) correction:<ref name='Weizs\u00e4cker1935'>{{cite journal|title=Zur Theorie der Kernmassen|trans-title=On the theory of nuclear masses|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik|year=1935|first=C.

The external potential (and hence the total energy), is a unique functional of the electron density.\n\n::If two systems of electrons, one trapped in a potential <math>v_1(\\vec{r})</math> and the other in <math>v_2(\\vec{r})</math>, have the same ground-state density <math>n(\\vec{r})</math> then <math>v_1(\\vec{r}) - v_2(\\vec{r})</math> is necessarily a constant.\n\n::'''Corollary:''' the ground state density uniquely determines the potential and thus all properties of the system, including the many-body wavefunction. In particular, the H\u2013K functional, defined as <math>F[n] = T[n] + U[n]</math>, is a universal functional of the density (not depending explicitly on the external potential).\n\n:'''Theorem 2.''' The functional that delivers the ground state energy of the system gives the lowest energy if and only if the input density is the true ground state density.\n\nIn other words, the energy content of the Hamiltonian reaches its absolute minimum, i.e., the ground state, when the charge density is that of the ground state. \n\n::For any positive integer <math>N</math> and potential <math>v(\\vec{r})</math>, a density functional <math>F[n]</math> exists such that\n:::<math> E_{(v,N)}[n] = F[n] + \\int v(\\vec r)n(\\vec r) \\,\\mathrm{d}^3r </math>\n::obtains its minimal value at the ground-state density of <math>N</math> electrons in the potential <math>v(\\vec{r})</math>. The minimal value of <math>E_{(v,N)}[n]</math> is then the ground state energy of this system.\n\n==Pseudo-potentials==\n\nThe many-electron [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] can be very much simplified if electrons are divided in two groups: [[valence electrons]] and inner core [[electrons]]. The electrons in the inner shells are strongly bound and do not play a significant role in the chemical binding of [[atoms]]; they also partially [[screening effect|screen]] the nucleus, thus forming with the [[nucleus (atomic structure)|nucleus]] an almost inert core. Binding properties are almost completely due to the valence electrons, especially in metals and semiconductors. This separation suggests that inner electrons can be ignored in a large number of cases, thereby reducing the atom to an ionic core that interacts with the valence electrons. The use of an effective interaction, a [[pseudopotential]], that approximates the potential felt by the valence electrons, was first proposed by Fermi in 1934 and Hellmann in 1935. In spite of the simplification pseudo-potentials introduce in calculations, they remained forgotten until the late 1950s.\n\n===''Ab initio'' pseudo-potentials===\n\nA crucial step toward more realistic pseudo-potentials was given by Topp and Hopfield<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Topp|first=William C.|last2=Hopfield|first2=John J.|date=1973-02-15|title=Chemically Motivated Pseudopotential for Sodium|journal=Physical Review B|volume=7|issue=4|pages=1295\u20131303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.7.1295|bibcode=1973PhRvB...7.1295T}}</ref> and more recently Cronin, who suggested that the pseudo-potential should be adjusted such that they describe the valence charge density accurately. Based on that idea, modern pseudo-potentials are obtained inverting the free atom Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a given reference electronic configuration and forcing the pseudo-wavefunctions to coincide with the true valence wave functions beyond a certain distance {{math|''rl''}}. The pseudo-wavefunctions are also forced to have the same norm as the true valence wavefunctions and can be written as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nR_l^\\mathrm{PP}(r)&=R_{nl}^\\mathrm{AE}(r), \\\\[6pt]\n\\int_{0}^{rl} \\left|R_l^\\mathrm{PP}(r)\\right|^2r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r &= \\int_{0}^{rl} \\left|R_{nl}^\\mathrm{AE}(r)\\right|^2r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''R<sub>l</sub>''(''r'')}} is the radial part of the [[wavefunction]] with [[angular momentum]] {{math|''l''}}; and PP and AE denote, respectively, the pseudo-wavefunction and the true (all-electron) wavefunction. The index {{math|''n''}} in the true wavefunctions denotes the [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] level. The distance beyond which the true and the pseudo-wavefunctions are equal, {{math|''rl''}}, is also dependent on {{math|''l''}}.\n\n==Electron smearing==\nThe electrons of a system will occupy the lowest Kohn\u2013Sham eigenstates up to a given energy level according to the [[Aufbau principle]]. This corresponds to the steplike [[Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution]] at absolute zero. If there are several degenerate or close to degenerate eigenstates at the [[Fermi level]], it is possible to get convergence problems, since very small perturbations may change the electron occupation. One way of damping these oscillations is to ''smear'' the electrons, i.e. allowing fractional occupancies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Michelini|last2=Pis Diez|last3=Jubert|first1=M.

The importance of correlation for thermodynamic properties was explored through density distribution functions. The [[functional derivative]] was introduced to define the distribution functions of classical mechanical systems. Theories were developed for simple and complex liquids using the ideal gas as a basis for the free energy and adding molecular forces as a second order perturbation. A term in the gradient of the density was added to account for non-uniformity in density in the presence of external fields or surfaces. These theories can be considered precursors of DFT. \n\nTo develop a formalism for the statistical thermodynamics of non-uniform fluids functional differentiation was used extensively by Percus and Lebowitz (1961) which led to the [[Percus\u2013Yevick approximation|Percus-Yevick equation]] linking the density distribution function and the direct correlation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lebowitz |first1=J.L. |last2=Percus |first2=J.K. |title=Statistical Thermodynamics of Non-uniform Fluids |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |date=1963 |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=116\u2013123 |doi=10.1063/1.1703877 |bibcode=1963JMP.....4..116L }}</ref> Other closure relations were also proposed;the [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method]], the [[BBGKY hierarchy]].

The spatial dependent [[density]] determines the local structure and composition of the material. It is determined as that function which optimizes the thermodynamic potential of the [[grand canonical ensemble]]. The [[grand potential]] is evaluated as the sum of the [[ideal gas]] term with the contribution from external fields and an excess [[thermodynamic free energy]] arising from interparticle interactions. In the simplest approach the excess free energy term is expanded on a system of uniform density using a functional [[Taylor expansion]]. The excess free energy is then a sum of the contributions from s-body interactions with density dependent effective potentials representing the interactions between s particles. In most calculations the terms in the interactions of three or more particles are neglected (second order DFT). When the structure of the system to be studied is not well approximated by a low order perturbation expansion with a uniform phase as the zero order term, non-perturbative free energy functionals have also been developed. The minimization of the grand potential functional in arbitrary local density functions for fixed chemical potential, volume and temperature provides self-consistent thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, in particular for the local [[chemical potential]]. The functional is not in general a [[convex function]]al of the density; solutions may not be local [[minima]]. Limiting to low order corrections in the local density is a well-known problem although the results agree (reasonably) well on comparison to experiment.\n\nA [[variational principle]] is used to determine the equilibrium density. It can be shown that for constant temperature and volume the correct equilibrium density minimizes the [[grand potential]] functional <math> \\Omega </math>  of the [[grand canonical ensemble]] over density functions <math> n(r)</math>. In the language of functional differentiation (Mermin theorem):\n\n:<math> \\delta \\Omega / \\delta n(r) =0 </math>\n\nThe [[Helmholtz free energy]] functional <math> F </math> is defined as  <math> F= \\Omega+\\int dr n(r) \\mu(r)</math>.\nThe [[functional derivative]] in the density function determines the local chemical potential: <math> \\mu(r)= \\delta F(r) /\\delta n(r) </math>\nIn classical statistical mechanics the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is a sum over probability for a given microstate of {{mvar|N}} classical particles as measured by the Boltzmann factor in the [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] of the system. The Hamiltonian splits into kinetic and potential energy which includes interactions between particles as well as external potentials. The partition function of the grand canonical ensemble defines the grand potential. A [[Correlation function (statistical mechanics)|correlation function]] is introduced to describe the effective interaction between particles. \n\nThe s-body density distribution function is defined as the statistical [[ensemble average]] <math> < > </math> of particle positions. It measures the probability to find s particles at points in space <math> r_1,...r_s </math>.\n\n:<math> n_s(r_1..r_s) =  (N!/(N-s)!)< \\delta ( r_1 - r'_1)... \\delta ( r_s - r'_s) > </math>\n\nFrom the definition of the grand potential the functional derivative with respect to the local chemical potential is the density; higher order density correlations for two, three, four or more particles are found from higher order derivatives.\n\n: <math> \\delta ^s \\Omega / \\delta \\mu (r_1)...\\mu (r_s)= (-1)^s n_s(r_1..r_s) </math>\n\nThe [[radial distribution function]] with s=2 measures the change in the density at a given point for a change of the local chemical interaction at a distant point.\n\nIn a fluid the free energy is a sum of the ideal free energy and the excess free energy contribution <math> \\Delta F </math> from interactions between particles. In the grand ensemble the functional derivatives in the density yield the direct correlation functions <math> c_s </math>.\n\n: <math> (1/kT) \\delta ^s \\Delta F / \\delta n(r_1)...n(r_s)= c_s (r_1..r_s)</math>\n\nThe one body direct correlation function plays the role of an effective mean field. The functional derivative in density of the one body direct correlation results in the direct correlation function between two particles <math> c_2 </math> . The direct correlation function is the correlation contribution to the change of local chemical potential at a point <math>r</math> for a density change at <math>r'</math>, and is related to the work of creating density changes at different positions. In dilute gases the direct correlation function is simply the pair-wise interaction between particles ([[Debye-Huckel equation]]). The Ornstein-Zernike equation between the pair and the direct correlation functions is derived from the equation:\n\n:<math>   \\int dr'' (\\delta \\mu(r)/\\delta n(r'')) (\\delta n(r'')/\\delta \\mu(r')))=\\delta(r-r')          </math>\n\nVarious assumptions and approximations adapted to the system under study lead to expressions for the free energy. Correlation functions are used to calculate the free energy functional as an expansion on a known reference system. If the non-uniform fluid can be described by a density distribution that is not far from uniform density a functional Taylor expansion of the free energy in density increments leads to an expression for the thermodynamic potential using known correlation functions of the uniform system. In the square gradient approximation a strong non-uniform density contributes a term in the gradient of the density. In a perturbation theory approach the direct correlation function is given by the sum of the direct correlation in a known system such as [[hard spheres ]] and a term in a weak interaction such as the long range [[London dispersion force]]. In a local density approximation the local excess free energy is calculated from the effective interactions with particles distributed at uniform density of the fluid in a cell surrounding a particle. Other improvements have been suggested such as the weighted density approximation for a direct correlation function of a uniform system which distributes the neighboring particles with an effective weighted density calculated from a self-consistent condition on the direct correlation function. \n\nThe variational Mermin principle leads to an equation for the equilibrium density and system properties are calculated from the solution for the density. The equation is a non-linear integro-differential equation and finding a solution is not trivial, requiring numerical methods except for the simplest models. Classical DFT is supported by standard software packages and specific software is currently under development. Assumptions can be made to propose trial functions as solutions and the free energy is expressed in the trial functions and optimized with respect to parameters of the trial functions. Examples are a localized [[Gaussian function]] centered on crystal lattice points for the density in a solid, the hyperbolic function <math> tanh(r)</math> for interfacial density profiles.\n\nClassical DFT has found many applications, for example: \n* developing new functional materials in [[materials science]], in particular [[nanotechnology]];\n* studying the properties of fluids at a [[surface]] and the phenomena of [[wetting]], [[adsorption]]; \n* understanding life processes in [[biotechnology]];\n* improving [[filtration]] methods for gases and fluids in [[chemical engineering]]; \n* fighting [[pollution]] of water and air in environmental science;\n* generating new procedures in [[microfluidics]] and [[nanofluidics]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Key papers==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |first1=R.

Using  this theory, the properties of a many-electron system can be determined by using [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]], i.e. functions of another [[Function (mathematics)|function]].  In the case of DFT, these are functionals of the spatially dependent [[electronic density|electron density]]. DFT is among the most popular and versatile methods available in [[condensed-matter physics]], [[computational physics]], and [[computational chemistry]].\n\nDFT has been very popular for calculations in [[solid-state physics]] since the 1970s. However, DFT was not considered accurate enough for calculations in [[quantum chemistry]] until the 1990s, when the approximations used in the theory were greatly refined to better model the [[Exchange interaction|exchange]] and [[Electronic correlation|correlation]] interactions. Computational costs are relatively low when compared to traditional methods, such as exchange only [[Hartree\u2013Fock method|Hartree\u2013Fock theory]] and [[post-Hartree\u2013Fock|its descendants]] that include electron correlation. Since, DFT has become an important tool for methods of [[nuclear spectroscopy]] such as [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]] or [[perturbed angular correlation]], in order to understand the reason of specific [[electric field gradient]]s in crystals.\n\nDespite recent improvements, there are still difficulties in using density functional theory to properly describe: [[intermolecular force|intermolecular interactions]] (of critical importance to understanding chemical reactions), especially [[van der Waals force]]s (dispersion); charge transfer excitations; transition states, global potential energy surfaces, dopant interactions and some [[strongly correlated material|strongly correlated]] systems; and in calculations of the [[band gap]] and [[ferromagnetism]] in [[semiconductor]]s.<ref name=\"dftmag\">{{cite journal| last1=Assadi| first1=M.

In contemporary DFT techniques the electronic structure is evaluated using a potential acting on the system\u2019s electrons. This DFT potential is constructed as the sum of external potentials {{math|''V''<sub>ext</sub>}}, which is  determined solely by the structure and the elemental composition of the system, and an effective potential {{math|''V''<sub>eff</sub>}}, which represents interelectronic interactions. Thus, a problem for a representative supercell of a material with {{math|''n''}} electrons can be studied as a set of {{math|''n''}} one-electron [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger-like equations]], which are also known as [[Kohn\u2013Sham equations]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Hanaor| first1=D.

It set down the groundwork for reducing the many-body problem of {{math|''N''}} electrons with {{math|3''N''}} spatial coordinates to three spatial coordinates, through the use of [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]] of the electron density. This theorem has since been extended to the time-dependent domain to develop [[time-dependent density functional theory]] (TDDFT), which can be used to describe excited states.\n\nThe second H\u2013K theorem defines an energy functional for the system and proves that the correct ground state electron density minimizes this energy functional.\n\nIn work that later won them the [[Nobel prize in chemistry]], the H\u2013K theorem was further developed by [[Walter Kohn]] and [[Lu Jeu Sham]] to produce [[Kohn\u2013Sham equations|Kohn\u2013Sham DFT]] (KS DFT). Within this framework, the intractable [[many-body problem]] of interacting electrons in a static external potential is reduced to a tractable problem of noninteracting electrons moving in an effective [[potential]]. The effective potential includes the external potential and the effects of the [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb interactions]] between the electrons, e.g., the [[exchange interaction|exchange]] and [[electron correlation|correlation]] interactions. Modeling the latter two interactions becomes the difficulty within KS DFT. The simplest approximation is the [[local-density approximation]] (LDA), which is based upon exact exchange energy for a uniform [[Fermi gas|electron gas]], which can be obtained from the [[Thomas\u2013Fermi model]], and from fits to the correlation energy for a uniform electron gas. Non-interacting systems are relatively easy to solve as the wavefunction can be represented as a [[Slater determinant]] of [[molecular orbitals|orbitals]]. Further, the [[kinetic energy]] functional of such a system is known exactly. The exchange\u2013correlation part of the total energy functional remains unknown and must be approximated.\n\nAnother approach, less popular than KS DFT but arguably more closely related to the spirit of the original H\u2013K theorems, is [[orbital-free density functional theory]] (OFDFT), in which approximate functionals are also used for the kinetic energy of the noninteracting system.\n\n==Derivation and formalism==\nAs usual in many-body electronic structure calculations, the nuclei of the treated molecules or clusters are seen as fixed (the [[Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation]]), generating a static external potential {{math|''V''}} in which the electrons are moving. A [[Stationary state|stationary electronic state]] is then described by a [[wavefunction]] {{math|\u03a8({{vec|''r''<sub>1</sub>}},\u2026,{{vec|''r<sub>N</sub>''}})}} satisfying the many-electron time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]\n\n:<math> \\hat H \\Psi = \\left[{\\hat T}+{\\hat V}+{\\hat U}\\right]\\Psi = \\left[\\sum_i^N \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_i}\\nabla_i^2\\right) + \\sum_i^N V\\left(\\vec r_i\\right) + \\sum_{i<j}^N U\\left(\\vec r_i, \\vec r_j\\right)\\right] \\Psi = E \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere, for the {{math|''N''}}-electron system, {{math|''\u0124''}} is the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], {{math|''E''}} is the total energy, {{math|''T\u0302''}} is the kinetic energy, {{math|''V\u0302''}} is the potential energy from the external field due to positively charged nuclei, and {{math|''\u00db''}} is the electron\u2013electron interaction energy. The operators {{math|''T\u0302''}} and {{math|''\u00db''}} are called universal operators as they are the same for any {{math|''N''}}-electron system, while {{math|''V\u0302''}} is system-dependent. This complicated many-particle equation is not separable into simpler single-particle equations because of the interaction term {{math|''\u00db''}}.\n\nThere are many sophisticated methods for solving the many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation based on the expansion of the wavefunction in [[Slater determinant]]s. While the simplest one is the [[Hartree\u2013Fock]] method, more sophisticated approaches are usually categorized as [[post-Hartree\u2013Fock]] methods. However, the problem with these methods is the huge computational effort, which makes it virtually impossible to apply them efficiently to larger, more complex systems.\n\nHere DFT provides an appealing alternative, being much more versatile as it provides a way to systematically map the many-body problem, with {{math|''\u00db''}}, onto a single-body problem without {{math|''\u00db''}}. In DFT the key variable is the electron density {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, which for a [[Normalisable wave function|normalized]] {{math|\u03a8}} is given by\n\n:<math>n\\left(\\vec r\\right) = N \\int{\\mathrm d}^3r_2 \\cdots \\int{\\mathrm d}^3r_N \\, \\Psi^*\\left(\\vec r,\\vec r_2,\\dots,\\vec r_N\\right) \\Psi\\left(\\vec r,\\vec r_2,\\dots,\\vec r_N\\right).</math>\n\nThis relation can be reversed, i.e., for a given ground-state density {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>({{vec|''r''}})}} it is possible, in principle, to calculate the corresponding ground-state wavefunction {{math|\u03a8<sub>0</sub>({{vec|''r''<sub>1</sub>}},\u2026,{{vec|''r<sub>N</sub>''}})}}. In other words, {{math|\u03a8}} is a unique [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}},<ref name='Hohenberg1964' />\n:<math>\\Psi_0 = \\Psi[n_0]</math>\n\nand consequently the ground-state [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of an observable {{math|''\u00d4''}} is also a functional of {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}}\n\n:<math> O[n_0] = \\left\\langle \\Psi[n_0] \\left| \\hat O \\right| \\Psi[n_0] \\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ground-state energy is a functional of {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}}\n\n:<math>E_0 = E[n_0] = \\left\\langle \\Psi[n_0] \\left| \\hat T + \\hat V + \\hat U \\right| \\Psi[n_0] \\right\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere the contribution of the external potential <math>\\left\\langle \\Psi[n_0] \\left| \\hat V \\right| \\Psi[n_0] \\right\\rangle</math> can be written explicitly in terms of the ground-state density <math>n_0</math>:\n\n:<math>V[n_0] = \\int V\\left(\\vec r\\right) n_0(\\vec r) \\,{\\mathrm d}^3r. </math>\n\nMore generally, the contribution of the external potential <math>\\left\\langle \\Psi \\left| \\hat V \\right| \\Psi \\right\\rangle</math> can be written explicitly in terms of the density <math>n</math>:\n\n:<math>V[n] = \\int V(\\vec r) n(\\vec r)\\,{\\mathrm d}^3r. </math>\n\nThe functionals {{math|''T''[''n'']}} and {{math|''U''[''n'']}} are called universal functionals, while {{math|''V''[''n'']}} is called a non-universal functional, as it depends on the system under study. Having specified a system, i.e., having specified {{math|''V\u0302''}}, one then has to minimize the functional\n\n:<math> E[n] = T[n]+ U[n] + \\int V(\\vec r) n(\\vec r) \\,{\\mathrm d}^3r </math>\n\nwith respect to {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, assuming one has reliable expressions for {{math|''T''[''n'']}} and {{math|''U''[''n'']}}. A successful minimization of the energy functional will yield the ground-state density {{math|''n''<sub>0</sub>}} and thus all other ground-state observables.\n\nThe variational problems of minimizing the energy functional {{math|''E''[''n'']}} can be solved by applying the Lagrangian method of undetermined multipliers.<ref name='Kohn1965'>{{cite journal|title=Self-consistent equations including exchange and correlation effects|journal=Physical Review|year=1965|first=W.| last=Kohn|last2=Sham |first2=L.

Here, {{math|''V''<sub>XC</sub>}} includes all the many-particle interactions. Since the Hartree term and {{math|''V''<sub>XC</sub>}} depend on {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, which depends on the {{math|''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>''}}, which in turn depend on {{math|''V''<sub>s</sub>}}, the problem of solving the Kohn\u2013Sham equation has to be done in a self-consistent (i.e., [[iteration|iterative]]) way. Usually one starts with an initial guess for {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}})}}, then calculates the corresponding {{math|''V''<sub>s</sub>}} and solves the Kohn\u2013Sham equations for the {{math|''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>''}}. From these one calculates a new density and starts again. This procedure is then repeated until convergence is reached. A non-iterative approximate formulation called [[Harris functional]] DFT is an alternative approach to this.\n\n'''Notes'''\n\n# The one-to-one correspondence between electron density and single-particle potential is not so smooth. It contains kinds of non-analytic structure. {{math|''E''<sub>s</sub>[''n'']}} contains kinds of singularities, cuts and branches. This may indicate a limitation of our hope for representing exchange\u2013correlation functional in a simple analytic form.\n# It is possible to extend the DFT idea to the case of the [[Green's function (many-body theory)|Green function]] {{math|''G''}} instead of the density {{math|''n''}}. It is called as [[Luttinger\u2013Ward functional]] (or kinds of similar functionals), written as {{math|''E''[''G'']}}. However, {{math|''G''}} is determined not as its minimum, but as its extremum. Thus we may have some theoretical and practical difficulties.\n# There is no one-to-one correspondence between one-body [[density matrix]] {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}},{{vec|''r''\u2032}})}} and the one-body potential {{math|''V''({{vec|''r''}},{{vec|''r''\u2032}})}}. (Remember that all the eigenvalues of {{math|''n''({{vec|''r''}},{{vec|''r''\u2032}})}} are 1.) In other words, it ends up with a theory similar to the Hartree\u2013Fock (or hybrid) theory.\n\n==Relativistic density functional theory (ab initio functional forms)==\nThe same theorems can be proven in the case of relativistic electrons, thereby providing generalization of DFT for the relativistic case. Unlike the nonrelativistic theory, in the relativistic case it is possible to derive a few exact and explicit formulas for the relativistic density functional.\n\nLet one consider an electron in a hydrogen-like ion obeying the relativistic [[Dirac equation]]. The Hamiltonian {{math|''H''}} for a relativistic electron moving in the Coulomb potential can be chosen in the following form ([[atomic units]] are used):\n\n:<math>H=c(\\vec{\\alpha} \\cdot \\vec{p})+eV+mc^2\\beta,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''V'' {{=}} \u2212{{sfrac|''eZ''|''r''}}}} is the Coulomb potential of a pointlike nucleus, {{math|{{vec|''p''}}}} is a momentum operator of the electron, and {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''c''}} are the [[elementary charge]], [[electron mass]] and the [[speed of light]] respectively, and finally {{math|{{vec|''\u03b1''}}}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} are a set of Dirac 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2 matrices:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\vec{\\alpha}&=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\vec{\\sigma} \\\\ \\vec{\\sigma} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\\\ \n\\beta&=\\begin{pmatrix} I & 0 \\\\ 0 & -I \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo find out the [[eigenfunction]]s and corresponding energies, one solves the eigenfunction equation\n\n:<math>H\\Psi=E\\Psi,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|\u03a8 {{=}} (\u03a8(1), \u03a8(2), \u03a8(3), \u03a8(4))<sup>T</sup>}} is a four-component [[wavefunction]] and {{math|''E''}} is the associated eigenenergy. It is demonstrated in Brack (1983)<ref>{{cite journal|title=Virial theorems for relativistic spin-{{1/2}} and spin-0 particles|first=M. |last=Brack |journal = Physical Review D|volume = 27|issue=8 |page = 1950|year = 1983|doi=10.1103/physrevd.27.1950|bibcode=1983PhRvD..27.1950B|url=https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/12408/1/46.pdf }}</ref> that application of the [[virial theorem]] to the eigenfunction equation produces the following formula for the eigenenergy of any bound state:\n\n:<math>E=mc^2\\left\\langle \\Psi \\left| \\beta \\right| \\Psi \\right\\rangle\n=mc^2\\int\\left|\\Psi(1)\\right|^2+\\left|\\Psi(2)\\right|^2-\\left|\\Psi(3)\\right|^2-\\left|\\Psi(4)\\right|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau,</math>\n\nand analogously, the virial theorem applied to the eigenfunction equation with the square of the Hamiltonian<ref>{{cite arxiv |title=About density functional theory interpretation|first=K. |last=Koshelev |eprint= 0812.2919 |year = 2015|class=quant-ph }}</ref> yields\n\n:<math>E^2=m^2c^4+emc^2\\left\\langle \\Psi \\left| V\\beta \\right| \\Psi \\right\\rangle</math>.\n\nIt is easy to see that both of the above formulae represent density functionals. The former formula can be easily generalized for the multi-electron case.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|title=Alpha variation problem and ''q''-factor definition|first=K. |last=Koshelev  |eprint= 0707.1146 |year = 2007|class=physics.atom-ph  }}</ref>\n\nOne may observe that both of the functionals written above don't have extremals, of course if reasonably\nwide set of functions is allowed for variation. Nevertheless it is possible to design a density functional with desired extremal properties out of those ones. Let us make it in the following way:\n\n:<math>F[n]={1\\over{mc^2}}\\left (mc^2\\int n d\\tau-\\sqrt{m^2c^4+emc^2\\int Vn d\\tau} \\right )^2+\\delta_{n,n_e}mc^2\\int n d\\tau</math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''n<sub>e</sub>''}} in Kronecker delta symbol of the second term denotes any extremal for the functional represented by the first term of the functional {{math|''F''}}. The second term amounts to zero for any function which is not an extremal for the first term of functional {{math|''F''}}. To proceed further we'd like to find Lagrange equation for this functional. In order to do this we\nshould allocate a linear part of functional increment when argument function is altered.\n\n:<math>F[n_e+\\delta n]={1\\over{mc^2}}\\left (mc^2\\int (n_e+\\delta n) d\\tau-\\sqrt{m^2c^4+emc^2\\int V(n_e+\\delta n) d\\tau} \\right )^2</math>\n\nDeploying written above equation it is easy to find the following formula for functional derivative\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta F[n_e]}{\\delta n}=2A-\\frac{2B^2+AeV(\\tau_0)}{B}+eV(\\tau_0)</math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} stay for {{math|''mc<sup>2</sup>\u222b n<sub>e</sub> d\u03c4''}} and {{math|''\u221am<sup>2</sup>c<sup>4</sup>+emc<sup>2</sup>\u222bVn<sub>e</sub>d\u03c4''}} respectively. And finally {{math|''V(\u03c4<sub>0</sub>)''}} is a value of potential in\nsome point, specified by support of variation function {{math|''\u03b4n''}} which is supposed to be infinitesimal. To advance toward Lagrange equation we equate functional derivative to zero and after simple algebraic manipulations arrive to the following equation.\n\n:<math>2B(A-B)=eV(\\tau_0)(A-B)</math>\n\nApparently this equation could have solution only if {{math|''A''}} is equal to {{math|''B''}}. This last condition provides us with Lagrange\nequation for functional {{math|''F''}}, which could be finally written down in the following form.\n\n:<math>\\left (mc^2\\int n d\\tau \\right )^2={m^2c^4+emc^2\\int Vn d\\tau}</math>\n\nSolutions of this equation represent extremals for functional {{math|''F''}}. It's easy to see that all real densities,\nthat is densities corresponding to the bound states of the system in question, are solutions of written above equation, which could be called the Kohn\u2013Sham equation in this particular case. Looking back onto the definition of the functional {{math|''F''}} we clearly see that the functional produces energy of the system for appropriate density, because the first term amounts to zero for such density and the\nsecond one delivers the energy value.\n\n==Approximations (exchange\u2013correlation functionals)==\nThe major problem with DFT is that the exact functionals for exchange and correlation are not known except for the [[Fermi gas|free electron gas]].

In such a situation, the one-to-one mapping between the ground-state electron density and wavefunction is lost. Generalizations to include the effects of magnetic fields have led to two different theories: current density functional theory (CDFT) and magnetic field density functional theory (BDFT). In both these theories, the functional used for the exchange and correlation must be generalized to include more than just the electron density. In current density functional theory, developed by [[Giovanni Vignale|Vignale]] and Rasolt,<ref name=\"vignale\" /> the functionals become dependent on both the electron density and the paramagnetic current density.

Specifically, DFT computational methods are applied for synthesis-related systems and processing parameters. In such systems, experimental studies are often encumbered by inconsistent results and non-equilibrium conditions. Examples of contemporary DFT applications include studying the effects of dopants on phase transformation behavior in oxides, magnetic behavior in dilute magnetic semiconductor materials, and the study of magnetic and electronic behavior in ferroelectrics and [[Magnetic semiconductor|dilute magnetic semiconductors]].<ref name=\"dftmag\" /><ref>{{cite journal| last1=Segall| first1=M.

In solid state calculations, the local density approximations are still commonly used along with [[plane wave]] basis sets, as an electron gas approach is more appropriate for electrons which are delocalised through an infinite solid. In molecular calculations, however, more sophisticated functionals are needed, and a huge variety of exchange\u2013correlation functionals have been developed for chemical applications. Some of these are inconsistent with the uniform electron gas approximation; however, they must reduce to LDA in the electron gas limit. Among physicists, one of the most widely used functionals is the revised Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof exchange model (a direct generalized gradient parameterization of the free electron gas with no free parameters); however, this is not sufficiently calorimetrically accurate for gas-phase molecular calculations. In the chemistry community, one popular functional is known as BLYP (from the name Becke for the exchange part and Lee, Yang and Parr for the correlation part). Even more widely used is B3LYP, which is a [[hybrid functional]] in which the exchange energy, in this case from Becke's exchange functional, is combined with the exact energy from Hartree\u2013Fock theory. Along with the component exchange and correlation fun\u0441tionals, three parameters define the hybrid functional, specifying how much of the exact exchange is mixed in. The adjustable parameters in hybrid functionals are generally fitted to a 'training set' of molecules. Although the results obtained with these functionals are usually sufficiently accurate for most applications, there is no systematic way of improving them (in contrast to some of the traditional [[wavefunction]]-based methods like [[configuration interaction]] or [[coupled cluster]] theory). In the current DFT approach it is not possible to estimate the error of the calculations without comparing them to other methods or experiments.\n\n'''''DFT calculation for MOFs:'''''\n\nMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are a class of hybrid organic-inorganic materials with high surface area, a permanent porosity with sizeable internal pore volume and tunable pore sizes. They have a wide range of potential applications; these are taking as the superior catalyst to fulfil the fundamental challenge in the modern chemistry.\u00a0 MOFs are constructed by interlinking metal ions or, more generally, metal-containing units with organic linkers. Through coordination bonds, they were thus creating crystalline frameworks. Due to the variety of the structural and chemical elements, some MOFs show unexpected characteristics, which sometimes cannot be adequately assessed experimentally. Theoretical approaches have been intensively employed in this case to investigate the systems at the atomic level. Computational modelling on these catalysts will offer many potentials to sort out the possibilities, ideas of synthetic planning and characterization and kinetics of the reaction.\n\nWe examine the heterogeneous hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions by the quantum chemical calculations. From the calculation, we examine the kinetics of these reactions (as mentioned above), characterize the metal-metal interaction in the bimetallic system and get the ideas about the reactive nodes in the framework. Even though there are several challenges for modelling the catalytic activity by reasoning the electronic effect between the interaction of two metal ions; nevertheless, it can successfully overcome this challenge.\u00a0 It has studied in bimetallic CuRhBTC successfully.\n\nOne of the critical challenges in the calculation is the reliability and cost of the calculation. Density functional theory (DFT) is primarily applied in material sciences. MOFs is most promise catalyst in which transition metals are used to design the catalyst. It is a challenge to approach degenerate and non-degenerate electronic configuration of partially filled 3d orbitals. DFT can produce a highly accurate result in lower cost. Besides the theory choosing the functionals is one of the challenges in the calculations.\u00a0 B3LYP functionals are unreliable calculation for the transition metal chemistry; however, both MO6-L and MO6 very suitable for the application in transition metal chemistry. Both give better performance than other basis sets. MO6-2X has improved performance but not suitable for the transition metal chemistry. MOF-HF also not suitable for the transition metal chemistry, which is less accurate than MO6-L and MO6. Thus, it is not possible to study reaction mechanisms using conventional MM methods.\u00a0 For structurally well-defined and small enough systems, DFT calculations are a convincing approach, especially in the field of localized catalytic reactions. It needs to outline the suitability of DFT techniques to study catalysis in MOFs materials through examples from the recent literature. In our previous research, DFT study used to model guest metal ions as active sites in the catalyst and to identify the favourable mechanism for the dissociation and absorption of the reactant on the guest metal ions. Based on these researches, we can try to use to model M (n+) ions in MM'BTC and mechanism of hydrogenation of propylene will be studied. For the hydroformylation, the reaction will be modelled for the Bimetallic framework to determine the reaction steps, Activation energies (reaction barrier) which provide the information about the rate-limiting steps. These steps will provide catalytic activity on MOFs nodes.(by Narayan Acharya)\n\n==Thomas\u2013Fermi model==\nThe predecessor to density functional theory was the '''[[Thomas\u2013Fermi model]]''', developed independently by both [[Llewellyn Thomas|Thomas]] and [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]] in 1927.

An exchange energy functional was added by [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in 1928.\n\nHowever, the Thomas\u2013Fermi\u2013Dirac theory remained rather inaccurate for most applications. The largest source of error was in the representation of the kinetic energy, followed by the errors in the exchange energy, and due to the complete neglect of [[electron correlation]].\n\n[[Edward Teller|Teller]] (1962) showed that Thomas\u2013Fermi theory cannot describe molecular bonding. This can be overcome by improving the kinetic energy functional.\n\nThe kinetic energy functional can be improved by adding the [[Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker|von Weizs\u00e4cker]] (1935) correction:<ref name='Weizs\u00e4cker1935'>{{cite journal|title=Zur Theorie der Kernmassen|trans-title=On the theory of nuclear masses|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik|year=1935|first=C.

The external potential (and hence the total energy), is a unique functional of the electron density.\n\n::If two systems of electrons, one trapped in a potential <math>v_1(\\vec{r})</math> and the other in <math>v_2(\\vec{r})</math>, have the same ground-state density <math>n(\\vec{r})</math> then <math>v_1(\\vec{r}) - v_2(\\vec{r})</math> is necessarily a constant.\n\n::'''Corollary:''' the ground state density uniquely determines the potential and thus all properties of the system, including the many-body wavefunction. In particular, the H\u2013K functional, defined as <math>F[n] = T[n] + U[n]</math>, is a universal functional of the density (not depending explicitly on the external potential).\n\n:'''Theorem 2.''' The functional that delivers the ground state energy of the system gives the lowest energy if and only if the input density is the true ground state density.\n\nIn other words, the energy content of the Hamiltonian reaches its absolute minimum, i.e., the ground state, when the charge density is that of the ground state. \n\n::For any positive integer <math>N</math> and potential <math>v(\\vec{r})</math>, a density functional <math>F[n]</math> exists such that\n:::<math> E_{(v,N)}[n] = F[n] + \\int v(\\vec r)n(\\vec r) \\,\\mathrm{d}^3r </math>\n::obtains its minimal value at the ground-state density of <math>N</math> electrons in the potential <math>v(\\vec{r})</math>. The minimal value of <math>E_{(v,N)}[n]</math> is then the ground state energy of this system.\n\n==Pseudo-potentials==\n\nThe many-electron [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] can be very much simplified if electrons are divided in two groups: [[valence electrons]] and inner core [[electrons]]. The electrons in the inner shells are strongly bound and do not play a significant role in the chemical binding of [[atoms]]; they also partially [[screening effect|screen]] the nucleus, thus forming with the [[nucleus (atomic structure)|nucleus]] an almost inert core. Binding properties are almost completely due to the valence electrons, especially in metals and semiconductors. This separation suggests that inner electrons can be ignored in a large number of cases, thereby reducing the atom to an ionic core that interacts with the valence electrons. The use of an effective interaction, a [[pseudopotential]], that approximates the potential felt by the valence electrons, was first proposed by Fermi in 1934 and Hellmann in 1935. In spite of the simplification pseudo-potentials introduce in calculations, they remained forgotten until the late 1950s.\n\n===''Ab initio'' pseudo-potentials===\n\nA crucial step toward more realistic pseudo-potentials was given by Topp and Hopfield<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Topp|first=William C.|last2=Hopfield|first2=John J.|date=1973-02-15|title=Chemically Motivated Pseudopotential for Sodium|journal=Physical Review B|volume=7|issue=4|pages=1295\u20131303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.7.1295|bibcode=1973PhRvB...7.1295T}}</ref> and more recently Cronin, who suggested that the pseudo-potential should be adjusted such that they describe the valence charge density accurately. Based on that idea, modern pseudo-potentials are obtained inverting the free atom Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a given reference electronic configuration and forcing the pseudo-wavefunctions to coincide with the true valence wave functions beyond a certain distance {{math|''rl''}}. The pseudo-wavefunctions are also forced to have the same norm as the true valence wavefunctions and can be written as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nR_l^\\mathrm{PP}(r)&=R_{nl}^\\mathrm{AE}(r), \\\\[6pt]\n\\int_{0}^{rl} \\left|R_l^\\mathrm{PP}(r)\\right|^2r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r &= \\int_{0}^{rl} \\left|R_{nl}^\\mathrm{AE}(r)\\right|^2r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''R<sub>l</sub>''(''r'')}} is the radial part of the [[wavefunction]] with [[angular momentum]] {{math|''l''}}; and PP and AE denote, respectively, the pseudo-wavefunction and the true (all-electron) wavefunction. The index {{math|''n''}} in the true wavefunctions denotes the [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] level. The distance beyond which the true and the pseudo-wavefunctions are equal, {{math|''rl''}}, is also dependent on {{math|''l''}}.\n\n==Electron smearing==\nThe electrons of a system will occupy the lowest Kohn\u2013Sham eigenstates up to a given energy level according to the [[Aufbau principle]]. This corresponds to the steplike [[Fermi\u2013Dirac distribution]] at absolute zero. If there are several degenerate or close to degenerate eigenstates at the [[Fermi level]], it is possible to get convergence problems, since very small perturbations may change the electron occupation. One way of damping these oscillations is to ''smear'' the electrons, i.e. allowing fractional occupancies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Michelini|last2=Pis Diez|last3=Jubert|first1=M.

The importance of correlation for thermodynamic properties was explored through density distribution functions. The [[functional derivative]] was introduced to define the distribution functions of classical mechanical systems. Theories were developed for simple and complex liquids using the ideal gas as a basis for the free energy and adding molecular forces as a second order perturbation. A term in the gradient of the density was added to account for non-uniformity in density in the presence of external fields or surfaces. These theories can be considered precursors of DFT. \n\nTo develop a formalism for the statistical thermodynamics of non-uniform fluids functional differentiation was used extensively by Percus and Lebowitz (1961) which led to the [[Percus\u2013Yevick approximation|Percus-Yevick equation]] linking the density distribution function and the direct correlation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lebowitz |first1=J.L. |last2=Percus |first2=J.K. |title=Statistical Thermodynamics of Non-uniform Fluids |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |date=1963 |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=116\u2013123 |doi=10.1063/1.1703877 |bibcode=1963JMP.....4..116L }}</ref> Other closure relations were also proposed;the [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method]], the [[BBGKY hierarchy]].

The spatial dependent [[density]] determines the local structure and composition of the material. It is determined as that function which optimizes the thermodynamic potential of the [[grand canonical ensemble]]. The [[grand potential]] is evaluated as the sum of the [[ideal gas]] term with the contribution from external fields and an excess [[thermodynamic free energy]] arising from interparticle interactions. In the simplest approach the excess free energy term is expanded on a system of uniform density using a functional [[Taylor expansion]]. The excess free energy is then a sum of the contributions from s-body interactions with density dependent effective potentials representing the interactions between s particles. In most calculations the terms in the interactions of three or more particles are neglected (second order DFT). When the structure of the system to be studied is not well approximated by a low order perturbation expansion with a uniform phase as the zero order term, non-perturbative free energy functionals have also been developed. The minimization of the grand potential functional in arbitrary local density functions for fixed chemical potential, volume and temperature provides self-consistent thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, in particular for the local [[chemical potential]]. The functional is not in general a [[convex function]]al of the density; solutions may not be local [[minima]]. Limiting to low order corrections in the local density is a well-known problem although the results agree (reasonably) well on comparison to experiment.\n\nA [[variational principle]] is used to determine the equilibrium density. It can be shown that for constant temperature and volume the correct equilibrium density minimizes the [[grand potential]] functional <math> \\Omega </math>  of the [[grand canonical ensemble]] over density functions <math> n(r)</math>. In the language of functional differentiation (Mermin theorem):\n\n:<math> \\delta \\Omega / \\delta n(r) =0 </math>\n\nThe [[Helmholtz free energy]] functional <math> F </math> is defined as  <math> F= \\Omega+\\int dr n(r) \\mu(r)</math>.\nThe [[functional derivative]] in the density function determines the local chemical potential: <math> \\mu(r)= \\delta F(r) /\\delta n(r) </math>\nIn classical statistical mechanics the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is a sum over probability for a given microstate of {{mvar|N}} classical particles as measured by the Boltzmann factor in the [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] of the system. The Hamiltonian splits into kinetic and potential energy which includes interactions between particles as well as external potentials. The partition function of the grand canonical ensemble defines the grand potential. A [[Correlation function (statistical mechanics)|correlation function]] is introduced to describe the effective interaction between particles. \n\nThe s-body density distribution function is defined as the statistical [[ensemble average]] <math> < > </math> of particle positions. It measures the probability to find s particles at points in space <math> r_1,...r_s </math>.\n\n:<math> n_s(r_1..r_s) =  (N!/(N-s)!)< \\delta ( r_1 - r'_1)... \\delta ( r_s - r'_s) > </math>\n\nFrom the definition of the grand potential the functional derivative with respect to the local chemical potential is the density; higher order density correlations for two, three, four or more particles are found from higher order derivatives.\n\n: <math> \\delta ^s \\Omega / \\delta \\mu (r_1)...\\mu (r_s)= (-1)^s n_s(r_1..r_s) </math>\n\nThe [[radial distribution function]] with s=2 measures the change in the density at a given point for a change of the local chemical interaction at a distant point.\n\nIn a fluid the free energy is a sum of the ideal free energy and the excess free energy contribution <math> \\Delta F </math> from interactions between particles. In the grand ensemble the functional derivatives in the density yield the direct correlation functions <math> c_s </math>.\n\n: <math> (1/kT) \\delta ^s \\Delta F / \\delta n(r_1)...n(r_s)= c_s (r_1..r_s)</math>\n\nThe one body direct correlation function plays the role of an effective mean field. The functional derivative in density of the one body direct correlation results in the direct correlation function between two particles <math> c_2 </math> . The direct correlation function is the correlation contribution to the change of local chemical potential at a point <math>r</math> for a density change at <math>r'</math>, and is related to the work of creating density changes at different positions. In dilute gases the direct correlation function is simply the pair-wise interaction between particles ([[Debye-Huckel equation]]). The Ornstein-Zernike equation between the pair and the direct correlation functions is derived from the equation:\n\n:<math>   \\int dr'' (\\delta \\mu(r)/\\delta n(r'')) (\\delta n(r'')/\\delta \\mu(r')))=\\delta(r-r')          </math>\n\nVarious assumptions and approximations adapted to the system under study lead to expressions for the free energy. Correlation functions are used to calculate the free energy functional as an expansion on a known reference system. If the non-uniform fluid can be described by a density distribution that is not far from uniform density a functional Taylor expansion of the free energy in density increments leads to an expression for the thermodynamic potential using known correlation functions of the uniform system. In the square gradient approximation a strong non-uniform density contributes a term in the gradient of the density. In a perturbation theory approach the direct correlation function is given by the sum of the direct correlation in a known system such as [[hard spheres ]] and a term in a weak interaction such as the long range [[London dispersion force]]. In a local density approximation the local excess free energy is calculated from the effective interactions with particles distributed at uniform density of the fluid in a cell surrounding a particle. Other improvements have been suggested such as the weighted density approximation for a direct correlation function of a uniform system which distributes the neighboring particles with an effective weighted density calculated from a self-consistent condition on the direct correlation function. \n\nThe variational Mermin principle leads to an equation for the equilibrium density and system properties are calculated from the solution for the density. The equation is a non-linear integro-differential equation and finding a solution is not trivial, requiring numerical methods except for the simplest models. Classical DFT is supported by standard software packages and specific software is currently under development. Assumptions can be made to propose trial functions as solutions and the free energy is expressed in the trial functions and optimized with respect to parameters of the trial functions. Examples are a localized [[Gaussian function]] centered on crystal lattice points for the density in a solid, the hyperbolic function <math> tanh(r)</math> for interfacial density profiles.\n\nClassical DFT has found many applications, for example: \n* developing new functional materials in [[materials science]], in particular [[nanotechnology]];\n* studying the properties of fluids at a [[surface]] and the phenomena of [[wetting]], [[adsorption]]; \n* understanding life processes in [[biotechnology]];\n* improving [[filtration]] methods for gases and fluids in [[chemical engineering]]; \n* fighting [[pollution]] of water and air in environmental science;\n* generating new procedures in [[microfluidics]] and [[nanofluidics]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Key papers==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |first1=R.

The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.\n\nAn anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, propaganda, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.\n\n==Types== \n[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]\n\n=== Parachronism <!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here-->===\nA '''parachronism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac}}, \"on the side\", and {{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"time\") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).\n\nThis may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion or idioms.\n\nExamples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); a teenager from the 1980s being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries; or a businessman in 2006 wearing late 19th century clothing. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era\u2014with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.\n\n[[File:Cesare Gennari Orfeo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Orpheus]] with a [[violin]] (invented in the 16th century) rather than a [[lyre]]. A 17th-century painting by [[Cesare Gennari]].]]\n\n=== Prochronism <!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here-->===\nA '''prochronism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc}}, \"before\", and {{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"time\") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.\n\nThe well-known stories of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' contain a manifest anachronism: in the [[frame story]], the tales are narrated to King  [[Shahry\u0101r]], presented as a member of the Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Dynasty]], by his wife [[Scheherazade]] - yet many of the stories she tells relate to the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and his contemporary the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], all of whom lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanids.\n\n===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===\nThe intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.\n\n== Politically motivated anachronism ==\nWorks of art and literature promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause may use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is, or otherwise intentionally blur the distinctions between past and present. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]\u2014two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history\u2014with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s: anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made. The Russian artist [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], in his painting ''[[Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English]]'' (c.1884), depicts the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], when mutineers were executed by being [[blowing from a gun|blown from a gun]]. In order to make a contemporary political point, Vereshchagin dresses the British soldiers responsible in late 19th-century uniforms.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nConstantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|''Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns become Brothers'': 19th-century flags in a 16th-century scene\nVereshchagin-Blowing from Guns in British India.jpg|''[[Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English]]'': events of the 1850s with soldiers in uniforms of the 1880s\n</gallery>\n\n== Art and literature ==\n[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]\nAnachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. Anachronisms may be unintentional, arising from ignorance; or they may be a deliberate aesthetic choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref> \n\nSir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: \"It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}</ref> However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. \"Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period\", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; \"Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker.\"<ref>Grafton 1990, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIt is only since the beginning of the 19th century that deviations from historical reality have jarred on a general audience. [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote: \n{{quote|All medieval narratives about the past are ... lacking in a sense of period.... It was known that [[Adam]] went naked till he fell. After that, [medieval people] pictured the whole past in terms of their own age. So indeed did the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]]. So did [[John Milton|Milton]]; he never doubted that \"[[capon]] and white broth\" would have been as familiar to Christ and the disciples as to himself. It is doubtful whether the sense of period is much older than the [[Waverley novels]]. It is hardly present in [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]. [[Horace Walpole|Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto|Otranto]]'', which would not now deceive schoolchildren, could hope, not quite vainly, to deceive the public of 1765. Where even the most obvious and superficial distinctions between one century (or millennium) and another were ignored, the profounder differences of temper and mental climate were naturally not dreamed of....

One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver D. |title=Beards: true and false |journal=Church Monuments |volume=28 |year=2013 |pages=124\u201332 }}</ref>\n\n==Time travel==\nThe extensive science fiction subgenre depicting [[Time travel in fiction| time travel]] in effect consists of deliberate, consciously created anachronisms, letting people of one time meet and interact with those of another time. Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.\n\n== In academia ==\nIn historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}</ref> [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that \"a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know\" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that \"anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}</ref> Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.\n\nThe use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice. In most cases, however, the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Detection of forgery==\nThe ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time.

The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.\n\nAn anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used for purposes of rhetoric, propaganda, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, language, customs, attitudes, or fashions between different historical eras.\n\n==Types== \n[[Image:Aristotle in Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493) shows [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] in scholar's clothing of the book's time, 1,800 years too modern for Aristotle]]\n\n=== Parachronism <!-- 'Parachronism' redirects here-->===\nA '''parachronism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac}}, \"on the side\", and {{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"time\") is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).\n\nThis may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era.  They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate.  They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion or idioms.\n\nExamples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the United States around 1960 using a [[washboard (laundry)|washboard]] for laundry (well after [[washing machine]]s had become the norm); a teenager from the 1980s being an avid fan of [[ragtime]] music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries; or a businessman in 2006 wearing late 19th century clothing. Often, a parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era\u2014with a different state of knowledge.  Many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings, and works of [[speculative fiction]] often find their speculations outstripped by real-world technological developments or scientific discoveries.\n\n[[File:Cesare Gennari Orfeo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Orpheus]] with a [[violin]] (invented in the 16th century) rather than a [[lyre]]. A 17th-century painting by [[Cesare Gennari]].]]\n\n=== Prochronism <!-- 'Prochronism' redirects here-->===\nA '''prochronism'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc}}, \"before\", and {{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"time\") is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] at the top of the article). A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had not yet been created.\n\nThe well-known stories of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' contain a manifest anachronism: in the [[frame story]], the tales are narrated to King  [[Shahry\u0101r]], presented as a member of the Persian [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Dynasty]], by his wife [[Scheherazade]] - yet many of the stories she tells relate to the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and his contemporary the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], all of whom lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanids.\n\n===Behavioral and cultural anachronism===\nThe intentional use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a [[top hat]], write with a [[quill]], or carry on a conversation in Latin. Such choices may reflect an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]] or an [[aesthetic]] preference.\n\n== Politically motivated anachronism ==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nConstantin Lecca - Infratirea moldovenilor si muntenilor.jpg|''Moldavians and [[Muntenia]]ns become Brothers'': 19th-century flags in a 16th-century scene\nVereshchagin-Blowing from Guns in British India.jpg|''[[Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English]]'': events of the 1850s with soldiers in uniforms of the 1880s\n</gallery>\nWorks of art and literature promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause may use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is, or otherwise intentionally blur the distinctions between past and present. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter [[Constantin Lecca]] depicts the peace agreement between [[Bogdan III cel Orb|Ioan Bogdan Voievod]] and [[Radu cel Mare|Radu Voievod]]\u2014two leaders in Romania's 16th-century history\u2014with the flags of [[Moldavia]] (blue-red) and of [[Wallachia]] (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s: anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and  Wallachia into the [[Kingdom of Romania]] at the time the painting was made. The Russian artist [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], in his painting ''[[Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English]]'' (c.1884), depicts the aftermath of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], when mutineers were executed by being [[blowing from a gun|blown from a gun]]. In order to make a contemporary political point, Vereshchagin dresses the British soldiers responsible in late 19th-century uniforms.\n\n== Art and literature ==\n[[File:Lucas van Leyden - Lot and his Daughters - WGA12932.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucas van Leyden]]'s 1520 painting ''Lot and His Daughters'' shows Biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] as a typical Dutch city of the painter's time.]]\nAnachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. Anachronisms may be unintentional, arising from ignorance; or they may be a deliberate aesthetic choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/174817-for-infidelity-reconsidering-aesthetic-anachronism/|title=For Infidelity: Reconsidering Aesthetic Anachronism|last=Potthast|first=Jane|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2013-09-18|accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref> \n\nSir [[Walter Scott]] justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: \"It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Scott |authorlink=Walter Scott |title=Ivanhoe; a Romance |place=Edinburgh |year=1820 |volume=1 |page=xvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zzQJAAAAQAAJ }}</ref> However, as fashions move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. \"Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period\", writes [[Anthony Grafton]]; \"Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out 'Ludwig! [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]! Come in and practice your piano now!' we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker.\"<ref>Grafton 1990, p. 67.</ref>\n\nIt is only since the beginning of the 19th century that deviations from historical reality have jarred on a general audience. [[C. S. Lewis]] wrote: \n{{quote|All medieval narratives about the past are ... lacking in a sense of period.... It was known that [[Adam]] went naked till he fell.

It is doubtful whether the sense of period is much older than the [[Waverley novels]]. It is hardly present in [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]. [[Horace Walpole|Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto|Otranto]]'', which would not now deceive schoolchildren, could hope, not quite vainly, to deceive the public of 1765.

One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Effigy|tomb effigies]] and figures in [[Medieval stained glass|stained glass]] in records made by English [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] of the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

Covers of time-travel books often depict deliberate anachronisms of this kind. For example, the cover of [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' (1992) features a portrait of Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]] holding an [[AK-47]] rifle.\n\n== In academia ==\nIn historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]]. [[Empiricism|Empiricist]] [[historian]]s, working in the traditions established by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Davies |title=Empiricism and History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2003 |page=29 }}</ref> [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that \"a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know\" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that \"anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}</ref> Anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing, as in early-20th-century scholarship's use of [[Translatio imperii]], first formulated in the 12th century, to interpret 10th-century literature.\n\nThe use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex. To refer to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as the First [[Reich]], for example, is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise; the application of theory to works which predate [[Marxist]], [[Feminist]] or [[Freudian]] subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice.

The [[history of Chinese currency]] dates back as early as the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770\u2013476 BCE), and the earliest coinages took the form of imitations of the [[cowrie shells]] that were used in ceremonial exchanges. During the [[Warring States period]] new forms of currency such as the [[spade money]], [[knife money]], and [[Huanqian|round copper-alloy coins]] were introduced (further reading: [[Zhou dynasty coinage]] and [[Ancient Chinese coinage]]). After unification of China under the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BC the [[Ban Liang]] (\u534a\u5169) [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash coin]] became the standard coinage, under the [[Han dynasty]] the [[Wu Zhu]] (\u4e94\u9296) cash coins became the main currency of China until they were replaced with the [[Kaiyuan Tongbao]] (\u958b\u5143\u901a\u5bf3) during the [[Tang dynasty]], after which [[List of Chinese cash coins by inscription|a large number of inscriptions]] were used on Chinese coinages. During the late nineteenth century China started producing its own [[Milled coinage|machine-struck coinages]]. \n\nIn [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]] coins are often used as burial objects and it's not uncommon for coins to be discovered in tombs and graves. \n\nOccasionally foreign coins are also found in China, which were brought there through [[international trade]] routes such as the [[silk road]], overseas trade with foreign countries, and [[colonialism]].

Mr. Zhang Tiejun (\u5f20\u94c1\u519b), the assistant to the president of the Suzhou Archaeology Research Bureau noted that the coin hoard was divided into two layers, where the top was organised while the bottom layer wasn't as much.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekTwoHundredThousandOldWell\"/> Furthermore common jugs were found at the bottom of the well which indicated that it was a normal water well.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekTwoHundredThousandOldWell\"/> The inscriptions of the cash coins located in the top layer were mostly Chongning Zhongbao (\u5d07\u5be7\u91cd\u5bf6) and were largely bigger coins, while the bottom layer consisted mostly of Yuanfeng Tongbao (\u5143\u8c50\u901a\u5bf6) and Shaosheng Yuanbao (\u7d39\u8056\u5143\u5bf6) cash coins.

Zhang Tiejun speculated that the cash coins were buried in a hurry for safekeeping during a [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] invasion of Suzhou when the city had turned into a [[War|war zone]], as the coins

coin hoards, because the bronze Chinese cash coins that were unearthed came from many different periods and dynasties in Chinese history spanning over two millennia.<ref

Some of the local residents managed to dig up several kilograms of cash coins while other locals were only able to find ten or twenty cash coins.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> Soon the local police was alerted by the local authorities and they tried to cordon off the area to let the local Bureau of Cultural Relics dispatch archeologists to retrieve the cash coins.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> The treasure hunting done by the local residents was seen as \"looting\" because in accordance to the [[law of the People's Republic of China]] all cultural relics that are buried on land or discovered somewhere in the territorial waters or seas of China are at all times to be considered state property, and the local residents were asked by the police to \"return\" their findings.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> After the Chengdu archaeologists had arrived on the scene they had determined that the cash coins from the Golden Horse River board were strewn over an area approximately two hundred meters long and one hundred meters wide.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> Within only a short period of time the Chengdu archaeologists had managed to find over 5 kilograms of cash coins.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> The local archeologists stated that it was not practical to try to excavate the site or even attempt to preserve it because that there was a possibility of dangerous flood waters suddenly appearing.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> A few local archaeologists speculated as to why the cash coins were found there spun over such a large period of time, Mr. Liu Yumao (\u5218\u96e8\u8302) noted that it was customary throughout Chinese history to place old cash coins into structures that were built for things such as irrigation and water conservancy, this superstition was done in the hopes of gaining good fortune and to avoid disaster.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> Liu Yumao further stated that the cash coins from the Golden Horse River hoard may have originally been buried inside of such a structure, and that later over time this structure had eroded and was washed.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> After this the cash coins could then have been carried across the river by the current and eventually ended at the site where they were found.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> As to why most of the unearthed cash coins came from the Tang dynasty period, local archeologist Mr. Wang Zongxiong (\u738b\u4ef2\u96c4) noted that it was possible that during this period a boat which was carrying coins across the Golden Horse River may have sunk and that the cash coins in its cargo were hidden underwater until they were found in 2011.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> While most cash coins found at the Golden Horse River hoard are Tang dynasty period [[Kaiyuan Tongbao]] (\u958b\u5143\u901a\u5bf6) and Qianyuan Zhongbao (\u4e7e\u5143\u91cd\u5bf6), while other inscriptions of cash coins found at the Golden Horse River hoard range from [[Han dynasty]] period [[Wu Zhu]] (\u4e94\u9296), [[Xin dynasty]] Huo Quan (\u8ca8\u6cc9) to [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] period [[Qianlong Tongbao]] (\u4e7e\u9686\u901a\u5bf6) as well as [[Guangxu coinage]] (\u5149\u7dd2\u9322).<ref name=\"PrimaltrekGoldenHorseRiverHoard\"/> || Various periods || \n|}\n\n==== 2011 (Hong Kong) ====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%\"\n!colspan=7 | List of 2011 coin hoards in Hong Kong  \n|- \n!

Through his personal narration, Lowenfeld mentioned that he was pulling toward music at an early age \u2013 probably four or five.  He started to play violin at the age of nine or ten.  And because he used to play by ear, rather than reading notes, he was often called a \u201cGypsy.\u201d  That same year Lowenfeld started painting.  This early exposure to the visual and performing arts led him to a career devoted to the practice of educating himself and the public in art.\n\nDr. Lowenfeld graduated from the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna|College of Applied Arts]] in [[Vienna]], as well as the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in the same city.  He later received his doctorate in Education from the University of Vienna, and during this time served as an elementary and secondary school teacher.  While in Vienna, he also served as the director of art in the Blind Institute.  In 1938 Lowenfeld fled to England before arriving in the United States.  He became a citizen in 1946 after serving in the Navy as a wartime visual aids consultant.\n\nLowenfeld joined the [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]] in Virginia in 1939 as assistant professor of Industrial Arts, studio art teacher, and later Chairman of the Art Department.  In 1945 he was named curator of the distinguished collection of Black African Art at the Hampton Institute.  Lowenfeld came to The Pennsylvania State University as professor of Art Education in 1946.  Ten years later he became head of the newly founded Department of Art Education.  He stayed in this position until his death in 1960.\nDr. Lowenfeld is well known for his Visual-Haptic theory in Art Education which was assimilated from Viennese sources.  He always regarded good teaching as a dialogue, therefore his motivation and evaluations had a strong Expressionist bias.  His psychological training enabled him to gain a therapeutic position in his early months in America, labeling him a \u201cViennese Psychologist\u201d in Time.  He was an active leader in the [[National Art Education Association]] and The National Committee on Art Education.\n\nAccording to Peter Smith, \u201cLowenfeld is still a name of power in American art education.

The stages consisted of\n#scribble;\n#preschematic;\n#schematic;\n#Dawning Realism;\n#Pseudorealism; and\n#Period of decision/crisis.\n\nLowenfeld's ideas of art as a catalyst of creativity have prompted many research dissertations in the field of [[art education]].\n\n== The Lowenfeld Memorial Collection ==\nViktor Lowenfeld left behind an association of friends and followers including Edward L.

It had an estimated 2,500 speakers in the year 2000.\n\n== Dialects and range==\nSa has numerous dialects, with no well-established names or boundaries. At a meeting in 2008, speakers recognised four main dialects, with sub-dialectal variation and mixing of dialects in some areas.\n\nThe two central dialects are relatively similar to one another and are generally understood by all Sa speakers. Most writing and research in Sa has been in one of these dialects:\n\n* A western dialect (\"Saa\" with a long ''a'') is spoken on the west coast around Panas, Wali, Panngi and Ranputor.\n* An eastern dialect (\"Sa\" with a short ''a'') is spoken in the south-east around Ranwas. A variant of this dialect with longer vowels in certain words is spoken at Poinkros in the far south, and is used in the Bible Society's recent Gospel translations.\n\nThere are also two outlying dialects, which are highly distinctive and difficult for speakers of other dialects to understand:\n\n* A northern dialect (\"F dialect\"), characterised by the presence of an ''f'' sound, is spoken in the north of the Sa area, at St Henri (Fatsare) and by some at Ran'gusuksu.  It has close links with neighbouring [[Ske language]] and with Doltes, the extinct dialect of Hotwata village.\n* A southern dialect (\"Ha\"), notable for the widespread replacement of ''s'' with ''h'', is spoken in Bay Martelli (Harop) and Londar, and has close links with the languages of neighbouring [[Ambrym]] island.\n\nThe distinctive speech of villages such as [[Bunlap]], Bay Barrier (Ranon) and Wanur appears to comprise mixtures of neighbouring dialects.\n\nPeople in southern Pentecost remember the existence of additional dialects that are now extinct.\n\n==Phonology==\nThe [[consonants]] of Sa include '''b''', '''d''', '''g''', '''h''', '''k''', '''l''', '''m''', '''n''', '''ng''' (as in English \"singer\"), '''p''', '''r''', '''s''', '''t''', and '''w'''. In most dialects there is also '''j''' (occasionally written \"ts\"), which is apparently an [[allophone]] of ''t'' found before the vowels ''i'' and ''u'' although speakers regard it separately. Most speakers also use labiovelar '''bw''', '''mw''' and '''pw''', although from some speakers of outlying dialects these are indistinguishable from normal ''b'', ''m'' and ''p''. In addition to these consonants, the northern dialect has a bilabial '''f'''. In this dialect ''s'' may be pronounced like English ''sh''.\n\nAs a general rule, clusters of consonants do not occur within a syllable. Word roots may begin with a pair of consonants, but in speech the first of these consonants is usually either dropped or attached to the final syllable of the preceding word.\n\nIn addition to the five standard [[vowels]] ('''a''', '''e''', '''i''', '''o''' and '''u'''), Sa is generally believed{{by whom|date=September 2011}} to have additional mid-high vowels '''\u00ea''' (intermediate between ''e'' and ''i'') and '''\u00f4''' (intermediate between ''o'' and ''u''). Not all authors have recognised these extra vowels, but they have been accepted by local teachers of vernacular literacy and are used in the Bible Society's recent Gospel translations. Vowels are distinguished for length, with long vowels ('''aa''', '''ee''', etc.) often occurring where a consonant has historically been lost. Vowels can occur alone or in various combinations.\n\nStress is normally on the penultimate syllable of a word. However, syllables that end with a consonant or a long vowel take stress in precedence to other syllables.\n\n==Grammar==\nBasic word order in Sa is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n\n===Pronouns===\nPersonal pronouns are distinguished by [[Grammatical person|person]] and [[Grammatical number|number]]. They are not distinguished by [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. With one exception, subject and object pronouns are identical.\n\nThe singular and plural pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Person || Sa || English\n|--\n| 1st person singular || ''n\u00ea'' || \"I\" / \"me\"\n|--\n| 2nd person singular || ''\u00eak''<br />(''o'' in subject position) || \"you\" (singular)\n|--\n| 3rd person singular || ''i'' || \"he\" / \"she\" / \"him\" / \"her\" / \"it\"\n|--\n| 1st person plural (inclusive)|| ''k\u00ea(t)'' || \"we\" / \"us\" (you and me)\n|--\n| 1st person plural (exclusive)|| ''gema'' || \"we\" / \"us\" (me and others)\n|--\n| 2nd person plural|| ''gimi'' || \"you\" (plural)\n|--\n| 3rd person plural|| ''\u00ear'' || \"they\" / \"them\"\n|}\n\nIn addition, there are '''dual''' pronouns (referring to two people), which incorporate the particle ''k\u00f4'', and '''paucal''' pronouns (referring to a small number of people), which incorporate the particle ''t\u00eal'' or ''pat''.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns in Sa are not preceded by [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. [[Plural]]ity is indicated by placing the pronoun ''\u00ear'' (\"them\") or a number after the noun.\n\nNouns may be either '''free''', or '''directly possessed'''. Directly possessed nouns are followed either by a suffix or a noun indicating whom an item belongs to. For example:\n\n:''s\u00ea'''k''''' = my name\n:''s\u00ea'''m''''' = your name\n:''s\u00ea'''n''''' = his/her name\n:''s\u00ea''' temak''''' = my father's name\n\nThe possessive suffixes are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Past and present tense are not explicitly distinguished:\n\n:''n\u00ea '''m'''los'' = I bathe / I bathed\n:''n\u00ea '''ma'''rngo'' = I hear / I heard\n\nIn [[Negation (linguistics)|negative]] statements this marker is replaced with ''taa-'' or a variant:\n\n:''n\u00ea '''taa'''los'' = I don't bathe / I didn't bathe\n:''n\u00ea '''taa'''rngo'' = I don't hear / I didn't hear\n\nThese markers may be combined with a future marker ''t'' or ''te'':\n\n:''n\u00ea me'''t''' los'' = I will bathe\n:''n\u00ea me'''te'''rngo'' = I will hear\n:''n\u00ea taa'''t''' los'' = I won't bathe\n:''n\u00ea taa'''te'''rngo'' = I won't hear\n\nIn the [[Imperative mood|imperative]], the future marker occurs without any other marker:\n\n:''O '''t'''los!'' = [You] bathe!\n:''O '''te'''rngo!'' = [You] listen!\n\nHypothetical statements include a particle ''po'':\n\n:''n\u00ea met'''po''' los'' = I should bathe\n\nCompleted actions are indicated using ''t\u00ea'':\n\n:''n\u00ea mlos '''t\u00ea''''' = I bathed already\n\nThe subject can be omitted from a sentence, as in the second example below:\n\n:''i meterngo'' = he will hear it\n:''meterngo'' = it will be heard\n\nTransitive and intransitive verb forms are distinguished, with [[transitive verb]]s often followed by ''n\u00ea'':\n\n:''\u00ear r\u00f4s'' = they move\n:''\u00ear r\u00f4s'''n\u00ea''' at'' = they move the stone\n\nVerbs in Sa can be linked together in a variety of [[serial verb construction]]s.\n\n==Sample phrases==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[island platform]]s, only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\n===Construction and opening===\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. The plan for the line was initially adopted on June 1, 1905, before being approved by the [[Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York]] on June 18, 1906 after the Rapid Transit Commission was unable to get the necessary consents of property owners along the planned route.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=David|date=May 1961|title=The Fourth Ave. Subway|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKvSWhrQBW4d3pvOGZaSERiZEhpQ24xT19DTktkQUVlLW5j/view|journal=New York Division Bulletin|publisher=Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=|pages=2\u201310|access-date=May 8, 2017|via=}}</ref> The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the [[New York Public Service Commission|New York State Public Service Commission]] (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the PSC approved the plan for the line in October and November 1907.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XoxBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=4th+Avenue+line#v=onepage&q=4th%20Avenue%20line&f=false|page=18|title=Fourth Avenue Subway, Brooklyn's New Transportation Line: A Part of the Dual System of Rapid Transit of the City of New York|date=June 19, 1915|publisher=Public Service Commission|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48901678/|title=Fourth Avenue Subway Is Sent To A Committee|date=March 20, 1908|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=May 4, 2017|pages=1\u20132|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs part of negotiations between New York City and the [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company]] (BRT), and the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[island platform]]s, only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. The plan for the line was initially adopted on June 1, 1905, before being approved by the [[Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York]] on June 18, 1906 after the Rapid Transit Commission was unable to get the necessary consents of property owners along the planned route.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=David|date=May 1961|title=The Fourth Ave. Subway|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKvSWhrQBW4d3pvOGZaSERiZEhpQ24xT19DTktkQUVlLW5j/view|journal=New York Division Bulletin|publisher=Electric Railroaders' Association|volume=|pages=2\u201310|access-date=May 8, 2017|via=}}</ref> The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the [[New York Public Service Commission|New York State Public Service Commission]] (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the PSC approved the plan for the line in October and November 1907.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XoxBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=4th+Avenue+line#v=onepage&q=4th%20Avenue%20line&f=false|page=18|title=Fourth Avenue Subway, Brooklyn's New Transportation Line: A Part of the Dual System of Rapid Transit of the City of New York|date=June 19, 1915|publisher=Public Service Commission|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":11\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48901678/|title=Fourth Avenue Subway Is Sent To A Committee|date=March 20, 1908|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=May 4, 2017|pages=1\u20132|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs part of negotiations between New York City and the [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company]] (BRT), and the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company]] for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT.

However, Miller may have ceased dissenting when Jones confirmed at one point that \"the Congressman has been murdered\" after the airstrip shooters returned.<ref name=\"tape\" />\n\nWhen the Red Brigade members came back to Jonestown after Ryan's murder, Tim Carter, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, recalled them having the \"[[thousand-yard stare]]\" of weary soldiers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=178}}</ref> After Jones confirmed that \"the Congressman's dead,\" no dissent is heard on the death tape. By this point, armed guards had taken up positions surrounding the pavilion area. Directly after this, Jones stated that \"the Red Brigade's the only one that made any sense anyway,\" and, \"the Red Brigade showed them justice.\" In addition to McElvane, several other Temple members gave speeches praising Jones and his decision for the community to commit suicide, even after Jones stopped appreciating this praise and begged for the process to go faster.<ref name=\"tape\" />\n\nAccording to escaped Temple member Odell Rhodes, the first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old infant. A syringe without a needle fitted was used to squirt poison into the infant's mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth.<ref name=\"odellinquest\">[http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GuyanaInquest.pdf ''Guyana Inquest \u2013 Interview of Odell Rhodes''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205013735/http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/GuyanaInquest.pdf |date=February 5, 2015 }}.

I didn't plan it but I know it's gonna happen. They're gonna shoot that pilot and down comes the plane into the jungle and we had better not have any of our children left when it's over, because they'll parachute in here on us.</blockquote>\n\nParroting Jones' prior statements that hostile forces would convert captured children to [[fascism]], one Temple member stated: \"The ones that they take captured, they're gonna just let them grow up and be dummies.\"<ref name=\"tape\" />\n\nOn the tape, Jones urged Temple members to commit \"revolutionary suicide\".<ref name=\"tape\" /> Such an act had been planned by the Temple before and, according to Jonestown defectors, its theory was \"you can go down in history, saying you chose your own way to go, and it is your commitment to refuse capitalism and in support of socialism.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=566}}</ref>\n\nTemple member Christine Miller argued that the Temple should alternatively attempt an airlift to the Soviet Union. Jim McElvane, a former therapist who had arrived in Jonestown only two days earlier, assisted Jones by arguing against Miller's resistance to suicide, stating \"Let's make it a beautiful day\" and later citing possible [[reincarnation]]. After several exchanges in which Jones argued that a Soviet exodus would not be possible, along with reactions by other Temple members hostile to Miller, she backed down. However, Miller may have ceased dissenting when Jones confirmed at one point that \"the Congressman has been murdered\" after the airstrip shooters returned.<ref name=\"tape\" />\n\nWhen the Red Brigade members came back to Jonestown after Ryan's murder, Tim Carter, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, recalled them having the \"[[thousand-yard stare]]\" of weary soldiers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reiterman|Jacobs|1982|p=178}}</ref> After Jones confirmed that \"the Congressman's dead,\" no dissent is heard on the death tape. By this point, armed guards had taken up positions surrounding the pavilion area.
