The show aired at 4:30pm IST Sunday.\n\n== Background ==\nVikram Aur Betaal' is based on 'Betaal Pachisi', written in the 11th century by Kashmiri poet Somdev Bhatt. These are spellbinding stories told to the wise King Vikramaditya by the witty ghost Betaal. Vikramaditya was a great king who ruled over a prosperous kingdom from his capital at Ujjain. He had immense love for learning as well as for adventure. He was brave, fearless and with a strong will. Everyday many visitors used to visit the king and gift him something. The King used to accept all the gifts with the same courtesy. Among such visitors was a mendicant who presented the king with a fruit on every visit. King Vikramaditya used to hand over the fruit to the royal storekeeper. One day while handling the fruit, it broke and from the pop came out a handy ball of ruby. The King was surprised. He ordered to check all the fruits, and from all fruits came out a fine ruby. The King decided to meet the mendicant. However, the mendicant had set a condition that the King must meet him under a Banyan tree in the center of the cremation ground beyond the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month. King met him as decided. The King asked the mendicant why he was doing this. The mendicant tells that there is a task that only a King like Vikrmaditya can perform. King Vikramaditya had to visit the northern-most corner of this ground where he would find a very ancient tree. There would be a corpse hanging from one of its branches. He would have to fetch it for the mendicant, as the mendicant was seeking certain occult powers which he would get only if a king brought this particular corpse to him and if he would practice certain rites sitting on it. According to the legend the King Vikramaditya, in order to fulfil a vow, was required to remove a corpse of Betaal from a treetop and carry it on his shoulder to another place in silence. En route, the spirit of Betaal (in the corpse) used to narrate a story to the king and after completing the story Betaal would pose a query that if he (The king) knew the answer, was bound to respond lest he will break his head into thousand pieces. But if he does speak out, he would break the vow of silence and Betaal would fly back to the treetop, leaving the king inches short of his destination! The king would go after the vampire and start all over again. And so on and on. As the name 'Betaal Pachisi' suggests the Betaal told King 25 stories. ('Pachisi' (Hindi) is derived from word 'Pachis' in Hindi which means twenty five) . However, looking at the determination of the king Vikramaditya, Betaal finally disclosed the true motive of the mendicant. The mendicant's plan was to practice certain rites sitting on Betaal but he would kill the King also to get all powers of world and rule the world. This created suspicion in Vikramaditya's mind. However, he still went to the mendicant, but he was prepared for surprise. Betaal proved to be right and the mendicant tried to kill Vikramaditya. However, Vikramaditya outwitted the mendicant and killed him.\n\n== The stories ==\nThe name Betaal Pachisi suggests the Betaal told the king 25 stories (pacchisi - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938\u0940 is derived from pacchis - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938 in [[Hindi]], which means 25), each narrated while Vikramaditya is carrying Betaal to the mendicant, where of each ended with a moral.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Arun Govil]] - as King Vikramaditya.\n* [[Sajjan (actor)|Sajjan]] - as Betaal.\n* [[Arvind Trivedi]] - as the mendicant.\n* [[Deepika Chikhalia]] - in many roles.\n* [[Vijay Arora]] - in many roles.\n* [[Ramesh Bhatkar]] - in many roles.\n* [[Mulraj Rajda]] - in many roles.\n* Rajni Bala - in many roles.\n* [[Sunil Lahiri]] - in many roles.\n* [[Lilliput (actor)|Lilliput]] - in many roles.\n* [[Rama Vij]] - in many roles.\n* [[Satish Kaul]] - in many roles.\n* [[Surjeet Mohanty]] - in many roles.\n\n==List of episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" \n|-\n! style=\"width: 03%; background: #4169E1;\" | # \n! style=\"width: 50%; background: #4169E1;\" | Title \n! style=\"width: 47%; background: #4169E1;\" | Other Cast\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1 || '''\"King Vikramaditya and the Yogi / Suryamal and His Bride's Dilemma\"''' || Balwant Bansal as Mantri<br />[[Ramesh Bhatkar]] as the bride's father<br />Gagan Gupta as soldier<br />[[Satish Kaul]] as Suryamal  \n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#E6E6FA\" colspan=3 |'''Short Summary:''' The first episode shows the story of how Raja Vikramaditya and Betaal meet.

The concept of the program was based on ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'', a collection of tales about the legendary king Vikram (identified as [[Vikram\u0101ditya]]) and the [[Vetala]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32198806-vikram-and-betaal |title=Vikram And Betaal |website=www.goodreads.com |publisher=[[Amazon]] [[Goodreads]] |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> a spirit analogous to a [[vampire]] in western literature. The show aired at 4:30pm IST Sunday.\n\n== Background ==\nVikram Aur Betaal' is based on 'Betaal Pachisi', written in the 11th century by Kashmiri poet Somdev Bhatt. These are spellbinding stories told to the wise King Vikramaditya by the witty ghost Betaal. Vikramaditya was a great king who ruled over a prosperous kingdom from his capital at Ujjain. He had immense love for learning as well as for adventure. He was brave, fearless and with a strong will. Everyday many visitors used to visit the king and gift him something. The King used to accept all the gifts with the same courtesy. Among such visitors was a mendicant who presented the king with a fruit on every visit. King Vikramaditya used to hand over the fruit to the royal storekeeper. One day while handling the fruit, it broke and from the pop came out a handy ball of ruby. The King was surprised. He ordered to check all the fruits, and from all fruits came out a fine ruby. The King decided to meet the mendicant. However, the mendicant had set a condition that the King must meet him under a Banyan tree in the center of the cremation ground beyond the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month. King met him as decided. The King asked the mendicant why he was doing this. The mendicant tells that there is a task that only a King like Vikrmaditya can perform. King Vikramaditya had to visit the northern-most corner of this ground where he would find a very ancient tree. There would be a corpse hanging from one of its branches. He would have to fetch it for the mendicant, as the mendicant was seeking certain occult powers which he would get only if a king brought this particular corpse to him and if he would practice certain rites sitting on it. According to the legend the King Vikramaditya, in order to fulfil a vow, was required to remove a corpse of Betaal from a treetop and carry it on his shoulder to another place in silence. En route, the spirit of Betaal (in the corpse) used to narrate a story to the king and after completing the story Betaal would pose a query that if he (The king) knew the answer, was bound to respond lest he will break his head into thousand pieces. But if he does speak out, he would break the vow of silence and Betaal would fly back to the treetop, leaving the king inches short of his destination! The king would go after the vampire and start all over again. And so on and on. As the name 'Betaal Pachisi' suggests the Betaal told King 25 stories. ('Pachisi' (Hindi) is derived from word 'Pachis' in Hindi which means twenty five) . However, looking at the determination of the king Vikramaditya, Betaal finally disclosed the true motive of the mendicant. The mendicant's plan was to practice certain rites sitting on Betaal but he would kill the King also to get all powers of world and rule the world. This created suspicion in Vikramaditya's mind. However, he still went to the mendicant, but he was prepared for surprise. Betaal proved to be right and the mendicant tried to kill Vikramaditya. However, Vikramaditya outwitted the mendicant and killed him.\n\n== The stories ==\nThe name Betaal Pachisi suggests the Betaal told the king 25 stories (pacchisi - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938\u0940 is derived from pacchis - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938 in [[Hindi]], which means 25), each narrated while Vikramaditya is carrying Betaal to the mendicant, where of each ended with a moral.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Arun Govil]] - as King Vikramaditya.\n* [[Sajjan (actor)|Sajjan]] - as Betaal.\n* [[Arvind Trivedi]] - as the mendicant.\n* [[Deepika Chikhalia]] - in many roles.\n* [[Vijay Arora]] - in many roles.\n* [[Ramesh Bhatkar]] - in many roles.\n* [[Mulraj Rajda]] - in many roles.\n* Rajni Bala - in many roles.\n* [[Sunil Lahiri]] - in many roles.\n* [[Lilliput (actor)|Lilliput]] - in many roles.\n* [[Rama Vij]] - in many roles.\n* [[Satish Kaul]] - in many roles.\n* [[Surjeet Mohanty]] - in many roles.\n\n==List of episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" \n|-\n! style=\"width: 03%; background: #4169E1;\" | # \n! style=\"width: 50%; background: #4169E1;\" | Title \n! style=\"width: 47%; background: #4169E1;\" | Other Cast\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1 || '''\"King Vikramaditya and the Yogi / Suryamal and His Bride's Dilemma\"''' || Balwant Bansal as Mantri<br />[[Ramesh Bhatkar]] as the bride's father<br />Gagan Gupta as soldier<br />[[Satish Kaul]] as Suryamal  \n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#E6E6FA\" colspan=3 |'''Short Summary:''' The first episode shows the story of how Raja Vikramaditya and Betaal meet.

Formed as St. Luke's FC in 1877, the club has played at [[Molineux Stadium]] since 1889 and competes in the [[Premier League]], the top division of English football, after winning the [[2017\u201318 EFL Championship]]. Wolves also compete in the [[2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League]]: this is the first time the club has [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. in European football|qualified for a European tournament]] for 39 years, by virtue of finishing in seventh place in the [[2018\u201319 Premier League]], their first season in the top tier since  the [[2011\u201312 Premier League|2011\u201312 season]].\n\nWolves was one of the founding members of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in [[1888\u201389 Football League|1888]]. The club in [[2019\u201320 Premier League|2019\u201320]] is enjoying its 65th season of top flight football; Wolves's longest continuous period in the top tier was 26 consecutive seasons in the 33 years between 1932 and 1965 (n.b. there was no league football between 1939 and 1946 due to [[World War II]]). There longest spell outside the top-flight is 26 years, between 1906 and 1932. Their most recent longtime spell outside the top tier, is from 1985 until 2004. During that time Wolves also had short spells in the third and fourth tiers. In the 1950s, Wolves were [[List of English football champions|English League champions]] three times ([[1953\u201354 Football League|1953\u201354]], [[1957\u201358 Football League|1957\u201358]] and [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359]]), under the management of [[Stan Cullis]]. Wolves have also finished League runners-up on five occasions, most recently in [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360]].\n\nWolves have won the [[FA Cup]] four times, most recently in [[1960 FA Cup Final|1960]], and finished runners-up on a further four occasions. The club has also won the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] twice, in [[1974 Football League Cup Final|1974]] and [[1980 Football League Cup Final|1980]].\n\nIn 1953, Wolves was one of the first British clubs to install [[floodlight]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.footballsite.co.uk/DYK/DYK26-Floodlights.htm|title=Floodlights|publisher=footballsite.co.uk |accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref> taking part in televised \"floodlit friendlies\" against leading overseas club sides between 1953 and 1956 in the run-up to the creation of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1955 and the first participation of an English club side in that competition in 1956.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/13/wolves-world-champions-honved-molineux-hungary-wembley|title=The night Wolves became 'champions of the world' against Honved|work=[[The Observer]]|date=13 September 2014|first=Nick|last=Miller|accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref> Wolves reached the quarter-finals of the [[1959\u201360 European Cup]] and the semi-finals of the [[1960\u201361 European Cup Winners' Cup]], and were runners-up to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the  [[1972 UEFA Cup Final|inaugural UEFA Cup Final]] in 1972.\n\nWolves' traditional kit consists of old gold shirts and socks and black shorts. Since 1979 the kit has also featured the club's \"wolf's head\" badge. Wolves have long-standing rivalries with other West Midlands clubs, the main one being with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], against whom they contest the [[Black Country derby]], although the two clubs have not met since [[2011\u201312 Premier League|2011\u201312]], the last time they competed in the same division.\n\nWolves have spent the majority of its history in the top two tiers. \n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.}}\n{{about||a statistical breakdown by season|List of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Formation and the Football League (1879\u20131893)===\nIn the 2000 edition of \"The Rough Guide to English Football\", the history section on the Wolves page begins: \"The very name Wolves thunders from the pages of English football history\".<ref name=\"Rough\">Goldstein, Dan (editor).

They were pipped to the league title by a point on the final day of the season by [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]. Despite that bright start to the decade, the 1960s saw Wolves begin to decline. After finishing as [[1959-60 Football League#First Division|league runners-up in 1959\u201360]] and a creditable third-place league finish in [[Tottenham Hotspur]]'s [[1960-61 Football League#First Division|'double'-winning season]], the team faded and Cullis himself was sacked after sixteen years in post in September 1964 after a disastrous start to the [[1964-65 Football League First Division|1964\u201365 season]].<ref name=\"Cullis\"/> Cullis's sacking did not prevent the season ending with relegation (the first time Wolves had known relegation since [[1922\u201323 Football League#Second Division|1922\u201323]]) and the club's first spell outside the top division since 1932. Exile from the top flight lasted only two seasons however, as Wolves were [[1966\u201367 Football League#Second Division|promoted in 1967]] as Second Division runners-up.\n\nDuring the close season in 1967, Wolves played a mini-season in North America as part of the fledgling [[United Soccer Association|United Soccer Association league]] which imported clubs from Europe and South America.

The Irish elk was a prime example because it had evolved from a smaller ancestor with smaller antlers. In terms of the Irish elk, orthogenesis was claimed to have caused an evolutionary trajectory towards antlers that became larger and larger, eventually causing the species' extinction because the antlers grew to sizes which inhibited proper feeding habits and caused the animal to become trapped in tree branches.<ref name=Hughes />\n\nIn the 1930s, orthogenesis was disputed by Darwinians led by [[Julian Huxley]], who noted that antler size was relative to body size. Because the Irish elk was a large organism compared to its smaller relatives such as deer, there was an [[Allometry|allometric]] relationship between the antlers and body size.<ref>Anderson, Kristina. \"What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.\" What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.

This reduction in antler mass is 2.7 times more extreme than expected given the allometric relationship between antler and body masses in red deer<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> and demonstrates a rapid evolution of smaller antlers. A similar change in a typical Irish elk population with prime stags having {{cvt|35|kg}} antlers<ref name=\"barnosky86\"/> would result in antler weights of {{cvt|13|kg}} or less in worsening climatic conditions.

The antlers of the Irish elk should have been able to evolve rapidly in the face of selection for smaller and less expensive sizes. This conclusion is supported by the great diversity of Irish elk antler forms found among different populations at different times, including compact upright orientations possibly from populations inhabiting more heavily wooded environments<ref>Lister 1994</ref> suggesting the evolutionary malleability of Irish elk antlers.\"<ref name=\"Worman\"/> Ultimately, the decrease in energy intake by the Late Pleistocene, influenced the ability to produce for Irish elk females.<ref name=\"Worman\">{{cite journal |last2= Kimbrell|first2= Tristan|title= Getting to the hart of the matter: Did antlers truly cause the extinction of the Irish elk?|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff4d412edd3dcb9f15a1321f780f507468024bf3|journal= Oikos|volume= 117|issue= 9|pages= 1397\u20131405|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16608.x|year= 2008|last1= O'Driscoll Worman|first1= Cedric}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Knight Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]\nFrequent debates occur as to whether or not sexual selection led to the Irish elk's extinction. Sexual selection can increase or decrease a population's chance of extinction, due to behaviours such as male-male competition and female choice. Also, sexual harassment by males can result in lower female fecundity or even death.<ref name=\"Kokko\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kokko | first1 = H. | last2 = Brooks | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = Sexy to die for? sexual selection and the risk of extinction | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/18804232 | journal = Annales Zoologici Fennici | volume = 40 | issue = 2| pages = 207\u2013219 }}</ref> Regardless of the details of the species' life history, extinction would require that too few males survive to maturity to fertilize a sufficient number of females to maintain a viable population.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> When it comes to male-male competition, if the assumption is that detrimental effects are clear in only the males, a surviving male would have a large number of females to choose from, with little competition. Selection must, therefore, favour the less extreme male genotypes, and generating a scenario seems impossible where males with larger antlers are still selected for when the lifetime reproductive success of males with large antlers approaches zero (as required for deterministic extinction to occur).<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nIn female choice, sexual selection could, thus, reinforce natural selection and lead to quicker responses to environmental changes, should they occur.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> With a decrease in male population, females have fewer choices, which could result in inbreeding. This can pose significant threats to population survival.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> However, many of these studies are contradicting. Females may adaptively avoid the accumulation of inbreeding, so that female choice might increase effective population size.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nLate Pleistocene fossils from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, indicate that males segregated from females during winters.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> This type of segregation implies that the Irish elk had behaviours such as [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] and polygynous mating systems, where a single male mates with two or more females. This also supports the belief that the large antler size was used for social display. Within male groups, winterkill was the chief cause of death and was highest among juveniles and small adults with small antlers.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/>\n\n===Habitat===\nNeither exclusive to Ireland nor an elk, it was named so because the most well-known and best-preserved fossil specimens have been found in lake sediments and [[peat bog]]s in Ireland. The Irish elk had a far-reaching range, being located throughout Europe, northern Africa, and some related forms located in China.\n\nThe Irish elk prioritized open grassland habitats and was in fact the most [[cursorial]] cervid known.<ref>Geist, V. 1999. Deer of the World. Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury.</ref> Other ungulates that prefer open habitats, including the related [[fallow deer]], typically have more ostentatious colour patterns.\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Crystal Palace Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|Sculptures in [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]]]]\nA number of hypotheses are easy to advance regarding the disappearance of the more localized populations of this species. The situation is less clear regarding the final demise of the Irish elk in continental Eurasia east of the Urals. Stuart ''et al.'' (2004) tentatively suggest that a combination of human presence along rivers and slow decrease in habitat quality in upland areas presented the last Irish elk with the choice of either good habitat with considerable hunting pressure, or general absence of humans in a suboptimal habitat.\n\nTraditionally, discussion of the cause of their extinction has focused on the antler size (rather than on their overall body size), which may be due more to their impact on the observer than any actual property. Some have suggested hunting by humans was a contributing factor in the demise of the Irish elk, as may have been the case with other prehistoric [[megafauna]], even assuming that the large antler size restricted the movement of males through forested regions or that it was by some other means a \"[[maladaptation]]\".<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> Others assume the ultimate cause of extinction may have been the adaptations for mineral metabolism that were beneficial to the Irish elk until vegetation changed.<ref name=\"moen99\">{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=Ron A.|first2=John|last2=Pastor |first3=Yosef|last3=Cohen |title=Antler growth and extinction of Irish elk|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=1999|pages=235\u2013249|url=http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~rmoen/Dld/Moen_1999.pdf}}</ref> But given the difficulty of recovering quantitative records of human hunting impacts from the sub-fossil record alone, the role of humans in the extinction of the Irish elk is not yet clear.\n\nSome research has suggested that a lack of sufficient high-quality [[forage]] caused the extinction of the elk. According to an article written by researchers Silvia Gonzalez, Andrew Kitcheneri, and Adrian Lister, in 2000, a reduction in forest density into the Late Pleistocene decreased nutritional selection and is believed to have led to a conflict between sexual selection and ultimately a decrease in antler and body size, which can explain what may have caused their demise.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Silvia|author2=Andrew Kitchener |author3=Adrian Lister |title=Survival of the Irish elk into the Holocene|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6788|pages=753\u2013754|doi=10.1038/35015668|pmid=10866185}}</ref> High amounts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] compounds are required to form antlers, and therefore large quantities of these minerals are required for the massive structures of the Irish elk. The males (and male deer in general) met this requirement partly from their bones, replenishing them from food plants after the antlers were grown or reclaiming the nutrients from discarded antlers (as has been observed in extant deer). Thus, in the antler growth phase, giant deer suffered from a condition similar to [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"moen99\" /> When the climate changed at the end of the [[last glacial period]], the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that presumably could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals, at least in the western part of its range.\n\nSimply blaming antler size for their extinction may not be entirely accurate. The most likely cause is the significantly shortened growing season seen toward the end of the Pleistocene Era. This reduced availability in nutrition resulted in the lowering of the female reproduction output by about 50%.<ref name=\"Worman\"/>\n\nHowever, the most recent specimen of ''M. giganteus'' in northern Siberia, dated to approximately 7,700 years ago &mdash; well after the end of the last glacial period &mdash; shows no sign of nutrient stress. This specimen came from a region with a [[continental climate]] where the proposed vegetation changes had not yet occurred.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2006.02.004 | pmid=16556506 | volume=40 | title=Molecular phylogeny of the extinct giant deer, Megaloceros giganteus | year=2006 | journal=Mol.

Giant deer fossils found on the [[Isle of Man]] at Ballaugh confirm the survival of the species into early Holocene in at least this area. The [[Ballaugh Elk]] skeleton is smaller than the entire range of Irish skeletons, but has a relatively large skull and the antlers are well-sized for an adult male. This suggests that size decreased into the Holocene.\n\nThere is strong intraspecific [[allometry]] among Irish deer. Smaller animals have relatively shorter antlers. Reduced display organs are theorized to indicate a prelude to extinction from nutritional stress. Reduced forage density leads to a conflict between sexual selection for antler size and nutritional selection pressures. These factors reduced populations and the body size of the giant deer. However, data indicates that they are unlikely to have been wholly responsible for the animal's extinction. With available evidence, it is hard to define the cause of extinction.\n\nMany scientists argue that factors like ecological change, virulent disease, and hunting by people wiped out many large mammal species during the end of the European Ice age, including the giant deer. Fossils found on the Isle of Man at Ballaugh, and at two places in western Siberia postdating the supposed extinction of the species show that, whatever the causes, the actual termination of the species was likely due to a variety of factors which had different significance and timing in different parts of the species' range.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>Irish Elk Survived after Ice Age Ended Author(s): S.

The Irish elk was a prime example because it had evolved from a smaller ancestor with smaller antlers. In terms of the Irish elk, orthogenesis was claimed to have caused an evolutionary trajectory towards antlers that became larger and larger, eventually causing the species' extinction because the antlers grew to sizes which inhibited proper feeding habits and caused the animal to become trapped in tree branches.<ref name=Hughes />\n\nIn the 1930s, orthogenesis was disputed by Darwinians led by [[Julian Huxley]], who noted that antler size was relative to body size. Because the Irish elk was a large organism compared to its smaller relatives such as deer, there was an [[Allometry|allometric]] relationship between the antlers and body size.<ref>Anderson, Kristina. \"What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.\" What On Earth - A Canadian Newsletter for the Earth Sciences.

Because basal circumference is highly correlated with other linear measures of antler size,<ref>Barto\u0161 and Bahbouh 2006</ref> such a decrease indicates that insular antler mass dropped to {{frac|1|14}} of the mainland antler mass. This reduction in antler mass is 2.7 times more extreme than expected given the allometric relationship between antler and body masses in red deer<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> and demonstrates a rapid evolution of smaller antlers. A similar change in a typical Irish elk population with prime stags having {{cvt|35|kg}} antlers<ref name=\"barnosky86\"/> would result in antler weights of {{cvt|13|kg}} or less in worsening climatic conditions. This estimate is within the range of extant wapiti/red deer (''Cervus'' spp.) antler weights.<ref name=\"geist\"/>\n\nIrish elk stags in more adverse environments had smaller bodies and relatively even smaller antlers,<ref name=\"moen99\"/><ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> but proponents of the antler-extinction hypothesis have not addressed the possibility of rapid evolutionary reduction in antler size. The antlers of the Irish elk should have been able to evolve rapidly in the face of selection for smaller and less expensive sizes. This conclusion is supported by the great diversity of Irish elk antler forms found among different populations at different times, including compact upright orientations possibly from populations inhabiting more heavily wooded environments<ref>Lister 1994</ref> suggesting the evolutionary malleability of Irish elk antlers.\"<ref name=\"Worman\"/> Ultimately, the decrease in energy intake by the Late Pleistocene, influenced the ability to produce for Irish elk females.<ref name=\"Worman\">{{cite journal |last2= Kimbrell|first2= Tristan|title= Getting to the hart of the matter: Did antlers truly cause the extinction of the Irish elk?|url= https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ff4d412edd3dcb9f15a1321f780f507468024bf3|journal= Oikos|volume= 117|issue= 9|pages= 1397\u20131405|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16608.x|year= 2008|last1= O'Driscoll Worman|first1= Cedric}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Knight Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]]]]\nFrequent debates occur as to whether or not sexual selection led to the Irish elk's extinction. Sexual selection can increase or decrease a population's chance of extinction, due to behaviours such as male-male competition and female choice. Also, sexual harassment by males can result in lower female fecundity or even death.<ref name=\"Kokko\">Kokko, H., & Brooks, R. (2003). Sexy to die for? sexual selection and the risk of extinction. Annales Zoologici Fennici, 40(2), 207-219. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/18804232</ref> Regardless of the details of the species' life history, extinction would require that too few males survive to maturity to fertilize a sufficient number of females to maintain a viable population.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> When it comes to male-male competition, if the assumption is that detrimental effects are clear in only the males, a surviving male would have a large number of females to choose from, with little competition. Selection must, therefore, favour the less extreme male genotypes, and generating a scenario seems impossible where males with larger antlers are still selected for when the lifetime reproductive success of males with large antlers approaches zero (as required for deterministic extinction to occur).<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nIn female choice, sexual selection could, thus, reinforce natural selection and lead to quicker responses to environmental changes, should they occur.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> With a decrease in male population, females have fewer choices, which could result in inbreeding. This can pose significant threats to population survival.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/> However, many of these studies are contradicting. Females may adaptively avoid the accumulation of inbreeding, so that female choice might increase effective population size.<ref name=\"Kokko\"/>\n\nLate Pleistocene fossils from Ballybetagh bog, near Dublin, Ireland, indicate that males segregated from females during winters.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/> This type of segregation implies that the Irish elk had behaviours such as [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] and polygynous mating systems, where a single male mates with two or more females. This also supports the belief that the large antler size was used for social display. Within male groups, winterkill was the chief cause of death and was highest among juveniles and small adults with small antlers.<ref name=\"barnosky85\"/>\n\n===Habitat===\nNeither exclusive to Ireland nor an elk, it was named so because the most well-known and best-preserved fossil specimens have been found in lake sediments and [[peat bog]]s in Ireland. The Irish elk had a far-reaching range, being located throughout Europe, northern Africa, and some related forms located in China.\n\nThe Irish elk prioritized open grassland habitats and was in fact the most [[cursorial]] cervid known.<ref>Geist, V. 1999. Deer of the World. Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury.</ref> Other ungulates that prefer open habitats, including the related [[fallow deer]], typically have more ostentatious colour patterns.\n\n==Extinction==\n[[File:Crystal Palace Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|Sculptures in [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace]]]]\nA number of hypotheses are easy to advance regarding the disappearance of the more localized populations of this species. The situation is less clear regarding the final demise of the Irish elk in continental Eurasia east of the Urals. Stuart ''et al.'' (2004) tentatively suggest that a combination of human presence along rivers and slow decrease in habitat quality in upland areas presented the last Irish elk with the choice of either good habitat with considerable hunting pressure, or general absence of humans in a suboptimal habitat.\n\nTraditionally, discussion of the cause of their extinction has focused on the antler size (rather than on their overall body size), which may be due more to their impact on the observer than any actual property. Some have suggested hunting by humans was a contributing factor in the demise of the Irish elk, as may have been the case with other prehistoric [[megafauna]], even assuming that the large antler size restricted the movement of males through forested regions or that it was by some other means a \"[[maladaptation]]\".<ref name=\"gould1974\"/> Others assume the ultimate cause of extinction may have been the adaptations for mineral metabolism that were beneficial to the Irish elk until vegetation changed.<ref name=\"moen99\">{{cite journal|last=Moen|first=Ron A.|first2=John|last2=Pastor |first3=Yosef|last3=Cohen |title=Antler growth and extinction of Irish elk|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|year=1999|pages=235\u2013249|url=http://www.duluth.umn.edu/~rmoen/Dld/Moen_1999.pdf}}</ref> But given the difficulty of recovering quantitative records of human hunting impacts from the sub-fossil record alone, the role of humans in the extinction of the Irish elk is not yet clear.\n\nSome research has suggested that a lack of sufficient high-quality [[forage]] caused the extinction of the elk. According to an article written by researchers Silvia Gonzalez, Andrew Kitcheneri, and Adrian Lister, in 2000, a reduction in forest density into the Late Pleistocene decreased nutritional selection and is believed to have led to a conflict between sexual selection and ultimately a decrease in antler and body size, which can explain what may have caused their demise.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\">{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Silvia|author2=Andrew Kitchener |author3=Adrian Lister |title=Survival of the Irish elk into the Holocene|journal=Nature|date=15 June 2000|volume=405|issue=6788|pages=753\u2013754|doi=10.1038/35015668|pmid=10866185}}</ref> High amounts of [[calcium]] and [[phosphate]] compounds are required to form antlers, and therefore large quantities of these minerals are required for the massive structures of the Irish elk. The males (and male deer in general) met this requirement partly from their bones, replenishing them from food plants after the antlers were grown or reclaiming the nutrients from discarded antlers (as has been observed in extant deer). Thus, in the antler growth phase, giant deer suffered from a condition similar to [[osteoporosis]].<ref name=\"moen99\" /> When the climate changed at the end of the [[last glacial period]], the vegetation in the animal's habitat also changed towards species that presumably could not deliver sufficient amounts of the required minerals, at least in the western part of its range.\n\nSimply blaming antler size for their extinction may not be entirely accurate. The most likely cause is the significantly shortened growing season seen toward the end of the Pleistocene Era. This reduced availability in nutrition resulted in the lowering of the female reproduction output by about 50%.<ref name=\"Worman\"/>\n\nHowever, the most recent specimen of ''M. giganteus'' in northern Siberia, dated to approximately 7,700 years ago &mdash; well after the end of the last glacial period &mdash; shows no sign of nutrient stress. This specimen came from a region with a [[continental climate]] where the proposed vegetation changes had not yet occurred.<ref>{{aut|Hughes, Sandrine; Hayden, Thomas J.; Douady, Christophe J.; Tougard, Christelle; Germonpr\u00e9, Mietje; Stuart, Anthony; Lbova, Lyudmila; Carden, Ruth F.; H\u00e4nni, Catherine; Say, Ludovic}} (2006).

Giant deer fossils found on the [[Isle of Man]] at Ballaugh confirm the survival of the species into early Holocene in at least this area. The [[Ballaugh Elk]] skeleton is smaller than the entire range of Irish skeletons, but has a relatively large skull and the antlers are well-sized for an adult male. This suggests that size decreased into the Holocene.\n\nThere is strong intraspecific [[allometry]] among Irish deer. Smaller animals have relatively shorter antlers. Reduced display organs are theorized to indicate a prelude to extinction from nutritional stress. Reduced forage density leads to a conflict between sexual selection for antler size and nutritional selection pressures. These factors reduced populations and the body size of the giant deer. However, data indicates that they are unlikely to have been wholly responsible for the animal's extinction. With available evidence, it is hard to define the cause of extinction.\n\nMany scientists argue that factors like ecological change, virulent disease, and hunting by people wiped out many large mammal species during the end of the European Ice age, including the giant deer. Fossils found on the Isle of Man at Ballaugh, and at two places in western Siberia postdating the supposed extinction of the species show that, whatever the causes, the actual termination of the species was likely due to a variety of factors which had different significance and timing in different parts of the species' range.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>Irish Elk Survived after Ice Age Ended Author(s): S.

The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = September 13, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]].

The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].\n\nBecause of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the expression \"Apostles' Creed\" occurs in a letter of AD&nbsp;390 from a [[Synod of Milan|synod in Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title =

In the fourth line, it replaced the personal pronoun \"he\" with the relative \"who\", and changed the punctuation, so as no longer to present the Creed as a series of separate statements. In the same line it removed the words \"the power of\".

In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism.

F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]]. See [[:da:Den apostolske trosbekendelse|Den apostolske trosbekendelse]].\n\n===United Methodist Church===\nThe [[United Methodist Church|United Methodists]] commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at No. 881 in the ''[[United Methodist Hymnal]]'', one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]], founders of [[Methodism]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources |accessdate= May 19, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093223/http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |archivedate= May 18, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources |accessdate= May 19, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093227/http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |archivedate= May 18, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref> It is notable for omitting the line \"he descended into hell\", but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/apostles-creed-traditional-ecumenical | title = Apostle's Creed Traditional and Ecumenical Versions | publisher = The United Methodist Church |accessdate= July 15, 2015 }}</ref> which includes \"he descended to the dead.\"\n\nThe Apostles' Creed as found in ''The Methodist Hymnal'' of 1939 also omits the line \"he descended...\"<ref>''The Methodist Hymnal'' (1939).

Nashville: The Methodist Publishing House. #738.</ref>\n\nHowever, when the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in the United States in 1784, John Wesley sent the new American Church a Sunday Service which included the phrase \"he descended into hell\" in the text of The Apostles' Creed.  <ref>Wesley, John (1784). \"The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America with other Occasional Services,\" p. 12.</ref> It is clear that Wesley intended American Methodists to use the phrase in the recitation of the Creed. \n\nThe ''United Methodist Hymnal'' of 1989 also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).<ref>{{Citation | chapter = The Worship Resources | title = United Methodist Hymnal | editor-first = Hoyt | editor-last = Hickman | year = 1989 | page = 200}}.</ref> This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word \"catholic\" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.\n\n:I believe in God the Father Almighty,\n::maker of heaven and earth;\n\n:And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, \n::who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, \n::born of the Virgin Mary, \n::suffered under Pontius Pilate, \n::was crucified, died, and was buried;\n::he descended to the dead.\n::On the third day he rose again; \n::he ascended into heaven, \n::is seated at the right hand of the Father, \n::and will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\n:I believe in the Holy Spirit,\n::the holy catholic church,\n::the communion of saints,\n::the forgiveness of sins,\n::the resurrection of the body \n::and the life everlasting.

In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. The Apostles' Creed is recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, \"Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Holy Baptism,\" The (Online) Book of Common Prayer|date=1979|publisher=The Episcopal Church|edition=revised 2007|url=https://www.bcponline.org/Baptism/holybaptism.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> It is also used in an interrogative form at the [[Easter Vigil]] in The Renewal of Baptismal Vows.<ref>''The Book of Common Prayer'' (1979).

It is the first private observatory in the United States to open in the 20th century.\n\n==History==\nMIRA was founded in 1972.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mira.org/about.htm |title=About the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy |publisher=Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy |accessdate=22 July 2016 |website=mira.org}}</ref> The [[acronym]] \"MIRA\" was chosen because of the [[Mira|unusual star of that name]] and the reference to the astronomical-relevant [[wikt:mirar#Spanish|Spanish word for \u2018look\u2019]].\n\nThe idea for an independent observatory came from Bruce Weaver and [[Craig Chester (astronomer)|Craig Chester]], then astronomy graduate students at [[Warner and Swasey Observatory]], [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; the other founders were Donna Burych, Cynthia Irvine, Nelson Irvine, Albert Merville, Anne Merville, Hazel Ross, and Sandra Weaver.<ref name=\"Mullally\"/> The group of \"nearly penniless and doomed graduate students\" were concerned how they would manage to work in astronomy.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/> According to MIRA astronomer Arthur Babcock, during the early 1970s as \"the glory days of space exploration were winding down\" scientists decided they wanted a place where they could do long range research without the \"demanding cycle of academia\" and constant publishing.<ref name=\"Argueza Weekly\">{{cite web |last1=Argueza |first1=Marielle |title=A year later, the caretaker of a remote astronomy station remembers watching the Soberanes Fire. |url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/people/831/a-year-later-the-caretaker-of-a-remote-astronomy-station/article_9c22bf30-77d2-11e7-a6d7-f70ab29f3b20.html |website=Bird's Eye View |publisher=Monterey County Weekly |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> As observational stellar astronomers, they needed constant access to a large telescope. Working at the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory|Kitt Peak Observatory]] in Arizona was a possibility but opening their own observatory was even better, it started off as a joke but over time and in discussion with the other close-knit students it became serious contemplation. A meeting at a lecture, with astronomer [[Bart Bok]] who was very enthusiastic about the idea, encouraged the students.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/>\n\nWith Bok's influence and word-of-mouth, the Case students began to lecture at other campuses. During one lecture at the [[University of Maryland]] they \"heard of a 36-inch mirror that was gathering dust at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. It had been built by [[NASA]] as the backup for [[Stratoscope|Stratoscope II]] ... and never used\".<ref name=\"Overbye\"/> [[Carl Sagan]] suggested that the Case students be invited to give a talk at the [[American Astronomical Society]], where Weaver found [[Martin Schwarzschild]] who was then director of the Princeton Observatory, \"eating breakfast alone and sat down with him\"; this was an event known as '\"the famous breakfast meeting\"'. That discussion led to Princeton \"indefinitely\" loaning the mirror to the Case students.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/><ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chasan |first1=Daniel Jack |title=Young astronomers, in search of an observatory, start their own |journal=Smithsonian |date=1981 |pages=1\u20138 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Case students had now gained access to the mirror and had received pledges from the other students, and because they were not tied to any specific institution, they only needed to find the location. They knew that mountain ranges \"along the west coast of a continent\" where the air was smooth from the ocean, \"resulted in small sharp star images\". This knowledge led the students to eventually select the [[Santa Lucia Range]]. [[Lick Observatory]] astronomers had been interested in a new observing station in that area. Students Albert and Ann Merville were sent to investigate locations, and they selected Chews Ridge which had an elevation of 5,000 feet. A dirt road and a fire tower nearby were other considerations in favor of the location. In 1972, the astronomers applied to the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] for a use permit, and it was granted in 1974. Over the next couple of years, the Case students moved to Monterey County, and took part-time jobs in the area, in order to make a down-payment on 80-acres in Cachagua Valley, near the Carmel foothills.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=Merle |date=1970 |title=The California Site Survey |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=82 |page=672 |doi=10.1086/128945}}</ref>\n\nBruce Weaver recounts that the formation of Friends of MIRA happened in September 1978 \"when 80 people assembled in [[Ansel Adams]]' house.\"<ref name=\"Mullally\"/>\n\nThe influence of Bok and the nearness of Lick Observatory allowed MIRA to \"receive a $76,000 grant from the [[Research Corporation]] ... to build a telescope around the 36-inch mirror\".

It is the first private observatory in the United States to open in the 20th century.\n\n==History==\nMIRA was founded in 1972.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mira.org/about.htm |title=About the Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy |publisher=Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy |accessdate=22 July 2016 |website=mira.org}}</ref> The [[acronym]] \"MIRA\" was chosen because of the [[Mira|unusual star of that name]] and the reference to the astronomical-relevant [[wikt:mirar#Spanish|Spanish word for \u2018look\u2019]].\n\nThe idea for an independent observatory came from Bruce Weaver and [[Craig Chester (astronomer)|Craig Chester]], then astronomy graduate students at [[Warner and Swasey Observatory]], [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; the other founders were Donna Burych, Cynthia Irvine, Nelson Irvine, Albert Merville, Anne Merville, Hazel Ross, and Sandra Weaver.<ref name=\"Mullally\"/> The group of \"nearly penniless and doomed graduate students\" were concerned how they would manage to work in astronomy.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/> According to MIRA astronomer Arthur Babcock, during the early 1970s as \"the glory days of space exploration were winding down\" scientists decided they wanted a place where they could do long range research without the \"demanding cycle of academia\" and constant publishing.<ref name=\"Argueza Weekly\">{{cite web |last1=Argueza |first1=Marielle |title=A year later, the caretaker of a remote astronomy station remembers watching the Soberanes Fire. |url=http://www.montereycountyweekly.com/people/831/a-year-later-the-caretaker-of-a-remote-astronomy-station/article_9c22bf30-77d2-11e7-a6d7-f70ab29f3b20.html |website=Bird's Eye View |publisher=Monterey County Weekly |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> As observational stellar astronomers, they needed constant access to a large telescope. Working at the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory|Kitt Peak Observatory]] in Arizona was a possibility but opening their own observatory was even better, it started off as a joke but over time and in discussion with the other close-knit students it became serious contemplation. A meeting at a lecture, with astronomer [[Bart Bok]] who was very enthusiastic about the idea, encouraged the students.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/>\n\nWith Bok's influence and word-of-mouth, the Case students began to lecture at other campuses. During one lecture at the [[University of Maryland]] they \"heard of a 36-inch mirror that was gathering dust at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. It had been built by [[NASA]] as the backup for [[Stratoscope|Stratoscope II]] ... and never used\".<ref name=\"Overbye\"/> [[Carl Sagan]] suggested that the Case students be invited to give a talk at the [[American Astronomical Society]], where Weaver found [[Martin Schwarzschild]] who was then director of the Princeton Observatory, \"eating breakfast alone and sat down with him\"; this was an event known as '\"the famous breakfast meeting\"'. That discussion led to Princeton \"indefinitely\" loaning the mirror to the Case students.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/><ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite journal |last1=Chasan |first1=Daniel Jack |title=Young astronomers, in search of an observatory, start their own |journal=Smithsonian |date=1981 |pages=1\u20138 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Case students had now gained access to the mirror and had received pledges from the other students, and because they were not tied to any specific institution, they only needed to find the location. They knew that mountain ranges \"along the west coast of a continent\" where the air was smooth from the ocean, \"resulted in small sharp star images\". This knowledge led the students to eventually select the [[Santa Lucia Range]]. [[Lick Observatory]] astronomers had been interested in a new observing station in that area. Students Albert and Ann Merville were sent to investigate locations, and they selected Chews Ridge which had an elevation of 5,000 feet. A dirt road and a fire tower nearby were other considerations in favor of the location. In 1972, the astronomers applied to the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] for a use permit, and it was granted in 1974. Over the next couple of years, the Case students moved to Monterey County, and took part-time jobs in the area, in order to make a down-payment on 80-acres in Cachagua Valley, near the Carmel foothills.<ref name=\"Overbye\"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Walker |first=Merle |date=1970 |title=The California Site Survey |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |volume=82 |page=672 |doi=10.1086/128945}}</ref>\n\nBruce Weaver recounts that the formation of Friends of MIRA happened in September 1978 \"when 80 people assembled in [[Ansel Adams]]' house.\"<ref name=\"Mullally\"/>\n\nThe influence of Bok and the nearness of Lick Observatory allowed MIRA to \"receive a $76,000 grant from the [[Research Corporation]] ... to build a telescope around the 36-inch mirror\".
