Others, such as WWE and AEW, began presenting [[Behind closed doors (sport)|empty arena shows]]. WWE began this with the March 13 episodes of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' and ''[[205 Live]]'', broadcasting both shows from the [[WWE Performance Center]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Their following episodes of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' and ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' followed suit with plans to continue this format until further notice, which included hosting [[WrestleMania 36]] at this venue. AEW began this format with the March 18 episode of ''[[AEW Dynamite|Dynamite]]'', as well as that day's tapings for ''[[AEW Dark|Dark]]'', broadcasting from [[Daily's Place]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], though after a couple of weeks at this venue, they moved to an undisclosed location as Daily's Place became a testing site for COVID-19.

Others, such as WWE and AEW, began presenting [[Behind closed doors (sport)|empty arena shows]]. WWE began this with the March 13 episodes of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' and ''[[205 Live]]'', broadcasting both shows from the [[WWE Performance Center]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]. Their following episodes of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' and ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' followed suit with plans to continue this format until further notice, which included hosting [[WrestleMania 36]] at this venue. AEW began this format with the March 18 episode of ''[[AEW Dynamite|Dynamite]]'', as well as the tapings for ''[[AEW Dark|Dark]]'', broadcasting from [[Daily's Place]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], though after a couple of weeks at this venue, they moved to an undisclosed location as Daily's Place became a testing site for COVID-19.

Aaron was most popular in the United States in 1994 peaking as the 28th most popular name. Aaron is also a [[Jewish]] [[Aaron (surname)|surname]].  [[Saint Aaron|St. Aaron]]'s day is on July 1 and is celebrated in [[Francophonie|French speaking countries]] and [[Poland]]. The name is generally recognisable around the world as referring to the biblical [[Aaron]] and cognate forms in other languages include [[Aar\u00f3n]] in Spanish; [[Aar\u00e3o]] in Portuguese; [[Aron (name)|Aron]] in Irish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish and Croatian; \u00c1r\u00f3n in Czech; and [[Harun]] (\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646) in [[Arabic]].

For example, biblical texts focussed on rules and traditions such as [[Leviticus]] are considered aaronic.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Pronunciation==\nIn its original Hebrew, [[A-A-ron (given name)|Aharon]] (\u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df) is pronounced as three syllables, a-ha-ron. This Hebrew pronunciation is still used in modern Hebrew in Israel today. The Hebrew sound had no direct equivalent in Greek, when Jewish scriptures were translated by Greek-speaking Jews in Alexandria around 200 BCE  to form the  [[septuagint]], so these translators used a pair of Greek [[alpha]] letters to approximate the same sound, \"\u0391\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\".   This was translated again by [[St. Jerome]] from the Greek to the Latin [[Vulgate]] as \"Aaron\" in the fourth century CE.  It is thought that the Greeks and Romans would pronounce Aaron similarly to the Hebrew, as the Catholic Latin pronunciation is still defined this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccwatershed.org/media/pdfs/12/07/05/19-20-13_0.pdf | title=  The correct pronunciation of Latin according to Roman usage.  Rev. Michael de Angelis CRM PhD, 1937.}}</ref>\n\nThe English pronunciation of the biblical [[Aaron]]'s name was derived by anglicising the Latin during the [[Church of England]]'s translation of the Authorized [[King James Bible]] in 1611 (possibly influenced by older [[English translations of the bible]] from Anglo Saxon times onwards).

This pronunciation is used in the 1956 film [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]] featuring the biblical [[Aaron]], by UK chief rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]] when  speaking in English,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiefrabbi.org/tag/ki-tissa/ |title=Website of the chief rabbi |publisher=Jonathan Sacks |accessdate=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401065128/http://www.chiefrabbi.org/tag/ki-tissa/ |archivedate=2013-04-01 }}</ref> and in the BBC production of Shakespeare's [[Titus Andronicus]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rsLl8wDLg4.  Titus Andronicus, BBC Shakespeare video series, 1985.  DVD ASIN:B000KPG7RA</ref>\n\nThe English name \"Aaron\" is sometimes confused with the English name \"[[Aron (name)|Aron]]\" which is also derived from the biblical [[Aaron]] but through translation routes other than the Church of England (e.g. Scandinavian<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bibeln.se/las/2k/2_mos |title=Andra Mosenboken (Book of Exodus), Swedish Bible}}</ref> and Celtic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anbioblanaofa.org/pdf/021Eax.pdf |title=Eaxodus (Book of Exodus), Irish Bible |access-date=2013-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224104814/http://www.anbioblanaofa.org/pdf/021Eax.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> churches) and pronounced /\u00e6r\u0259n/ (\"a-ran\" as in \"arrow\").  It is further sometimes confused with the names [[Arran (disambiguation)|Arran]] and [[Aran (disambiguation)|Aran]] which are also pronounced /\u00e6r\u0259n/ (\"a-ran\" as in \"arrow\") but derive from various sources unrelated to the biblical [[Aaron]] such as the Scottish [[Isle of Arran]] and Irish [[Aran Islands]].  [[Aeron (Celtic mythology)|Aeron]] is another unrelated name, pronounced air-ron, of an old  [[Aeron (Celtic mythology)|Celtic god]] and the [[Aeron chair]].\n\nIn the 20th century, ambiguity over the pronunciation of \"Aaron\" was created by naming children after [[Elvis Aaron Presley]] rather than after the biblical [[Aaron]].  Presley's middle name was originally \"Aron\" on his birth certificate and pronounced /\u00e6r\u0259n/ (\"a-ran\" as in \"arrow\") by his parents to rhyme with his stillborn brother's name, Garon. Presley later legally amended his middle name to be spelt \"Aaron\" to match the English biblical [[Aaron]], but without changing the pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvis.com/about-the-king/faq.aspx |title=About the King |publisher=Official Elvis Presley site |accessdate=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105095633/http://www.elvis.com/about-the-king/faq.aspx |archivedate=2010-11-05 }}</ref> Naming children after Presley effectively created an alternative [[de facto]]  pronunciation which can now be found in the Oxford ''American'' English Dictionary,<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Aaron.  Oxford American English Dictionary</ref> along with /e\u026ar\u026an/ ('ay-rin' as in \"A to Z\") which is heard in the American [[deep south]]. However the difference in these pronunciations in American English is often small or nonexistent due to its longer \"a\" than British English, as can be heard in American media such as episodes of [[Lost (TV series)|Lost]], recorded interviews with [[Aaron Copland]], or Hollywood's 1999 Shakespeare movie, [[Titus (film)|Titus]].\n\n==Notable people==\n\n===Religion===\n*[[Aaron]], biblical

For example, biblical texts focussed on rules and traditions such as [[Leviticus]] are considered aaronic.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Pronunciation==\nIn its original Hebrew, [[A-A-ron (given name)|Aharon]] (\u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df) is pronounced as three syllables, a-ha-ron. This Hebrew pronunciation is still used in modern Hebrew in Israel today. The Hebrew sound had no direct equivalent in Greek, when Jewish scriptures were translated by Greek-speaking Jews in Alexandria around 200 BCE  to form the  [[septuagint]], so these translators used a pair of Greek [[alpha]] letters to approximate the same sound, \"\u0391\u03b1\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\".   This was translated again by [[St. Jerome]] from the Greek to the Latin [[Vulgate]] as \"Aaron\" in the fourth century CE.  It is thought that the Greeks and Romans would pronounce Aaron similarly to the Hebrew, as the Catholic Latin pronunciation is still defined this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccwatershed.org/media/pdfs/12/07/05/19-20-13_0.pdf | title=  The correct pronunciation of Latin according to Roman usage.

Titus Andronicus, BBC Shakespeare video series, 1985.

It is further sometimes confused with the names [[Arran (disambiguation)|Arran]] and [[Aran (disambiguation)|Aran]] which are also pronounced /\u00e6r\u0259n/ (\"a-ran\" as in \"arrow\") but derive from various sources unrelated to the biblical [[Aaron]] such as the Scottish [[Isle of Arran]] and Irish [[Aran Islands]].  [[Aeron (Celtic mythology)|Aeron]] is another unrelated name, pronounced air-ron, of an old  [[Aeron (Celtic mythology)|Celtic god]] and the [[Aeron chair]].\n\nIn the 20th century, ambiguity over the pronunciation of \"Aaron\" was created by naming children after [[Elvis Aaron Presley]] rather than after the biblical [[Aaron]].  Presley's middle name was originally \"Aron\" on his birth certificate and pronounced /\u00e6r\u0259n/ (\"a-ran\" as in \"arrow\") by his parents to rhyme with his stillborn brother's name, Garon. Presley later legally amended his middle name to be spelt \"Aaron\" to match the English biblical [[Aaron]], but without changing the pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvis.com/about-the-king/faq.aspx |title=About the King |publisher=Official Elvis Presley site |accessdate=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105095633/http://www.elvis.com/about-the-king/faq.aspx |archivedate=2010-11-05 }}</ref> Naming children after Presley effectively created an alternative [[de facto]]  pronunciation which can now be found in the Oxford ''American'' English Dictionary,<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Aaron.

However the difference in these pronunciations in American English is often small or nonexistent due to its longer \"a\" than British English, as can be heard in American media such as episodes of

The small plant in front is about 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;in) tall. The concept of \"individual\" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]\n'''Reproduction''' (or '''procreation''' or '''breeding''') is the [[biological process]] by which new individual [[organism]]s \u2013 \"offspring\" \u2013 are produced from their \"parents\". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]].\n\nIn asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]. The [[cloning]] of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce<ref>Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.</ref> and organisms only pass on 50% of their [[gene]]s.<ref name=\"maynard\">[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.</ref>\n\nSexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called [[gamete]]s, which contain half the number of [[chromosome]]s of normal cells and are created by [[meiosis]], with typically a male [[fertilization|fertilizing]] a female of the same [[species]] to create a fertilized [[zygote]]. This produces [[offspring]] organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.\n\n==Asexual==\n{{Main|Asexual reproduction}}\nAsexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. [[Bacteria]] divide asexually via [[binary fission]]; [[virus]]es take control of host cells to produce more viruses; [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] ([[invertebrate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Hydroidea'') and [[yeast]]s are able to reproduce by [[budding]]. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of \"splitting\" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most [[plant]]s have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species [[Mycocepurus smithii]] is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.\n\nSome species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], [[yeast]] (See [[Mating of yeast]]s) and [[jellyfish]], may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of [[vegetative reproduction]]\u2014reproduction without seeds or spores\u2014but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]].\n\nOther ways of asexual reproduction include [[parthenogenesis]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]] and [[spore formation]] that involves only [[mitosis]]. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of [[embryo]] or [[seed]] without [[fertilization]] by a [[male]]. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower [[plant]]s (where it is called [[apomixis]]), [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. [[water flea]]s, [[aphid]]s, some [[bee]]s and [[parasitic wasp]]s), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some\n[[reptile]]s,<ref name=\"reptiles\">{{Cite book | last1 = Halliday | first1 = Tim R. | last2=Adler |first2=Kraig (eds.) | title = Reptiles & Amphibians | publisher = Torstar Books |year= 1986| page = 101 | isbn = 978-0-920269-81-7 }}</ref> [[fish]], and, very rarely, [[bird]]s<ref>{{Cite web|last=Savage |first=Thomas F. |title=A Guide to the Recognition of Parthenogenesis in Incubated Turkey Eggs |work=Oregon State University |date=September 12, 2005 |url=http://oregonstate.edu/Dept/animal-sciences/poultry/index.html |accessdate=2006-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115201713/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/animal-sciences/poultry/index.html |archivedate=November 15, 2006 |df= }}</ref> and [[shark]]s<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201405.html \"Female Sharks Can Reproduce Alone, Researchers Find\"], Washington Post, Wednesday, May 23, 2007; p. A02</ref>). It is sometimes also used to describe reproduction modes in hermaphroditic species which can self-fertilize.\n\n==Sexual==\n{{Main|Sexual reproduction}}\n{{See also|Human reproduction}}\n[[File:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating in midair flight]]\nSexual reproduction is a [[biological process]] that creates a new [[organism]] by combining the [[Genetics|genetic]] material of two organisms in a process that starts with [[meiosis]], a specialized type of [[cell division]]. Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating [[haploid]] [[gametes]]. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these '''''anisogamous''''' species, the two sexes are referred to as [[male]] (producing [[sperm]] or microspores) and [[female]] (producing [[ovum|ova]] or megaspores). In '''''isogamous species''''', the gametes are similar or identical in form ([[isogamete]]s), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see [[isogamy]]). For example, in the green alga, ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', there are so-called \"plus\" and \"minus\" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many [[fungi]] and the [[ciliate]] ''Paramecium aurelia'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=T.M. Sonneborn |title= Mating Types in Paramecium Aurelia: Diverse Conditions for Mating in Different Stocks; Occurrence, Number and Interrelations of the Types |journal= Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume= 79 |issue= 3 |pages= 411\u2013434 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |jstor=984858|year= 1938 }}</ref> have more than two  \"sexes\", called [[syngen]]s.\nMost [[animal]]s (including humans) and [[plants]] reproduce sexually. Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called [[alleles]]). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that \"the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases\" where recombination occurs freely.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Otto | first1 = S.P. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = D.B. | year = 1992 | title = Recombination and the Evolution of Diploidy | url = | journal = [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]] | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 745\u2013751 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = H. | last2 = Hopf | first2 = F.A. | last3 = Michod | first3 = R.E. | year = 1987 | title = The molecular basis of the evolution of sex | url = | journal = Adv Genet | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 323\u2013370 | pmid = 3324702 }}</ref>\n\n[[Bryophyte]]s reproduce sexually, but the larger and commonly-seen organisms are [[haploid]] and produce [[gametes]]. The gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a [[sporangium]], which in turn produces haploid spores. The [[diploid]] stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. ''haploid dominance''. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as [[genetic recombination]] between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the [[population]] more able to survive environmental variation.\n\n===Allogamy===\n{{Main|Allogamy}}\n[[Allogamy]] is the [[fertilization]] of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)\n\n===Autogamy===\n{{main|Autogamy}}\nSelf-[[fertilization]], also known as autogamy, occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many [[vascular plants]], some [[foraminifera]]ns, some [[ciliate]]s. The term \"autogamy\" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes [[self-pollination]] within the same flower, distinguished from [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous pollination]], transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same [[flowering plant]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckert, C.G. |year=2000 |title=Contributions of autogamy and geitonogamy to self-fertilization in a mass-flowering, clonal plant |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=532\u2013542 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0532:coaagt]2.0.co;2}}</ref> or within a single [[monoecious]] [[Gymnosperm]] plant.\n\n===Mitosis and meiosis===\n[[Mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are types of [[cell division]]. Mitosis occurs in [[somatic cells]], while meiosis occurs in [[gametes]].\n\n'''Mitosis'''\nThe resultant number of cells in mitosis is twice the number of original cells. The number of [[chromosomes]] in the offspring cells is the same as that of the parent cell.\n{{Clear}}<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:mitosis.jpg|center]] -->\n'''Meiosis'''\nThe resultant number of cells is four times the number of original cells. This results in cells with half the number of [[chromosomes]] present in the parent cell.

Some animals, such as the [[human]] and [[northern gannet]], do not reach [[sexual maturity]] for many years after [[birth]] and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to [[adult]]hood. For example, a [[rabbit]] (mature after 8 months) can produce 10\u201330 offspring per year, and a [[Drosophila melanogster|fruit fly]] (mature after 10\u201314 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as [[K-selection]] (few offspring) and [[r-selection]] (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by [[evolution]] depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population.  Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]] thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.\n\n===Other types===\n{{main|Semelparity and iteroparity}}\n* '''Polycyclic animals''' reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.\n* '''Semelparous organisms''' reproduce only once in their lifetime, such as [[annual plant]]s (including all grain crops), and certain species of salmon, spider, bamboo and century plant. Often, they die shortly after reproduction. This is often associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]].\n* '''Iteroparous organisms''' produce offspring in successive (e.g. annual or seasonal) cycles, such as [[perennial plant]]s. Iteroparous animals survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). This is more associated with [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]].\n\n==Asexual vs. sexual reproduction==\n[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of the ''twofold cost of sexual reproduction''. If each organism were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]\n\nOrganisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.\n\nMany organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. [[Aphid]]s, [[slime mold]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, some species of [[starfish]] (by [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.\n\nWhen food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see [[Meiosis]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to content from predatory publisher}}  In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other \"over-wintering\" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can \"wait out\" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.\n\n==Life without==\nThe existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the [[origin of life]] produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called [[abiogenesis]].

Williams (biologist)|Williams G. C.]] 1975. Sex and Evolution. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.</ref> He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of \"winning\" \u2013 that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Breeding season]]\n* [[Masting]]\n* [[Mating system]]\n* [[Modes of reproduction]]\n* [[Plant reproduction]]\n* [[Reproductive system]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Tobler, M. & Schlupp, I.

The concept of \"individual\" is obviously stretched by this asexual reproductive process.]]\n'''Reproduction''' (or '''procreation''' or '''breeding''') is the [[biological process]] by which new individual [[organism]]s \u2013 \"offspring\" \u2013 are produced from their \"parents\". Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known [[life]]; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. There are two forms of reproduction: [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] and [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]].\n\nIn asexual reproduction, an organism can reproduce without the involvement of another organism. Asexual reproduction is not limited to [[unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]]. The [[cloning]] of an organism is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle for biologists. The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce<ref>Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.</ref> and organisms only pass on 50% of their [[gene]]s.<ref name=\"maynard\">[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.</ref>\n\nSexual reproduction typically requires the sexual interaction of two specialized organisms, called [[gamete]]s, which contain half the number of [[chromosome]]s of normal cells and are created by [[meiosis]], with typically a male [[fertilization|fertilizing]] a female of the same [[species]] to create a fertilized [[zygote]]. This produces [[offspring]] organisms whose genetic characteristics are derived from those of the two parental organisms.\n\n==Asexual==\n{{Main article|Asexual reproduction}}\nAsexual reproduction is a process by which organisms create genetically similar or identical copies of themselves without the contribution of genetic material from another organism. [[Bacteria]] divide asexually via [[binary fission]]; [[virus]]es take control of host cells to produce more viruses; [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]] ([[invertebrate]]s of the [[Order (biology)|order]] ''Hydroidea'') and [[yeast]]s are able to reproduce by [[budding]]. These organisms often do not possess different sexes, and they are capable of \"splitting\" themselves into two or more copies of themselves. Most [[plant]]s have the ability to reproduce asexually and the ant species [[Mycocepurus smithii]] is thought to reproduce entirely by asexual means.\n\nSome species that are capable of reproducing asexually, like [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], [[yeast]] (See [[Mating of yeast]]s) and [[jellyfish]], may also reproduce sexually. For instance, most plants are capable of [[vegetative reproduction]]\u2014reproduction without seeds or spores\u2014but can also reproduce sexually. Likewise, bacteria may exchange genetic information by [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]].\n\nOther ways of asexual reproduction include [[parthenogenesis]], [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]] and [[spore formation]] that involves only [[mitosis]]. Parthenogenesis is the growth and development of [[embryo]] or [[seed]] without [[fertilization]] by a [[male]]. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some species, including lower [[plant]]s (where it is called [[apomixis]]), [[invertebrate]]s (e.g. [[water flea]]s, [[aphid]]s, some [[bee]]s and [[parasitic wasp]]s), and [[vertebrate]]s (e.g. some\n[[reptile]]s,<ref name=\"reptiles\">{{Cite book | last1 = Halliday | first1 = Tim R. | last2=Adler |first2=Kraig (eds.) | title = Reptiles & Amphibians | publisher = Torstar Books |year= 1986| page = 101 | isbn = 978-0-920269-81-7 }}</ref> [[fish]], and, very rarely, [[bird]]s<ref>{{Cite web|last=Savage |first=Thomas F. |title=A Guide to the Recognition of Parthenogenesis in Incubated Turkey Eggs |work=Oregon State University |date=September 12, 2005 |url=http://oregonstate.edu/Dept/animal-sciences/poultry/index.html |accessdate=2006-10-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115201713/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/animal-sciences/poultry/index.html |archivedate=November 15, 2006 |df= }}</ref> and [[shark]]s<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/22/AR2007052201405.html \"Female Sharks Can Reproduce Alone, Researchers Find\"], Washington Post, Wednesday, May 23, 2007; p.

Each of two parent organisms contributes half of the offspring's genetic makeup by creating [[haploid]] [[gametes]]. Most organisms form two different types of gametes. In these '''''anisogamous''''' species, the two sexes are referred to as [[male]] (producing [[sperm]] or microspores) and [[female]] (producing [[ovum|ova]] or megaspores). In '''''isogamous species''''', the gametes are similar or identical in form ([[isogamete]]s), but may have separable properties and then may be given other different names (see [[isogamy]]). For example, in the green alga, ''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'', there are so-called \"plus\" and \"minus\" gametes. A few types of organisms, such as many [[fungi]] and the [[ciliate]] ''Paramecium aurelia'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=T.M.

Sexually reproducing organisms have different sets of genes for every trait (called [[alleles]]). Offspring inherit one allele for each trait from each parent. Thus, offspring have a combination of the parents' genes. It is believed that \"the masking of deleterious alleles favors the evolution of a dominant diploid phase in organisms that alternate between haploid and diploid phases\" where recombination occurs freely.<ref>S.P.

The gametes fuse to form a [[zygote]] which develops into a [[sporangium]], which in turn produces haploid spores. The [[diploid]] stage is relatively small and short-lived compared to the haploid stage, i.e. ''haploid dominance''. The advantage of diploidy, heterosis, only exists in the diploid life generation. Bryophytes retain sexual reproduction despite the fact that the haploid stage does not benefit from heterosis. This may be an indication that the sexual reproduction has advantages other than heterosis, such as [[genetic recombination]] between members of the species, allowing the expression of a wider range of traits and thus making the [[population]] more able to survive environmental variation.\n\n===Allogamy===\n{{Main article|Allogamy}}\n[[Allogamy]] is the [[fertilization]] of the combination of gametes from two parents, generally the [[ovum]] from one individual with the [[spermatozoa]] of another. (In isogamous species, the two gametes will not be defined as either sperm or ovum.)\n\n===Autogamy===\n{{main article|Autogamy}}\nSelf-[[fertilization]], also known as autogamy, occurs in [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] organisms where the two [[gamete]]s fused in fertilization come from the same individual, e.g., many [[vascular plants]], some [[foraminifera]]ns, some [[ciliate]]s. The term \"autogamy\" is sometimes substituted for autogamous pollination (not necessarily leading to successful fertilization) and describes [[self-pollination]] within the same flower, distinguished from [[geitonogamy|geitonogamous pollination]], transfer of pollen to a different flower on the same [[flowering plant]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eckert, C.G. |year=2000 |title=Contributions of autogamy and geitonogamy to self-fertilization in a mass-flowering, clonal plant |journal=Ecology |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=532\u2013542 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[0532:coaagt]2.0.co;2}}</ref> or within a single [[monoecious]] [[Gymnosperm]] plant.\n\n===Mitosis and meiosis===\n[[Mitosis]] and [[meiosis]] are types of [[cell division]].

Some animals, such as the [[human]] and [[northern gannet]], do not reach [[sexual maturity]] for many years after [[birth]] and even then produce few offspring. Others reproduce quickly; but, under normal circumstances, most offspring do not survive to [[adult]]hood. For example, a [[rabbit]] (mature after 8 months) can produce 10\u201330 offspring per year, and a [[Drosophila melanogster|fruit fly]] (mature after 10\u201314 days) can produce up to 900 offspring per year. These two main strategies are known as [[K-selection]] (few offspring) and [[r-selection]] (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by [[evolution]] depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population.  Some organisms such as honey bees and fruit flies retain sperm in a process called [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]] thereby increasing the duration of their fertility.\n\n===Other types===\n{{main article|Semelparity and iteroparity}}\n* '''Polycyclic animals''' reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.\n* '''Semelparous organisms''' reproduce only once in their lifetime, such as [[annual plant]]s (including all grain crops), and certain species of salmon, spider, bamboo and century plant. Often, they die shortly after reproduction. This is often associated with [[R/K selection theory|r-strategists]].\n* '''Iteroparous organisms''' produce offspring in successive (e.g. annual or seasonal) cycles, such as [[perennial plant]]s. Iteroparous animals survive over multiple seasons (or periodic condition changes). This is more associated with [[R/K selection theory|K-strategists]].\n\n==Asexual vs. sexual reproduction==\n[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|right|Illustration of the ''twofold cost of sexual reproduction''. If each organism were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]\n\nOrganisms that reproduce through asexual reproduction tend to grow in number exponentially. However, because they rely on mutation for variations in their DNA, all members of the species have similar vulnerabilities. Organisms that reproduce sexually yield a smaller number of offspring, but the large amount of variation in their genes makes them less susceptible to disease.\n\nMany organisms can reproduce sexually as well as asexually. [[Aphid]]s, [[slime mold]]s, [[sea anemone]]s, some species of [[starfish]] (by [[fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmentation]]), and many plants are examples. When environmental factors are favorable, asexual reproduction is employed to exploit suitable conditions for survival such as an abundant food supply, adequate shelter, favorable climate, disease, optimum pH or a proper mix of other lifestyle requirements. Populations of these organisms increase exponentially via asexual reproductive strategies to take full advantage of the rich supply resources.\n\nWhen food sources have been depleted, the climate becomes hostile, or individual survival is jeopardized by some other adverse change in living conditions, these organisms switch to sexual forms of reproduction. Sexual reproduction ensures a mixing of the gene pool of the species. The variations found in offspring of sexual reproduction allow some individuals to be better suited for survival and provide a mechanism for selective adaptation to occur. The meiosis stage of the sexual cycle also allows especially effective repair of DNA damages (see [[Meiosis]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to content from predatory publisher}}  In addition, sexual reproduction usually results in the formation of a life stage that is able to endure the conditions that threaten the offspring of an asexual parent. Thus, seeds, spores, eggs, pupae, cysts or other \"over-wintering\" stages of sexual reproduction ensure the survival during unfavorable times and the organism can \"wait out\" adverse situations until a swing back to suitability occurs.\n\n==Life without==\nThe existence of life without reproduction is the subject of some speculation. The biological study of how the [[origin of life]] produced reproducing organisms from non-reproducing elements is called [[abiogenesis]]. Whether or not there were several independent abiogenetic events, biologists believe that the [[last universal ancestor]] to all present life on Earth lived about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].\n\nScientists have speculated about the possibility of creating life non-reproductively in the laboratory. Several scientists have succeeded in producing simple viruses from entirely non-living materials.<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12114528&dopt=Abstract Chemical synthesis of poliovirus cDNA: generation of infectious virus in the absence of natural template]<br />[http://atheism.about.com/b/a/042809.htm Scientists Create Artificial Virus]</ref> However, viruses are often regarded as not alive.

[[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] used [[lottery]] tickets as an [[analogy]] in one explanation for the widespread use of sexual reproduction.<ref>[[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams G. C.]] 1975. Sex and Evolution. Princeton (NJ): Princeton University Press.</ref> He argued that asexual reproduction, which produces little or no genetic variety in offspring, was like buying many tickets that all have the same number, limiting the chance of \"winning\" \u2013 that is, producing surviving offspring. Sexual reproduction, he argued, was like purchasing fewer tickets but with a greater variety of numbers and therefore a greater chance of success. The point of this analogy is that since asexual reproduction does not produce genetic variations, there is little ability to quickly adapt to a changing environment. The lottery principle is less accepted these days because of evidence that asexual reproduction is more prevalent in unstable environments, the opposite of what it predicts.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Breeding season]]\n* [[Masting]]\n* [[Mating system]]\n* [[Modes of reproduction]]\n* [[Plant reproduction]]\n* [[Reproductive system]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Tobler, M. & Schlupp, I.

It became a top ten hit on the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100, reaching number six.

The green-screen footage was done in a short amount of time, and some of it was put into a computer generated 3D environment, while components of the band were also shot. La Sala said, \"We were very flexible but every person in the team had his own special skill who was more towards motion graphics, design and editing, others more skilled in architectural design and me and the CEO experts in animation.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe video was listed in [[NME]]'s \"50 Worst Music Videos Ever\".<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Worst Music Videos Ever |url=http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |website=[[NME]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203205813/http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |archivedate=December 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Synopsis ===\nThe video takes place on Tukon4, where lead singer [[Jeffrey Jey]] is abducted by blue [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] Zorotl and Sayok6 during a concert.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.zorotl.com/zorotl_story7.php Jeffrey-kidnapped]</ref> The aliens then proceed to leave [[Earth]] with him. Group members [[Maurizio Lobina]] and [[Gabry Ponte]] chase after them in their own small [[spacecraft]], and eventually both ships arrive on the blue aliens' [[planet]] via a portal.\n\nIt is then shown that Jey was abducted to perform in a concert for the aliens, with him singing the same song he was about to sing when he was taken. He slowly realises that the crowd is composed entirely of strange blue beings, which are known as Tukonians,<ref name=\":0\" /> and becomes increasingly concerned.\n\nAfter fighting off a number of alien guards using [[martial arts]] and several energy-based, psionic abilities, including force lightning, Lobina and Ponte succeed in rescuing Jey. While leaving the planet, they are asked to return by the aliens. They oblige, and spend the remaining duration of the video performing a concert for the blue-skinned extraterrestrials with Zorotl joining them on stage, creating a friendship between the band and the creatures. These events possibly lead into the scenario in the music video for \"[[Move Your Body (Eiffel 65 song)|Move Your Body]]\".\n\nThe events in the video share no relation to the song's lyrical content apart from the fact that the aliens all have blue skin.\n\n==Cover versions and samplings==\nGerman singer [[Max Raabe]] and Palast Orchester covered the song for his 2001 studio album ''Super Hits''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palastorchester.de/index.php?id=13 |title=Max Raabe und Palast Orchester News, Bilder, Konzerte und Videos 2011 - Home |publisher=Palastorchester.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> A cover version was released on the 2006 [[Crazy Frog]] studio album ''[[Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits|More Crazy Hits]]''.

The green-screen footage was done in a short amount of time, and some of it was put into a computer generated 3D environment, while components of the band were also shot. La Sala said, \"We were very flexible but every person in the team had his own special skill who was more towards motion graphics, design and editing, others more skilled in architectural design and me and the CEO experts in animation.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe video was listed in [[NME]]'s \"50 Worst Music Videos Ever\".<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Worst Music Videos Ever |url=http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |website=[[NME]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203205813/http://www.nme.com/list/50-worst-music-videos-ever/253198/page/2 |archivedate=December 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Synopsis ===\nThe video takes place on Tukon4, where lead singer [[Jeffrey Jey]] is abducted by blue [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] Zorotl and Sayok6 during a concert.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.zorotl.com/zorotl_story7.php Jeffrey-kidnapped]</ref> The aliens then proceed to leave [[Earth]] with him. Group members [[Maurizio Lobina]] and [[Gabry Ponte]] chase after them in their own small [[spacecraft]], and eventually both ships arrive on the blue aliens' [[planet]] via a portal.\n\nIt is then shown that Jey was abducted to perform in a concert for the aliens, with him singing the same song he was about to sing when he was taken. He slowly realises that the crowd is composed entirely of strange blue beings, which are known as Tukonians,<ref name=\":0\" /> and becomes increasingly concerned.\n\nAfter fighting off a number of alien guards using [[martial arts]] and several energy-based, psionic abilities, including force lightning, Lobina and Ponte succeed in rescuing Jey. While leaving the planet, they are asked to return by the aliens. They oblige, and spend the remaining duration of the video performing a concert for the blue-skinned extraterrestrials with Zorotl joining them on stage, creating a friendship between the band and the creatures. These events possibly lead into the scenario in the music video for \"[[Move Your Body (Eiffel 65 song)|Move Your Body]]\".\n\nThe events in the video share no relation to the song's lyrical content apart from the fact that the aliens all have blue skin.\n\n==Cover versions and samplings==\nGerman singer [[Max Raabe]] and Palast Orchester covered the song for his 2001 studio album ''Super Hits''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.palastorchester.de/index.php?id=13 |title=Max Raabe und Palast Orchester News, Bilder, Konzerte und Videos 2011 - Home |publisher=Palastorchester.de |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> A cover version was released on the 2006 [[Crazy Frog]] studio album ''[[Crazy Frog Presents More Crazy Hits|More Crazy Hits]]''.
