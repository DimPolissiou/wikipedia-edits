The most successful of these was the attack on the army barracks in Bauchi. A spokesman for the group told BBC Hausa that the attack had been carried out, as a test of loyalty, by serving members of the military hoping to join the group. This charge was later refuted by an army spokesman who claimed: \"This is not a [[banana republic]]\". However, on 8 January 2012 the president would announce that Boko Haram had in reality infiltrated both the army and the police, as well as the executive, parliamentary and legislative branches of government. Boko Haram's spokesman also claimed responsibility for the killing outside his home in Maiduguri of the politician Abba Anas Ibn Umar Garbai, the younger brother of the Shehu of Borno, who was the second most prominent Muslim in the country after the [[Sultan of Sokoto]]. He added: \"We are doing what we are doing to fight injustice, if they stop their satanic ways of doing things and the injustices, we would stop what we are doing\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/06/boko-haram-claims-responsibility-for-bomb-blasts-in-bauchi-maiduguri/ |title=Boko Haram claims responsibility for bomb blasts in Bauchi, Maiduguri |work=Vanguard News |date=1 June 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |title=Boko Haram has infiltrated my govt \u2013Jonathan |work=Punch |author=Olalekan Adetayo |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=6 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808043607/http://www.punchng.com/news/boko-haram-has-infiltrated-my-govt-jonathan/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThis was one of several political and religious assassinations Boko Haram carried out that year, with the presumed intention of correcting injustices in the group's home state of Borno. Meanwhile, the trail of massacres continued relentlessly, apparently leading the country towards civil war. By the end of 2011, these conflicting strategies led observers to question the group's cohesion; comparisons were drawn with the diverse motivations of the militant factions of the oil-rich [[Niger Delta]].

Hundreds of police were dead and more than 60 police stations had been attacked by mid-2012.

In 2013, the group also kidnapped eight French citizens in northern Cameroon and obtained ransom payments for their release.<ref name=Bureau/>}}\n\nBoko Haram has often managed to evade the Nigerian army by retreating into the hills around the border with Cameroon, whose army is apparently unwilling to confront them. Nigeria, Chad and Niger had formed a Multinational Joint Task Force in 1998. In February 2012, Cameroon signed an agreement with Nigeria to establish a Joint Trans-Border Security Committee, which was inaugurated in November 2013, when Cameroon announced plans to conduct \"coordinated but separate\" border patrols in 2014. It convened again in July 2014 to further improve cooperation between the two countries.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/99174/with-cross-border-attacks-boko-haram-threat-widens |title=With cross-border attacks, Boko Haram threat widens |publisher=IRIN |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/30/us-nigeria-boko-haram-idUSKBN0EA1LE20140530 |title=Cameroon weakest link in fight against Boko Haram |work=Reuters |author=Tim Cocks |date=30 May 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201302060270.html |title=Nigeria: FG Inaugurates Nigeria-Cameroon Trans-Border Security Committee |publisher=allAfrica |date=5 February 2013 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/07/2nd-session-nigeriacameroon-trans-border-security-committee-meets-abuja/ |title=2nd session of Nigeria/Cameroon Trans-Border Security Committee meets in Abuja |newspaper=Daily Independent |date= |accessdate=August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809232618/http://dailyindependentnig.com/2014/07/2nd-session-nigeriacameroon-trans-border-security-committee-meets-abuja/ |archivedate=9 August 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://m.news24.com/nigeria/National/News/Nigeria-Cameroon-security-committee-meets-20140707 |title=Nigeria-Cameroon security committee meets |publisher=News 24 Nigeria |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2013, Amnesty International received 'credible' information that over 950 inmates had died in custody, mostly in detention centres in Maiduguri and [[Damaturu]], within the first half of the year.

7-->\n\nEfforts to cooperate in freeing the Chibok schoolgirls had faltered, largely due to mutual distrust; the infiltration of the military by Boko Haram meant that U.S. officials were wary of sharing raw intelligence data, and the Nigerian military had failed to supply information that might have aided U.S. drone flights in locating the kidnapped girls. The Nigerian government claims that Boko Haram is \"the West Africa branch of the world-wide Al-Qaida movement\" with connections to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]] in [[Somalia]] and AQIM in Mali. The Nigerian government denies having committed human rights abuses in the conflict, and therefore oppose U.S. restrictions on arms sales, which they see as being based on the U.S. mis-application of the [[Leahy Law]] due to concerns over [[human rights in Nigeria]]. The U.S. had supplied the Nigerian army with trucks and equipment but had blocked the sale of [[Cobra helicopter]]s. In November 2014 the U.S. State department again refused to supply Cobras, citing concerns over the Nigerian military's ability to maintain and use them without endangering civilians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nigeriaembassyusa.org/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&cntnt01articleid=357&cntnt01origid=15&cntnt01detailtemplate=nigeriadet&cntnt01returnid=108 |title=A Stable and Secure Nigeria: An Asset to America |publisher=Embassy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Washington, D.C. |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30006066 |title=Boko Haram crisis: Nigeria fury over U.S. arms refusal |work=BBC News|date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/world/with-schoolgirls-still-missing-fragile-us-nigeria-ties-falter.html |title=With Schoolgirls Taken by Boko Haram Still Missing, U.S.-Nigeria Ties Falter |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Eric Schmidt |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=cobra/>\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the U.S. embassy in Abuja announced that the U.S. had discontinued training a Nigerian battalion at the request of the Nigerian government.

The most successful of these was the attack on the army barracks in Bauchi. A spokesman for the group told BBC Hausa that the attack had been carried out, as a test of loyalty, by serving members of the military hoping to join the group. This charge was later refuted by an army spokesman who claimed: \"This is not a [[banana republic]]\". However, on 8 January 2012 the president would announce that Boko Haram had in reality infiltrated both the army and the police, as well as the executive, parliamentary and legislative branches of government. Boko Haram's spokesman also claimed responsibility for the killing outside his home in Maiduguri of the politician Abba Anas Ibn Umar Garbai, the younger brother of the Shehu of Borno, who was the second most prominent Muslim in the country after the [[Sultan of Sokoto]].

The [[NGO]]s were critical of both security forces and Boko Haram. HRW stated \"Boko Haram should immediately cease all attacks, and threats of attacks, that cause loss of life, injury, and destruction of property. The Nigerian government should take urgent measures to address the human rights abuses that have helped fuel the violent militancy\".

Media reported the JTF killed 20 to 45 civilians and razed 50 to 100 houses in the neighborhood. The JTF commander in Maiduguri denied the allegations. On November 2, witnesses claimed the JTF shot and killed up to 40 people during raids in Maiduguri. The army claimed it dismissed some officers from the military as a result of alleged abuses committed in Maiduguri, but there were no known formal prosecutions in Maiduguri by year's end.\n\nCredible reports also indicated&nbsp;... uniformed military personnel and [[paramilitary]] [[Nigerian Mobile Police|mobile police]] carried out summary executions, assaults, torture, and other abuses throughout Bauchi, Borno, [[Kano State|Kano]], [[Kaduna State|Kaduna]], [[Plateau State|Plateau]], and Yobe states&nbsp;... The national police, army, and other security forces committed [[extrajudicial killing]]s and used lethal and [[excessive force]] to apprehend criminals and suspects, as well as to disperse protesters. Authorities generally did not hold police accountable for the use of excessive or [[deadly force]] or for the deaths of persons [[Death in custody|in custody]]. Security forces generally operated with impunity in the illegal apprehension, detention, and sometimes [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial]] [[execution]] of criminal suspects. The reports of state or federal panels of inquiry investigating [[suspicious death]]s remained unpublished.\n\nThere were no new developments in the case of five police officers accused of executing Muhammad Yusuf in 2009 at a state police headquarters. In July 2011 authorities arraigned five police officers in the federal high court in Abuja for the [[murder]] of Yusuf. The court granted bail to four of the officers, while one remained in custody.\n\nPolice use of excessive force, including use of live ammunition, to disperse demonstrators resulted in numerous killings during the year. For example, although the January fuel subsidy demonstrations generally remained peaceful, security forces reportedly fired on protesters in various states across the country during those demonstrations, resulting in 10 to 15 deaths and an unknown number of wounded.\n\nDespite some improvements resulting from the closure of police checkpoints in many parts of the country, states with an increased security presence due to the activities of Boko Haram experienced a rise in violence and lethal force at police and military [[roadblock]]s.\n\nContinuing abductions of civilians by criminal groups occurred in the Niger Delta and [[Biafra|Southeast]]&nbsp;... Police and other security forces were often implicated in the kidnapping schemes.\n\nAlthough the constitution and law prohibit such practices and provide for punishment of such abuses, torture is not criminalized, and security service personnel, including police, military, and State Security Service (SSS) officers, regularly tortured, beat, and abused demonstrators, criminal suspects, detainees, and convicted prisoners.

They were linked to a number of kidnappings, often reportedly in association with the splinter group [[Ansaru]], drawing towards them a higher level of international attention.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Counterterrorism|U.S. Bureau of Counterterrorism]] provides the following summary of Boko Haram's 2013 foreign operations:\n{{quote|In February 2013, Boko Haram was responsible for kidnapping seven French tourists in the far north of Cameroon.

The announcement to the media, unaccompanied by any evidence of the reality of the agreement, was thought by analysts to have been a political ploy by the president to raise his popularity before his confirmation of his candidacy in the [[2015 Nigerian general election|2015 general election]]. Earlier in the year, the girls' plight had featured on \"#BringBackOurGirls\" political campaign posters in the streets of the capital, which the president denied knowledge of and soon took down after news of criticism surfaced.

Accounts from military insiders and data of Boko Haram incidences before, during and after the mobile phone blackout suggest that the shut down was 'successful' from a military- tactical point of view. However it angered citizens in the region (owing to negative social and economic consequences of the mobile shutdown) and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens and organizations developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the [[Sambisa Forest]].

The device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino headquarters]]. It was released on September 20, 2013, alongside its lower-end counterpart, the [[iPhone 5C]].<ref name=\"verge 5s unveil\" />\n\nThe iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the [[iPhone 5]], although the 5S received a new white/gold color scheme in addition to white/silver and space gray/black. The 5S has vastly upgraded internal hardware, however. It introduced the [[Apple A7|A7]] 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the [[Apple M7|M7]] \"motion co-processor\". A redesigned home button with [[Touch ID]], a [[fingerprint recognition]] system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[iTunes Store]] purchases, was also introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger [[aperture]] and a dual-LED flash optimized for different [[color temperature]]s. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.\n\nThe iPhone 5S originally shipped with [[iOS 7]], which introduced a revamped visual appearance among other new features. Designed by [[Jony Ive]], iOS 7 departed from [[skeuomorph]]ic elements used in previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were [[AirDrop]], an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and [[iTunes Radio]], an [[internet radio]] service.

The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and low end of the iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB (14.9 or 29.8 [[gibibyte|GiB]]) storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due to its additional gold finish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gottabemobile.com/2014/09/23/iphone-5c-the-iphone-that-isnt-worth-buying-for-0/|title=iPhone 5c: The iPhone That Isn't Worth Buying for $0|author=Xavier Lanier|work=Gotta Be Mobile}}</ref><ref name=\"readwrite1\">{{cite web|url=http://readwrite.com/2014/03/18/iphone-5c-price-8gb|title=The 8GB iPhone 5C Is Still Not The Budget iPhone You Are Looking For|date=March 18, 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2015\u201316, there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch [[iPhone 6]] and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5/5S design was regarded as \"long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general\" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it \"felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap\". The iPhone 5 was described as \"elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn\u2019t really look like anything else on the market at the time\". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus [[phablet]] models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the [[iPhone SE (2016)|first-generation iPhone SE]] which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.<ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/03/26/iphone-se-review-very-average-smartphone/#c8fbbb168fda|title=iPhone SE Reviews: Apple's Strange Case Of Jekyll And Hyde|date=26 March 2016|work=Forbes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"wired.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/iphone-se-smaller-phone/|title=With the iPhone SE, Apple Returns to a Masterpiece of Design|date=22 March 2016|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nThe iPhone 5S and 5C sold over nine million units in the first three days, setting a record for first weekend smartphone sales,<ref name=\"NYT iP5S sales 1\">{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/apple-sells-nine-million-new-iphones|title=Apple Sells Nine Million New iPhones|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Brian X.|last=Chen|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref> with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C.

The device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino headquarters]]. It was released on September 20, 2013, alongside its lower-end counterpart, the [[iPhone 5C]].<ref name=\"verge 5s unveil\" />\n\nThe iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the [[iPhone 5]], although the 5S received a new white/gold color scheme in addition to white/silver and space gray/black. The 5S has vastly upgraded internal hardware, however. It introduced the [[Apple A7|A7]] 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the [[Apple M7|M7]] \"motion co-processor\". A redesigned home button with [[Touch ID]], a [[fingerprint recognition]] system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[iTunes Store]] purchases, was also introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger [[aperture]] and a dual-LED flash optimized for different [[color temperature]]s. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.\n\nThe iPhone 5S originally shipped with [[iOS 7]], which introduced a revamped visual appearance among other new features. Designed by [[Jony Ive]], iOS 7 departed from [[skeuomorph]]ic elements used in previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were [[AirDrop]], an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and [[iTunes Radio]], an [[internet radio]] service. The 5S is the only iPhone to be supported through six major versions of iOS, from [[iOS 7]] to [[iOS 12]], and the second iOS device to support six major updates - the first being the [[iPad 2]] which supported iOS versions 4 to 9.\n\nReception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be the best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7.<ref name=\"atd review\"/> Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and small display of the iPhone 5,<ref name=\"scottstein\"/> and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system.<ref name=\"touch id hackers\"/> Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on the weekend of their release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones.<ref name=\"NYT iP5S sales 1\"/> The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.<ref name=\"iP5S best selling\"/>\n\nThe iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the larger [[iPhone 6]] in September 2014. On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a direct replacement with the announcement of the [[iPhone SE (2016)|first-generation iPhone SE]], which incorporated internal hardware similar to the [[iPhone 6S]] while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the 5S.<ref name=\"macworld-iphonese\">{{cite web|title=iPhone SE first look: Where 2012 meets 2016|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3046615/iphone-ipad/iphone-se-first-look-its-2012-all-over-again.html|website=MacWorld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| footer = The iPhone&nbsp;5S was announced during a keynote at [[4 Infinite Loop]] on September 10, 2013.\n| image1    = 4 Infinite Loop.jpg\n| alt1      =  The front of 4 Infinite Loop at the Apple Campus.\n| width1 = 232\n}}\n\nBefore its official unveiling, media speculation primarily centered on reports that the next iPhone would include a [[fingerprint scanner]]; including Apple's July 2012 acquisition of [[AuthenTec]], a developer of [[mobile security]] products,<ref name=\"verge authentec 1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/27/3193078/apple-purchases-authentec-356-million|title=Apple buys patent-rich security firm Authentec for $356 million|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> references to a fingerprint sensor on the home button in the beta release of [[iOS 7]]<ref name=\"verge ios7 finger\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/29/4568802/iphone-biometric-sensor-ios-7-beta-code|title=Apple references iPhone fingerprint sensor in latest iOS 7 beta|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> and leaked packaging for an iPhone 5S showing that the traditional home button now had a metallic \"ring\" around it.

Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch [[iPhone 6]] and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5/5S design was regarded as \"long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general\" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it \"felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap\". The iPhone 5 was described as \"elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn\u2019t really look like anything else on the market at the time\". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus [[phablet]] models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the [[iPhone SE (2016)|first-generation iPhone SE]] which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.<ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/03/26/iphone-se-review-very-average-smartphone/#c8fbbb168fda|title=iPhone SE Reviews: Apple's Strange Case Of Jekyll And Hyde|date=26 March 2016|work=Forbes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"wired.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/iphone-se-smaller-phone/|title=With the iPhone SE, Apple Returns to a Masterpiece of Design|date=22 March 2016|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nThe iPhone 5S and 5C sold over nine million units in the first three days, setting a record for first weekend smartphone sales,<ref name=\"NYT iP5S sales 1\">{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/apple-sells-nine-million-new-iphones|title=Apple Sells Nine Million New iPhones|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Brian X.|last=Chen|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref> with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C.

He is the only [[World Series MVP Award|World Series MVP]] ever to be selected from the losing team. He wore the uniform number 1 for the majority of his career (1958\u20131966).\n\n==Early life==\nRichardson was the middle child of Robert Sr. and Debbie Richardson of [[Sumter, South Carolina]].

Richardson played on a local [[YMCA]]/[[Salvation Army]] team at the age of ten. Later, he played on ballclubs sponsored by the local [[Kiwanis Club]] and [[American Legion]]. On the American Legion team, Richardson's coach was [[Fred Hutchinson]], who would later manage the [[Cincinnati Reds]] when Richardson faced them in the [[1961 World Series]]. Hutchinson and Richardson became American Legion champions in 1952, Richardson's junior year of high school. Hutchinson also coached Richardson at Edmunds High School.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n11 out of 16 [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams showed interest in Richardson, as well as the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Georgia Tech University]], which offered baseball scholarships. [[Mayo Smith]], manager of the [[Norfolk Tars]], a team in the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Piedmont League]] and an affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], scouted Richardson for New York, as did Bill Harris.

In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled [[Curt Flood]]'s double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage.

They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas (a 5\u20131 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221\u201392\u20131 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.  Richardson is considered the father of Gamecocks baseball, and is credited with having set them on their path to becoming one of the elite college baseball programs in the NCAA still today. In the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach for two seasons (1985\u201386) at [[Coastal Carolina University]] in [[Conway, South Carolina]], where he compiled a record of (61\u201338). After the 1986 season, he resigned as head coach at Coastal Carolina to replace [[Al Worthington]] as the baseball coach at [[Liberty University]]. \"I came here as athletic director under a different administration and [Chancellor] Ron [Eaglin] felt I should resign as athletic director and focus on baseball,\" Richardson explained the decision to resign, with Eaglin saying the two had disagreed on a budget for the next season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/10/sports/sports-people-richardson-moves-on.html?searchResultPosition=5|title=Sports People; Richardson Moves On|work=The New York Times|page=D-31|date=April 10, 1986|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Nixon tried to convince Richardson to run for the [[United States Congress]] in [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]].

His campaign was supported by former baseball players [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Ted Williams]], [[Bob Feller]], and [[Wilmer Mizell|Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell]] among others.

However, batting against Cardinal ace [[Bob Gibson]] with the Yankees trailing 7\u20135 in the seventh and deciding game of that World Series, he popped out to [[Dal Maxvill]] for the final out of the Series. Richardson also had the dubious distinction of committing errors that affected the outcome of two games in the Series. In the sixth inning of Game Four, he mishandled [[Dick Groat]]'s ground ball for a double play that would have ended the inning with no runs scoring; the error was followed one batter later by [[Ken Boyer]]'s grand slam\u2014the four runs the Cardinals needed in defeating the Yankees 4\u20133. In the fifth inning of Game Five, he bobbled [[Curt Flood]]'s double play ground ball, which also would have ended that inning without any damage. The Cardinals eventually scored twice in the inning, then won the game 5\u20132 on [[Tim McCarver]]'s 10th inning, three-run home run.\n\n===Legacy===\nRichardson racked up 1,432 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] in his career, with a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .266, 34 [[home run]]s and 390 [[run batted in|RBI]]s.

They advanced all the way to the national championship game against Texas (a 5\u20131 Longhorns victory). Richardson left South Carolina after the 1976 season, finishing his tenure with a 221\u201392\u20131 record and three NCAA Tournament appearances.  Richardson is considered the father of Gamecocks baseball, and is credited with having set them on their path to becoming one of the elite college baseball programs in the NCAA still today. In the 1980s, Richardson served as the baseball coach for two seasons (1985\u201386) at [[Coastal Carolina University]] in [[Conway, South Carolina]], where he compiled a record of (61\u201338). After the 1986 season, he resigned as head coach at Coastal Carolina to replace [[Al Worthington]] as the baseball coach at [[Liberty University]]. \"I came here as athletic director under a different administration and [Chancellor] Ron [Eaglin] felt I should resign as athletic director and focus on baseball,\" Richardson explained the decision to resign, with Eaglin saying the two had disagreed on a budget for the next season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/10/sports/sports-people-richardson-moves-on.html?searchResultPosition=5|title=Sports People; Richardson Moves On|work=The New York Times|page=D-31|date=April 10, 1986|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Nixon tried to convince Richardson to run for the [[United States Congress]] in [[South Carolina's 5th congressional district]].

Holland was aided by the strength of [[Jimmy Carter]]'s winning campaign in South Carolina to hold off Richardson by a tally of 66,073 (51.4%) to 62,095 (48.3%). His campaign was supported by former baseball players [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Ted Williams]], [[Bob Feller]], and [[Wilmer Mizell|Wilmer \"Vinegar Bend\" Mizell]] among others.  Richardson's old friend, Yankee shortstop [[Tony Kubek]], declined to campaign for him because Kubek was a Democrat.<ref>{{cite book |title=October 1964 |last= Halberstam |first=David |authorlink= |year=1995 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |location= |isbn= 0-449-98367-6 |pages=366\u2013367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZ7sUkp5eBcC&lpg=PP1&dq=october%201964&pg=PA366#v=onepage&q&f=false }}</ref>\n\nRichardson is a [[born-again Christian]].

The first land titles in town were issued in 1711. Original construction by early residents of the town occurred between 1715 and 1719. Early settlement pre-dating the Hatboro name occurred in the Crooked Billet area east of York Road, between Moreland Avenue and Byberry Road.\n\nEarly resident John Dawson entertained guests at the Crooked Billet Inn as well as manufacturing a line of hats. When the post office opened in 1809 the town was officially called Hatborough. U.S. [[Postmaster General]] [[John Wanamaker]] officially changed the name of the town in the 1880s to Hatboro.\n\nThe [[Union Library Company]] of Hatboro, the third library company to be founded in Pennsylvania, was formed in 1755. This building still stands on its original site today and still serves as a library. [[George Washington]] and his troops passed through the town numerous times during 1777 in pursuit of British Troops.  The [[Battle of Crooked Billet]] was fought in 1778.\n\nThe year 1811 saw the construction of the [[Loller Academy]], the first bank was built in 1873, and railroad service connected to Hatboro in 1874.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hatboro |publisher= [[Arcadia Publishing]] |year= 2000 |isbn= 0-7385-0342-8 }}</ref>\n\nThe Loller Academy, [[Roberts and Mander Stove Company Buildings]], and Union Library Company are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nHatboro is located at {{Coord|40|10|39|N|75|6|16|W|type:city}} (40.177635, -75.104424).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.4|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\nThe Borough of Hatboro is a small municipality that is surrounded by [[Upper Moreland Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Moreland Township]] in Montgomery County to the west, south, and east; and [[Warminster Township, Pennsylvania|Warminster Township]] in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]] to the north.

The first land titles in town were issued in 1711. Original construction by early residents of the town occurred between 1715 and 1719. Early settlement pre-dating the Hatboro name occurred in the Crooked Billet area east of York Road, between Moreland Avenue and Byberry Road.\n\nEarly resident John Dawson entertained guests at the Crooked Billet Inn as well as manufacturing a line of hats. When the post office opened in 1809 the town was officially called Hatborough. U.S. [[Postmaster General]] [[John Wanamaker]] officially changed the name of the town in the 1880s to Hatboro.\n\nThe [[Union Library Company]] of Hatboro, the third library company to be founded in Pennsylvania, was formed in 1755. This building still stands on its original site today and still serves as a library. [[George Washington]] and his troops passed through the town numerous times during 1777 in pursuit of British Troops.  The [[Battle of Crooked Billet]] was fought in 1778.\n\nThe year 1811 saw the construction of the [[Loller Academy]], the first bank was built in 1873, and railroad service connected to Hatboro in 1874.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hatboro |publisher= [[Arcadia Publishing]] |year= 2000 |isbn= 0-7385-0342-8 }}</ref>\n\nThe Loller Academy, [[Roberts and Mander Stove Company Buildings]], and Union Library Company are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nHatboro is located at {{Coord|40|10|39|N|75|6|16|W|type:city}} (40.177635, -75.104424).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the borough has a total area of {{convert|1.4|sqmi|km2}}, all land.\n\nThe Borough of Hatboro is a small municipality that is surrounded by [[Upper Moreland Township, Pennsylvania|Upper Moreland Township]] in Montgomery County to the west, south, and east; and [[Warminster Township, Pennsylvania|Warminster Township]] in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]] to the north.

Composed with lyrics in the [[Bengali language]], Bengali music spans a wide variety of styles.\n\nThe [[Bengal region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] is currently split between [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest music in Bengal was influenced by [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] chants, and evolved under the influence of [[Vaishnav]] poetry such as the 13th-century ''[[Gitagovindam]]'' by [[Jayadeva]], whose work continues to be sung in many eastern [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temples. The Middle Ages saw a mixture of Hindu and Islamic trends when the musical tradition was formalized under the patronage of [[Sultan and Nawab]]s and the powerful landlords ''[[Baro Bhuiyans|baro bhuiyans]]''.\n\nMuch of the early canon is devotional, as in the Hindu devotional songs of [[Ramprasad Sen]] a [[bhakti|bhakta]] who captures the Bengali ethos in his poetic, rustic, and ecstatic vision of the Hindu goddess of time and destruction in her motherly incarnation, Ma [[Kali]]. Another writer of the time was Vidyapati. Notable in this devotional poetry is an earthiness that does not distinguish between love in its carnal and devotional forms; some see connections between this and [[Tantra]], which originated sometime in the middle of the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]].\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Bishnupur Gharana===\n{{Main|Bishnupur Gharana}}\n\nThe Bishnupur Gharana is the sole Classical (Drupad) gharana of Bengal. It originated in Bishnupur, Bankura by the court musicians of the Malla Kings. Bahadur Khan of Delhi, a descendant of the Tansen, was the father of Bishnupur Gharana. Bahadur Khan was brought to Bishnupur by Malla King Raghunath Singha II.\n\n===Baul===\n{{Main|Baul}}\n\nThe [[Baul]]s (meaning \"divinely inspired insanity\") are a group of mystic minstrels (Muslim Sufis and Hindu Baishnos) from the Bengal region, who sang primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are thought to have been influenced greatly by the Hindu tantric sect of the [[Kartabhaja]]s as well as by Muslim [[Sufi]] philosophers. Bauls traveled and sang in search of the internal ideal, ''[[Moner Manush]]'' (''Man of the Heart'' or the ''inner being''), and described \"superfluous\" differences between religions. [[Lalon Fakir]], alternatively known as Lalon Shah, who lived in the 19th century in and around [[Kushtia]], is considered to be the greatest of all bauls.\n\n===Rabindra Sangeet===\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n\nThe leading proponent of Bengali music is [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (known in Bengali as ''Robi Thakur'' and ''Gurudeb'', the latter meaning \"Respected Teacher\" (in the Bengal of that time, the suffix 'deb' was an honorific, ascribed to people who enjoyed immense respect, but this title was primarily used by his students at Santiniketan, though many others did use the address/<ref>{{cite book|last1=Devi|first1=Maitreyi|authorlink=Maitreyi Devi|title=Na Hanyate|date=May 1983|publisher=Upama Sengupta; Prima Publications|location=Kolkata|pages=1, 23, 59|edition=First Edition, Seventh Reprint}}</ref>) Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit.<ref name=\"DasguptaGuha2013\">{{cite book|author1=Sanjukta Dasgupta|author2=Chinmoy Guha|title=Tagore-At Home in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zfX4llLjyUC|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1084-2|page=254}}</ref> His songs are known as ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' (\"Tagore Song\"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which\u2014poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike\u2014were lyricised. Influenced by the ''[[thumri]]'' style of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta |Robinson|1997|p=94}} They emulated the tonal colour of classical ''[[raga]]s'' to varying extents.

It was written \u2014 ironically \u2014 to protest the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]] along communal lines: cutting off the Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath.

Composed with lyrics in the [[Bengali language]], Bengali music spans a wide variety of styles.\n\nThe [[Bengal region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] is currently split between [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest music in Bengal was influenced by [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] chants, and evolved under the influence of [[Vaishnav]] poetry such as the 13th-century ''[[Gitagovindam]]'' by [[Jayadeva]], whose work continues to be sung in many eastern [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temples. The Middle Ages saw a mixture of Hindu and Islamic trends when the musical tradition was formalized under the patronage of [[Sultan and Nawab]]s and the powerful landlords ''[[Baro Bhuiyans|baro bhuiyans]]''.\n\nMuch of the early canon is devotional, as in the Hindu devotional songs of [[Ramprasad Sen]] a [[bhakti|bhakta]] who captures the Bengali ethos in his poetic, rustic, and ecstatic vision of the Hindu goddess of time and destruction in her motherly incarnation, Ma [[Kali]]. Another writer of the time was Vidyapati. Notable in this devotional poetry is an earthiness that does not distinguish between love in its carnal and devotional forms; some see connections between this and [[Tantra]], which originated sometime in the middle of the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]].\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Bishnupur Gharana===\n{{Main|Bishnupur Gharana}}\n\nThe Bishnupur Gharana is the sole Classical (Drupad) gharana of Bengal. It originated in Bishnupur, Bankura by the court musicians of the Malla Kings. Bahadur Khan of Delhi, a descendant of the Tansen, was the father of Bishnupur Gharana. Bahadur Khan was brought to Bishnupur by Malla King Raghunath Singha II.\n\n===Baul===\n{{Main|Baul}}\n\nThe [[Baul]]s (meaning \"divinely inspired insanity\") are a group of mystic minstrels (Muslim Sufis and Hindu Baishnos) from the Bengal region, who sang primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are thought to have been influenced greatly by the Hindu tantric sect of the [[Kartabhaja]]s as well as by Muslim [[Sufi]] philosophers. Bauls traveled and sang in search of the internal ideal, ''[[Moner Manush]]'' (''Man of the Heart'' or the ''inner being''), and described \"superfluous\" differences between religions. [[Lalon Fakir]], alternatively known as Lalon Shah, who lived in the 19th century in and around [[Kushtia]], is considered to be the greatest of all bauls.\n\n===Rabindra Sangeet===\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n\nThe leading proponent of Bengali music is [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (known in Bengali as ''Robi Thakur'' and ''Gurudeb'', the latter meaning \"Respected Teacher\" (in the Bengal of that time, the suffix 'deb' was an honorific, ascribed to people who enjoyed immense respect, but this title was primarily used by his students at Santiniketan, though many others did use the address/<ref>{{cite book|last1=Devi|first1=Maitreyi|authorlink=Maitreyi Devi|title=Na Hanyate|date=May 1983|publisher=Upama Sengupta; Prima Publications|location=Kolkata|pages=1, 23, 59|edition=First Edition, Seventh Reprint}}</ref>) Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit.<ref name=\"DasguptaGuha2013\">{{cite book|author1=Sanjukta Dasgupta|author2=Chinmoy Guha|title=Tagore-At Home in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zfX4llLjyUC|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1084-2|page=254}}</ref> His songs are known as ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' (\"Tagore Song\"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which\u2014poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike\u2014were lyricised.

Abortion related laws were drafted by the legislature by the end of the 1900s.\u00a0 These laws would be addressed in court during the 1800s as they related to application in prosecutions of women for having abortions. During the 1940s, hospitals created committees to approve abortion requests with the goal of trying to reduce the number of abortions performed at them.\n\nThe number of abortion clinics in the state has been on the decline in recent years, going from 100 in 1982 to 88 in 1992 to 41 in 2014.\u00a0State funding through Medicaid was available for poor women needing abortions, with 10,277 state funded abortions in 2010.\u00a0 There were 24,454 legal abortions performed in 2014,\u00a0going up to 48,110 abortions in New Jersey in 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/state-facts-about-abortion-new-jersey|title=State Facts About Abortion: New Jersey|date=2016-01-26|website=Guttmacher Institute|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>.

Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Katie|date=20 Dec 2019|title=Why We Should Stop Using the Term \"Elective Abortion\"|url=https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/why-we-should-stop-using-term-elective-abortion/2018-12|journal=AMA Journal of Ethics|doi=10.1001/amajethics.2018.1175|accessdate=17 May 2019|pmid=30585581|volume=20|pages=E1175-1180|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAnti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\",<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chamberlain|first1=Pam|last2=Hardisty|first2=Jean|year=2007|title=The Importance of the Political 'Framing' of Abortion|url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v14n1/ReproPatriarch-07.html|journal=The Public Eye Magazine|volume=14|issue=1}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/weekinreview/05greenhouse.html?scp=1&sq=infanticide \"The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion\".] ''New York Times.''

Wade'':<blockquote>(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgement of the pregnant woman's attending physician. (b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health. (c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgement, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.</blockquote>Likewise, ''Black's Law Dictionary'' defines abortion as \"knowing destruction\" or \"intentional expulsion or removal\".</ref> Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K. Rowling]]|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The [[Peoples Improv Theater]]: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]|image=PuffsPlay.jpg}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on December 3, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a five night run.

The set and props were designed by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Michelle Kelleher, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keefe and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra.

The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J.

He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on December 3, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a five night run. Co-produced by Stephen Stout and Colin Waitt, the production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Costumes were designed by Madeleine Bundy. The set and props were designed by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Michelle Kelleher, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keefe and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.
