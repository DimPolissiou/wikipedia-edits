The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in [[short films]] produced by [[Paramount Pictures]] in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in ''[[Sweet Adeline (musical)|Sweet Adeline]]'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, [[Fox Film]] signed him to a Hollywood contract. \n\nHis screen debut in the 1931 film ''[[Bad Girl (1931 film)|Bad Girl]]'' made him an overnight box-office star and he was cast as the lead in a succession of romantic drama and comedy films. In 1934, he co-starred with [[Shirley Temple]] in her first three films. In 1935, at the height of his popularity, he broke his studio contract two years before it expired and became a free agent. With musicals on the wane in the late 1930s, he was cast in a series of [[B movie]]s and began struggling with alcoholism in his personal life. In 1945, having not worked in film for five years, he was selected by director [[Elia Kazan]] for the role of Johnny Nolan, the dreamy alcoholic father in ''[[A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945 film)|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn]]'' (1945), which earned him the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. \n\nThe Oscar did not advance his film career, however, and while he still found roles in Broadway productions, in 1949 he became a [[character actor]] on television. He had a regular role in the hit sitcom ''[[It's a Great Life (TV series)|It's a Great Life]]''  from 1954 to 1956, and guest-starred in dozens of episodes of popular television series from the 1950s through mid-1960s.

His father's name was Mr. Veera Vijaya Suckev.\n\n==Military career==\nCaptain Eric Tucker was one of the most determined soldiers of the Indian Army. He always took actions with clear and organized thoughts. He sacrificed his life for the nation at a very young age.\n\n==The Naga Insurgency==\nNaga Insurgency was India's first and oldest rebellion since independence. The guerrilla gangs were ferocious and battle trained. In 1956 Captain Eric James Tucker was commanding \u2018B\u2019 Company of the 2nd battalion of Maratha Light Infantry operating in the Naga Hills. He was given the task of opening the lines of communication from Chakabama to Phek, a distance of 42 miles and further to  Meluri, a distance of 20 miles. He successfully achieved his objective and reached to Meluri on 15 October 1956 after a successful encounter with a large number of hostile, armed with automatics and rifles, guerillas. Undeterred by the injuries sustained by him, he had kept fighting his way with great courage, inflicting many casualties on the enemies. Subsequently, Captain Tucker carried many dangerous and arduous tasks way beyond his duty relentless against several warnings from the rebels that they would kill him. On 1 Apr 1957, while operating in Naga Hills, he received information about rebel concentration at Chipokatami. He immediately rushed to the location, moving through dark jungles, took them by surprise and captured four rebels along with weapons. On 18 July 1957, he exercised a large maneuver, inflicted intense casualties and captured a number of prisoners. Similar to these tasks again on 2 August 1957, while proceeding from Khuzami to Kivikhu with a platoon, he was trapped in the thick undergrowth of the jungle by militants who had collected advance information about his movement. Captain Eric James Tucker got hit by the militants on the face and legs but he stood his ground, fought and engaged the militants till the last round. Finally, he charged at the militants just before being hit by an automatic burst of fire that killed him on the spot.\n\n==Ashoka Chakra Awardee==\nCaptain Eric James led his men with an extremely high order of personal courage and determination amidst hostile concentration. He was a great inspiration for his comrades and his devotion to duty and leadership are exemplary.For his gallantry and sacrifice, he was posthumously awarded Ashoka Chakra.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:1927 births]]\n[[Category:1957 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n| honorific_prefix = [[Captain]]\n| name          = Eric James Tucker\n| honorific_suffix = [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)| AC]]\n| image         = \n| image_size    = \n| caption       = \n| birth_date    = {{birth date |1927|10|21}}\n| death_date    = {{death date and age |1957|08|02|1927|10|21}}\n| birth_place   = \n| death_place   = \n| allegiance    = {{Flag|India}}\n| branch        = {{Army|India}}\n| rank          = [[File:Captain of the Indian Army.svg|25px]] [[Captain]]\n| servicenumber = IC-5034\n| unit          = [[Maratha Light Infantry| 2 Maratha LI]]\n| awards        = [[File:Ashoka Chakra ribbon.svg|30px]] [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)| Ashoka Chakra]]\n}}\n[[Captain]] Eric James Tucker, [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|AC]] (21 Oct 1927 - 2 Aug 1957) was an [[Indian Army]] officer who was Posthumously awarded the highest peace time gallantry award, [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashok Chakra]] for an act of Gallantry in [[Nagaland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.honourpoint.in/profile/capt-eric-james-tucker-ac/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gallantryawards.gov.in/Awardee/eric-james-tucker|title=Eric James Tucker Ashoka Chakra Recipient|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCapt Eric James Tucker was born on 21 Oct 1927 and was commissioned in the Maratha Light Infantry on 13 July 1947.
