{"title_page": "Proto-Celtic language", "text_new": "{{short description|Ancestor of the Celtic languages}}\n{{Indo-European topics}}\n\nThe '''Proto-Celtic language''', also called '''Common Celtic''', is the partially [[reconstructed language|reconstructed ancestor language]] of all the known [[Celtic languages]]. Its [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], or vocabulary, can be confidently reconstructed on the basis of the [[comparative method]] of [[historical linguistics]], in the same manner as [[Proto-Indo-European]] or PIE, the ancient language which has been most thoroughly re-constructed. Proto-Celtic is a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European language and is itself the ancestor of the [[Celtic languages]] which are members of the modern [[Indo-European language family]], the most commonly spoken language family. Modern Celtic languages share common features with [[Italic languages]] that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient [[Italo-Celtic]] branch. The duration of the cultures speaking Proto-Celtic was relatively brief compared to PIE\u2019s 2,000 years. The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age [[Urnfield culture]] of [[Central Europe]] c.1300 BCE.<ref name=ChadCorc>{{cite book|last=Chadwick with Corcoran|first=Nora with J.X.W.P.|title=The Celts|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=28\u201333}}</ref> By the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] of around 800 BC these people had become fully [[Celts|Celtic]].<ref name=ChadCorc/>\n\nThe reconstruction of Proto-Celtic is currently being undertaken, by necessity relying on later iterations of Celtic languages. Although [[Continental Celtic]] presents much substantiation for Proto-Celtic\u2019s [[phonology]], and some for its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], recorded material is too scanty to allow a secure reconstruction of [[syntax]], although some complete sentences are recorded in the Continental [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]].  Therefore, the primary sources for reconstruction come from the [[Insular Celtic languages]] with the oldest [[literature]] found in [[Old Irish]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/art/Celtic-literature#ref42288 Celtic literature] at britannica.com, accessed 7 February 2018</ref> and [[Middle Welsh]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rhys|first1=John|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=E.

So the Proto-Indo-European [[voiced consonant|voiced]] aspirated stops *{{PIE|''b\u02b0''}}, *{{PIE|''d\u02b0''}}, *{{PIE|''g\u02b0/\u01f5\u02b0''}} merged with *{{PIE|''b''}}, *{{PIE|''d''}}, *{{PIE|''g/\u01f5''}}. The voiced aspirate [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0''}} did not merge with *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}}, though: plain *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}} became *{{PIE|''b''}} in Proto-Celtic, while aspirated *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0''}} became *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}}. Thus, PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7en-''}} 'woman' became Old Irish ''ben'' and Old Welsh ''ben'', but PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0n\u0325-''}} 'to kill, to wound' became Old Irish ''gonaid'' and Welsh ''gwanu''.\n\nProto-Indo-European *{{PIE|''p''}} was lost in Proto-Celtic, apparently going through the stages *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} (as in the table above) and *{{PIE|''h''}} (perhaps attested by the [[toponym]] [[Hercynian Forest|Hercynia]] if this is of Celtic origin) before being lost completely word-initially and between vowels. Adjacent to consonants, Proto-Celtic *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} underwent different changes: the [[consonant cluster|clusters]] *{{PIE|''\u0278s''}} and *{{PIE|''\u0278t''}} became *{{PIE|''xs''}} and *{{PIE|''xt''}} respectively already in Proto-Celtic. PIE *{{PIE|''sp-''}} became Old Irish ''s'' (lenited ''f-'', exactly as for PIE *{{PIE|''sw-''}}) and Brythonic ''f''; while {{harvnb|Schrijver|1995|p=348}} argues there was an intermediate stage *{{PIE|''s\u0278-''}} (in which *{{PIE|\u0278}} remained an independent phoneme until after Proto-Insular Celtic had diverged into Goidelic and Brythonic), {{harvnb|McCone|1996|pp=44\u201345}} finds it more economical to believe that *{{PIE|''sp-''}} remained unchanged in PC, that is, the change *{{PIE|''p''}} to *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} did not happen when *{{PIE|''s''}} preceded. (Similarly, [[Grimm's law]] did not apply to ''*p, t, k'' after *''s'' in [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]], and later the same exception occurred again in the [[High German consonant shift]].)\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Consequently, one finds Gaulish ''petuar[ios]'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pedwar'' \"four\", compared to [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''cethair'' and [[Latin]] ''quattuor''. Insofar as this new {{IPA|/p/}} fills the space in the phoneme inventory which was lost by the disappearance of the equivalent stop in PIE, we may think of this as a [[chain shift]].\n\nThe terms '''P-Celtic''' and '''Q-Celtic''' are useful when we wish to group the Celtic languages according to the way they handle this one phoneme.  However a simple division into P- and Q-Celtic may be untenable, as it does not do justice to the evidence of the ancient [[Continental Celtic languages]]. The large number of unusual shared innovations among the [[Insular Celtic languages]] are often also presented as evidence against a P-Celtic ''vs'' Q-Celtic division, but they may instead reflect a common [[substratum]] influence from the pre-Celtic languages of Britain and Ireland,[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5469/1158], or simply continuing contact between the insular languages; in either case they would be irrelevant to Celtic language classification in the genetic sense.\n\nQ-Celtic languages may also have {{IPA|/p/}} in loan words, though in early borrowings from Welsh into Primitive Irish {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} was used by sound substitution due to a lack of a {{IPA|/p/}} phoneme at the time:\n*Latin ''Patricius'' \"[[Saint Patrick]]\"' > Welsh > Primitive Irish {{sm|Qatrikias}} > Old Irish ''Cothrige'', later [[Saint Patrick|''P\u00e1draig'']];\n*Latin ''[[presbyter]]'' \"priest\" > early form of word seen in [[Old Welsh]] ''premter primter'' > Primitive Irish {{sm|qrimitir}} > Old Irish ''cruimther''.\nGaelic ''p\u00f3g'' \"kiss\" was a later borrowing (from the second word of the Latin phrase ''osculum pacis'' \"kiss of peace\") at a stage where ''p'' was borrowed directly as ''p'', without substituting ''c''.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe Proto-Celtic vowel system is highly comparable to that reconstructed for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] by [[Antoine Meillet]].

Proto-Celtic is believed to have had nouns in three [[grammatical gender|genders]], three [[grammatical number|numbers]] and five to eight cases. The genders were the normal masculine, feminine and neuter, the three numbers were singular, plural and dual. The number of cases is a subject of contention:<ref>{{cite book |author=Pedersen, Holger |title=Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen, 2.

These cases were [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[ablative]], [[locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].\n\nNouns fall into nine or so declensions, depending on the stem.

Gaulish ''delgu'' \"I hold\", Old Irish ''tongu'' \"I swear\"\n* [[Imperative mood|imperative]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Celtiberian ''usabituz'', Gaulish ''appisetu''\n* [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''buetid'' \"may he be\", Celtiberian ''asekati''\nand four tenses:\n* [[Present tense|present]] \u2014 seen in e.g. Gaulish ''uedi\u00edu-mi'' \"I pray\", Celtiberian ''zizonti'' \"they sow\"\n* [[preterite]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''sioxti'', Lepontic ''<small>K</small>ari<small>T</small>e''\n* [[imperfect]] \u2014 perhaps in Celtiberian ''kombalkez'', ''atibion''\n* [[Future tense|future]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''bissiet'', Old Irish ''bieid'' \"he shall be\"\nA probable [[optative mood]] also features in Gaulish (''tixsintor'') and an [[infinitive]] (with a characteristic ending ''-unei'') in Celtiberian.<ref>Stefan Schumacher, ''Die keltischen Prim\u00e4rverben: Ein vergleichendes, etymologisches und morphologisches Lexikon'' (Innsbruck: Institut f\u00fcr Sprachen und Literaturen der Universit\u00e4t, 2004).</ref><ref>Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La langue gauloise: Description linguistique, commentaire d'inscriptions choisies'' (Paris: Errance, revised ed. 2003).</ref>\n\nVerbs were formed by adding [[suffix]]es to a [[verb]]al [[Word stem|stem]].

Its [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], or vocabulary, can be confidently reconstructed on the basis of the [[comparative method]] of [[historical linguistics]], in the same manner as [[Proto-Indo-European]] or PIE, the ancient language which has been most thoroughly re-constructed. Proto-Celtic is a descendant of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] and is itself the ancestor of the [[Celtic languages]] which are members of the modern [[Indo-European language family]], the most commonly spoken language family. Modern Celtic languages share common features with [[Italic languages]] that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient [[Italo-Celtic]] branch. The duration of the cultures speaking Proto-Celtic was relatively brief compared to PIE\u2019s 2,000 years. The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age [[Urnfield culture]] of [[Central Europe]] c.1300 BCE.<ref name=ChadCorc>{{cite book|last=Chadwick with Corcoran|first=Nora with J.X.W.P.|title=The Celts|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=28\u201333}}</ref> By the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] of around 800 BC these people had become fully [[Celts|Celtic]].<ref name=ChadCorc/>\n\nThe reconstruction of Proto-Celtic is currently being undertaken, by necessity relying on later iterations of Celtic languages. Although [[Continental Celtic]] presents much substantiation for Proto-Celtic\u2019s [[phonology]], and some for its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], recorded material is too scanty to allow a secure reconstruction of [[syntax]], although some complete sentences are recorded in the Continental [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]].

So the Proto-Indo-European [[voiced consonant|voiced]] aspirated stops *{{PIE|''b\u02b0''}}, *{{PIE|''d\u02b0''}}, *{{PIE|''g\u02b0/\u01f5\u02b0''}} merged with *{{PIE|''b''}}, *{{PIE|''d''}}, *{{PIE|''g/\u01f5''}}. The voiced aspirate [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0''}} did not merge with *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}}, though: plain *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}} became *{{PIE|''b''}} in Proto-Celtic, while aspirated *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0''}} became *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}}. Thus, PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7en-''}} 'woman' became Old Irish ''ben'' and Old Welsh ''ben'', but PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0n\u0325-''}} 'to kill, to wound' became Old Irish ''gonaid'' and Welsh ''gwanu''.\n\nProto-Indo-European *{{PIE|''p''}} was lost in Proto-Celtic, apparently going through the stages *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} (as in the table above) and *{{PIE|''h''}} (perhaps attested by the [[toponym]] [[Hercynian Forest|Hercynia]] if this is of Celtic origin) before being lost completely word-initially and between vowels. Adjacent to consonants, Proto-Celtic *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} underwent different changes: the [[consonant cluster|clusters]] *{{PIE|''\u0278s''}} and *{{PIE|''\u0278t''}} became *{{PIE|''xs''}} and *{{PIE|''xt''}} respectively already in Proto-Celtic. PIE *{{PIE|''sp-''}} became Old Irish ''s'' (lenited ''f-'', exactly as for PIE *{{PIE|''sw-''}}) and Brythonic ''f''; while {{harvnb|Schrijver|1995|p=348}} argues there was an intermediate stage *{{PIE|''s\u0278-''}} (in which *{{PIE|\u0278}} remained an independent phoneme until after Proto-Insular Celtic had diverged into Goidelic and Brythonic), {{harvnb|McCone|1996|pp=44\u201345}} finds it more economical to believe that *{{PIE|''sp-''}} remained unchanged in PC, that is, the change *{{PIE|''p''}} to *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} did not happen when *{{PIE|''s''}} preceded. (Similarly, [[Grimm's law]] did not apply to ''*p, t, k'' after *''s'' in [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]], and later the same exception occurred again in the [[High German consonant shift]].)\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Consequently, one finds Gaulish ''petuar[ios]'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pedwar'' \"four\", compared to [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''cethair'' and [[Latin]] ''quattuor''. Insofar as this new {{IPA|/p/}} fills the space in the phoneme inventory which was lost by the disappearance of the equivalent stop in PIE, we may think of this as a [[chain shift]].\n\nThe terms '''P-Celtic''' and '''Q-Celtic''' are useful when we wish to group the Celtic languages according to the way they handle this one phoneme.  However a simple division into P- and Q-Celtic may be untenable, as it does not do justice to the evidence of the ancient [[Continental Celtic languages]]. The large number of unusual shared innovations among the [[Insular Celtic languages]] are often also presented as evidence against a P-Celtic ''vs'' Q-Celtic division, but they may instead reflect a common [[substratum]] influence from the pre-Celtic languages of Britain and Ireland,[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5469/1158], or simply continuing contact between the insular languages; in either case they would be irrelevant to Celtic language classification in the genetic sense.\n\nQ-Celtic languages may also have {{IPA|/p/}} in loan words, though in early borrowings from Welsh into Primitive Irish {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} was used by sound substitution due to a lack of a {{IPA|/p/}} phoneme at the time:\n*Latin ''Patricius'' \"[[Saint Patrick]]\"' > Welsh > Primitive Irish {{sm|Qatrikias}} > Old Irish ''Cothrige'', later [[Saint Patrick|''P\u00e1draig'']];\n*Latin ''[[presbyter]]'' \"priest\" > early form of word seen in [[Old Welsh]] ''premter primter'' > Primitive Irish {{sm|qrimitir}} > Old Irish ''cruimther''.\nGaelic ''p\u00f3g'' \"kiss\" was a later borrowing (from the second word of the Latin phrase ''osculum pacis'' \"kiss of peace\") at a stage where ''p'' was borrowed directly as ''p'', without substituting ''c''.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe Proto-Celtic vowel system is highly comparable to that reconstructed for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] by [[Antoine Meillet]]. The following [[monophthong]]s have been reconstructed:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Proto-Celtic is believed to have had nouns in three [[grammatical gender|genders]], three [[grammatical number|numbers]] and five to eight cases. The genders were the normal masculine, feminine and neuter, the three numbers were singular, plural and dual. The number of cases is a subject of contention:<ref>{{cite book |author=Pedersen, Holger |title=Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen, 2. Band, Bedeutungslehre (Wortlehre) |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |location=G\u00f6ttingen |year=1913 |isbn=978-3-525-26119-4 }}</ref> while Old Irish may have only five, the evidence from Continental Celtic is considered{{by whom|date=April 2011}} rather unambiguous despite appeals to archaic retentions or [[morphological leveling]]. These cases were [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[ablative]], [[locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].\n\nNouns fall into nine or so declensions, depending on the stem. There are *''o''-stems, *''\u0101''-stems, *''i''-stems, *''u''-stems, dental stems, velar stems, nasal stems, *''r''-stems and *''s''-stems.\n\n====*''o''-stem nouns====\n*''makk\u02b7os'' 'son' (masculine) ([[Old Irish]] ''mac'' ~ [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] ''mab'')\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is the name by which he was known to his Egyptian subjects, and the name used uniformly in Egyptian and Arabic language historical scholarship. However, given his original status as a commander in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman military]], his first name is often rendered as {{lang|ota-Latn|Mehmed}}, which is the standard rendition of that name in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], or {{lang|sq|Mehmet}} in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. Current English-language historical scholarship is divided as to which is preferable, with the majority opinion favoring the former. Typically, historians accentuating the Egyptian character of his rule opt for {{lang|ar-Latn|Muhammad}}, whilst those accentuating the Ottoman character opt for {{lang|ota-Latn|Mehmed}} or {{lang|sq|Mehmet}}.

At the height of his rule, he controlled [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and [[Arabia|parts of Arabia]] and the entire [[Levant]]. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt.\n\nMuhammad Ali was born in [[Kavala]], [[Macedonia (region)|Ottoman Macedonia]] to a family of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origins. He was a military commander in an Albanian Ottoman force sent to recover Egypt from a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French occupation]] under [[Napoleon]]. Following Napoleon's withdrawal, Muhammad Ali rose to power through a series of political maneuvers, and in 1805 he was named ''[[W\u0101li]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt and gained the rank of [[Pasha]].\n\nAs ''W\u0101li'', Muhammad Ali attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the [[Mamluk]]s, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.\n\nMilitarily, Muhammad Ali [[Wahhabi War|recaptured the Arabian territories]] for the sultan, and [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquered Sudan]] on his own accord. His attempt at suppressing the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] failed decisively, however, following an intervention by the European powers at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]]. In 1831, Muhammad Ali [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|waged war against the sultan]], capturing Syria, crossing into Anatolia and directly threatening [[Constantinople]] but Western Powers threatened him to retreat. He did the same invasion against the Ottoman Empire in 1840 , when he defeated again the Ottomans and had a free way to capture Istanbul. Faced with another European intervention, he accepted a brokered peace in 1842 and withdrew from the Levant; in return, he and his descendants were granted hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan. The [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|dynasty]] he established would rule Egypt until the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n<!--these paragraphs refer to \"he\", but the text shows that \"he\" is sometimes Muhammad, and sometimes Ibrahim, and maybe others.

[[Mamluk]] power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power.<ref>Tom Little, ''Egypt'', (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), 57.</ref> During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troopsg to work with both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself.<ref name=Little57>Little, 57.</ref> As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. In 1801, he allied with the [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]ian leader [[Umar Makram]] and Egypt's [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]]. During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between 1801 and 1805, Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public.<ref>P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Egypt'', (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1805, a group of prominent Egyptians led by the [[ulema]] (scholars, savants) demanded the replacement of ''W\u0101li'' (viceroy) [[Ahmad Khurshid Pasha]] by Muhammad Ali, and the Ottomans yielded. In 1809, though, Ali exiled Makram to [[Damietta]]. According to [[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]], Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali's intentions to seize power for himself.<ref name=Little57/>\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] could not oppose Muhammad Ali's ascension. By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power.\n\n[[File:Mamluks, Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by [[Horace Vernet]].]]\nThe Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali. They controlled Egypt for more than 600 years, and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt. Muhammad Ali's approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership, then move against the rank and file. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the [[Cairo Citadel]] in honour of his son, [[Tusun Pasha]], who was to lead a military expedition into [[Arabia]]. The event was held on 1 March 1811. When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel, and were surrounded by Muhammad Ali's troops, he had his troops kill them.{{efn|Reports vary about how many died. William Cleveland claims 74 killed while H. Wood Jarvis claims nearly 500. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks.<ref>Cleveland, 67.</ref><ref>H. Wood Jarvis, ''Pharaoh to Farouk'', (London: John Murray, 1956), 124.</ref>}} After the leaders were killed, Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces.\n\nMuhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows:\n\n{{bquote|I am well aware that the (Ottoman) Empire is heading by the day toward destruction... On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.<ref>Georges Douin, ed. ''Une Mission militaire francaise aupres de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Generaux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Geographie d'Egypte'', 1923)</ref>}}\n\n== Reinventing Egypt ==\n\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy.]]\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789\u20131807) had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the [[Janissaries]], the Ottoman infantry formed from the [[devshirme]] system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, recognized the need to modernize, but unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.<ref>William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 57.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty.<ref>Cleveland, 62.</ref> To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt, Khaled Famy</ref>\n\nHis first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the [[iltizam]] lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the '[[tax-farmer]]s' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on [[waqf]] endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.<ref>Vatikiotis, 55; Cleveland, 63.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels - Sketch for the portrait of Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt.jpg|thumb|left|''Muhammad Ali'' by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]], 1847]]\n\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali's land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of [[long staple cotton]], a new [[cash crop]]. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the [[corv\u00e9e]], or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.<ref>Little, 59; Cleveland, 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nIn addition to bolstering the agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt. His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. With a [[shipyard]] he built in [[Alexandria]], he began construction of a navy. By the end of the 1830s, Egypt's war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.<ref name=Cleveland69>Cleveland, 69.</ref>\n\nHowever, the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a [[textile industry]] in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali used contracts called [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. Ali also granted [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] permission to build technical schools modeled after the [[Ecole Polytechnique]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a [[corv\u00e9e]] labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as [[Syria]]. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.\n\n[[File:\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627.JPG|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his officials in [[Cairo]].]]\n\nBeyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. The European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility.\n\nA by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a [[Civil service|professional bureaucracy]]. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali's other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the W\u0101li had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled. In doing so, Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself. He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\n\nA 2015 study found that Ali's economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panza|first=Laura|last2=Williamson|first2=Jeffrey G.|date=1 February 2015|title=Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=79\u2013100|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12063|issn=1468-0289}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mehemed Ali Egypt.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt, drawn by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]].]]\n\n== Law under Muhammad Ali ==\nThe purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 133</ref> Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt. Most notably he did this by passing his first penal legislation in 1829, in an effort to get a stronger hold over the population. By this time, Muhammad Ali was already moving towards an establishment of an independent state, which he first expressed in 1830, by creating a state of \"law and order\", where Christians within Egypt can be safe, which was a way Muhammad Ali was able to pull influence from Europe.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Fahmy|first=Khaled|date=1 January 1999|title=The Anatomy of Justice: Forensic Medicine and Criminal Law in Nineteenth-Century Egypt|jstor=3399313|journal=Islamic Law and Society|volume=6|issue=2|pages=224\u2013271}}</ref> He started gradually renovating more of the government for him to hold more sway over it rather than the sultan.

Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1990. <nowiki>http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft5t1nb3mq/</nowiki></ref> Clot-Bey had been invited in 1827 by Muhammad Ali to found the Qasral-\u2018Ayni School of Medicine at the Army hospital of Abou Zabel which later transferred to Cairo. The Army Medical School had a difficult beginning with religious officials against dissection of corpses for anatomy lessons.<ref>M. Paul Merruau, ''L\u2019Egypte Contemporaine de Mehemet-ali a Said Pacha'',\nParis, Librarie Internationale, 1860, p. 84.</ref>\n \nThe medical school for women would produce hakimas, \"doctoress\",<ref name=\":0\" /> to treat women and children. French women adherents of the [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] social reform movement were living in Egypt during 1833-36 and studied or provided medical care under Clot Bey's direction. French ''sage-femme'' (midwife) [[Suzanne Voilquin]] writes of assisting during the cholera epidemic of 1834.<ref>Voilquin, Suzanne. ''Souvenirs d'une fille du peuple: ou, La Saint-Simonienne en Egypte'', Intro by Lydia Elhadad. Paris: F. Maspero, 1978.</ref> Several of the French women contracted cholera and died.\n\nAli's military and economic goals required a healthy army and population from which young boys could be conscripted. Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, were common among soldiers and smallpox outbreaks led to high childhood mortality rates. Clot Bey argued that female-provided health care for women and children was crucial to maintain a healthy population.<ref name=\":0\" /> He believed that the untrained local dayas (midwives) were unable to provide appropriate care and under Egyptian law, male doctors could not treat women.<ref name=\":1\">Kozma, Liat. ''Policing Egyptian Women: Sex, Law, and Medicine in Khedival Egypt''. Syracuse, NY, USA: Syracuse University Press, 2011. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 24 May 2016.</ref> Clot Bey's solution was a school to train female doctors.\n\nThe school of medicine for women followed a French model. The first two years of training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients. The following four included training in: obstetrics, pre- and post-natal care, dressing wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, cupping, application of leeches, identification / preparation of common medicines. Students were provided housing, food, clothes and a monthly allowance from the state.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGraduates served at the Civil Hospital in Cairo or at health centres throughout Egypt. Some stayed at the school to serve as instructors.<ref name=\":0\" /> Marriages were arranged by the state to male doctors. Once married, hakimas were given the title of [[Effendi]], the rank of second lieutenant, and a monthly salary of 250 piasters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLicensed hakimas treated women and children, providing vaccinations and delivering children. They served a fundamental role in reducing the incidence of smallpox during the 19th century by vaccinating approximately 600 children a month in the Civil Hospital.<ref name=\":0\" /> They checked and treated women, mainly prostitutes, for venereal diseases.<ref name=\":2\">Fahmy, Khaled. \u201cWomen, Medicine, and Power in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.\u201d ''Remaking Women: Feminism and Modernity in the Middle East''.

In this respect, hakimas operated in legal setting. Their examination was used as evidence in cases involving unnatural death, suspected premarital loss of virginity, or miscarriage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAlthough one task of the hakimas was overseeing childbirth, the majority of the population continued to use the dayas.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hakimas performed almost no deliveries and often were only called upon during difficult deliveries.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, dayas were required to have a certificate to perform deliveries, which could only be obtained from hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" /> They were also expected to report statistics on births to the hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA significant issue was recruitment of students. Egyptian culture at the time opposed the education of women.<ref name=\":1\" /> Therefore, the first students at the medical school were young slave girls.<ref name=\":0\" /> Slaves continued to be recruited through slave auctions as well as orphans from hospices.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the modest success of the school and its graduates, increasing enrolment remained a consistent problem, though the limit of 60 students was reached in 1846.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nContemporary and modern historians have viewed the creation of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali.<ref name=\":2\" /> Khaled Fahmy argues against this view.<ref name=\":2\" /> Fahmy states that, because the reasons for the creation of the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army, the school was not a sign of reform but Ali furthering his military goals.<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate. Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Role in the Arabic literary renaissance ==\nIn the 1820s, Muhammad Ali sent the first educational \"mission\" of Egyptian students to Europe. This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance, known as the [[Nahda]].\n\nTo support the modernization of industry and the military, Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied. [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology, and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement, after the first [[Arab transmission of the Classics to the West#First period: Greek \u2013 Arabic translations|from Greek into Arabic]].\n\nIn 1819/21, his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World, the [[Bulaq Press]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verdery|first=Richard|title=The Publications of the B\u016bl\u0101q Press under Muhammad 'Al\u012b of Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1971|volume=91|issue=1|pages=129\u2013132|url=http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos-91-1-rnv.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2014|doi=10.2307/600448|jstor=600448}}</ref>  The Bulaq press published the official [[gazette]] of Muhammad Ali's government.\n\nAmong his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of [[Arabian horse]]s. In horses obtained as taxes and [[tribute]], Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the [[Bedouin]], particularly by the [[Anazeh]] in Syria and those bred in the [[Nejd]]. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] shared this interest and further built upon his work.\n\n== Military campaigns ==\n[[File:Flag of Muhammad Ali.svg|The Flag of Muhamma Ali|thumb|Muhammad Ali's flag.]]\n\nThough Muhammad Ali's chief aim was to establish a European-style military, and carve out a personal empire, he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], in Arabia and Greece, although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.  He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military. First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to. They began housing soldiers in barracks, leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance, roll call was done several times a day, and corporal punishment used to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt</ref> The army often used the [[bastinado]] and the [[Flagellation|whip]] to control and punish the soldiers.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt 127</ref> Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined, he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment, this helped to create blind obedience to the laws.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref> A large part of Ali's goal of a European-style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers, distinguish officers from enlisted men, structure units, and properly distribute salaries.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142\u2013146.</ref> Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it, and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142.</ref> This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement, such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 144.</ref>\nThe soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks. In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 123</ref> In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 124</ref>\n\n=== Arabian campaign ===\n{{Main|Wahhabi War}}\n\nMuhammad Ali's first military campaign was an expedition into the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The holy cities of [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]] had been captured by the [[House of Saud]], who had recently embraced a literalist [[Hanbali]] interpretation of [[Islam]]. Armed with their newfound religious zeal, the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia. This culminated in the capture of the [[Hejaz]] region by 1805.\n\nWith the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to [[Ottoman\u2013Saudi War|recapture the Arabian territories]]. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, [[Tusun Pasha|Tusun]], to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz.<ref>Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammal \u2018Ali'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nWhile the campaign was successful, the power of the Saudis was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central [[Nejd]] region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, [[Abdullah ibn Saud]], was sent to Istanbul, and executed.<ref>Dodwell, 48.</ref>\n\n=== Conquest of Sudan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)}}\n\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], beginning with the [[Sudan]] which he viewed as a valuable additional resource of territory, gold, and slaves. The Sudan at the time had no real central authority, as since the 18th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining [[Sultanate of Sennar]], fighting each other with Medieval weaponry. In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail and [[Abidin Bey]], south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.<ref>Dodwell, 51.</ref> Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance by the [[Shaigiya]]. Ultimately, the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the Shaigiya and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan.<ref>Emanuel Be\u0161ka, ''Muhammad Ali\u00b4s Conquest of Sudan (1820-1824)''. Asian and African Studies, 2019, Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 30-56.</ref> Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the [[Nile]] in [[Ethiopia]], and [[Uganda]]. His administration captured slaves from the [[Nuba Mountains]], and west and south Sudan, all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the ''Gihadiya'' which were composed of the recently defeated Shaigiya who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains. (pronounced ''Jihadiya'' in non-Egyptian Arabic). Ali's reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy-handed, contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]], [[Muhammad Ahmad]], in 1881.\n\n=== Greek rebellion ===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali Pasha with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph S\u00e8ve (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]].]]\n\nWhile Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The [[Greek War of Independence|rebellion]] in the [[Greece|Greek provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his own army proving ineffective, Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of [[Crete]] in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\n\nMuhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Dodwell, 71.</ref> Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the [[Battle of Navarino]], while under the command of Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. If the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was not in the least prepared for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.\n\n=== War against the sultan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)}}\n\nIn compensation for his loss at Navarino, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of [[Syria]]. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed.<ref>12 Bahr Barra, Jamad I 1243/1828</ref> But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.\n\nLike other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control [[Bilad al-Sham]] (the Levant), both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision on the part of the W\u0101li since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the [[Levant]]; in addition, it would be a [[captive market]] for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the [[First Turko-Egyptian War]]. For the sake of appearance on the world stage, a pretext for the invasion was vital. Ultimately, the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The W\u0101li alleged that 6,000 [[fellahin]] had fled to Acre to escape the draft, corv\u00e9e, and taxes, and he wanted them back.<ref>Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', University of Cambridge, 1983</ref> (See also: [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]])\n\nThe Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into [[Anatolia]]. At the [[Battle of Konya]] (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the ''sadr azam'' [[Grand Vizier]] Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan's name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.<ref>Dodwell, 111.</ref> So long as Muhammad Ali's march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained as passive observers.<ref>Dodwell, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid resulting in the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]].<ref>Cleveland, 72.</ref> Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, resulting in their direct intervention. From this position, the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May 1833 known as the [[Convention of Kutahya]].<ref name= Kupchan >{{cite book | title = Power in Transition: The Peaceful Change of International Order | author = Charles Kupchan  | publisher = United Nations University Press | year = 2001 |  page = 117 }}</ref> The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of [[Crete]] (then known as Candia) and the [[Hijaz]] as compensation, and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W\u0101li of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.<ref>Dodwell, 122\u2013123.</ref>\n\n[[File:Interview with Mehemet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria, by David Roberts and Louis Hague.jpg|thumb|left|''Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria'' (1839), with [[Patrick Campbell (British Army officer, born 1779)|Patrick Campbell]] in the centre. After [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in [[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]]]\nSensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains, the sultan attempted to pre-empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence.<ref name=Vatikiotis66>Vatikiotis, 66.</ref> Muhammad Ali rejected the offer, knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete.\n\nOn 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali informed Britain, and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Dodwell, 171.</ref> This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> With Muhammad Ali's intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war. Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria. In Constantinople, the Ottoman commander, Hafiz Pasha, assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army.\n\nWhen Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier, Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the [[Battle of Nezib]] (24 June 1839) near [[Urfa]]. In an echo of the Battle of Konya, Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali's forces. A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen-year-old [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. At this point, Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow; Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family.\n\nAt this point, the European powers again intervened (see [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, which had colluded with [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as [[King Louis-Philippe]] did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, especially at a time when he also had to deal with the [[Rhine crisis]]. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria.<ref>Jarvis, 134.</ref> In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.\n\nAfter the [[Royal Navy|British]], and Austrian navies blockaded the [[Nile delta]] coastline, shelled [[Beirut]] (11 September 1840), and after Acre had capitulated (3 November 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete, and Hejaz, downsizing his navy, and reducing his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy [[hereditary]] rule over Egypt and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]: an unheard-of status for an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]].<ref>Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'', (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11.</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\n[[File:mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|[[The Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]\n\nAfter 1843, fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle, and the [[treaty of Balta Liman]], which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the [[silver nitrate]] he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.<ref>\"...the silver nitrate his doctors gave him earlier to cure his dysentery was taking its toll...\", Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 255; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the tax receipts were in, and Sherif Pasha, the head of the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the W\u0101li the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80&nbsp;million francs (\u00a32,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres{{efn|A [[Kuru\u015f|piastre]] is forty ''[[Para (currency)|paras]]''. A ''para'' is the smallest Egyptian silver coin. In this instance, a piastre can be viewed as approximately 40% of a British pound sterling.}} out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts.<ref>Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 252; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref> Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, \u0130brahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.\n\nA year later while Ibrahim, progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis (he was beginning to cough up blood), was sent to Italy to take the waters, Muhammad Ali, in 1846, travelled to Constantinople. There he approached the Sultan, expressed his fears, and made his peace, explaining: \"[My son] Ibrahim is old and sick, [my grandson] Abbas is indolent (''happa''), and then children will rule Egypt. How will they keep Egypt?\"<ref>Nubar Pasha,''Memoirs'', p.63.</ref>\nAfter he secured hereditary rule for his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when senility made further governance by him impossible.\n\n[[File:Tomb Muhammad Ali Pasha 2.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo]]\n\nIt soon came to the point where his son and heir, the mortally ailing Ibrahim, had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive. However, on the ship returning home, Ibrahim, gripped by fever and guilt, succumbed to seizures and hallucinations. He survived the journey but within six months was dead. He was succeeded by his nephew (Tosun's son) [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].\n\nBy this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son's death. Lingering a few months more, Muhammad Ali died at [[Ras el-Tin Palace]] in [[Alexandria]] on 2 August 1849, and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the [[Cairo Citadel]].\n\nBut the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key, thanks in no small part to the contempt the new w\u0101li Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather.\n\nEyewitness British consul John Murray wrote:\n<blockquote>... the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre, miserable affair; the [diplomatic] Consular was not invited to attend, and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed \u2013 in short, a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather, in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner, and in neglecting to attend them in person.\n\n<br>...[the] attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer. The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country; the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious, vacillating government of his successor; all classes whether Turk, or Arab, not only feel, but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali...In truth my Lord, it cannot be denied, that Muhammad Ali, notwithstanding all his faults was a great man.<ref>F.O. 78/804. Murray to Palmerston, September 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Muhammadalipasha.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]].]]\n\nThe prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the 'Father of Modern Egypt', being the first ruler since the [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman conquest in 1517]] to permanently divest the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] of its power in Egypt. While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime, he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state. In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm, he built a central bureaucracy, an educational system that allowed social mobility, and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop, cotton, and military-based manufacturing. His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly 150 years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state.<ref>The 'Father of Modern Egypt' school includes: Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad \u2018Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965); Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation-State (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1988); Albert Haurani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002); Jean Lacouture and Simonne Lacouture, ''Egypt in Transition'', trans.

He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and throughout his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous.

[[Fuad I of Egypt]] in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt. These Royal Archives represented the primary and, in the case of some important works,<ref>For example, Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad 'Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1931)</ref> the only source of information for Egyptian history until the sharia court records became available in the 1970s.

At the height of his rule, he controlled [[Lower Egypt]], [[Upper Egypt]], [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and [[Arabia|parts of Arabia]] and the entire [[Levant]]. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt.\n\nMuhammad Ali was born in [[Kavala]], [[Macedonia (region)|Ottoman Macedonia]] to a family of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origins. He was a military commander in an Albanian Ottoman force sent to recover Egypt from a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|French occupation]] under [[Napoleon]]. Following Napoleon's withdrawal, Muhammad Ali rose to power through a series of political maneuvers, and in 1805 he was named ''[[W\u0101li]]'' (viceroy) of Egypt and gained the rank of [[Pasha]].\n\nAs ''W\u0101li'', Muhammad Ali attempted to modernize Egypt by instituting dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres. He also initiated a violent purge of the [[Mamluk]]s, consolidating his rule and permanently ending the Mamluk hold over Egypt.\n\nMilitarily, Muhammad Ali [[Wahhabi War|recaptured the Arabian territories]] for the sultan, and [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)|conquered Sudan]] on his own accord. His attempt at suppressing the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek rebellion]] failed decisively, however, following an intervention by the European powers at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]]. In 1831, Muhammad Ali [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)|waged war against the sultan]], capturing Syria, crossing into Anatolia and directly threatening [[Constantinople]] but Western Powers threatened him to retreat. He did the same invasion against the Ottoman Empire in 1840 , when he defeated again the Ottomans and had a free way to capture Istanbul. Faced with another European intervention, he accepted a brokered peace in 1842 and withdrew from the Levant; in return, he and his descendants were granted hereditary rule over Egypt and Sudan. The [[Muhammad Ali dynasty|dynasty]] he established would rule Egypt until the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n<!--these paragraphs refer to \"he\", but the text shows that \"he\" is sometimes Muhammad, and sometimes Ibrahim, and maybe others.

[[Mamluk]] power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power.<ref>Tom Little, ''Egypt'', (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), 57.</ref> During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to work with both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself.<ref name=Little57>Little, 57.</ref> As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle.

During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between 1801 and 1805, Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public.<ref>P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Egypt'', (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 51.</ref>\n\nIn 1805, a group of prominent Egyptians led by the [[ulema]] (scholars, savants) demanded the replacement of ''W\u0101li'' (viceroy) [[Ahmad Khurshid Pasha]] by Muhammad Ali, and the Ottomans yielded. In 1809, though, Ali exiled Makram to [[Damietta]]. According to [[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]], Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali's intentions to seize power for himself.<ref name=Little57/>\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] could not oppose Muhammad Ali's ascension. By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power.\n\n[[File:Mamluks, Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by [[Horace Vernet]].]]\nThe Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali. They controlled Egypt for more than 600 years, and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt. Muhammad Ali's approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership, then move against the rank and file. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the [[Cairo Citadel]] in honour of his son, [[Tusun Pasha]], who was to lead a military expedition into [[Arabia]]. The event was held on 1 March 1811. When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel, and were surrounded by Muhammad Ali's troops, he had his troops kill them.{{efn|Reports vary about how many died. William Cleveland claims 74 killed while H. Wood Jarvis claims nearly 500. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks.<ref>Cleveland, 67.</ref><ref>H. Wood Jarvis, ''Pharaoh to Farouk'', (London: John Murray, 1956), 124.</ref>}} After the leaders were killed, Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces.\n\nMuhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows:\n\n{{bquote|I am well aware that the (Ottoman) Empire is heading by the day toward destruction... On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.<ref>Georges Douin, ed. ''Une Mission militaire francaise aupres de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Generaux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Royale de Geographie d'Egypte'', 1923)</ref>}}\n\n== Reinventing Egypt ==\n\n[[File:Mouhamed ali army&navy.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy.]]\n\nSultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789\u20131807) had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the [[Janissaries]], the Ottoman infantry formed from the [[devshirme]] system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, recognized the need to modernize, but unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.<ref>William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 57.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty.<ref>Cleveland, 62.</ref> To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt, Khaled Famy</ref>\n\nHis first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the [[iltizam]] lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the '[[tax-farmer]]s' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on [[waqf]] endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.<ref>Vatikiotis, 55; Cleveland, 63.</ref>\n\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels - Sketch for the portrait of Muhammad Ali, viceroy of Egypt.jpg|thumb|left|''Muhammad Ali'' by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels]], 1847]]\n\nIn practice, Muhammad Ali's land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of [[long staple cotton]], a new [[cash crop]]. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the [[corv\u00e9e]], or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.<ref>Little, 59; Cleveland, 63\u201364.</ref>\n\nIn addition to bolstering the agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt. His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. With a [[shipyard]] he built in [[Alexandria]], he began construction of a navy. By the end of the 1830s, Egypt's war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.<ref name=Cleveland69>Cleveland, 69.</ref>\n\nHowever, the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a [[textile industry]] in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali used contracts called [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. Ali also granted [[Barth\u00e9lemy Prosper Enfantin]] permission to build technical schools modeled after the [[Ecole Polytechnique]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a [[corv\u00e9e]] labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as [[Syria]]. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.\n\n[[File:\u0623\u0633\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627.JPG|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt with his officials in [[Cairo]].]]\n\nBeyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. The European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility.\n\nA by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a [[Civil service|professional bureaucracy]]. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali's other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the W\u0101li had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled. In doing so, Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself. He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order.<ref name=Cleveland69 /> Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.\n\nA 2015 study found that Ali's economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Panza|first=Laura|last2=Williamson|first2=Jeffrey G.|date=1 February 2015|title=Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=79\u2013100|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12063|issn=1468-0289}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mehemed Ali Egypt.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt, drawn by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]].]]\n\n== Law under Muhammad Ali ==\nThe purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 133</ref> Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt.

Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, were common among soldiers and smallpox outbreaks led to high childhood mortality rates. Clot Bey argued that female-provided health care for women and children was crucial to maintain a healthy population.<ref name=\":0\" /> He believed that the untrained local dayas (midwives) were unable to provide appropriate care and under Egyptian law, male doctors could not treat women.<ref name=\":1\">Kozma, Liat. ''Policing Egyptian Women: Sex, Law, and Medicine in Khedival Egypt''. Syracuse, NY, USA: Syracuse University Press, 2011. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 24 May 2016.</ref> Clot Bey's solution was a school to train female doctors.\n\nThe school of medicine for women followed a French model. The first two years of training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients. The following four included training in: obstetrics, pre- and post-natal care, dressing wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, cupping, application of leeches, identification / preparation of common medicines. Students were provided housing, food, clothes and a monthly allowance from the state.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGraduates served at the Civil Hospital in Cairo or at health centres throughout Egypt. Some stayed at the school to serve as instructors.<ref name=\":0\" /> Marriages were arranged by the state to male doctors. Once married, hakimas were given the title of [[Effendi]], the rank of second lieutenant, and a monthly salary of 250 piasters.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLicensed hakimas treated women and children, providing vaccinations and delivering children. They served a fundamental role in reducing the incidence of smallpox during the 19th century by vaccinating approximately 600 children a month in the Civil Hospital.<ref name=\":0\" /> They checked and treated women, mainly prostitutes, for venereal diseases.<ref name=\":2\">Fahmy, Khaled. \u201cWomen, Medicine, and Power in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.\u201d ''Remaking Women: Feminism and Modernity in the Middle East''.

In this respect, hakimas operated in legal setting. Their examination was used as evidence in cases involving unnatural death, suspected premarital loss of virginity, or miscarriage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAlthough one task of the hakimas was overseeing childbirth, the majority of the population continued to use the dayas.<ref name=\":0\" /> Hakimas performed almost no deliveries and often were only called upon during difficult deliveries.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, dayas were required to have a certificate to perform deliveries, which could only be obtained from hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" /> They were also expected to report statistics on births to the hakimas.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA significant issue was recruitment of students. Egyptian culture at the time opposed the education of women.<ref name=\":1\" /> Therefore, the first students at the medical school were young slave girls.<ref name=\":0\" /> Slaves continued to be recruited through slave auctions as well as orphans from hospices.<ref name=\":2\" /> Despite the modest success of the school and its graduates, increasing enrolment remained a consistent problem, though the limit of 60 students was reached in 1846.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nContemporary and modern historians have viewed the creation of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali.<ref name=\":2\" /> Khaled Fahmy argues against this view.<ref name=\":2\" /> Fahmy states that, because the reasons for the creation of the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army, the school was not a sign of reform but Ali furthering his military goals.<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate. Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Role in the Arabic literary renaissance ==\nIn the 1820s, Muhammad Ali sent the first educational \"mission\" of Egyptian students to Europe. This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance, known as the [[Nahda]].\n\nTo support the modernization of industry and the military, Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied. [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology, and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement, after the first [[Arab transmission of the Classics to the West#First period: Greek \u2013 Arabic translations|from Greek into Arabic]].\n\nIn 1819/21, his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World, the [[Bulaq Press]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Verdery|first=Richard|title=The Publications of the B\u016bl\u0101q Press under Muhammad 'Al\u012b of Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1971|volume=91|issue=1|pages=129\u2013132|url=http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos-91-1-rnv.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2014|doi=10.2307/600448|jstor=600448}}</ref>  The Bulaq press published the official [[gazette]] of Muhammad Ali's government.\n\nAmong his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of [[Arabian horse]]s. In horses obtained as taxes and [[tribute]], Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the [[Bedouin]], particularly by the [[Anazeh]] in Syria and those bred in the [[Nejd]]. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] shared this interest and further built upon his work.\n\n== Military campaigns ==\n[[File:Flag of Muhammad Ali.svg|The Flag of Muhamma Ali|thumb|Muhammad Ali's flag.]]\n\nThough Muhammad Ali's chief aim was to establish a European-style military, and carve out a personal empire, he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], in Arabia and Greece, although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.  He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military. First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to. They began housing soldiers in barracks, leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance, roll call was done several times a day, and corporal punishment used to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt</ref> The army often used the [[bastinado]] and the [[Flagellation|whip]] to control and punish the soldiers.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt 127</ref> Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined, he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment, this helped to create blind obedience to the laws.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119\u201347.</ref> A large part of Ali's goal of a European-style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers, distinguish officers from enlisted men, structure units, and properly distribute salaries.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142\u2013146.</ref> Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it, and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142.</ref> This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement, such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha\u2019s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 144.</ref>\nThe soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks. In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 123</ref> In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place.<ref>All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 124</ref>\n\n=== Arabian campaign ===\n{{Main|Wahhabi War}}\n\nMuhammad Ali's first military campaign was an expedition into the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The holy cities of [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]] had been captured by the [[House of Saud]], who had recently embraced a literalist [[Hanbali]] interpretation of [[Islam]]. Armed with their newfound religious zeal, the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia. This culminated in the capture of the [[Hejaz]] region by 1805.\n\nWith the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to [[Ottoman\u2013Saudi War|recapture the Arabian territories]]. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, [[Tusun Pasha|Tusun]], to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz.<ref>Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammal \u2018Ali'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 43\u201344.</ref>\n\nWhile the campaign was successful, the power of the Saudis was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central [[Nejd]] region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, [[Abdullah ibn Saud]], was sent to Istanbul, and executed.<ref>Dodwell, 48.</ref>\n\n=== Conquest of Sudan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820\u20131824)}}\n\nMuhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], beginning with the [[Sudan]] which he viewed as a valuable additional resource of territory, gold, and slaves. The Sudan at the time had no real central authority, as since the 18th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining [[Sultanate of Sennar]], fighting each other with Medieval weaponry. In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail and [[Abidin Bey]], south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.<ref>Dodwell, 51.</ref> Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance by the [[Shaigiya]]. Ultimately, the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the Shaigiya and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan.<ref>Emanuel Be\u0161ka, ''Muhammad Ali\u00b4s Conquest of Sudan (1820-1824)''. Asian and African Studies, 2019, Vol. 28, No. 1, pp. 30-56.</ref> Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the [[Nile]] in [[Ethiopia]], and [[Uganda]]. His administration captured slaves from the [[Nuba Mountains]], and west and south Sudan, all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the ''Gihadiya'' which were composed of the recently defeated Shaigiya who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains. (pronounced ''Jihadiya'' in non-Egyptian Arabic). Ali's reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy-handed, contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]], [[Muhammad Ahmad]], in 1881.\n\n=== Greek rebellion ===\n{{Main|Greek War of Independence}}\n\n[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali Pasha with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph S\u00e8ve (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]].]]\n\nWhile Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The [[Greek War of Independence|rebellion]] in the [[Greece|Greek provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his own army proving ineffective, Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of [[Crete]] in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.\n\nMuhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].<ref>Dodwell, 71.</ref> Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the [[Battle of Navarino]], while under the command of Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. If the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was not in the least prepared for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.\n\n=== War against the sultan ===\n{{Main|Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1831\u20131833)}}\n\nIn compensation for his loss at Navarino, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of [[Syria]]. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed.<ref>12 Bahr Barra, Jamad I 1243/1828</ref> But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.\n\nLike other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control [[Bilad al-Sham]] (the Levant), both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision on the part of the W\u0101li since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the [[Levant]]; in addition, it would be a [[captive market]] for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.\n\nA new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the [[First Turko-Egyptian War]]. For the sake of appearance on the world stage, a pretext for the invasion was vital. Ultimately, the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The W\u0101li alleged that 6,000 [[fellahin]] had fled to Acre to escape the draft, corv\u00e9e, and taxes, and he wanted them back.<ref>Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', University of Cambridge, 1983</ref> (See also: [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]])\n\nThe Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into [[Anatolia]]. At the [[Battle of Konya]] (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the ''sadr azam'' [[Grand Vizier]] Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.\n\nThrough the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan's name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.<ref>Dodwell, 111.</ref> So long as Muhammad Ali's march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained as passive observers.<ref>Dodwell, 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\nDespite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid resulting in the [[Treaty of H\u00fcnk\u00e2r \u0130skelesi]].<ref>Cleveland, 72.</ref> Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, resulting in their direct intervention. From this position, the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May 1833 known as the [[Convention of Kutahya]].<ref name= Kupchan >{{cite book | title = Power in Transition: The Peaceful Change of International Order | author = Charles Kupchan  | publisher = United Nations University Press | year = 2001 |  page = 117 }}</ref> The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of [[Crete]] (then known as Candia) and the [[Hijaz]] as compensation, and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed W\u0101li of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.<ref>Dodwell, 122\u2013123.</ref>\n\n[[File:Interview with Mehemet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria, by David Roberts and Louis Hague.jpg|thumb|left|''Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria'' (1839), with [[Patrick Campbell (British Army officer, born 1779)|Patrick Campbell]] in the centre. After [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], in [[The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia]]]]\nSensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains, the sultan attempted to pre-empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence.<ref name=Vatikiotis66>Vatikiotis, 66.</ref> Muhammad Ali rejected the offer, knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete.\n\nOn 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali informed Britain, and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Dodwell, 171.</ref> This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> With Muhammad Ali's intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war. Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria. In Constantinople, the Ottoman commander, Hafiz Pasha, assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army.\n\nWhen Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier, Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the [[Battle of Nezib]] (24 June 1839) near [[Urfa]]. In an echo of the Battle of Konya, Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali's forces. A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali.<ref name=Vatikiotis66/> Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen-year-old [[Abd\u00fclmecid I|Abd\u00fclmecid]]. At this point, Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow; Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family.\n\nAt this point, the European powers again intervened (see [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, which had colluded with [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as [[King Louis-Philippe]] did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, especially at a time when he also had to deal with the [[Rhine crisis]]. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria.<ref>Jarvis, 134.</ref> In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.\n\nAfter the [[Royal Navy|British]], and Austrian navies blockaded the [[Nile delta]] coastline, shelled [[Beirut]] (11 September 1840), and after Acre had capitulated (3 November 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete, and Hejaz, downsizing his navy, and reducing his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy [[hereditary]] rule over Egypt and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]: an unheard-of status for an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]].<ref>Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'', (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11.</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\n[[File:mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|[[The Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]\n\nAfter 1843, fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle, and the [[treaty of Balta Liman]], which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the [[silver nitrate]] he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.<ref>\"...the silver nitrate his doctors gave him earlier to cure his dysentery was taking its toll...\", Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 255; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the tax receipts were in, and Sherif Pasha, the head of the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the W\u0101li the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80&nbsp;million francs (\u00a32,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres{{efn|A [[Kuru\u015f|piastre]] is forty ''[[Para (currency)|paras]]''. A ''para'' is the smallest Egyptian silver coin. In this instance, a piastre can be viewed as approximately 40% of a British pound sterling.}} out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts.<ref>Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 252; Cambridge Press, 1983</ref> Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, \u0130brahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.\n\nA year later while Ibrahim, progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis (he was beginning to cough up blood), was sent to Italy to take the waters, Muhammad Ali, in 1846, travelled to Constantinople. There he approached the Sultan, expressed his fears, and made his peace, explaining: \"[My son] Ibrahim is old and sick, [my grandson] Abbas is indolent (''happa''), and then children will rule Egypt. How will they keep Egypt?\"<ref>Nubar Pasha,''Memoirs'', p.63.</ref>\nAfter he secured hereditary rule for his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when senility made further governance by him impossible.\n\n[[File:Tomb Muhammad Ali Pasha 2.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo]]\n\nIt soon came to the point where his son and heir, the mortally ailing Ibrahim, had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive. However, on the ship returning home, Ibrahim, gripped by fever and guilt, succumbed to seizures and hallucinations. He survived the journey but within six months was dead. He was succeeded by his nephew (Tosun's son) [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].\n\nBy this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son's death. Lingering a few months more, Muhammad Ali died at [[Ras el-Tin Palace]] in [[Alexandria]] on 2 August 1849, and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the [[Cairo Citadel]].\n\nBut the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key, thanks in no small part to the contempt the new w\u0101li Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather.\n\nEyewitness British consul John Murray wrote:\n<blockquote>... the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre, miserable affair; the [diplomatic] Consular was not invited to attend, and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed \u2013 in short, a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather, in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner, and in neglecting to attend them in person.\n\n<br>...[the] attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer. The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country; the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious, vacillating government of his successor; all classes whether Turk, or Arab, not only feel, but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali...In truth my Lord, it cannot be denied, that Muhammad Ali, notwithstanding all his faults was a great man.<ref>F.O. 78/804. Murray to Palmerston, September 1849</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Muhammadalipasha.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]].]]\n\nThe prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the 'Father of Modern Egypt', being the first ruler since the [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman conquest in 1517]] to permanently divest the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] of its power in Egypt. While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime, he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state. In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm, he built a central bureaucracy, an educational system that allowed social mobility, and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop, cotton, and military-based manufacturing. His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly 150 years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state.<ref>The 'Father of Modern Egypt' school includes: Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad \u2018Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965); Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation-State (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1988); Albert Haurani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002); Jean Lacouture and Simonne Lacouture, ''Egypt in Transition'', trans.

[[Fuad I of Egypt]] in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt. These Royal Archives represented the primary and, in the case of some important works,<ref>For example, Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad 'Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1931)</ref> the only source of information for Egyptian history until the sharia court records became available in the 1970s. Fuad's portrayal of Muhammad Ali as a [[Egyptian nationalism|nationalist]] and benevolent monarch therefore heavily influenced the historical debate. Later, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and his revolutionary republican regime promoted an alternative narrative which portrayed Muhammad Ali as the nationalist founder of modern Egypt but also an ambitious monarch with little regard for his people whose policies ultimately benefited himself and his dynasty at the expense of Egypt.<ref>Khaled Fahmy, ''Mehmed Ali: From Ottoman Governor to Ruler of Egypt'' (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2009)</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt}}\n* [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty]]\n* [[Ottoman Egypt]]\n* [[Lists of rulers of Egypt]]\n* [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]\n* [[Muhammad Ali's seizure of power]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Ahmed, Jamal Mohammed.

They were used in the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-occupied countries to identify the reason the prisoners had been placed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/holocaust/h-dach-early.htm|title=The History Place - Holocaust Timeline: Nazis Open Dachau Concentration Camp|website=historyplace.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> The triangles were made of fabric and were sewn on jackets and trousers of the prisoners. These mandatory [[badge of shame|badges of shame]] had specific meanings indicated by their colour and shape. Such emblems helped guards assign tasks to the detainees. For example, a guard at a glance could see if someone were a convicted criminal (green patch) and thus likely of a tough temperament suitable for ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' duty.\n\nSomeone with an escape suspect mark usually would not be assigned to work squads operating outside the camp fence. Someone wearing an F could be called upon to help translate guards' spoken instructions to a trainload of new arrivals from France. Some historical monuments quote the badge-imagery, with the use of a triangle being a sort of visual shorthand to symbolize all camp victims.\n\nThe modern-day use of a [[pink triangle]] emblem to symbolize gay rights is a response to the camp identification patches.\n\n== Badge coding system ==\n[[File:Wikpedia system of identification German camps.png|thumb|right|Prisoners' distinguishing badges]]\nThe system of badges varied between the camps and in the later stages of [[World War II]] the use of badges dwindled in some camps and became increasingly accidental in others. The following description is based on the badge coding system used before and during the early stages of the war in the [[Dachau concentration camp]], which had one of the more elaborate coding systems.\n\nShape was chosen by analogy with the common [[Warning sign|triangular road hazard signs]] in Germany that denote warnings to motorists.

A letter P (for ''Polen'') was cut out of the purple cloth to show the yellow backing beneath.  \n\nFurthermore, repeat offenders (''r\u00fcckf\u00e4llige'', meaning recidivists) would receive bars over their stars or triangles, a different colour for a different crime.\n* A political prisoner would have a red bar over their star or triangle.\n* A professional criminal would have a green bar.\n* A foreign forced laborer would not have a blue bar (as their impressment was for the duration of the war), but might have a different coloured bar if they were drawn from another pool of inmates. \n* One of Jehovah's Witnesses would have a purple bar.\n* A homosexual or sex offender would have a pink bar.\n* An asocial would have a black bar.\n* Roma and Sinti (Gypsies) would usually be incarcerated in special sub-camps until they died and so would not normally receive a repeat stripe.\n\nLater in the war (late 1944), to save cloth Jewish prisoners wore a yellow bar over a regular point-down triangle to indicate their status. For instance, regular Jews would wear a yellow bar over a red triangle while Jewish criminals would wear a yellow bar over a green triangle.\n\n==== Special marks ====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2019}}\nMany various markings and combinations existed. A prisoner would usually have at least two and possibly more than six.\n\nLimited preventative custody detainee (''Befristete Vorbeugungshaft H\u00e4ftling'', or BV) was the term for general criminals (who wore green triangles with no special marks). They originally were only supposed to be incarcerated at the camp until their term expired and then they would be released. However, when the war began they were confined indefinitely for its duration.\n\n''Erziehungsh\u00e4ftlinge'' (reformatory inmates) wore E or EH in large black letters on a white square. They were made up of intellectuals and respected community members who could organize and lead a resistance movement, suspicious persons picked up in sweeps or stopped at checkpoints, people caught performing conspiratorial activities or acts and inmates who broke work discipline. They were assigned to hard labor for 6 to 8 weeks and were then released. It was hoped that the threat of permanent incarceration at hard labor  would deter them from further mischief.\n\n''Polizeih\u00e4ftlinge'' (police inmates), short for ''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrte H\u00e4ftlinge'' (police secure custody inmates), wore either PH in large black letters on a white square or the letter S (for ''Sicherungsverwahrt'' \u2014 secure custody) on a green triangle. To save expense, some camps had them just wear their civilian clothes without markings. Records used the letter PSV (''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrt'') to designate them. They were people awaiting trial by a police court-martial or who were already convicted. They were detained in a special jail barracks until they were executed.\n\nSome camps assigned ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (night and fog) prisoners had them wear two large letters NN in yellow.\n\nSoviet prisoners of war (''russische Kriegsgefangenen'') assigned to work camps (''Arbeitslager'') wore two large letters SU (for ''sowjetischer Untermensch'', meaning Soviet sub-human){{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} in yellow and had vertical stripes painted on their uniforms. They were the few who had not been shot out of hand or died of neglect from untreated wounds, exposure to the elements, or starvation before they could reach a camp. They performed hard labor. Some joined [[Andrey Vlasov|Andrey Vlasov's]] [[Russian Liberation Army|Liberation Army]] to fight for the Germans.\n\nLabor education detainees (''Arbeitserziehung H\u00e4ftling'') wore a white letter A on their black triangle. This stood for ''Arbeitsscheuer'' (work-shy person), designating as lazy social undesirables like Gypsies, petty criminals (e.g. prostitutes and pickpockets), alcoholics/drug addicts and vagrants. They were usually assigned to work at labor camps.\n\n''Asoziale'' (anti-socials) inmates wore a plain black triangle. They were considered either too \"selfish\" or \"deviant\" to contribute to society or were considered too impaired to support themselves. They were therefore considered a burden. This category included pacifists and conscription resisters, petty or habitual criminals, the mentally ill and the mentally and/or physically disabled. They were usually executed or euthanized.\n\nThe Wehrmacht ''[[Strafbattalion]]'' (punishment battalion) and SS ''Bew\u00e4hrungstruppe'' (probation company) were military punishment units. They consisted of [[Wehrmacht]] and SS military criminals, SS personnel convicted by an Honor Court of bad conduct and civilian criminals for which military service was either the assigned punishment or a voluntary replacement of imprisonment. They wore regular uniforms, but were forbidden rank or unit insignia until they had proven themselves in combat. They wore an uninverted (point-upwards) red triangle on their upper sleeves to indicate their status. Most were used for hard labor, \"special tasks\" (unwanted dangerous jobs like defusing landmines or running phone cables) or were used as [[forlorn hope]]s or [[cannon fodder]]. The infamous [[Dirlewanger Brigade]] was an example of a regular unit created from such personnel.\n\nA ''Strafkompanie'' (punishment company) was a hard labor unit in the camps. Inmates assigned to it wore a black roundel bordered white under their triangle patch.\n\nPrisoners \"suspected of [attempting to] escape\" (''Fluchtverd\u00e4chtiger'') wore a red roundel bordered white under their triangle patch. If also assigned to hard labor, they wore the red roundel under their black ''Strafkompanie'' roundel.\n\nA prisoner-functionary (''Funktionsh\u00e4ftling''), or ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' (boss), wore a cloth [[brassard]] (their ''Kennzeichen'', or identifying mark) to indicate their status. They served as camp guards (''Lagerpolizei''), barracks clerks (''Blockschreiber'') and the senior prisoners (''\u00e4ltesten'', meaning elders) at the camp (''lager\u00e4ltester''), barracks (''block\u00e4ltester'') and room (''stuben\u00e4ltester'') levels of camp organization. They received privileges like bigger and sometimes better food rations, better quarters (or even a private room), luxuries (like tobacco or alcohol) and access to the camp's facilities (like the showers or the pool). Failure to please their captors meant demotion and loss of privileges and an almost certain death at the hands of their fellow inmates.\n\nDetainees wearing civilian clothing (more common later in the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent X on the back.<ref name=Saidel>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zglu2RvoLmgC&lpg=PA76&ots=ElAQpjF6Aw&dq=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&f=false|title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp|author=Rochelle G.

Most triangles are plain while some others bear [[Nazi concentration camp badges#Other badges|nationality-letters]]. The otherwise potentially puzzling designs are a direct reference to the identification patches used in the camps. On such monuments, typically an inverted (point down, base up) triangle (especially if red) evokes all victims, including also the [[Holocaust#Non-Jewish|non-Jewish victims]] like Slavs, Poles, communists, homosexuals, [[Romani people|Roma and Sinti]] (see [[Porajmos]]), the handicapped (see [[Action T4]]) Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]].  An inverted triangle colored pink would symbolize gay male victims.  A non-inverted (base down, point up) triangle and/or a yellow triangle is generally more evocative of the Jewish victims.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Some examples of camp triangle emblems on monuments and related uses\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:KZ Sachsenhausen - zentrales Mahnmal.JPG|At [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]\nFile:Todesmarsch Gedenkstein Breitenfeld.JPG|A [[Mittelbau-Dora|Dora]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] roadside tablet marked only with the date and a red triangle\nFile:Holocaust Memorial in Estonia.jpg|On the [[Klooga concentration camp|Klooga]] Jewish victims' memorial\nFile:Crawinkel Gedenktafel.JPG|On a [[Buchenwald]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] route historical marker\nFile:Death March Memorial Plaque, Oranienburg.jpg|On a [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] death march route [[historical marker]]\nFile:Belower-Damm-Wittstock-Dosse-Mahnmal.jpg|Monument (in the village of [[Grabow-Below]]) for [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] death march victims\nFile:Denkmal KZ Woebbelin4.jpg|On a [[W\u00f6bbelin concentration camp|W\u00f6bbelin]] memorial stone\nFile:Gedenkst\u00e4tte_Lindenring_(2).jpg|Boulder (in Lindenring) for 2,000 women victims of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]]\nFile:Cenoteph of Cap Arcona.JPG|On a ''[[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|Cap Arcona]]'' incident memorial\nFile:Neustadt-Glewe VVN-Denkmal 2008-01-03.jpg|At the [[Neustadt-Glewe]] concentration camp memorial\nFile:French monument Mauthausen 1243.JPG|F-triangle at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen-Gusen]] honors French victims\nFile:Croix du Prisonnier Politique 1940-1945.jpg|B-triangle incorporated into the Belgian [[Political Prisoner's Cross 1940\u20131945|Political Prisoner's Cross]]\nFile:KZ-Hinzert-Plakette-Nacht-und-Nebel.jpg|F-triangle at [[Hinzert concentration camp|Hinzert]] honors French victims, especially of the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' program\nFile:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1973, MiNr 1878.jpg|On a [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] memorial (pictured on an East German stamp).\nFile:Han Seelhorst Mahnmal KZ Opfer 01.PNG|On a monument to [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] victims in [[Hamburg]], where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters, but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Ludwigsfelde Friedhof Gedenkstein Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer.JPG|On a memorial to victims killed at Genshagen (right panel), where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Denkmal f\u00fcr die Opfer der NS-Konzentrationslager Zgorzelec.JPG|P-triangle at a Zgorzelec memorial\nFile:Krzy\u017c O\u015bwi\u0119cimski-awers.jpg|P-triangle on the [[Auschwitz Cross|Polish medal for camp victims]]\nFile:Memorial with Prisoners Triangle Badges and Star of David Badge - Dachau Concentration Camp Site - Dachau - Bavaria - Germany.jpg|Various badges on a [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] memorial{{note|Photo by Adam Jones.}}\nFile:In memory of homosexual.JPG|[[Pink triangle]] (''Rosa Winkel'' in German) memorial for gay men killed at [[Buchenwald]]\nFile:Gedenktafel Rosa Winkel Nollendorfplatz.jpg|In the Berlin [[Nollendorfplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Nollendorfplatz subway station]], a pink triangle plaque honors gay male victims{{note|Photo by Manfred Brueckels.}}\nFile:Ac.homomonument.jpg|Amsterdam's ''[[Homomonument]]'' uses pink triangles symbolically to memorialize gay men killed in the [[Holocaust]] and also victims of [[Gay bashing|anti-gay violence generally]]\nFile:Pink triangle on Twin Peaks (19055079410).jpg|Every year, a pink triangle is erected on [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco)|Twin Peaks]] in San Francisco during [[San Francisco Pride|Pride weekend]].\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Richard Plant (1988).

These mandatory [[badge of shame|badges of shame]] had specific meanings indicated by their colour and shape. Such emblems helped guards assign tasks to the detainees. For example, a guard at a glance could see if someone were a convicted criminal (green patch) and thus likely of a tough temperament suitable for ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' duty.\n\nSomeone with an escape suspect mark usually would not be assigned to work squads operating outside the camp fence. Someone wearing an F could be called upon to help translate guards' spoken instructions to a trainload of new arrivals from France. Some historical monuments quote the badge-imagery, with the use of a triangle being a sort of visual shorthand to symbolize all camp victims.\n\nThe modern-day use of a [[pink triangle]] emblem to symbolize gay rights is a response to the camp identification patches.\n\n== Badge coding system ==\n[[File:Wikpedia system of identification German camps.png|thumb|right|Prisoners' distinguishing badges]]\nThe system of badges varied between the camps and in the later stages of [[World War II]] the use of badges dwindled in some camps and became increasingly accidental in others. The following description is based on the badge coding system used before and during the early stages of the war in the [[Dachau concentration camp]], which had one of the more elaborate coding systems.\n\nShape was chosen by analogy with the common [[Warning sign|triangular road hazard signs]] in Germany that denote warnings to motorists. Here, a triangle is called inverted because its base is up while one of its angles points down.\n\n=== Single triangles ===\n* Red triangle \u2013 [[political prisoner]]s: [[social democracy|social democrats]], [[Socialism|socialists]], [[communism|communists]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]]; [[Individuals and groups assisting Jews during the Holocaust|rescuers of Jews]]; trade unionists; and [[Suppression of Freemasonry|Freemasons]].\n* Green triangle \u2013 convicts and criminals (often working as ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapos]]'').\n* Blue triangle \u2013 foreign forced laborers and [[emigrants]].\n* [[Purple triangle]] \u2013 primarily [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (over 99%) as well as members of other small pacifist religious groups.<ref group=notes>Johannes S.

A letter P (for ''Polen'') was cut out of the purple cloth to show the yellow backing beneath.  \n\nFurthermore, repeat offenders (''r\u00fcckf\u00e4llige'', meaning recidivists) would receive bars over their stars or triangles, a different colour for a different crime.\n* A political prisoner would have a red bar over their star or triangle.\n* A professional criminal would have a green bar.\n* A foreign forced laborer would not have a blue bar (as their impressment was for the duration of the war), but might have a different coloured bar if they were drawn from another pool of inmates. \n* One of Jehovah's Witnesses would have a purple bar.\n* A homosexual or sex offender would have a pink bar.\n* An asocial would have a black bar.\n* Roma and Sinti (Gypsies) would usually be incarcerated in special sub-camps until they died and so would not normally receive a repeat stripe.\n\nLater in the war (late 1944), to save cloth Jewish prisoners wore a yellow bar over a regular point-down triangle to indicate their status. For instance, regular Jews would wear a yellow bar over a red triangle while Jewish criminals would wear a yellow bar over a green triangle.\n\n==== Special marks ====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2019}}\nMany various markings and combinations existed. A prisoner would usually have at least two and possibly more than six.\n\nLimited preventative custody detainee (''Befristete Vorbeugungshaft H\u00e4ftling'', or BV) was the term for general criminals (who wore green triangles with no special marks). They originally were only supposed to be incarcerated at the camp until their term expired and then they would be released. However, when the war began they were confined indefinitely for its duration.\n\n''Erziehungsh\u00e4ftlinge'' (reformatory inmates) wore E or EH in large black letters on a white square. They were made up of intellectuals and respected community members who could organize and lead a resistance movement, suspicious persons picked up in sweeps or stopped at checkpoints, people caught performing conspiratorial activities or acts and inmates who broke work discipline. They were assigned to hard labor for 6 to 8 weeks and were then released. It was hoped that the threat of permanent incarceration at hard labor  would deter them from further mischief.\n\n''Polizeih\u00e4ftlinge'' (police inmates), short for ''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrte H\u00e4ftlinge'' (police secure custody inmates), wore either PH in large black letters on a white square or the letter S (for ''Sicherungsverwahrt'' \u2014 secure custody) on a green triangle. To save expense, some camps had them just wear their civilian clothes without markings. Records used the letter PSV (''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrt'') to designate them. They were people awaiting trial by a police court-martial or who were already convicted. They were detained in a special jail barracks until they were executed.\n\nSome camps assigned ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (night and fog) prisoners had them wear two large letters NN in yellow.\n\nSoviet prisoners of war (''russische Kriegsgefangenen'') assigned to work camps (''Arbeitslager'') wore two large letters SU (for ''sowjetischer Untermensch'', meaning Soviet sub-human){{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} in yellow and had vertical stripes painted on their uniforms. They were the few who had not been shot out of hand or died of neglect from untreated wounds, exposure to the elements, or starvation before they could reach a camp. They performed hard labor. Some joined [[Andrey Vlasov|Andrey Vlasov's]] [[Russian Liberation Army|Liberation Army]] to fight for the Germans.\n\nLabor education detainees (''Arbeitserziehung H\u00e4ftling'') wore a white letter A on their black triangle. This stood for ''Arbeitsscheuer'' (work-shy person), designating as lazy social undesirables like Gypsies, petty criminals (e.g. prostitutes and pickpockets), alcoholics/drug addicts and vagrants. They were usually assigned to work at labor camps.\n\n''Asoziale'' (anti-socials) inmates wore a plain black triangle. They were considered either too \"selfish\" or \"deviant\" to contribute to society or were considered too impaired to support themselves. They were therefore considered a burden. This category included pacifists and conscription resisters, petty or habitual criminals, the mentally ill and the mentally and/or physically disabled. They were usually executed or euthanized.\n\nThe Wehrmacht ''[[Strafbattalion]]'' (punishment battalion) and SS ''Bew\u00e4hrungstruppe'' (probation company) were military punishment units. They consisted of [[Wehrmacht]] and SS military criminals, SS personnel convicted by an Honor Court of bad conduct and civilian criminals for which military service was either the assigned punishment or a voluntary replacement of imprisonment. They wore regular uniforms, but were forbidden rank or unit insignia until they had proven themselves in combat. They wore an uninverted (point-upwards) red triangle on their upper sleeves to indicate their status. Most were used for hard labor, \"special tasks\" (unwanted dangerous jobs like defusing landmines or running phone cables) or were used as [[forlorn hope]]s or [[cannon fodder]]. The infamous [[Dirlewanger Brigade]] was an example of a regular unit created from such personnel.\n\nA ''Strafkompanie'' (punishment company) was a hard labor unit in the camps. Inmates assigned to it wore a black roundel bordered white under their triangle patch.\n\nPrisoners \"suspected of [attempting to] escape\" (''Fluchtverd\u00e4chtiger'') wore a red roundel bordered white under their triangle patch. If also assigned to hard labor, they wore the red roundel under their black ''Strafkompanie'' roundel.\n\nA prisoner-functionary (''Funktionsh\u00e4ftling''), or ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' (boss), wore a cloth [[brassard]] (their ''Kennzeichen'', or identifying mark) to indicate their status. They served as camp guards (''Lagerpolizei''), barracks clerks (''Blockschreiber'') and the senior prisoners (''\u00e4ltesten'', meaning elders) at the camp (''lager\u00e4ltester''), barracks (''block\u00e4ltester'') and room (''stuben\u00e4ltester'') levels of camp organization. They received privileges like bigger and sometimes better food rations, better quarters (or even a private room), luxuries (like tobacco or alcohol) and access to the camp's facilities (like the showers or the pool). Failure to please their captors meant demotion and loss of privileges and an almost certain death at the hands of their fellow inmates.\n\nDetainees wearing civilian clothing (more common later in the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent X on the back.<ref name=Saidel>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zglu2RvoLmgC&lpg=PA76&ots=ElAQpjF6Aw&dq=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&f=false|title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp|author=Rochelle G.

Most triangles are plain while some others bear [[Nazi concentration camp badges#Other badges|nationality-letters]]. The otherwise potentially puzzling designs are a direct reference to the identification patches used in the camps. On such monuments, typically an inverted (point down, base up) triangle (especially if red) evokes all victims, including also the [[Holocaust#Non-Jewish|non-Jewish victims]] like Slavs, Poles, communists, homosexuals, [[Romani people|Roma and Sinti]] (see [[Porajmos]]), the handicapped (see [[Action T4]]) Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]].  An inverted triangle colored pink would symbolize gay male victims.  A non-inverted (base down, point up) triangle and/or a yellow triangle is generally more evocative of the Jewish victims.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Some examples of camp triangle emblems on monuments and related uses\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:KZ Sachsenhausen - zentrales Mahnmal.JPG|At [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]\nFile:Todesmarsch Gedenkstein Breitenfeld.JPG|A [[Mittelbau-Dora|Dora]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] roadside tablet marked only with the date and a red triangle\nFile:Holocaust Memorial in Estonia.jpg|On the [[Klooga concentration camp|Klooga]] Jewish victims' memorial\nFile:Crawinkel Gedenktafel.JPG|On a [[Buchenwald]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] route historical marker\nFile:Death March Memorial Plaque, Oranienburg.jpg|On a [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] death march route [[historical marker]]\nFile:Belower-Damm-Wittstock-Dosse-Mahnmal.jpg|Monument (in the village of [[Grabow-Below]]) for [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] death march victims\nFile:Denkmal KZ Woebbelin4.jpg|On a [[W\u00f6bbelin concentration camp|W\u00f6bbelin]] memorial stone\nFile:Gedenkst\u00e4tte_Lindenring_(2).jpg|Boulder (in Lindenring) for 2,000 women victims of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]]\nFile:Cenoteph of Cap Arcona.JPG|On a ''[[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|Cap Arcona]]'' incident memorial\nFile:Neustadt-Glewe VVN-Denkmal 2008-01-03.jpg|At the [[Neustadt-Glewe]] concentration camp memorial\nFile:French monument Mauthausen 1243.JPG|F-triangle at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen-Gusen]] honors French victims\nFile:Croix du Prisonnier Politique 1940-1945.jpg|B-triangle incorporated into the Belgian [[Political Prisoner's Cross 1940\u20131945|Political Prisoner's Cross]]\nFile:KZ-Hinzert-Plakette-Nacht-und-Nebel.jpg|F-triangle at [[Hinzert concentration camp|Hinzert]] honors French victims, especially of the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' program\nFile:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1973, MiNr 1878.jpg|On a [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] memorial (pictured on an East German stamp).\nFile:Han Seelhorst Mahnmal KZ Opfer 01.PNG|On a monument to [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] victims in [[Hamburg]], where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters, but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Ludwigsfelde Friedhof Gedenkstein Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer.JPG|On a memorial to victims killed at Genshagen (right panel), where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Denkmal f\u00fcr die Opfer der NS-Konzentrationslager Zgorzelec.JPG|P-triangle at a Zgorzelec memorial\nFile:Krzy\u017c O\u015bwi\u0119cimski-awers.jpg|P-triangle on the [[Auschwitz Cross|Polish medal for camp victims]]\nFile:Memorial with Prisoners Triangle Badges and Star of David Badge - Dachau Concentration Camp Site - Dachau - Bavaria - Germany.jpg|Various badges on a [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] memorial{{note|Photo by Adam Jones.}}\nFile:In memory of homosexual.JPG|[[Pink triangle]] (''Rosa Winkel'' in German) memorial for gay men killed at [[Buchenwald]]\nFile:Gedenktafel Rosa Winkel Nollendorfplatz.jpg|In the Berlin [[Nollendorfplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Nollendorfplatz subway station]], a pink triangle plaque honors gay male victims{{note|Photo by Manfred Brueckels.}}\nFile:Ac.homomonument.jpg|Amsterdam's ''[[Homomonument]]'' uses pink triangles symbolically to memorialize gay men killed in the [[Holocaust]] and also victims of [[Gay bashing|anti-gay violence generally]]\nFile:Pink triangle on Twin Peaks (19055079410).jpg|Every year, a pink triangle is erected on [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco)|Twin Peaks]] in San Francisco during [[San Francisco Pride|Pride weekend]].\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Richard Plant (1988).

It is generally estimated to have been spoken around 2,500 to 3,000 years ago,{{sfn|Goddard|1978|p=587}} but on the question of where it was spoken, there is less agreement. The Algonquian family, which is a branch of the larger [[Algic languages|Algic language family]], is usually divided into three subgroups: [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]], which is a [[historical linguistics|genetic]] subgroup, and [[Central Algonquian languages|Central Algonquian]] and [[Plains Algonquian languages|Plains Algonquian]], both of which are [[Sprachbund|areal]] groupings. In the historical linguistics of North America, Proto-Algonquian is one of the best studied, most thoroughly reconstructed proto-languages.{{sfn|Campbell|2004|p=185}}{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=70}} It is descended from [[Proto-Algic]].\n\n==History of research==\nMost Algonquian languages are similar enough that their relatedness has been recognized for centuries and was commented on by the early English and French colonists and explorers. For example, in 1787 (over a decade before [[William Jones (philologist)#Scholarly contributions|Sir William Jones' famous speech]] on Indo-European), the theologian and linguist [[Jonathan Edwards (the younger)|Jonathan Edwards Jr.]] deduced that the Algonquian languages of the eastern and central United States were \"radically the same\" ('radically' meaning having a common 'root', since ''radix'' is Latin for 'root'), and contrasted them with the neighboring [[Iroquoian languages]].{{sfn|Campbell|1997|pp=29-30}} The earliest work on reconstructing the Algonquian proto-language was undertaken by the linguists [[Truman Michelson]] and [[Leonard Bloomfield]]. In 1925 Bloomfield reconstructed what he called \"Primitive Central Algonquian\", using what were at the time the four best-attested Algonquian languages: [[Fox language|Fox]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Menominee language|Menominee]], and [[Plains Cree language|Plains Cree]].{{sfn|Thomason|2006|pp=190-191}} Following his initial reconstructions, investigations of other languages revealed that his \"Primitive Central Algonquian\" was essentially equivalent to Proto-Algonquian.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=85-86}} Bloomfield wrote a refinement and expansion of his reconstruction in 1946, and his two papers remain the starting point for all research and reconstructions of Proto-Algonquian.{{sfn|Thomason|2006|pp=190-191}}{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=70-71}} In the years since there has been an enormous amount of comparative work undertaken on the Algonquian family.{{sfn|Goddard|1990|p=99}}\n\n==Urheimat==\nThere remains some disagreement over the Algonquian ''[[Urheimat]]'' (homeland of the protolanguage). The initial theory, first put forth by [[Frank T. Siebert, Jr.]] in 1967 based on examining of the ranges of numerous species of plants and animals for which reliable Algonquian [[cognate]]s existed, holds that Proto-Algonquian was spoken between [[Georgian Bay, Ontario|Georgian Bay]] and [[Lake Ontario]], in [[Ontario]], Canada, and at least as far south as [[Niagara Falls]]. Research a generation later suggests that in fact it was spoken farther west than this, perhaps \"somewhere immediately west of [[Lake Superior]].\"{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=207}}\n\n==Phonology==\n===Vowels===\nProto-Algonquian had four basic vowels, ''*i'', ''*e'', ''*a'', ''*o'', each of which had a [[Vowel length|long]] counterpart (commonly written ''*i\u00b7'', ''*e\u00b7'', ''*a\u00b7'', ''*o\u00b7''), for a total of eight vowels. The same inventory of eight vowels was found in Proto-Algic, but Proto-Algonquian did not inherit its inventory directly from Proto-Algic. Rather, several sound changes left pre-Proto-Algonquian without short *''i'' and *''o''.<ref name=\"Proulx 2004 vowels\">{{cite journal | last1 = Proulx | first1 = Paul | year = 2004 | title = Proto-Algic VI: Conditioned Yurok reflexes of Proto-Algic vowels | url = | journal = Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 124\u2013138 }}</ref> It is not clear that they had redeveloped by the time of Proto-Algonquian. All instances in which Bloomfield reconstructed ''*o'' can now be reconstructed as ''*we'' based on evidence from some of the Eastern languages (for example, Bloomfield's ''*nekotwi'' \"one\" is now reconstructed as ''*nekwetwi'' based on forms like [[Munsee language|Munsee]] ''nkw\u00fati'').{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=75}} There are still a handful of instances where ''*o'' can be reconstructed, usually as the result of a [[Morphophonology|morphophonological]] process of vowel shortening. Goddard concludes that \"an independent phoneme ''*o'' is of no great antiquity in Proto-Algonquian\",{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=75}} but recommends continuing to use it in reconstructions. Likewise, Berman states that \"PA ''*i'' is probably also of recent origin\", derived from earlier (pre-Proto-Algonquian) ''*ye'' sequences and morphophonological shortening.{{sfn|Berman|1982|p=414}}\n\n===Consonants===\nProto-Algonquian had a smaller number of consonants than Proto-Algic. The reconstructed consonants are as follows (given in the [[Americanist phonetic notation]] common in the literature):{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PA Consonant Phonemes\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]/<br>[[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! colspan=2|[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''p'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''t'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u010d''' {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k'''\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!

[[Approximant]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''w'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''r or l'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''y''' {{IPA|[j]}}\n|\n|\n|}\n\nThe phoneme given in the table as \u27e8r\u27e9 was reconstructed by Bloomfield as ''*l'', but Goddard has more recently argued that it should be reconstructed as ''*r'', largely because the earliest attestations of the majority of languages show some sort of rhotic as its reflex, which in many languages subsequently changed to a lateral within the historical period.{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=204-205}} The precise pronunciation of the phoneme written \u27e8\u03b8\u27e9 is unknown. It has merged with the reflex of ''*r'' in all Algonquian languages except for [[Cree language|Cree]] and the [[Arapahoan languages]].{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=87}}{{sfn|Pentland|2006|p=163}} [[Leonard Bloomfield]] originally suggested that it could have been either an [[interdental]] fricative or a [[Voiceless lateral fricative|lateral fricative]]. One piece of evidence for the interdental fricative is that this is the reflex it has in Arapaho.{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=204-205}} However, other researchers have argued for its reconstruction as a lateral fricative, {{IPA|*/\u026c/}}, in part because of the aforementioned merger in most languages with the phoneme traditionally reconstructed as ''*l''.{{sfn|Picard|1984|p=}}\n\nAs with ''*i'' and ''*o'', it is unclear whether ''*\u010d'' was an independent phoneme in Proto-Algonquian. Almost all instances where ''*\u010d'' is reconstructed are before ''*i'', ''*i\u00b7'', or ''*y'', where it does not contrast with ''*t'' (see below), or are cases of diminutive consonant symbolism.{{sfn|Pentland|2006|p=163}} However, Goddard recommends continuing to write it in reconstructions, since it seems to have been present in the clusters ''*\u010dp'' and ''*\u010dk''; since it can be reconstructed before ''*a'' in the term ''*\u010dapo\u00b7nk-'' \"splash\"; and since ''*t'' does appear before ''*i\u00b7'' in some reconstructions of the onomatopoeic noun ''ti\u00b7nti\u00b7wa'' \"blue jay\" (however, see [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Algonquian/ti\u00b7nti\u00b7wa|Wiktionary]] for more).{{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=73-74}}\n\n===Clusters===\nReconstruction of the consonant clusters has been relatively difficult, and the paths the clusters take in their evolutions to the daughter languages have been complex.

Goddard argues that Bloomfield's arbitrary symbol \u27e8x\u27e9 be reconstructed as ''*s'', and Bloomfield's \u27e8\u00e7\u27e9 be reconstructed as ''*r''.{{sfn|Goddard|1994b|pp=205-206}} While a glottal stop phoneme is not otherwise reconstructed, given that Bloomfield's \u27e8\u0294\u27e9 in clusters seems to represent the neutralization of ''*p'' and ''*k'' and its realization in Menominee and Cheyenne is a glottal stop, it probably was indeed phonetically {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.{{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=77-78}}{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}} The cluster written \u27e8Hm\u27e9 shows up as ''p'' or ''m'' in most of the daughter languages, but as ''hm'' in [[Munsee language|Munsee]] (for example, PA ''*wi\u00b7kiwa\u00b7Hmi'' \"house\" becomes Ojibwe ''wiigiwaam'', Fox ''w\u00eekiy\u00e2pi'', and Munsee ''w\u00edikwahm'').{{sfn|Goddard|1967|p=87}}{{sfn|Goddard|1974b|pp=326-327}} The first member of the cluster may have been either *h or {{IPA|*\u0294}}.{{sfn|Goddard|1974b|pp=322}}\n\nThe clusters ''*\u0161t'' and ''*hr'' are each reconstructed on the basis of only a single correspondence set (''*\u0161t'' in ''*we\u0161tikwa\u00b7ni'', \"his/her head\"; and ''*hr'' in ''*re\u00b7hre\u00b7wa'', \"s/he breathes\"){{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=71-72}}{{sfn|Pentland|1977|p=}} and may not have been part of Proto-Algonquian. David Pentland, for example, argued that Ojibwe ''oshtigwaan'', claimed as the only form requiring the reconstruction of ''*\u0161t'', is a borrowing from Cree.{{sfn|Pentland|1977|p=}} However, evidence from Munsee and [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]] seem to also point toward ''*\u0161t'' as a valid separate cluster in PA (Munsee ''w\u00ecil\u00f9sht\u00edikan'', Blackfoot ''mo\u2019tok\u00e1\u00e1ni'', \"head, hair\").{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=107}}{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=282}}\n\nFinally, all consonants and consonant clusters could be followed by ''*w'' or ''*y'' (although the sequences ''*\u010dw'' and ''*hy'' did not occur; and ''*t'' and ''*\u03b8'' were regularly replaced before ''*y'', for which see below).{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=72}}\n\n===Phonological processes===\nSeveral [[Allophone|allophonic]] processes, [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] processes, and [[Phonotactics|phonological constraints]] can be reconstructed. Among the most significant of these processes was that ''*t'' and ''*\u03b8'' became ''*\u010d'' and ''*\u0161'' respectively before ''*i'', ''*i\u00b7'', and ''*y''.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=92}} For example, the initial ''*went-'' \"from there\" (as in ''*wentenamwa'' \"s/he takes it from there\") is realized as ''*wen\u010d-'' in the word ''*wen\u010di\u00b7wa'' \"s/he comes from there\", since it precedes ''*i\u00b7''.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=86, 89, 92}}\n\nThere were several restrictions on phonotactics and the shape of the PA word that can be reconstructed. All words began with a single consonant (other than ''*h'') or vowel, or with a consonant plus ''*w'' or ''*y''; there were no sequences of consecutive vowels; and the word always ended in a short vowel. The vowels ''*i'' and ''*o'' never occurred in initial syllables.{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=72}} A sequence of consonant+semivowel could not be followed by ''*o'' or ''*o\u00b7''.{{sfn|Goddard|1974a|p=}} There was also a restriction which prevented two-syllable nouns from ending in a sequence of short vowel + consonant + short vowel.{{sfn|Berman|1992|p=}}\n\nIn most cases, when the pronominal prefixes ''*ne-'' (first person), ''*ke-'' (second person), and ''*we-'' (third person) were added to a vowel-initial stem, an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''*-t-'' was inserted between the prefix and the stem. Thus, the prefixes became ''*net-'', ''*ket-'', and ''*wet-'' respectively.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=95}} For example, ''*ne-'' + ''*-ehkwa-'' = ''*netehkwa-'' \"my louse\". This feature goes back to [[Proto-Algic]] (compare [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]] ''du-'' + ''h\u00edkw'' = ''dut\u00edkw'' \"my louse\").{{sfn|Campbell|Poser|2008|p=178}} There were a handful of irregular exceptions to this pattern, however. For example, the prefixes lost their vowels before several kinship terms, as in ''*ne-'' + ''*-o\u00b7hkomehsa'' = ''*no\u00b7hkomehsa'' \"my grandmother.\"{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=91, 96}}\n\n[[File:Algonquian langs.png|thumb|360px|Approximate distribution of the Algonquian languages when first encountered by Europeans]]\nSeveral rules for [[Sandhi|internal sandhi]] in morpheme combinations can be reconstructed. The most basic was the insertion of a \"connective i\" between two consonants. For example, ''*po\u00b7n-'' \"cease\" + ''*-m'' \"act by speech on an animate object\" = ''*po\u00b7n'''i'''me\u00b7wa'' \"s/he stops talking to him/her.\" {{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=90-91}}{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=192}} In a few idiosyncratic cases, however, this rule did not operate, and instead the consonants were changed in various ways. For instance, the combination ''\u03b8+p'' produced when the root ''*e\u03b8-'' \"thither, thus\" was added to the final ''*-pahto\u00b7'' \"run\" simplified to ''*xp'': ''*expahta\u00b7wa'' \"s/he runs thither.\" One regular exception to the \"connective i\" rule was when the conjunct suffix ''*-ki'' was added to a verb stem ending in a consonant, for example ''*ki\u00b7\u0161ekat-'' \"be day\" + ''*-ki'' = ''*ki\u00b7\u0161ekaxki'' \"when it is day.\" {{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=91}} Note that Bloomfield here actually reconstructed this word as ''*ki\u00b7\u0161eka\u03b8ki'', but evidence from other Algonquian languages has shown that the cluster should be reconstructed as ''*xk''.{{sfn|Proulx|1984a|p=168, note 2}} When two vowels became contiguous, if one was a long vowel and one was short, the short vowel dropped: ''*naka\u00b7-'' \"stop\" + ''*-en'' \"by hand\" = ''*naka\u00b7ne\u00b7wa'' \"s/he stops him/her by hand.\" If both were long, an epenthetic ''*y'' was inserted between the two.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=93}}\n\n==Grammar==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2011}}\nProto-Algonquian nouns had an [[Animacy|animate/inanimate]] contrast: nouns representing animate beings (and some traditional items viewed as having spiritual powers) were classed as ''animate'', while all other nouns were ''inanimate''. The plural marker differed in form depending on whether the noun was animate or inanimate: animate nouns took a plural suffix ''*-aki'', while inanimate nouns took a plural suffix ''*-ari''. Another important distinction involved the contrast between nouns marked as ''proximate'' and those marked as ''[[obviative]]''. Proximate nouns were those deemed most central or important to the discourse, while obviative nouns were those less important to the discourse. When two third person participants appeared in a sentence, one was marked as proximate and the other as obviative, in order to distinguish which one was the subject and which was the object (since verbs inflected for whether they had a proximate or obviative subject and a proximate or obviative object).  In a given stretch of discourse, there will not be two proximate or two obviative participants.{{sfn|Hockett|1966|p=60}}\n\nThere were personal pronouns which distinguished three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive first person plural]], and proximate and obviative third persons. Demonstrative pronouns have been more difficult to reconstruct, as many of the daughter languages have innovated a great deal.\n\nPA had four classes of verbs: [[Transitive verb|transitive]] verbs with an animate object (abbreviated TA), transitive verbs with an inanimate object (TI), [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] verbs with an animate subject (AI), and intransitive verbs with an inanimate subject (II). Transitive verbs had two paradigms, termed ''objective'' and ''absolute''. Objective verbs were used when the object of the verb was not present as an overt noun elsewhere in the sentence, while absolute verbs were used when the object of the verb ''was'' marked with an overt noun in the sentence. Objective verbs could also be used when an object was present, and in such cases indicated that the object was [[Definiteness|definite]], as opposed to indefinite.<ref>The verb system is surveyed by Hockett (1966) with particular reference to [[Potawatomi]];  see also Teeter (1965) and Weggelaar (1974).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Algonquian languages]]\n**[[Plains Algonquian languages]]\n**[[Central Algonquian languages]]\n**[[Eastern Algonquian languages]]\n*[[Algic languages]]\n*[[Algonquian sound laws]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=1982 |title=Two Phonological Innovations in Ritwan |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=412\u2013420 |jstor=1264843 |doi=10.1086/465750}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=1990 |title=New Algonquian\u2013Ritwan Cognate Sets |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=431\u2013434 |jstor=1265518 |doi=10.1086/466168}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=1992 |title=A Restriction on the Shape of Proto-Algonquian Nouns |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=321\u2013323 |jstor=3519790}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=2006 |title=Studies in Blackfoot Prehistory |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=264\u2013284 |jstor= |doi=10.1086/507167}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Bloomfield |year=1925 |title=On the Sound System of Central Algonquian |journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]] |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=130\u2013156 |jstor=409540}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard |editor1-first=Harry |editor1-last=Hoijer |editor1-link=Harry Hoijer |editor2-last=Osgood |editor2-first=Cornelius|year=1946 |title=Linguistic Structures of Native America |contribution=Algonquian |series=Viking Fund Publications in Anthropology, 6 |place=New York |pages=85\u2013129 |asin=B002M3AJEA}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Campbell|first=Lyle |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |year=1997 |title=American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509427-5}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Campbell|first=Lyle |year=2004 |title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=2nd |publisher=The MIT Press |place=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-262-53267-9}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Campbell|first1=Lyle |last2=Poser|first2=William J. |authorlink2=William Poser |year=2008 |title=Language Classification: History and Method |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-88005-3 |lastauthoramp=y}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Goddard|first=Ives |authorlink=Ives Goddard |year=1967 |title=Contributions to Anthropology: Linguistics I (Algonquian) |contribution=The Algonquian Independent Indicative |publisher=National Museum of Canada, Bulletin 214 |place=Ottawa |series=Anthropological Series 78 |pages=66\u2013106 |oclc=102526}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Goddard|first=Ives |year=1974a |title=An Outline of the Historical Phonology of Arapaho and Atsina |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=102\u2013116 |jstor=1264344 |doi=10.1086/465292}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Goddard|first=Ives |year=1974b |title=Remarks on the Algonquian Independent Indicative |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=317\u2013327 |jstor=1265006 |doi=10.1086/465328}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Goddard|first=Ives |year=1978 |chapter=Central Algonquian Languages |editor-last=Trigger |editor-first=Bruce G. |editor2=William C.

For example, in 1787 (over a decade before [[William Jones (philologist)#Scholarly contributions|Sir William Jones' famous speech]] on Indo-European), the theologian and linguist [[Jonathan Edwards (the younger)|Jonathan Edwards Jr.]] deduced that the Algonquian languages of the eastern and central United States were \"radically the same\" ('radically' meaning having a common 'root', since ''radix'' is Latin for 'root'), and contrasted them with the neighboring [[Iroquoian languages]].{{sfn|Campbell|1997|pp=29-30}} The earliest work on reconstructing the Algonquian proto-language was undertaken by the linguists [[Truman Michelson]] and [[Leonard Bloomfield]]. In 1925 Bloomfield reconstructed what he called \"Primitive Central Algonquian\", using what were at the time the four best-attested Algonquian languages: [[Fox language|Fox]], [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Menominee language|Menominee]], and [[Plains Cree language|Plains Cree]].{{sfn|Thomason|2006|pp=190-191}} Following his initial reconstructions, investigations of other languages revealed that his \"Primitive Central Algonquian\" was essentially equivalent to Proto-Algonquian.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=85-86}} Bloomfield wrote a refinement and expansion of his reconstruction in 1946, and his two papers remain the starting point for all research and reconstructions of Proto-Algonquian.{{sfn|Thomason|2006|pp=190-191}}{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=70-71}} In the years since there has been an enormous amount of comparative work undertaken on the Algonquian family.{{sfn|Goddard|1990|p=99}}\n\n==Urheimat==\nThere remains some disagreement over the Algonquian ''[[Urheimat]]'' (homeland of the protolanguage). The initial theory, first put forth by [[Frank T. Siebert, Jr.]] in 1967 based on examining of the ranges of numerous species of plants and animals for which reliable Algonquian [[cognate]]s existed, holds that Proto-Algonquian was spoken between [[Georgian Bay, Ontario|Georgian Bay]] and [[Lake Ontario]], in [[Ontario]], Canada, and at least as far south as [[Niagara Falls]]. Research a generation later suggests that in fact it was spoken farther west than this, perhaps \"somewhere immediately west of [[Lake Superior]].\"{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=207}}\n\n==Phonology==\n===Vowels===\nProto-Algonquian had four basic vowels, ''*i'', ''*e'', ''*a'', ''*o'', each of which had a [[Vowel length|long]] counterpart (commonly written ''*i\u00b7'', ''*e\u00b7'', ''*a\u00b7'', ''*o\u00b7''), for a total of eight vowels. The same inventory of eight vowels was found in Proto-Algic, but Proto-Algonquian did not inherit its inventory directly from Proto-Algic. Rather, several sound changes left pre-Proto-Algonquian without short *''i'' and *''o''.<ref name=\"Proulx 2004 vowels\">Paul Proulx, ''Proto-Algic VI: Conditioned Yurok reflexes of Proto-Algic vowels'', ''Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics'' 27:124\u2013138 (2004)</ref> It is not clear that they had redeveloped by the time of Proto-Algonquian. All instances in which Bloomfield reconstructed ''*o'' can now be reconstructed as ''*we'' based on evidence from some of the Eastern languages (for example, Bloomfield's ''*nekotwi'' \"one\" is now reconstructed as ''*nekwetwi'' based on forms like [[Munsee language|Munsee]] ''nkw\u00fati'').{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=75}} There are still a handful of instances where ''*o'' can be reconstructed, usually as the result of a [[Morphophonology|morphophonological]] process of vowel shortening. Goddard concludes that \"an independent phoneme ''*o'' is of no great antiquity in Proto-Algonquian\",{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=75}} but recommends continuing to use it in reconstructions. Likewise, Berman states that \"PA ''*i'' is probably also of recent origin\", derived from earlier (pre-Proto-Algonquian) ''*ye'' sequences and morphophonological shortening.{{sfn|Berman|1982|p=414}}\n\n===Consonants===\nProto-Algonquian had a smaller number of consonants than Proto-Algic. The reconstructed consonants are as follows (given in the [[Americanist phonetic notation]] common in the literature):{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PA Consonant Phonemes\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]/<br>[[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! colspan=2|[[Plosive consonant|Plosive]]\n| align=\"center\"|'''p'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''t'''\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u010d''' {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k'''\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!

It has merged with the reflex of ''*r'' in all Algonquian languages except for [[Cree language|Cree]] and the [[Arapahoan languages]].{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=87}}{{sfn|Pentland|2006|p=163}} [[Leonard Bloomfield]] originally suggested that it could have been either an [[interdental]] fricative or a [[Voiceless lateral fricative|lateral fricative]]. One piece of evidence for the interdental fricative is that this is the reflex it has in Arapaho.{{sfn|Goddard|1994|p=204-205}} However, other researchers have argued for its reconstruction as a lateral fricative, {{IPA|*/\u026c/}}, in part because of the aforementioned merger in most languages with the phoneme traditionally reconstructed as ''*l''.{{sfn|Picard|1984|p=}}\n\nAs with ''*i'' and ''*o'', it is unclear whether ''*\u010d'' was an independent phoneme in Proto-Algonquian. Almost all instances where ''*\u010d'' is reconstructed are before ''*i'', ''*i\u00b7'', or ''*y'', where it does not contrast with ''*t'' (see below), or are cases of diminutive consonant symbolism.{{sfn|Pentland|2006|p=163}} However, Goddard recommends continuing to write it in reconstructions, since it seems to have been present in the clusters ''*\u010dp'' and ''*\u010dk''; since it can be reconstructed before ''*a'' in the term ''*\u010dapo\u00b7nk-'' \"splash\"; and since ''*t'' does appear before ''*i\u00b7'' in some reconstructions of the onomatopoeic noun ''ti\u00b7nti\u00b7wa'' \"blue jay\" (however, see [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Algonquian/ti\u00b7nti\u00b7wa|Wiktionary]] for more).{{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=73-74}}\n\n===Clusters===\nReconstruction of the consonant clusters has been relatively difficult, and the paths the clusters take in their evolutions to the daughter languages have been complex. The current view is that the permissible consonant clusters were (first member on the left, second member across the top):{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PA Consonant Clusters\n|-\n! \n! p\n! k\n! t\n! \u010d\n! \u03b8\n! s\n! \u0161\n! r\n! m\n|-\n! &nbsp; {{IPA|\u0294}} &nbsp;\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|''{{IPA|*\u0294}}t''\n| align=\"center\"|''{{IPA|*\u0294}}\u010d''\n| align=\"center\"|''{{IPA|*\u0294}}\u03b8''\n| align=\"center\"|''{{IPA|*\u0294}}s''\n| align=\"center\"|''{{IPA|*\u0294}}\u0161''\n| align=\"center\"|''{{IPA|*\u0294}}r''\n| rowspan=2 align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*Hm''&nbsp;\n|-\n! h\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*hp''&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*hk''&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*ht''&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*h\u010d''&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*h\u03b8''&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*hs''&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''*h\u0161''&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\"|&nbsp;''(*hr)''&nbsp;\n|-\n!

Goddard argues that Bloomfield's arbitrary symbol \u27e8x\u27e9 be reconstructed as ''*s'', and Bloomfield's \u27e8\u00e7\u27e9 be reconstructed as ''*r''.{{sfn|Goddard|1994b|pp=205-206}} While a glottal stop phoneme is not otherwise reconstructed, given that Bloomfield's \u27e8\u0294\u27e9 in clusters seems to represent the neutralization of ''*p'' and ''*k'' and its realization in Menominee and Cheyenne is a glottal stop, it probably was indeed phonetically {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.{{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=77-78}}{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=191}} The cluster written \u27e8Hm\u27e9 shows up as ''p'' or ''m'' in most of the daughter languages, but as ''hm'' in [[Munsee language|Munsee]] (for example, PA ''*wi\u00b7kiwa\u00b7Hmi'' \"house\" becomes Ojibwe ''wiigiwaam'', Fox ''w\u00eekiy\u00e2pi'', and Munsee ''w\u00edikwahm'').{{sfn|Goddard|1967|p=87}}{{sfn|Goddard|1974b|pp=326-327}} The first member of the cluster may have been either *h or {{IPA|*\u0294}}.{{sfn|Goddard|1974b|pp=322}}\n\nThe clusters ''*\u0161t'' and ''*hr'' are each reconstructed on the basis of only a single correspondence set (''*\u0161t'' in ''*we\u0161tikwa\u00b7ni'', \"his/her head\"; and ''*hr'' in ''*re\u00b7hre\u00b7wa'', \"s/he breathes\"){{sfn|Goddard|1979|pp=71-72}}{{sfn|Pentland|1977|p=}} and may not have been part of Proto-Algonquian. David Pentland, for example, argued that Ojibwe ''oshtigwaan'', claimed as the only form requiring the reconstruction of ''*\u0161t'', is a borrowing from Cree.{{sfn|Pentland|1977|p=}} However, evidence from Munsee and [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]] seem to also point toward ''*\u0161t'' as a valid separate cluster in PA (Munsee ''w\u00ecil\u00f9sht\u00edikan'', Blackfoot ''mo\u2019tok\u00e1\u00e1ni'', \"head, hair\").{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=107}}{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=282}}\n\nFinally, all consonants and consonant clusters could be followed by ''*w'' or ''*y'' (although the sequences ''*\u010dw'' and ''*hy'' did not occur; and ''*t'' and ''*\u03b8'' were regularly replaced before ''*y'', for which see below).{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=72}}\n\n===Phonological processes===\nSeveral [[Allophone|allophonic]] processes, [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] processes, and [[Phonotactics|phonological constraints]] can be reconstructed. Among the most significant of these processes was that ''*t'' and ''*\u03b8'' became ''*\u010d'' and ''*\u0161'' respectively before ''*i'', ''*i\u00b7'', and ''*y''.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=92}} For example, the initial ''*went-'' \"from there\" (as in ''*wentenamwa'' \"s/he takes it from there\") is realized as ''*wen\u010d-'' in the word ''*wen\u010di\u00b7wa'' \"s/he comes from there\", since it precedes ''*i\u00b7''.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=86, 89, 92}}\n\nThere were several restrictions on phonotactics and the shape of the PA word that can be reconstructed. All words began with a single consonant (other than ''*h'') or vowel, or with a consonant plus ''*w'' or ''*y''; there were no sequences of consecutive vowels; and the word always ended in a short vowel. The vowels ''*i'' and ''*o'' never occurred in initial syllables.{{sfn|Goddard|1979|p=72}} A sequence of consonant+semivowel could not be followed by ''*o'' or ''*o\u00b7''.{{sfn|Goddard|1974a|p=}} There was also a restriction which prevented two-syllable nouns from ending in a sequence of short vowel + consonant + short vowel.{{sfn|Berman|1992|p=}}\n\nIn most cases, when the pronominal prefixes ''*ne-'' (first person), ''*ke-'' (second person), and ''*we-'' (third person) were added to a vowel-initial stem, an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''*-t-'' was inserted between the prefix and the stem. Thus, the prefixes became ''*net-'', ''*ket-'', and ''*wet-'' respectively.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=95}} For example, ''*ne-'' + ''*-ehkwa-'' = ''*netehkwa-'' \"my louse\". This feature goes back to [[Proto-Algic]] (compare [[Wiyot language|Wiyot]] ''du-'' + ''h\u00edkw'' = ''dut\u00edkw'' \"my louse\").{{sfn|Campbell|Poser|2008|p=178}} There were a handful of irregular exceptions to this pattern, however. For example, the prefixes lost their vowels before several kinship terms, as in ''*ne-'' + ''*-o\u00b7hkomehsa'' = ''*no\u00b7hkomehsa'' \"my grandmother.\"{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=91, 96}}\n\n[[File:Algonquian langs.png|thumb|360px|Approximate distribution of the Algonquian languages when first encountered by Europeans]]\nSeveral rules for [[Sandhi|internal sandhi]] in morpheme combinations can be reconstructed. The most basic was the insertion of a \"connective i\" between two consonants. For example, ''*po\u00b7n-'' \"cease\" + ''*-m'' \"act by speech on an animate object\" = ''*po\u00b7n'''i'''me\u00b7wa'' \"s/he stops talking to him/her.\" {{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|pp=90-91}}{{sfn|Thomason|2006|p=192}} In a few idiosyncratic cases, however, this rule did not operate, and instead the consonants were changed in various ways. For instance, the combination ''\u03b8+p'' produced when the root ''*e\u03b8-'' \"thither, thus\" was added to the final ''*-pahto\u00b7'' \"run\" simplified to ''*xp'': ''*expahta\u00b7wa'' \"s/he runs thither.\" One regular exception to the \"connective i\" rule was when the conjunct suffix ''*-ki'' was added to a verb stem ending in a consonant, for example ''*ki\u00b7\u0161ekat-'' \"be day\" + ''*-ki'' = ''*ki\u00b7\u0161ekaxki'' \"when it is day.\" {{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=91}} Note that Bloomfield here actually reconstructed this word as ''*ki\u00b7\u0161eka\u03b8ki'', but evidence from other Algonquian languages has shown that the cluster should be reconstructed as ''*xk''.{{sfn|Proulx|1984a|p=168, note 2}} When two vowels became contiguous, if one was a long vowel and one was short, the short vowel dropped: ''*naka\u00b7-'' \"stop\" + ''*-en'' \"by hand\" = ''*naka\u00b7ne\u00b7wa'' \"s/he stops him/her by hand.\" If both were long, an epenthetic ''*y'' was inserted between the two.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1946|p=93}}\n\n==Grammar==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2011}}\nProto-Algonquian nouns had an [[Animacy|animate/inanimate]] contrast: nouns representing animate beings (and some traditional items viewed as having spiritual powers) were classed as ''animate'', while all other nouns were ''inanimate''. The plural marker differed in form depending on whether the noun was animate or inanimate: animate nouns took a plural suffix ''*-aki'', while inanimate nouns took a plural suffix ''*-ari''. Another important distinction involved the contrast between nouns marked as ''proximate'' and those marked as ''[[obviative]]''. Proximate nouns were those deemed most central or important to the discourse, while obviative nouns were those less important to the discourse. When two third person participants appeared in a sentence, one was marked as proximate and the other as obviative, in order to distinguish which one was the subject and which was the object (since verbs inflected for whether they had a proximate or obviative subject and a proximate or obviative object).  In a given stretch of discourse, there will not be two proximate or two obviative participants.{{sfn|Hockett|1966|p=60}}\n\nThere were personal pronouns which distinguished three persons, two numbers (singular and plural), [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive first person plural]], and proximate and obviative third persons. Demonstrative pronouns have been more difficult to reconstruct, as many of the daughter languages have innovated a great deal.\n\nPA had four classes of verbs: [[Transitive verb|transitive]] verbs with an animate object (abbreviated TA), transitive verbs with an inanimate object (TI), [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] verbs with an animate subject (AI), and intransitive verbs with an inanimate subject (II). Transitive verbs had two paradigms, termed ''objective'' and ''absolute''. Objective verbs were used when the object of the verb was not present as an overt noun elsewhere in the sentence, while absolute verbs were used when the object of the verb ''was'' marked with an overt noun in the sentence. Objective verbs could also be used when an object was present, and in such cases indicated that the object was [[Definiteness|definite]], as opposed to indefinite.<ref>The verb system is surveyed by Hockett (1966) with particular reference to [[Potawatomi]];  see also Teeter (1965) and Weggelaar (1974).</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Algonquian languages]]\n**[[Plains Algonquian languages]]\n**[[Central Algonquian languages]]\n**[[Eastern Algonquian languages]]\n*[[Algic languages]]\n*[[Algonquian sound laws]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=1982 |title=Two Phonological Innovations in Ritwan |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=412\u2013420 |jstor=1264843 |doi=10.1086/465750}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=1990 |title=New Algonquian\u2013Ritwan Cognate Sets |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=431\u2013434 |jstor=1265518 |doi=10.1086/466168}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=1992 |title=A Restriction on the Shape of Proto-Algonquian Nouns |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=321\u2013323 |jstor=3519790}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Berman|first=Howard |year=2006 |title=Studies in Blackfoot Prehistory |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=264\u2013284 |jstor= |doi=10.1086/507167}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Bloomfield |year=1925 |title=On the Sound System of Central Algonquian |journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]] |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=130\u2013156 |jstor=409540}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Bloomfield|first=Leonard |editor1-first=Harry |editor1-last=Hoijer |editor1-link=Harry Hoijer |editor2-last=Osgood |editor2-first=Cornelius|year=1946 |title=Linguistic Structures of Native America |contribution=Algonquian |series=Viking Fund Publications in Anthropology, 6 |place=New York |pages=85\u2013129 |asin=B002M3AJEA}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Campbell|first=Lyle |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |year=1997 |title=American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-509427-5}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Campbell|first=Lyle |year=2004 |title=Historical Linguistics: An Introduction |edition=2nd |publisher=The MIT Press |place=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-262-53267-9}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Campbell|first1=Lyle |last2=Poser|first2=William J. |authorlink2=William Poser |year=2008 |title=Language Classification: History and Method |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-88005-3 |lastauthoramp=y}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Goddard|first=Ives |authorlink=Ives Goddard |year=1967 |title=Contributions to Anthropology: Linguistics I (Algonquian) |contribution=The Algonquian Independent Indicative |publisher=National Museum of Canada, Bulletin 214 |place=Ottawa |series=Anthropological Series 78 |pages=66\u2013106 |oclc=102526}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Goddard|first=Ives |year=1974a |title=An Outline of the Historical Phonology of Arapaho and Atsina |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=102\u2013116 |jstor=1264344 |doi=10.1086/465292}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Goddard|first=Ives |year=1974b |title=Remarks on the Algonquian Independent Indicative |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]] |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=317\u2013327 |jstor=1265006 |doi=10.1086/465328}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Goddard|first=Ives |year=1978 |chapter=Central Algonquian Languages |editor-last=Trigger |editor-first=Bruce G. |editor2=William C.
