The chants can be simple, consisting of a few loud shouts or spoken words, but more often they are short song verses and sometimes longer songs.  They are typically performed repetitively, sometimes accompanied by handclapping, but occasionally they may be more elaborate involving musical instruments, props or choreographed routines. They are often adaptations of popular songs, using their tunes as the basis of the chants, but some are entirely original. Football chants are most often used by fans to encourage the home team or express their pride in the team, and they may be sung to celebrate a particular player or manager. Fans may also use football chants to slight the opposition, and many fans sing songs about their club [[sports rivalry|rivals]], even when they are not playing them. Sometimes the chants are spontaneous reactions to events on the pitch.\n\nFootball chants are known to have been used by fans from the late 19th century onwards, but developed into the current popular forms in the 1960s. Football chants can be historic, dating back as early as the formation of the club popularly sung down the years and considered the anthems for these clubs. They may also be popular for only a relatively short time, with new chants being constantly created and discarded.  The tradition of football chants vary from country to country and team to team, but some chants are common to many clubs and popular internationally. Football chants may be considered one of the last remaining sources of an oral [[Folk music|folk song]] tradition.<ref>Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 ({{ISBN|0-7862-8517-6}})</ref>\n\n==History==\nFootball chants may be considered modern examples of traditional storytelling and folk songs.

The catalyst for the change may be due to a number of factors; one suggestion is the growth and evolution of youth culture in this period which, together with popular music started being played over the public announcement system at matches instead of brass bands, encouraged fans to start their own singing based on popular tunes. Another suggestion is the mixing of fan cultures from different countries through international football competitions that started to be broadcast internationally \u2013 the exposure to intense chanting by South American and Italian fans during the 1962 and 1966 World Cups may have encouraged British fans who were previously more reserved to do the same.<ref name=morris /><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Hoqp2xO7OEC&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A History of Football in 100 Objects |first= Gavin |last=Mortimer|publisher=Serpent's Tail |isbn=9781847659057 }}</ref> They also picked up different type of chants from other countries; [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans for example, may have used a Brazilian hand-clapping chant \"Brazil, cha-cha-cha\" from the television broadcast of the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], and turned it into the \"Li-ver-pool, [clap, clap, clap]\" chant.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEAwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Savage Enthusiasm: A History of Football Fans |first= Paul |last=Brown |page=162 |work= Goal Post|date=2017|isbn=978-0995541221}}</ref> Chants became more extensive, and popular songs became increasingly common as the basis of chants as fans adapted these songs to reflect situations and events relevant to them.

For the [[Indonesia national football team]] one group of fans will chant \"In-Do-Ne-Sia\" with an [[air horn]] and hand clap in response. \"Garuda Di Dadaku\" is sung by fans when Indonesia plays at home.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nPopularised at the [[Sydney Olympics]] and used by Australian football supporters everywhere is the \"[[Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi]]\" chant between two groups of supporters.

The chants can be simple, consisting of a few loud shouts or spoken words, but more often they are short song verses and sometimes longer songs.  They are typically performed repetitively, sometimes accompanied by handclapping, but occasionally they may be more elaborate involving musical instruments, props or choreographed routines. They are often adaptations of popular songs, using their tunes as the basis of the chants, but some are entirely original. Football chants are most often used by fans to encourage the home team or express their pride in the team, and they may be sung to celebrate a particular player or manager. Fans may also use football chants to slight the opposition, and many fans sing songs about their club [[sports rivalry|rivals]], even when they are not playing them. Sometimes the chants are spontaneous reactions to events on the pitch.\n\nFootball chants are known to have been used by fans from the late 19th century onwards, but developed into the current popular forms in the 1960s. Football chants can be historic, dating back as early as the formation of the club popularly sung down the years and considered the anthems for these clubs. They may also be popular for only a relatively short time, with new chants being constantly created and discarded.  The tradition of football chants vary from country to country and team to team, but some chants are common to many clubs and popular internationally. Football chants may be considered one of the last remaining sources of an oral [[Folk music|folk song]] tradition.<ref>Chris Roberts, Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 ({{ISBN|0-7862-8517-6}})</ref>\n\n==History==\nFootball chants may be considered modern examples of traditional storytelling and folk songs.

Another suggestion is the mixing of fan cultures from different countries through international football competitions that started to be broadcast internationally \u2013 the exposure to intense chanting by South American and Italian fans during the 1962 and 1966 World Cups may have encouraged British fans who were previously more reserved to do the same.<ref name=morris /><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Hoqp2xO7OEC&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=A History of Football in 100 Objects |first= Gavin |last=Mortimer|publisher=Serpent's Tail |isbn=9781847659057 }}</ref> They also picked up different type of chants from other countries; [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] fans for example, may have used a Brazilian hand-clapping chant \"Brazil, cha-cha-cha\" from the television broadcast of the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], and turned it into the \"Li-ver-pool, [clap, clap, clap]\" chant.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEAwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Savage Enthusiasm: A History of Football Fans |first= Paul |last=Brown |page=162 |work= Goal Post|date=2017|isbn=978-0995541221}}</ref> Chants became more extensive, and popular songs became increasingly common as the basis of chants as fans adapted these songs to reflect situations and events relevant to them.
