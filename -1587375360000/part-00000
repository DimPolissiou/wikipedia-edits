Spacely's rival, Cogswell, has been stealing Spacely's business ideas - putting their jobs in jeopardy. Spacely blames George - suspecting that he was spying for Cogswell. Spacely orders George to spy on Cogswell to clear his name to avoid getting fired. George finds out that Cogswell's robot computer, S.A.R.A., has been seducing the Spacely robot computer, R.U.D.I., into leaking Mr. Spacely's secrets. George tries to report this to Spacely, but R.U.D.I. sabotages his efforts.\n\nIn the [[Stone Age]], [[Wilma Flintstone|Wilma]] and [[Betty Rubble|Betty]] are trying to convince [[Fred Flintstone]] to have their vacation in Honolurock ([[Honolulu]]), but Fred ignores their advances. Later, at work, Fred tells [[Barney Rubble]] that he plans to take the girls someplace better. He tells Barney that a poker tournament is being held at the Water Buffalo lodge and wants to go, but Mr. Slate shows up and tells them that due to their going on vacation, they must work the late shift because Turk Tarpit, Slate's business rival and nemesis, has been outproducing them. Fred and Barney later disobey Slate's orders and go to the poker tournament. However, after seeing that Slate is playing there too, they disguise themselves. Fred plays against Slate but loses. A spider exposes Barney - and ultimately Fred. Furious that they deceived and disobeyed him, Slate fires Fred and Barney.\n\nBack in the future, Elroy completes his time machine. The Jetsons decide to use it to take a trip to the 25th century to relax. Right before Elroy gets the machine working, his dog, [[Astro (The Jetsons)|Astro]], accidentally sets the switch to \"Past.\"\n\nWith no job, the Flintstones and Rubbles are forced to settle for a camping holiday. As Fred and Barney set up the tent, the Jetsons arrive from the future. Fred and George eventually communicate, and the families become friends. Fred is amazed by George's futuristic gadgets and decides to use them to help Mr. Slate in a competition at the upcoming company picnic. Fred introduces George to Slate - claiming that George is a distant cousin. Slate is reluctant at first to trust George, but since rival businessman Turk Tarpit's cheating has set him back, Slate accepts their help in exchange for giving them their jobs back. George and Fred use future technology to help Slate win several games, but in the last event, Astro's and Dino's actions causes Tarpit to become the winner. In the end, Slate once again fires Fred and Barney.\n\nWhile Mr. Spacely continues to vent over his failing business, Henry Orbit and [[Rosie the Robot Maid]] assemble a \"time machine retriever\" to bring the Jetsons back. But when they turn it on, the time machine returns with the Flintstones instead. Upon seeing they really are [[Caveman|cavemen]], Spacely introduces them to the [[Press media|press]].\n\nStuck in the past, George asks Mr. Slate for a job. Slate initially rejects, but when Tarpit offers George work, Slate immediately makes George his partner, and George soon becomes famous. Using their newfound fame and riches, the Jetsons buy multiple local businesses and are soon overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Mr. Spacely makes Fred the spokesman for his company, but R.U.D.I. leaks this information to S.A.R.A. When Spacely is introducing Fred to some important investors, Cogswell introduces Barney instead - leading to a rift in Fred's and Barney's friendship. Meanwhile, Rosie requests R.U.D.I. to help Henry and her try to fix the time machine to find the Jetsons. S.A.R.A. appears and demands that R.U.D.I. get rid of Rosie before she departs, but R.U.D.I. agrees to do whatever he can to get the Jetsons back and leaves S.A.R.A. for good. They fix the time machine, and Rosie is transported to the Stone Age where she finds her family.\n\nNow able to return home, the Jetsons leave, taking Fred's car with them, after [[Judy Jetson|Judy]] says goodbye to a teen idol - Iggy. Mr. Spacely concocts a plan to use Fred's car as a model for futuristic replicas. Cogswell sends his robotic dog, Sentro, to steal this information since S.A.R.A. is no longer useful when she tells him that R.U.D.I. broke up with her and told her off. The two families manage to stop Sentro - destroying the evidence he had collected. Spacely's business of selling Stone Age style cars becomes successful, and he even agrees to sell one to Cogswell - but not without warning Cogswell that if he copies any part of it, Spacely will sue him and take over his business. Fred and Barney repair their friendship, Spacely lets George keep his job, and George offers his partnership with Mr. Slate to Fred and Barney to give them their jobs back. Just as they are about to leave for home, Elroy tells them the time machine is broken and cannot be repaired. Fortunately, they are able to return to the Stone Age because Fred's car absorbed the time machine's \"quadrapotents.\" The Flintstones and the Rubbles then bid a fond farewell to the Jetsons and are sent back to the Stone Age.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Henry Corden]] as [[Fred Flintstone]]\n* [[George O'Hanlon]] as [[George Jetson]]\n* [[Mel Blanc]] as [[Barney Rubble]], [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino the Dinosaur]], and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Spacely|Mr. Spacely]]\n* [[Jean Vander Pyl]] as [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Rosie|Rosie the Robot Maid]]\n* [[Penny Singleton]] as [[List of The Jetsons characters#Jane Jetson|Jane Jetson]]\n* [[Julie McWhirter|Julie Dees]] as [[Betty Rubble]], Jet Rivers, Investor, Panelist, and Harem Girl\n* [[Janet Waldo]] as [[List of The Jetsons characters#Judy Jetson|Judy Jetson]] and S.A.R.A.\n* [[Daws Butler]] as [[List of The Jetsons characters#Elroy Jetson|Elroy Jetson]], [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Cogswell|Cogswell]], and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Henry Orbit|Henry Orbit]]\n* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] as [[The Flintstones#Characters|Mr. Slate]]\n* [[Hamilton Camp]] as Turk Tarpit\n* [[Don Messick]] as [[List of The Jetsons characters#Astro|Astro the Space Mutt]], [[List of The Jetsons characters#George Jetson's workplace|R.U.D.I]] and [[List of The Jetsons characters#M.A.C.C.|M.A.C.C.]]\n* [[Jon Bauman]] as Iggy\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as DiDi\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Dan Rathmoon, Johnny, and Mr. Goldbrick\n* [[Patric Zimmerman]] as additional voices\n* [[Catherine Thompson]] as additional voices\n* [[Howard Morris]] as additional voices\n\n==Home media==\nThe movie has been released on VHS four times, first by [[Worldvision Enterprises|Worldvision Home Video]],<ref>{{cite web|author=The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones [VHS] |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/6301220609 |title=The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones [VHS&#93;: Henry Corden, George O'Hanlon, Jean Vander Pyl, Penny Singleton, Janet Waldo, Mel Blanc, Daws Butler, Hamilton Camp, Frank Welker, John Stephenson, Don Messick, Julie McWhirter, Jon 'Bowzer' Bauman, Brenda Vaccaro, Don Lusk: Movies & TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> then by Kid Klassics (using the same cassette as the previous release) in 1987, its parent company, [[GoodTimes Home Video]], in 1989, and by [[Warner Home Video]] on July 3, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones [VHS] |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005BCMZ |title=The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones [VHS&#93;: George O'Hanlon, Henry Corden, Penny Singleton, Jean Vander Pyl, Jon 'Bowzer' Bauman, Mel Blanc, Daws Butler, Hamilton Camp, Julie McWhirter, Don Messick, John Stephenson, Brenda Vaccaro, Don Lusk, Ray Patterson, Bernard Wolf, Bob Hathcock, Joseph Barbera, William Hanna, Arthur Alsberg, Don Nelson: Movies & TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> On June 14, 2011, [[Warner Archive Collection|Warner Archive]] released ''The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones'' on DVD in NTSC picture format with all region encoding, for the very first time as part of their [[Hanna\u2013Barbera Classics Collection|Hanna-Barbera Classics Collection]].

In Hinduism, nondualism has more commonly become associated with the Advaita Vedanta tradition of [[Adi Shankara]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}}\n\nIn the [[Buddhism|Buddhist tradition]] non-duality is associated with the teachings of emptiness (''[[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101]]'') and the [[two truths doctrine]], particularly the [[Madhyamaka]] teaching of the non-duality of absolute and relative truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}}{{sfn|Davis|2010}} and the [[Yogachara]] notion of \"mind/thought only\" (''citta-matra'') or \"representation-only\" (''[[Yogacara#Representation-only|vij\u00f1aptim\u0101tra]]'').{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} These teachings'','' coupled with the doctrine of [[Buddha-nature]] have been influential concepts in the subsequent development of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], not only in India, but also in [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], most notably in [[Zen|Ch\u00e1n (Zen)]] and [[Vajrayana]].\n\nWestern [[Neo-Platonism]] is an essential element of both [[Christian contemplation]] and [[mysticism]], and of [[Western esotericism]] and [[Spirituality#Modern spirituality|modern spirituality]], especially [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]].\n\n==Etymology==\nWhen referring to nondualism, Hinduism generally uses the Sanskrit term ''Advaita,'' while Buddhism uses ''Advaya'' (Tibetan: ''gNis-med,'' Chinese: ''pu-erh,'' Japanese: ''fu-ni'')''.''<ref name=\":0\">Loy, David, Nonduality: A Study in Comparative Philosophy, Prometheus Books, 2012, p. 1.</ref>\n\n\"Advaita\" (\u0905\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0924) is from Sanskrit roots ''a'', not; ''dvaita'', dual, and is usually translated as \"nondualism\", \"nonduality\" and \"nondual\". The term \"nondualism\" and the term \"''advaita''\" from which it originates are [[Polyvalent logic|polyvalent]] terms. The English word's origin is the [[Latin]] ''duo'' meaning \"two\" prefixed with \"non-\" meaning \"not\".\n\n\"Advaya\" (\u0905\u0926\u094d\u0935\u092f) is also a Sanskrit word that means \"identity, unique, not two, without a second,\" and typically refers to the two truths doctrine of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], especially [[Madhyamaka]].\n\nOne of the earliest uses of the word Advaita is found in verse 4.3.32 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (~800 BCE), and in verses 7 and 12 of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] (variously dated to have been composed between 500 BCE to 200 CE).<ref>{{cite book|author=George Adolphus Jacob|title=A concordance to the principal Upanisads and Bhagavadgita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx-oj1dlojEC|year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1281-9|page=33}}</ref> The term appears in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the section with a discourse of the oneness of [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (individual soul) and [[Brahman]] (universal consciousness), as follows:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n147/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad] Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 127\u2013147</ref>\n{{Quote|An ocean is that one seer, without any duality [Advaita]; this is the Brahma-world, O King.

Likewise it is because they are dependently co-arisen that they have no intrinsic, independent reality of their own. Madhyamaka also rejects the existence of absolute realities or beings such as [[Brahman]] or Self.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994}} In the highest sense, \"ultimate reality\" is not an ontological [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] reality that lies beneath an unreal world, nor is it the non-duality of a personal self (''atman'') and an absolute Self (cf.

It does not mean that samsara and nirvana are the same, or that they are one single thing, as in Advaita Vedanta, but rather that they are both empty, open, without limits, and merely exist for the conventional purpose of teaching the [[Buddha Dharma]].<ref name=\":02\"/> Referring to this verse, [[Jay L. Garfield|Jay Garfield]] writes that:<blockquote>to distinguish between samsara and nirvana would be to suppose that each had a nature and that they were different natures. But each is empty, and so there can be no inherent difference. Moreover, since nirvana is by definition the cessation of delusion and of grasping and, hence, of the reification of self and other and of confusing imputed phenomena for inherently real phenomena, it is by definition the recognition of the ultimate nature of things. But if, as Nagarjuna argued in Chapter XXIV, this is simply to see conventional things as empty, not to see some separate emptiness behind them, then nirvana must be ontologically grounded in the conventional. To be in samsara is to see things as they appear to deluded consciousness and to interact with them accordingly. To be in nirvana, then, is to see those things as they are - as merely empty, dependent, impermanent, and nonsubstantial, not to be somewhere else, seeing something else.{{sfn|Garfield|1995|pp=331-332}}</blockquote>\n\nIt is important to note however that the actual Sanskrit term \"advaya\" does not appear in the MMK, and only appears in one single work by Nagarjuna, the ''Bodhicittavivarana''.<ref>McCagney, Nancy (1997), ''N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and the Philosophy of Openness'', Rowman & Littlefield, 1997, pp. 128.</ref>\n\nThe later Madhyamikas, states Yuichi Kajiyama, developed the ''Advaya'' definition as a means to ''[[Nirvikalpa#Buddhism|Nirvikalpa-Samadhi]]'' by suggesting that \"things arise neither from their own selves nor from other things, and that when subject and object are unreal, the mind, being not different, cannot be true either; thereby one must abandon attachment to cognition of nonduality as well, and understand the lack of intrinsic nature of everything\".

Regarding this state of [[Buddhahood]], it states: <blockquote>Its operation is nondual (''advaya vrtti'') because of its abiding neither in samsara nor in nirvana (''samsaranirvana-apratisthitatvat''), through its being both conditioned and unconditioned (''samskrta-asamskrtatvena'').<ref name=\":4\">Makransky, John J.

''Buddhist Thought.'' Routledge 2000, p. 160.</ref> Various Mahayana texts such as the ''[[Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras]]'' focus on this idea and over time it became a very influential doctrine in Indian Buddhism, as well in East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism. The Buddha nature teachings may be regarded as a form of nondualism. According to Sally B King, all beings are said to be or possess ''[[tathagata-garbha]]'', which is nondual [[Tath\u0101t\u0101|Thusness]] or [[Dharmak\u0101ya|Dharmakaya]]. This reality, states King, transcends the \"duality of self and not-self\", the \"duality of form and emptiness\" and the \"two poles of being and non being\".<ref>King, Sally (1991), ''Buddha Nature'', SUNY Press, pp. 99, 106, 111.</ref>\n\nThere various interpretations and views on [[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]] and the concept became very influential in India, China and Tibet, where it also became a source of much debate. In later Indian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, a new sub-school developed which adopted the doctrine of ''[[tathagata-garbha]]'' into the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra system.<ref name=\":2\" /> The influence of this hybrid school can be seen in texts like the ''[[Lankavatara Sutra]]'' and the [[Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga|''Ratnagotravibhaga'']]. This synthesis of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra [[tathagata-garbha]] became very influential in later Buddhist traditions, such as Indian [[Vajrayana]], [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]].<ref>Brunnholzl, Karl'', When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra,'' Shambhala Publications, 2015, p. 118.</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAnother influential concept in Indian Buddhism is the idea of [[Luminous mind]] which became associated with Buddha nature. Yet another development in late Indian Buddhism was the synthesis of Madhymaka and Yogacara philosophies into a single system, by figures such as [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]] (8th century). [[Vajrayana|Buddhist Tantra]], also known as Vajrayana, Mantrayana or Esoteric Buddhism, drew upon all these previous Indian Buddhist ideas and nondual philosophies to develop innovative new traditions of Buddhist practice and new religious texts called the [[Tantras (Buddhism)|Buddhist tantras]] (from the 6th century onwards).<ref>Williams, Wynne, Tribe; ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'', pp. 205-206.</ref> Tantric Buddhism was influential in China and is the main form of Buddhism in the [[Himalayan Region|Himalayan regions]], especially [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. \n[[File:Chakrasamvara Vajravarahi.jpg|thumb|[[Chakrasamvara|Sa\u1e43vara]] with [[Vajrav\u0101r\u0101h\u012b]] in [[Yab-Yum]]. These tantric Buddhist depictions of sexual union symbolize the non-dual union of compassion and emptiness.]]\nThe concept of ''advaya'' has various meanings in Buddhist Tantra. According to Tantric commentator Lilavajra, Buddhist Tantra's \"utmost secret and aim\" is Buddha nature. This is seen as a \"non-dual, self-originated Wisdom ([[jnana]]), an effortless fount of good qualities.\"<ref>Wayman, Alex; Yoga of the Guhyasamajatantra: The arcane lore of forty verses : a Buddhist Tantra commentary, 1977, page 56.</ref> In Buddhist Tantra, there is no strict separation between the sacred (nirvana) and the profane (samsara), and all beings are seen as containing an immanent seed of awakening or Buddhahood.<ref>Duckworth, Douglas; Tibetan Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajray\u0101na in \"A companion to Buddhist philosophy\", page 100.</ref> The Buddhist Tantras also teach that there is a non-dual relationship between emptiness and compassion (''karuna''), this unity is called [[bodhicitta]].<ref>Lalan Prasad Singh, ''Buddhist Tantra: A Philosophical Reflection and Religious Investigation'', Concept Publishing Company, 2010, pp. 40-41.</ref> They also teach a \"nondual pristine wisdom of bliss and emptiness.\"<ref>Rinpoche Kirti Tsenshap, ''Principles of Buddhist Tantra,'' Simon and Schuster, 2011'','' p. 127.</ref> Advaya is also said to be the co-existence of [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1a]] (wisdom) and [[Upaya]] (skill in means).<ref>Lalan Prasad Singh, ''Buddhist Tantra: A Philosophical Reflection and Religious Investigation'', Concept Publishing Company, 2010, p. ix.</ref> These nondualities are also related to the idea of ''yuganaddha'', or \"union\" in the Tantras. This is said to be the \"indivisible merging of innate great bliss (the means) and clear light (emptiness)\" as well as the merging of relative and ultimate truths and the knower and the known, during Tantric practice.<ref>Jamgon Kongtrul, ''The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Five: Buddhist Ethics,'' Shambhala Publications, 5 June 2003, p. 345.</ref>\n\nBuddhist Tantras also promote certain practices which are [[Antinomianism|antinomian]], such as [[Sexual ritual|sexual rites]] or the consumption of disgusting or repulsive substances (the \"five ambrosias\", feces, urine, blood, semen, and marrow.). These are said to allow one to cultivate nondual perception of the pure and impure (and similar conceptual dualities) and thus it allows one to prove one's attainment of nondual gnosis (''advaya j\u00f1ana'').<ref>Wedemeyer, Christian K. ''Making Sense of Tantric Buddhism: History, Semiology, and Transgression in the Indian Traditions,'' Columbia University Press, 6 May 2014, p. 145.</ref>\n\nIndian Buddhist Tantra also views humans as a microcosmos which mirrors the macrocosmos.{{sfn|White|2000|p=8-9}} Its aim is to gain access to the awakened energy or consciousness of Buddhahood, which is nondual, through various practices.{{sfn|White|2000|p=8-9}}\n\n===East-Asian Buddhism===\n\n====Chinese Buddhism====\n{{Main|Buddhism in China}}\n\n[[File:Indrasnet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 3D rendering of [[Indra's net]], an illustration of the Huayan concept of interpenetration.]]\nChinese Buddhism was influenced by the philosophical strains of Indian Buddhist nondualism such as the [[Madhyamaka|Madhymaka]] doctrines of emptiness and the [[Two truths doctrine|two truths]] as well as [[Yogachara|Yogacara]] and ''[[tathagata-garbha]]''. For example, [[East Asian M\u0101dhyamaka|Chinese Madhyamaka]] philosophers like [[Jizang]], discussed the nonduality of the two truths.<ref>Chang-Qing Shih, ''The Two Truths in Chinese Buddhism Motilal'' Banarsidass Publ., 2004, p. 153.</ref> [[East Asian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra|Chinese Yogacara]] also upheld the Indian Yogacara views on nondualism. One influential text in Chinese Buddhism which synthesizes ''[[Tathagata-garbha]]'' and Yogacara views is the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]], which may be a Chinese composition.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism, the polarity of absolute and relative realities is also expressed as \"[[Essence-Function|essence-function]]\". This was a result of an ontological interpretation of the two truths as well as influences from native Taoist and Confucian metaphysics.<ref>Lai, Whalen (2003), Buddhism in China: A Historical Survey.

Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all \"inherently entailed\" within each other.<ref name=\":6\" /> Each moment of consciousness is simply the Absolute itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.\n\nAnother influential Chinese tradition, the [[Huayan|Huayan school]] (Flower Garland) flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang period]]. It is based on the [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Garland Sutra]] (S. ''Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra'', C. ''Huayan Jing''). Huayan doctrines such as the [[Four Dharmadhatu|Fourfold Dharmadhatu]] and the doctrine of the [[Huayan#Interpenetration|mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena]] (''dharmas'') or \"perfect interfusion\" (''yuanrong'', \u5713\u878d) are classic nondual doctrines.<ref name=\":5\" /> This can be described as the idea that all [[dharmas|phenomena]] \"are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception\" and that \"they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict.\"<ref name=\"Hamar, Imre 2007, page 189\">Hamar, Imre (Editor).

Shentong has often been incorrectly associated with the Cittam\u0101tra ([[Yogacara]]) position, but is in fact also Madhyamaka,<ref>Stearns p. 72</ref> and is present primarily as the main philosophical theory of the [[Jonang]] school, although it is also taught by the [[Sakya]]<ref>Stearns p. 61</ref> and [[Kagyu]] schools.<ref name=TaiSitupa>{{cite book|author1=Pema T\u00f6ny\u00f6 Nyinje, 12th Tai Situpa|authorlink1=Pema T\u00f6ny\u00f6 Nyinje|title=Ground, Path and Fruition|publisher=Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Charitable Trust|isbn=978-1-877294-35-8|page=2005|date=August 2005}}</ref><ref name=Hookham>{{cite book|last1=Hookham|first1=S.K.|authorlink1=Shenpen Hookham|title=The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-0-7914-0358-7|pages=13}}</ref> According to Shentongpa (proponents of shentong), the emptiness of ultimate reality should not be characterized in the same way as the emptiness of apparent phenomena because it is ''[[\u00f6sel (yoga)|prabh\u0101\u015bvara]]-[[mindstream|sa\u1e43t\u0101na]]'', or \"luminous mindstream\" endowed with limitless Buddha qualities.<ref>[http://www.ahs.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&ID=1847 Lama Shenpen, ''Emptiness Teachings''.

The state of nondual awareness is called ''[[rigpa]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This primordial nature is clear light, unproduced and unchanging, free from all defilements. Through meditation, the [[Dzogchen]] practitioner experiences that thoughts have no substance. Mental phenomena arise and fall in the mind, but fundamentally they are empty. The practitioner then considers where the mind itself resides.

In this approach, the notion of God is stripped from all positive qualifications, leaving a \"darkness\" or \"unground.\" It had a strong influence on western mysticism. A notable example is [[Meister Eckhart]], who also attracted attention from Zen-Buddhists like [[D.T. Suzuki]] in modern times, due to the similarities between Buddhist thought and Neo-Platonism.\n\n[[The Cloud of Unknowing]] \u2013 an anonymous work of [[Christian mysticism]] written in [[Middle English]] in the latter half of the 14th century \u2013 advocates a mystic relationship with God. The text describes a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] union with God through the heart. The author of the text advocates [[centering prayer]], a form of inner silence. According to the text, God can not be known through knowledge or from intellection. It is only by emptying the mind of all created images and thoughts that we can arrive to experience God. Continuing on this line of thought, God is completely unknowable by the mind. God is not known through the intellect but through intense [[contemplation]], motivated by love, and stripped of all thought.<ref>Paul de Jaegher ''Christian Mystics of the Middle Ages: An Anthology of Writings'', translated by [[Donald Attwater]] 2004, p. 86</ref>\n\n[[Thomism]], though not non-dual in the ordinary sense, considers the unity of God so absolute that even the duality of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], to describe him, can be true only by [[analogy]]. In Thomist thought, even the [[Tetragrammaton]] is only an approximate name, since \"I am\" involves a predicate whose own essence is its subject.<ref>Koren, Henry J (1955).

The belief in \"one G-d\" is no longer perceived as the mere rejection of other deities or intermediaries, but a denial of any existence outside of G-d.{{refn|group=note|As Rabbi Moshe Cordovero explains: \"Before anything was emanated, there was only the Infinite One (Ein Sof), which was all that existed. And even after He brought into being everything which exists, there is nothing but Him, and you cannot find anything that existed apart from Him, G-d forbid. For nothing existed devoid of G-d's power, for if there were, He would be limited and subject to duality, G-d forbid. Rather, G-d is everything that exists, but everything that exists is not G-d... Nothing is devoid of His G-dliness: everything is within it... There is nothing but it\" (Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, ''Elimah Rabasi'', p. 24d-25a; for sources in early Chasidism see: Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef of Polonne, ''Ben Poras Yosef'' (Piotrk\u00f3w 1884), pp. 140, 168; ''Keser Shem Tov'' (Brooklyn: Kehos 2004) pp. 237-8; Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, ''Pri Ha-Aretz'', (Kopust 1884), p. 21.).

They are largely distinct both from orthodox [[Judeo-Christian|Judeo-Christian religion]] and from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]]. The earliest traditions which later analysis would label as forms of Western esotericism emerged in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] during [[Late Antiquity]], where [[Hermetism]], [[Gnosticism]], and [[Neoplatonism]] developed as schools of thought distinct from what became mainstream Christianity. In [[Renaissance]] Europe, interest in many of these older ideas increased, with various intellectuals seeking to combine \"[[pagan]]\" philosophies with the [[Kabbalah]] and with Christian philosophy, resulting in the emergence of esoteric movements like [[Christian theosophy]].\n\n====Perennial philosophy====\n{{Main|Perennial philosophy}}\n\nThe Perennial philosophy has its roots in the Renaissance interest in [[neo-Platonism]] and its [[Theory of Forms|idea]] of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]], from which all existence emanates.

He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] and other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497\u20131548) coined the term ''philosophia perennis''.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}}\n\n====Orientalism====\n{{Main|Orientalism}}\n\nThe western world has been exposed to Indian religions since the late 18th century.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} The first western translation of a Sanskrit text was made in 1785.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} It marked a growing interest in Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} The first translation of the dualism and nondualism discussing Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802{{sfn|Renard|2010|pp=177-184}} and influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them \"the consolation of my life\".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}}\n\n====Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism====\n{{Main|Transcendentalism}}\n\nTranscendentalism was an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement that developed in the 1830s and 1840s in the Eastern region of the [[United States]]. It was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].<ref group=web name=\"Stanford\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'']</ref>\n\nThe Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm |title=Jone John Lewis, \"What is Transcendentalism?\" |access-date=24 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209161406/http://transcendentalists.com/what.htm |archive-date=9 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\" /> In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of [[Hindu]] texts appeared, which were read by the Transcendentalists and influenced their thinking.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\" /> The Transcendentalists also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\" /><ref group=web name=\"Andrews\">[http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html Barry Andrews, ''THE ROOTS OF UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SPIRITUALITY IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |date=21 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAmong the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both people and nature. Transcendentalists believed that society and its institutions&mdash;particularly organized religion and political parties&mdash;ultimately corrupted the purity of the individual. They had faith that people are at their best when truly \"self-reliant\" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community could be formed.\n\nThe major figures in the movement were [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]].\n\n====Neo-Vedanta====\nUnitarian Universalism had a strong impact on Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj, and subsequently on Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of [[Neo-Vedanta]], a modern interpretation of Hinduism in line with [[Western esotericism|western esoteric traditions]], especially [[Transcendentalism]], [[New Thought]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India,{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.{{Sfn|Dutta|2003|p=110}}\n\nNarendranath Datta (Swami Vivekananda) became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge \"at some point before 1884\"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshab Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} who were closely connected to the [[Transcendentalists]], who in turn were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}} It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} [[Debendranath Tagore]] brought this \"neo-Hinduism\" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen,{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} who was also influenced by [[transcendentalism]], which emphasised personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen's influence brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=50}}\n\nVivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}}\n\nIn 1897 he founded the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], which was instrumental in the spread of Neo-Vedanta in the west, and attracted people like Alan Watts. Aldous Huxley, author of ''[[The Perennial Philosophy (book)|The Perennial Philosophy]]'', was associated with another neo-Vedanta organisation, the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}\n\n====Theosophical Society====\n{{Main|Theosophical Society}}\nA major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185\u2013188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|\"Masters of Wisdom\"]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} \"beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others\".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

It is the personal realization that ultimate reality is nondual, and is thought to be a validating means of knowledge of this nondual reality. This insight is interpreted as a psychological state, and labeled as religious or mystical experience.\n\n====Development====\nAccording to Hori, the notion of \"religious experience\" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term \"religious experience\" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}\n\nIn the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.<ref>''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79</ref>\n\n[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768\u20131834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}\n\nSuch religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was&nbsp;\u2013 during the period in-between world wars&nbsp;\u2013 famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].<ref>''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116\u2013119</ref> In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].<ref>''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126\u2013127</ref>\n\nThe notion of \"religious experience\" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding \"enlightenment\", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: \"It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion.\"{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196\u2013197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}\n\n====Criticism====\nThe notion of \"experience\" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: \"[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship. Both historical and ethnographic evidence suggests that the privileging of experience may well be traced to certain twentieth-century reform movements, notably those that urge a return to ''[[zazen]]'' or ''[[vipassana]]'' meditation, and these reforms were profoundly influenced by religious developments in the west [...] While some adepts may indeed experience \"altered states\" in the course of their training, critical analysis shows that such states do not constitute the reference point for the elaborate Buddhist discourse pertaining to the \"path\".{{sfn|Sharf|1995b|p=1}}}}\n\nInsight is not the \"experience\" of some transcendental reality, but is a cognitive event, the (intuitive) understanding or \"grasping\" of some specific understanding of reality, as in [[kensho]]{{sfn|Hori|2000}} or [[anubhava]].{{sfn|Comans|1993}}\n\n\"Pure experience\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity.{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282}}{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80-82}} A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \"cleaning the doors of perception\",{{refn|group=note|[[William Blake]]: \"If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.

Bronkhorst for example notices that the conception of what exactly \"liberating insight\" is in Buddhism was developed over time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the Four Truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this \"liberating insight\" exist in the Buddhist canon.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n'''Various'''\n* [[Abheda]]\n* [[Acosmism]] (belief that the world is illusory)\n* [[Anatta]] (Belief that there is no self)\n* [[Cosmic Consciousness]]\n* [[Emanationism]]\n* [[Henosis]] (Union with the absolute)\n* [[Holism]]\n* [[Kenosis]] (Self-emptying)\n* [[Maya (illusion)]] (Cosmic illusion)\n* [[Monad (philosophy)]]\n* [[Neo-Advaita]]\n* [[Nihilism]]\n* [[Nirguna Brahman]]\n* [[Oceanic feeling]]\n* [[Open individualism]]\n* [[Panentheism]]\n* [[Pantheism]] (Belief that God and the world are identical)\n* [[Pluralism (metaphysics)]] \n* [[Process Psychology]]\n* [[Rigpa]]\n* [[Shuddhadvaita]]\n* [[Sunyata]] (Emptiness).\n* [[The All]]\n* [[Turiya]]\n* [[Yanantin]] (Complementary dualism in Native South American culture)\n'''Metaphors for nondualisms'''\n* [[Indra's net|Jewel Net of Indra]], ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]''\n* [[Blind men and an elephant]]\n* [[Eclipse]]\n* [[Garden of Eden]]\n* [[Hermaphrodite]], e.g. [[Ardhan\u0101r\u012b\u015bvara]]\n* [[Mirror]] and [[Reflection (physics)|reflections]], as a metaphor for the continuum of the subject-object in the mirror-the-mind and the interiority of perception and its illusion of projected exteriority\n* [[Great Rite]]\n* [[Sacred marriage]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Published sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last =Akizuki | first =Ry\u014dmin | year =1990 | title =New Mah\u0101y\u0101na: Buddhism for a Post-modern World | publisher =Jain Publishing Company}}\n* {{Citation | last =Amidon | first =Elias | year =2012 | title =The Open Path: Recognizing Nondual Awareness | publisher =Sentient Publications}}\n* {{Citation | last =Anderson | first =Allan W. | year =2009 | title =Self-Transformation and the Oracular: A Practical Handbook for Consulting the I Ching and Tarot | publisher =Xlibris Corporation}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}\n<!-- B -->\n* {{Citation | last =Bhattacharya | first =Vidhushekhara | year =1943 | title=Gau\u1e0dap\u0101dak\u0101rik\u0101 | place =Delhi | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass}}\n* {{Citation|last=Bhuyan|first= P.

Although this state of consciousness may seem to appear spontaneous,{{refn|group=note|See ''Cosmic Consciousness'', by Richard Bucke}} it usually follows prolonged preparation through ascetic or meditative/contemplative practice, which may include ethical injunctions. While the term \"nondualism\" is derived from [[Advaita Vedanta]], descriptions of nondual consciousness can be found within [[Hinduism]] (''[[Turiya]], [[sahaja]]''), [[Buddhism]] ([[\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|emptiness]], [[Yogachara#The Three Natures and Emptiness|''parini\u1e63panna'']], [[nature of mind]], ''[[rigpa]]''), Islam ([[Sufi metaphysics#Wa\u1e25dat al-Wuj\u016bd (Unity of Existence)|Wahdat al Wujud]], [[Fanaa]], and [[Haqiqah]]) and western [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonic traditions]] ([[henosis]], [[Mysticism|mystical union]]).\n\nThe Asian ideas of nondualism developed in the [[Vedic]] and post-Vedic [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] philosophies around 800 BCE<ref name=benami9/>, as well as in the [[Buddhist]] traditions.{{sfn|Dasgupta|Mohanta|1998|p=362}} The oldest traces of nondualism in Indian thought are found in the earlier [[Hindu]] [[Upanishad]]s such as [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], as well as other pre-Buddhist Upanishads such as the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], which emphasizes the unity of individual soul called [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and the Supreme called [[Brahman]]. In Hinduism, nondualism has more commonly become associated with the Advaita Vedanta tradition of [[Adi Shankara]].{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}}\n\nIn the [[Buddhism|Buddhist tradition]] non-duality is associated with the teachings of emptiness (''[[\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101]]'') and the [[two truths doctrine]], particularly the [[Madhyamaka]] teaching of the non-duality of absolute and relative truth,{{sfn|Loy|1988|p=9-11}}{{sfn|Davis|2010}} and the [[Yogachara]] notion of \"mind/thought only\" (''citta-matra'') or \"representation-only\" (''[[Yogacara#Representation-only|vij\u00f1aptim\u0101tra]]'').{{sfn|Raju|1992|p=177}} These teachings'','' coupled with the doctrine of [[Buddha-nature]] have been influential concepts in the subsequent development of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], not only in India, but also in [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], most notably in [[Zen|Ch\u00e1n (Zen)]] and [[Vajrayana]].\n\nWestern [[Neo-Platonism]] is an essential element of both [[Christian contemplation]] and [[mysticism]], and of [[Western esotericism]] and [[Spirituality#Modern spirituality|modern spirituality]], especially [[Unitarianism]], [[Transcendentalism]], [[Universalism]] and [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]].\n\n==Etymology==\nWhen referring to nondualism, Hinduism generally uses the Sanskrit term ''Advaita,'' while Buddhism uses ''Advaya'' (Tibetan: ''gNis-med,'' Chinese: ''pu-erh,'' Japanese: ''fu-ni'')''.''<ref name=\":0\">Loy, David, Nonduality: A Study in Comparative Philosophy, Prometheus Books, 2012, p. 1.</ref>\n\n\"Advaita\" (\u0905\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u0924) is from Sanskrit roots ''a'', not; ''dvaita'', dual, and is usually translated as \"nondualism\", \"nonduality\" and \"nondual\". The term \"nondualism\" and the term \"''advaita''\" from which it originates are [[Polyvalent logic|polyvalent]] terms. The English word's origin is the [[Latin]] ''duo'' meaning \"two\" prefixed with \"non-\" meaning \"not\".\n\n\"Advaya\" (\u0905\u0926\u094d\u0935\u092f) is also a Sanskrit word that means \"identity, unique, not two, without a second,\" and typically refers to the two truths doctrine of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], especially [[Madhyamaka]].\n\nOne of the earliest uses of the word Advaita is found in verse 4.3.32 of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (~800 BCE), and in verses 7 and 12 of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] (variously dated to have been composed between 500 BCE to 200 CE).<ref>{{cite book|author=George Adolphus Jacob|title=A concordance to the principal Upanisads and Bhagavadgita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tx-oj1dlojEC|year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1281-9|page=33}}</ref> The term appears in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad in the section with a discourse of the oneness of [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (individual soul) and [[Brahman]] (universal consciousness), as follows:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n147/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad] Robert Hume (Translator), Oxford University Press, pp. 127\u2013147</ref>\n{{Quote|An ocean is that one seer, without any duality [Advaita]; this is the Brahma-world, O King.

It does not mean that samsara and nirvana are the same, or that they are one single thing, as in Advaita Vedanta, but rather that they are both empty, open, without limits, and merely exist for the conventional purpose of teaching the [[Buddha Dharma]].<ref name=\":02\"/> Referring to this verse, [[Jay L. Garfield|Jay Garfield]] writes that:<blockquote>to distinguish between samsara and nirvana would be to suppose that each had a nature and that they were different natures. But each is empty, and so there can be no inherent difference. Moreover, since nirvana is by definition the cessation of delusion and of grasping and, hence, of the reification of self and other and of confusing imputed phenomena for inherently real phenomena, it is by definition the recognition of the ultimate nature of things. But if, as Nagarjuna argued in Chapter XXIV, this is simply to see conventional things as empty, not to see some separate emptiness behind them, then nirvana must be ontologically grounded in the conventional. To be in samsara is to see things as they appear to deluded consciousness and to interact with them accordingly. To be in nirvana, then, is to see those things as they are - as merely empty, dependent, impermanent, and nonsubstantial, not to be somewhere else, seeing something else.{{sfn|Garfield|1995|pp=331-332}}</blockquote>\n\nIt is important to note however that the actual Sanskrit term \"advaya\" does not appear in the MMK, and only appears in one single work by Nagarjuna, the ''Bodhicittavivarana''.<ref>McCagney, Nancy (1997), ''N\u0101g\u0101rjuna and the Philosophy of Openness'', Rowman & Littlefield, 1997, pp. 128.</ref>\n\nThe later Madhyamikas, states Yuichi Kajiyama, developed the ''Advaya'' definition as a means to ''[[Nirvikalpa#Buddhism|Nirvikalpa-Samadhi]]'' by suggesting that \"things arise neither from their own selves nor from other things, and that when subject and object are unreal, the mind, being not different, cannot be true either; thereby one must abandon attachment to cognition of nonduality as well, and understand the lack of intrinsic nature of everything\".

Yet another development in late Indian Buddhism was the synthesis of Madhymaka and Yogacara philosophies into a single system, by figures such as [[\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita]] (8th century). [[Vajrayana|Buddhist Tantra]], also known as Vajrayana, Mantrayana or Esoteric Buddhism, drew upon all these previous Indian Buddhist ideas and nondual philosophies to develop innovative new traditions of Buddhist practice and new religious texts called the [[Tantras (Buddhism)|Buddhist tantras]] (from the 6th century onwards).<ref>Williams, Wynne, Tribe; ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'', pp. 205-206.</ref> Tantric Buddhism was influential in China and is the main form of Buddhism in the [[Himalayan Region|Himalayan regions]], especially [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. \n[[File:Chakrasamvara Vajravarahi.jpg|thumb|[[Chakrasamvara|Sa\u1e43vara]] with [[Vajrav\u0101r\u0101h\u012b]] in [[Yab-Yum]].

One influential text in Chinese Buddhism which synthesizes ''[[Tathagata-garbha]]'' and Yogacara views is the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]], which may be a Chinese composition.\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism, the polarity of absolute and relative realities is also expressed as \"[[Essence-Function|essence-function]]\". This was a result of an ontological interpretation of the two truths as well as influences from native Taoist and Confucian metaphysics.<ref>Lai, Whalen (2003), Buddhism in China: A Historical Survey. In Antonio S. Cua (ed.): Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy, New York: Routledge.</ref> In this theory, the absolute is essence, the relative is function.

Zalta (ed.), URL = <<nowiki>https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/buddhism-tiantai/</nowiki>>.</ref> Tiantai metaphysics is an immanent [[holism]], which sees every phenomenon, moment or event as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality. Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all \"inherently entailed\" within each other.<ref name=\":6\" /> Each moment of consciousness is simply the Absolute itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.\n\nAnother influential Chinese tradition, the [[Huayan|Huayan school]] (Flower Garland) flourished in [[China]] during the [[Tang period]]. It is based on the [[Avatamsaka Sutra|Flower Garland Sutra]] (S. ''Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra'', C. ''Huayan Jing''). Huayan doctrines such as the [[Four Dharmadhatu|Fourfold Dharmadhatu]] and the doctrine of the [[Huayan#Interpenetration|mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena]] (''dharmas'') or \"perfect interfusion\" (''yuanrong'', \u5713\u878d) are classic nondual doctrines.<ref name=\":5\" /> This can be described as the idea that all [[dharmas|phenomena]] \"are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception\" and that \"they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict.\"<ref name=\"Hamar, Imre 2007, page 189\">Hamar, Imre (Editor).

The Diamond-sutra, another popular sutra, emphasizes sunyata, which \"must be realized totally or not at all\".{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|pp=26\u201328}} The [[Prajnaparamita]] Sutras emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the [[Heart Sutra]] says.{{sfn|Liang-Chieh|1986|p=9}} According to [[Chinul]], Zen points not to mere emptiness, but to ''suchness'' or the [[dharmadhatu]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991|p=240-241}}\n\nThe idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not explain how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as [[Five Ranks|the Five Ranks of Tozan]]{{sfn|Kasulis|2003|p=29}} and the [[Ten Bulls|Oxherding Pictures]].\n\nThe continuous pondering of the break-through [[k\u014dan]] (''shokan''{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=132}}) or [[Hua Tou]], \"word head\",{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=38}} leads to [[kensho]], an initial insight into \"seeing the [[Buddha-nature|(Buddha-)nature]]\".{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=287}} According to Hori, a central theme of many koans is the \"identity of opposites\", and point to the original nonduality.{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289\u2013290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}} Victor Sogen Hori describes [[kensho]], when attained through [[Koan|koan-study]], as the absence of subject\u2013object duality.{{sfn|Hori|1994|p=30\u201331}} The aim of the so-called break-through koan is to see the \"nonduality of subject and object\", {{sfn|Hori|2000|p=289\u2013290}}{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=310 note 14}} in which \"subject and object are no longer separate and distinct.\"{{sfn|Hori|2000|p=288\u2013289}}\n\nZen Buddhist training does not end with kensh\u014d.

In this approach, the notion of God is stripped from all positive qualifications, leaving a \"darkness\" or \"unground.\" It had a strong influence on western mysticism. A notable example is [[Meister Eckhart]], who also attracted attention from Zen-Buddhists like [[D.T. Suzuki]] in modern times, due to the similarities between Buddhist thought and Neo-Platonism.\n\n[[The Cloud of Unknowing]] \u2013 an anonymous work of [[Christian mysticism]] written in [[Middle English]] in the latter half of the 14th century \u2013 advocates a mystic relationship with God. The text describes a [[spirtuality|spiritual]] union with God through the heart. The author of the text advocates [[centering prayer]], a form of inner silence. According to the text, God can not be known through knowledge or from intellection. It is only by emptying the mind of all created images and thoughts that we can arrive to experience God. Continuing on this line of thought, God is completely unknowable by the mind. God is not known through the intellect but through intense [[contemplation]], motivated by love, and stripped of all thought.<ref>Paul de Jaegher ''Christian Mystics of the Middle Ages: An Anthology of Writings'', translated by [[Donald Attwater]] 2004, p. 86</ref>\n\n[[Thomism]], though not non-dual in the ordinary sense, considers the unity of God so absolute that even the duality of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]], to describe him, can be true only by [[analogy]]. In Thomist thought, even the [[Tetragrammaton]] is only an approximate name, since \"I am\" involves a predicate whose own essence is its subject.<ref>Koren, Henry J (1955).

The belief in \"one G-d\" is no longer perceived as the mere rejection of other deities or intermediaries, but a denial of any existence outside of G-d.{{refn|group=note|As Rabbi Moshe Cordovero explains: \"Before anything was emanated, there was only the Infinite One (Ein Sof), which was all that existed. And even after He brought into being everything which exists, there is nothing but Him, and you cannot find anything that existed apart from Him, G-d forbid. For nothing existed devoid of G-d's power, for if there were, He would be limited and subject to duality, G-d forbid. Rather, G-d is everything that exists, but everything that exists is not G-d... Nothing is devoid of His G-dliness: everything is within it... There is nothing but it\" (Rabbi Moshe Cordovero, ''Elimah Rabasi'', p. 24d-25a; for sources in early Chasidism see: Rabbi Ya'akov Yosef of Polonne, ''Ben Poras Yosef'' (Piotrk\u00f3w 1884), pp. 140, 168; ''Keser Shem Tov'' (Brooklyn: Kehos 2004) pp. 237-8; Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk, ''Pri Ha-Aretz'', (Kopust 1884), p. 21.).

They are largely distinct both from orthodox [[Judeo-Christian|Judeo-Christian religion]] and from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]]. The earliest traditions which later analysis would label as forms of Western esotericism emerged in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] during [[Late Antiquity]], where [[Hermetism]], [[Gnosticism]], and [[Neoplatonism]] developed as schools of thought distinct from what became mainstream Christianity. In [[Renaissance]] Europe, interest in many of these older ideas increased, with various intellectuals seeking to combine \"[[pagan]]\" philosophies with the [[Kabbalah]] and with Christian philosophy, resulting in the emergence of esoteric movements like [[Christian theosophy]].\n\n====Perennial philosophy====\n{{Main|Perennial philosophy}}\n\nThe Perennial philosophy has its roots in the Renaissance interest in [[neo-Platonism]] and its [[Theory of Forms|idea]] of [[Neo-Platonism#The One|The One]], from which all existence emanates. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (1433\u20131499) sought to integrate ''[[Corpus Hermeticum|Hermeticism]]'' with Greek and Jewish-Christian thought,{{sfn|Slavenburg|Glaudemans|1994|p=395}} discerning a [[Prisca theologia]] which could be found in all ages.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=508}} [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] (1463\u201394) suggested that truth could be found in many, rather than just two, traditions. He proposed a harmony between the thought of Plato and Aristotle, and saw aspects of the ''Prisca theologia'' in [[Averroes]], the [[Koran]], the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]] and other sources.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966|p=513}} [[Agostino Steuco]] (1497\u20131548) coined the term ''philosophia perennis''.{{sfn|Schmitt|1966}}\n\n====Orientalism====\n{{Main|Orientalism}}\n\nThe western world has been exposed to Indian religions since the late 18th century.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} The first western translation of a Sanskrit text was made in 1785.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=176}} It marked a growing interest in Indian culture and languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=177}} The first translation of the dualism and nondualism discussing Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802{{sfn|Renard|2010|pp=177-184}} and influenced [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], who called them \"the consolation of my life\".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}} Early translations also appeared in other European languages.{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=183-184}}\n\n====Transcendentalism and Unitarian Universalism====\n{{Main|Transcendentalism}}\n\nTranscendentalism was an early 19th-century [[Liberal Christianity|liberal Protestant]] movement that developed in the 1830s and 1840s in the Eastern region of the [[United States]]. It was rooted in English and German [[Romanticism]], the Biblical criticism of [[Herder]] and [[Schleiermacher]], and the [[skepticism]] of [[David Hume|Hume]].<ref group=web name=\"Stanford\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''Transcendentalism'']</ref>\n\nThe Transcendentalists emphasised an intuitive, experiential approach of religion.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.transcendentalists.com/what.htm |title=Jone John Lewis, \"What is Transcendentalism?\" |access-date=24 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209161406/http://transcendentalists.com/what.htm |archive-date=9 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Following Schleiermacher,{{sfn|Sharf|1995}} an individual's intuition of truth was taken as the criterion for truth.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\" /> In the late 18th and early 19th century, the first translations of [[Hindu]] texts appeared, which were read by the Transcendentalists and influenced their thinking.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\" /> The Transcendentalists also endorsed [[Universalism|universalist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarianist]] ideas, leading to [[Unitarian Universalism]], the idea that there must be truth in other religions as well, since a loving God would redeem all living beings, not just Christians.<ref group=web name=\"Lewis\" /><ref group=web name=\"Andrews\">[http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html Barry Andrews, ''THE ROOTS OF UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST SPIRITUALITY IN NEW ENGLAND TRANSCENDENTALISM ''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054734/http://archive.uua.org/re/other/andrews.html |date=21 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAmong the transcendentalists' core beliefs was the inherent goodness of both people and nature. Transcendentalists believed that society and its institutions&mdash;particularly organized religion and political parties&mdash;ultimately corrupted the purity of the individual. They had faith that people are at their best when truly \"self-reliant\" and independent. It is only from such real individuals that true community could be formed.\n\nThe major figures in the movement were [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[John Muir]], [[Margaret Fuller]] and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]].\n\n====Neo-Vedanta====\nUnitarian Universalism had a strong impact on Ram Mohan Roy and the Brahmo Samaj, and subsequently on Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda was one of the main representatives of [[Neo-Vedanta]], a modern interpretation of Hinduism in line with [[Western esotericism|western esoteric traditions]], especially [[Transcendentalism]], [[New Thought]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India,{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West.{{Sfn|Dutta|2003|p=110}}\n\nNarendranath Datta (Swami Vivekananda) became a member of a [[Freemasonry]] lodge \"at some point before 1884\"{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=100}} and of the [[Sadharan Brahmo Samaj]] in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] led by [[Keshab Chandra Sen]] and [[Debendranath Tagore]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=99}} Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833), the founder of the Brahmo Samaj, had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians,{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3}} who were closely connected to the [[Transcendentalists]], who in turn were interested in and influenced by Indian religions early on.{{sfn|Versluis|1993}} It was in this [[cult]]ic{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=31-35}} milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western [[esotericism]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=19-90, 97-100}} [[Debendranath Tagore]] brought this \"neo-Hinduism\" closer in line with western [[esotericism]], a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen,{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=47}} who was also influenced by [[transcendentalism]], which emphasised personal [[religious experience]] over mere reasoning and theology.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=81}} Sen's influence brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.{{sfn|Michelis|2005|p=50}}\n\nVivekananda's acquaintance with western esotericism made him very successful in western esoteric circles, beginning with his speech in 1893 at the Parliament of Religions. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like [[Transcendentalism]] and [[New thought]].{{sfn|Michelis|2004|p=119-123}}\n\nIn 1897 he founded the [[Ramakrishna Mission]], which was instrumental in the spread of Neo-Vedanta in the west, and attracted people like Alan Watts. Aldous Huxley, author of ''[[The Perennial Philosophy (book)|The Perennial Philosophy]]'', was associated with another neo-Vedanta organisation, the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}\n\n====Theosophical Society====\n{{Main|Theosophical Society}}\nA major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185\u2013188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|\"Masters of Wisdom\"]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{refn|group=note|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} \"beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others\".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]],{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} and the spread of those modernised versions in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H.

It is the personal realization that ultimate reality is nondual, and is thought to be a validating means of knowledge of this nondual reality. This insight is interpreted as a psychological state, and labeled as religious or mystical experience.\n\n====Development====\nAccording to Hori, the notion of \"religious experience\" can be traced back to [[William James]], who used the term \"religious experience\" in his book, ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]''.{{sfn|Hori|1999|p=47}} The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}\n\nIn the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] held that [[Moral obligation|moral experience]] justified [[religious belief]]s, [[John Wesley]] in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the [[Methodist movement]] (paralleling the [[Romantic Movement]]) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life.<ref>''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 68, 79</ref>\n\n[[Wayne Proudfoot]] traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" to the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768\u20131834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher and [[Albrecht Ritschl|Albert Ritschl]] to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies [[religious belief]]s.{{sfn|Sharf|2000}}\n\nSuch religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was&nbsp;\u2013 during the period in-between world wars&nbsp;\u2013 famously rejected by [[Karl Barth]].<ref>''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, page 114, 116\u2013119</ref> In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theological]] view are [[Charles E. Raven|Charles Raven]] and the Oxford physicist/theologian [[Charles Coulson]].<ref>''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]'', [[Ian Barbour]], [[Prentice-Hall]], 1966, p. 126\u2013127</ref>\n\nThe notion of \"religious experience\" was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.{{sfn|Sharf|2000|p=271}}{{refn|group=note|James also gives descriptions of conversion experiences. The Christian model of dramatic conversions, based on the role-model of Paul's conversion, may also have served as a model for Western interpretations and expectations regarding \"enlightenment\", similar to Protestant influences on Theravada Buddhism, as described by Carrithers: \"It rests upon the notion of the primacy of religious experiences, preferably spectacular ones, as the origin and legitimation of religious action. But this presupposition has a natural home, not in Buddhism, but in Christian and especially Protestant Christian movements which prescribe a radical conversion.\"{{sfn|Carrithers|1983|p=18}} See Sekida for an example of this influence of William James and Christian conversion stories, mentioning Luther{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=196\u2013197}} and St. Paul.{{sfn|Sekida|1985|p=251}} See also McMahan for the influence of Christian thought on Buddhism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}}}\n\n====Criticism====\nThe notion of \"experience\" has been criticised.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{sfn|Mohr|2000|p=282-286}}{{sfn|Low|2006|p=12}} Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences.{{sfn|Sharf|1995a}}{{refn|group=note|Robert Sharf: \"[T]he role of experience in the history of Buddhism has been greatly exaggerated in contemporary scholarship.

Proudfoot.{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}} They argue that \n{{quote|[N]o unmediated experience is possible, and that in the extreme, language is not simply used to interpret experience but in fact constitutes experience.{{sfn|Spilka e.a.|2003|p=321}}}}\n\nThe idea of a common essence has been questioned by Yandell, who discerns various \"religious experiences\" and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the \"evidential value\" they present.{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=19\u201323}} Yandell discerns five sorts:{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=23\u201331}}\n# [[Numinous]] experiences \u2013 [[Monotheism]] (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic){{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24\u201326}}\n# [[Nirvana|Nirvanic]] experiences \u2013 [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24\u201325, 26\u201327}} \"according to which one sees that the self is but [[Anatta|a bundle of fleeting states]]\"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=24\u201325}}\n# [[Kevala Jnana|Kevala]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=30}} \u2013 [[Jainism]],{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}} \"according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience\"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}}\n# [[Moksha]] experiences{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=29}} \u2013 Hinduism,{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}} Brahman \"either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless\"{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=25}}\n# Nature mystical experience{{sfn|Yandell|1994|p=30}}\n\nThe specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may determine what \"experience\" someone has, which means that this \"experience\" is not the ''proof'' of the teaching, but a ''result'' of the teaching.{{sfn|Samy|1998|p=80}} The notion of what exactly constitutes \"liberating insight\" varies between the various traditions, and even within the traditions. Bronkhorst for example notices that the conception of what exactly \"liberating insight\" is in Buddhism was developed over time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified, later on the Four Truths served as such, to be superseded by ''pratityasamutpada'', and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=100-101}} And Schmithausen notices that still other descriptions of this \"liberating insight\" exist in the Buddhist canon.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n'''Various'''\n* [[Abheda]]\n* [[Acosmism]] (belief that the world is illusory)\n* [[Anatta]] (Belief that there is no self)\n* [[Cosmic Consciousness]]\n* [[Emanationism]]\n* [[Henosis]] (Union with the absolute)\n* [[Holism]]\n* [[Kenosis]] (Self-emptying)\n* [[Maya (illusion)]] (Cosmic illusion)\n* [[Monad (philosophy)]]\n* [[Neo-Advaita]]\n* [[Nihilism]]\n* [[Nirguna Brahman]]\n* [[Oceanic feeling]]\n* [[Open individualism]]\n* [[Panentheism]]\n* [[Pantheism]] (Belief that God and the world are identical)\n* [[Pluralism (metaphysics)]] \n* [[Process Psychology]]\n* [[Rigpa]]\n* [[Shuddhadvaita]]\n* [[Sunyata]] (Emptiness).\n* [[The All]]\n* [[Turiya]]\n* [[Yanantin]] (Complementary dualism in Native South American culture)\n'''Metaphors for nondualisms'''\n* [[Indra's net|Jewel Net of Indra]], ''[[Avatamsaka Sutra]]''\n* [[Blind men and an elephant]]\n* [[Eclipse]]\n* [[Garden of Eden]]\n* [[Hermaphrodite]], e.g. [[Ardhan\u0101r\u012b\u015bvara]]\n* [[Mirror]] and [[Reflection (physics)|reflections]], as a metaphor for the continuum of the subject-object in the mirror-the-mind and the interiority of perception and its illusion of projected exteriority\n* [[Great Rite]]\n* [[Sacred marriage]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Published sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last =Akizuki | first =Ry\u014dmin | year =1990 | title =New Mah\u0101y\u0101na: Buddhism for a Post-modern World | publisher =Jain Publishing Company}}\n* {{Citation | last =Amidon | first =Elias | year =2012 | title =The Open Path: Recognizing Nondual Awareness | publisher =Sentient Publications}}\n* {{Citation | last =Anderson | first =Allan W. | year =2009 | title =Self-Transformation and the Oracular: A Practical Handbook for Consulting the I Ching and Tarot | publisher =Xlibris Corporation}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}\n<!-- B -->\n* {{Citation | last =Bhattacharya | first =Vidhushekhara | year =1943 | title=Gau\u1e0dap\u0101dak\u0101rik\u0101 | place =Delhi | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass}}\n* {{Citation|last=Bhuyan|first= P.

Barbacoan is often connected with the [[Paezan languages]] (including P\u00e1ez); however, Curnow (1998) shows how much of this proposal is based on misinterpretation of an old document of Douay (1888). (See: [[Paezan languages]].)\n\nOther more speculative larger groupings involving Barbacoan include the [[Macro-Paesan]] \"cluster\", the [[Macro-Chibchan]] stock, and the [[Chibchan-Paezan]] stock.\n\n==Languages==\n\nBarboacoan consists of 6 languages:\n\n*'''Northern'''\n:* '''Awan''' (also known as Awa or Pasto)\n::* [[Awa Pit]] (also known as Cuaiquer, Coaiquer, Kwaiker, Aw\u00e1, Awa, Telembi, Sindagua, Awa-Cuaiquer, Koaiker, Telemb\u00ed)\n::* Pasto\u2013Muellama\n:::* [[Pasto language|Pasto]] (also known as Past Aw\u00e1) ''(\u2020)''\n:::* [[Muellama language|Muellama]] (also known as Muellamu\u00e9s, Muelyama) ''(\u2020)''\n:* '''Coconucan''' (also known as Guambiano\u2013Totor\u00f3)\n::* [[Guambiano language|Guambiano]] (also known as Mog\u00fces, Moguez, Mog\u00e9s, Wam, Misak, Guambiano-Moguez, Wambiano-Mog\u00e9s, Moguex)\n::* [[Totoro language|Totor\u00f3]] (also known as Polindara)\n::* [[Coconuco language|Coconuco]] (also known as Kokonuko, Cauca, Wanaka) ''(\u2020)''\n\n*'''Southern''' ? (Cayapa\u2013Tsafiki)\n:* [[Caranqui language|Caranqui]] (also known as Cara, Kara, Karanki, Imbaya) ''(\u2020)''\n:* [[Cha'palaachi language|Cha\u2019palaachi]] (also known as Cayapa, Chachi, Kayapa, Nigua, Cha\u2019pallachi)\n:* [[Tsafiki language|Tsafiki]] (also known as Colorado, Tsafiqui, Ts\u00e1fiki, Colorado, Ts\u00e1chela, Tsachila, Campaz, Colima)\n\nPasto, Muellama, Coconuco, and Caranqui are now [[Extinct language|extinct]].\n\nPasto and Muellama are usually classified as Barbacoan, but the current evidence is weak and deserves further attention. Muellama may have been one of the last surviving [[dialect]]s of Pasto (both extinct, replaced by Spanish) \u2014 Muellama is known only by a short wordlist recorded in the 19th century. The Muellama vocabulary is similar to modern Awa Pit. The [[Ca\u00f1ari\u2013Puruh\u00e1 languages]] are even more poorly attested, and while often placed in a [[Chimuan languages|Chimuan]] family, Adelaar (2004:397) thinks they may have been Barbacoan.\n\nThe Coconucan languages were first connected to Barbacoan by Daniel Brinton in 1891. However, a subsequent publication by Henri Beuchat and Paul Rivet placed Coconucan together with a [[Paezan]] family (which included [[P\u00e1ez language|P\u00e1ez]] and [[Paniquita language|Paniquita]]) due a misleading \"Moguex\" vocabulary list. The \"Moguex\" vocabulary turned out to be a mix of both P\u00e1ez and Guambiano languages (Curnow 1998). This vocabulary has led to misclassifications by Greenberg (1956, 1987), Loukotka (1968), Kaufman (1990, 1994), and Campbell (1997), among others. Although P\u00e1ez may be related to the Barbacoan family, a conservative view considers P\u00e1ez a [[language isolate]] pending further investigation. Guambiano is more similar to other Barbacoan languages than to P\u00e1ez, and thus Key (1979), Curnow et al. (1998), Gordon (2005), and Campbell (2012)<ref name=\"Campbell-SAmerica\">{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |editor1-last=Grondona |editor1-first=Ver\u00f3nica |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Lyle |date=2012 |title=The Indigenous Languages of South America |chapter=Classification of the indigenous languages of South America |series=The World of Linguistics |volume=2 |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |pages=59\u2013166 |isbn=9783110255133}}</ref> place Coconucan under Barbacoan. The [[moribund language|moribund]] Totor\u00f3 is sometimes considered a dialect of Guambiano instead of a separate language, and, indeed, Adelaar & Muysken (2004) state that Guambiano-Totor\u00f3-Coconuco is best treated as a single language.\n\nThe Barb\u00e1coa (Barbacoas) language itself is unattested, and is only assumed to be part of the Barbacoan family.  Nonetheless, it has been assigned an ISO code, though the better-attested and classifiable Pasto language has not.\n\n===Loukotka (1968)===\nBelow is a full list of Barbacoan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n;Barbacoa group\n*'''Barb\u00e1coa of Colima''' - extinct language once spoken on the [[Iscuand\u00e9 River]] and [[Patia River]], Nari\u00f1o department, Colombia.

Barbacoan is often connected with the [[Paezan languages]] (including P\u00e1ez); however, Curnow (1998) shows how much of this proposal is based on misinterpretation of an old document of Douay (1888). (See: [[Paezan languages]].)\n\nOther more speculative larger groupings involving Barbacoan include the [[Macro-Paesan]] \"cluster\", the [[Macro-Chibchan]] stock, and the [[Chibchan-Paezan]] stock.\n\n==Languages==\n\nBarboacoan consists of 6 languages:\n\n*'''Northern'''\n:* '''Awan''' (also known as Awa or Pasto)\n::* [[Awa Pit]] (also known as Cuaiquer, Coaiquer, Kwaiker, Aw\u00e1, Awa, Telembi, Sindagua, Awa-Cuaiquer, Koaiker, Telemb\u00ed)\n::* Pasto\u2013Muellama\n:::* [[Pasto language|Pasto]] (also known as Past Aw\u00e1) ''(\u2020)''\n:::* [[Muellama language|Muellama]] (also known as Muellamu\u00e9s, Muelyama) ''(\u2020)''\n:* '''Coconucan''' (also known as Guambiano\u2013Totor\u00f3)\n::* [[Guambiano language|Guambiano]] (also known as Mog\u00fces, Moguez, Mog\u00e9s, Wam, Misak, Guambiano-Moguez, Wambiano-Mog\u00e9s, Moguex)\n::* [[Totoro language|Totor\u00f3]] (also known as Polindara)\n::* [[Coconuco language|Coconuco]] (also known as Kokonuko, Cauca, Wanaka) ''(\u2020)''\n\n*'''Southern''' ? (Cayapa\u2013Tsafiki)\n:* [[Caranqui language|Caranqui]] (also known as Cara, Kara, Karanki, Imbaya) ''(\u2020)''\n:* [[Cha'palaachi language|Cha\u2019palaachi]] (also known as Cayapa, Chachi, Kayapa, Nigua, Cha\u2019pallachi)\n:* [[Tsafiki language|Tsafiki]] (also known as Colorado, Tsafiqui, Ts\u00e1fiki, Colorado, Ts\u00e1chela, Tsachila, Campaz, Colima)\n\nPasto, Muellama, Coconuco, and Caranqui are now [[Extinct language|extinct]].\n\nPasto and Muellama are usually classified as Barbacoan, but the current evidence is weak and deserves further attention. Muellama may have been one of the last surviving [[dialect]]s of Pasto (both extinct, replaced by Spanish) \u2014 Muellama is known only by a short wordlist recorded in the 19th century. The Muellama vocabulary is similar to modern Awa Pit. The [[Ca\u00f1ari\u2013Puruh\u00e1 languages]] are even more poorly attested, and while often placed in a [[Chimuan languages|Chimuan]] family, Adelaar (2004:397) thinks they may have been Barbacoan.\n\nThe Coconucan languages were first connected to Barbacoan by Daniel Brinton in 1891. However, a subsequent publication by Henri Beuchat and Paul Rivet placed Coconucan together with a [[Paezan]] family (which included [[P\u00e1ez language|P\u00e1ez]] and [[Paniquita language|Paniquita]]) due a misleading \"Moguex\" vocabulary list. The \"Moguex\" vocabulary turned out to be a mix of both P\u00e1ez and Guambiano languages (Curnow 1998). This vocabulary has led to misclassifications by Greenberg (1956, 1987), Loukotka (1968), Kaufman (1990, 1994), and Campbell (1997), among others. Although P\u00e1ez may be related to the Barbacoan family, a conservative view considers P\u00e1ez a [[language isolate]] pending further investigation. Guambiano is more similar to other Barbacoan languages than to P\u00e1ez, and thus Key (1979), Curnow et al. (1998), Gordon (2005), and Campbell (2012)<ref name=\"Campbell-SAmerica\">{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Lyle |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |editor1-last=Grondona |editor1-first=Ver\u00f3nica |editor2-last=Campbell |editor2-first=Lyle |date=2012 |title=The Indigenous Languages of South America |chapter=Classification of the indigenous languages of South America |series=The World of Linguistics |volume=2 |location=Berlin |publisher=De Gruyter Mouton |pages=59\u2013166 |isbn=9783110255133}}</ref> place Coconucan under Barbacoan. The [[moribund language|moribund]] Totor\u00f3 is sometimes considered a dialect of Guambiano instead of a separate language, and, indeed, Adelaar & Muysken (2004) state that Guambiano-Totor\u00f3-Coconuco is best treated as a single language.\n\nThe Barb\u00e1coa (Barbacoas) language itself is unattested, and is only assumed to be part of the Barbacoan family.  Nonetheless, it has been assigned an ISO code, though the better-attested and classifiable Pasto language has not.\n\n==Loukotka (1968)==\nBelow is a full list of Barbacoan language varieties listed by [[\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka|Loukotka]] (1968), including names of unattested varieties.<ref name=\"Loukotka\">{{cite book |last=Loukotka |first=\u010cestm\u00edr |authorlink=\u010cestm\u00edr Loukotka |title=Classification of South American Indian languages |url=https://archive.org/details/classificationof0007louk |url-access=registration |publisher=UCLA Latin American Center |year=1968 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>\n\n;Barbacoa group\n*'''Barb\u00e1coa of Colima''' - extinct language once spoken on the [[Iscuand\u00e9 River]] and [[Patia River]], Nari\u00f1o department, Colombia.
