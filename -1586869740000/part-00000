\u2013 16 July 2019) was a South African musician and [[anthropologist]], some of whose work was in musicology focused on the music of indigenous South African peoples.<ref name=sexton/> His band [[Juluka]] began as a duo with [[Sipho Mchunu]], and was the first group in the South African [[apartheid]]-era with a white man and a black man. They recorded and performed, later in larger formation.\n\nIn 1986 Clegg founded the band [[Savuka]], and also recorded as a solo act, occasionally reuniting with his earlier band partners. Sometimes called ''Le Zoulou Blanc'' ({{IPA-fr|l\u0259 zulu bl\u0251\u0303|lang}}, for \"The White [[Zulu people|Zulu]]\"), he was an important figure in South African popular music and one of the most prominent white activists in [[Internal resistance to apartheid|resistance to apartheid]],<ref name=LeMonde-Jul2019>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=16 July 2019 |title=Mort du chanteur sud-africain Johnny Clegg, \u00ab&nbsp;le Zoulou blanc&nbsp;\u00bb qui combattait l\u2019apartheid |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2019/07/16/mort-du-chanteur-sud-africain-johnny-clegg-le-zoulou-blanc-qui-combattait-l-apartheid_5490110_3382.html |website=Le Monde |location=Paris |trans-title=Death of South African singer Johnny Clegg, the \"white Zulu\" who fought apartheid |language=fr |agency=AFP |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716212749/https://www.lemonde.fr/disparitions/article/2019/07/16/mort-du-chanteur-sud-africain-johnny-clegg-le-zoulou-blanc-qui-combattait-l-apartheid_5490110_3382.html |archive-date=16 July 2019 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> with songs that mixed [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and English lyrics, also combining [[Music of Africa|African music]] with various Western styles.<ref name=Cartwright-Jul2019>{{cite web |last=Cartwright |first=Gareth |date=24 July 2019 |title=Johnny Clegg: South African singer whose cross-cultural music was a direct challenge to apartheid |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/johnny-clegg-death-singer-south-africa-apartheid-nelson-mandela-obituary-a9008716.html |website=The Independent |location=London |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725142755/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/johnny-clegg-death-singer-south-africa-apartheid-nelson-mandela-obituary-a9008716.html |archive-date=25 July 2019 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\nClegg was born on 7 June 1953 in [[Bacup]], [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\"official\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnyclegg.com/biog.html|title=JOHNNY CLEGG BIOGRAPHY AND AWARDS|publisher=JohnnyClegg.com|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> to an English father of Scottish descent, Dennis Clegg, and a Rhodesian mother, Muriel (Braudo).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/white-zulu-is-making-a-comeback-940896|title=White Zulu is making a comeback &#124; IOL Entertainment|website=Iol.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/arts/music/johnny-clegg-dead.html|title=Johnny Clegg, South African Singer Who Battled Apartheid With Music, Is Dead at 66|first=Alan|last=Cowell|date=16 July 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Clegg's mother's family were [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from [[Lithuania]], and Clegg had a secular Jewish upbringing, learning about the [[Ten Commandments]] but refusing to have a ''[[bar mitzvah]]'' or even associate with other Jewish children at school.<ref name=\"stars\">''Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories'' by Scott R.
