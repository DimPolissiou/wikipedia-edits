In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to see off numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The weapon was estimated to allow the regiment to deliver five t seven times the firepower of muzzle-loading opponents<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>.\n\nThe 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\" /> The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe brigade surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After driving them through the gap, the brigade found it outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade entrenched and held this position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/> The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the campaign. }} \n\nDuring the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]|Tullahoma Campaign]], the 123rd and the rest of the Lightning Brigade, were one of the few positive results. The 123rd was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Feeling quite confident in the advantage their [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s gave them, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAt around 14:00 on 19 September, the 123rd and its brigade spoiled the left column of the main rebel attack by severely mauling both Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade and Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade. The attacking Confederates were surprised by the resolute, confident manner that the Lightning Brigade demonnstrated in driving them back.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> \n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to see off numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The weapon was estimated to allow the regiment to deliver five t seven times the firepower of muzzle-loading opponents<ref name=\"SunSpencer\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>.\n\nThe 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref> The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe brigade surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After driving them through the gap, the brigade found it outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade entrenched and held this position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/> The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the campaign. }} \n\nDuring the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]|Tullahoma Campaign]], the 123rd and the rest of the Lightning Brigade, were one of the few positive results. The 123rd was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Feeling quite confident in the advantage their [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s gave them, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAt around 14:00 on 19 September, the 123rd and its brigade spoiled the left column of the main rebel attack by severely mauling both Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade and Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade. The attacking Confederates were surprised by the resolute, confident manner that the Lightning Brigade demonnstrated in driving them back.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

The draft was held from April 23\u201325 via [[videoconferencing]]. The first round was held on April 23, followed by the second and third rounds on April 24, and concluded with rounds 4\u20137 on April 25. The NFL originally planned to hold the event live in [[Paradise, Nevada]], before all public events related to it were canceled due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. Instead, all team selections took place virtually. The [[Cincinnati Bengals]] selected quarterback [[Joe Burrow]] of [[LSU]] with the first overall pick.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Format==\nThe host city for this draft was chosen among finalists [[Denver]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Las Vegas, [[Nashville]], and [[Cleveland]]/[[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] in May 2018 during the NFL Spring League Meeting,<ref>{{cite news|title=Finalists to host 2019, 2020 NFL Draft announced|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000916417/article/finalists-to-host-2019-2020-nfl-draft-announced|website=NFL.com|publisher=National Football League|date=February 15, 2018}}</ref> when Nashville was chosen to host the [[2019 NFL Draft|2019 draft]].

Men competed in both disciplines whereas women only participated in the freestyle events, with 18 [[gold medal]]s awarded. [[Amateur wrestling|Wrestling]] had been contested at every modern [[Summer Olympic Games]], except [[1900 Summer Olympics|Paris 1900]].\n\nAround 344 wrestlers competed in 18 events at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. In September 2013, a new change to the rules and guidelines of the sport had been instituted and overhauled by the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[United World Wrestling|FILA]] (now known as the United World Wrestling).

A member of a prominent political family in Massachusetts, he was a leading 19th century lawyer of that state. He was associated with the [[Federalist Party]] until its decline after the War of 1812.   Over his career, a prominent Massachusetts anti-slavery politician and spokesperson. He became a leading member of the Massachusetts [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Party, a leading and founding member of the Massachusetts  [[Free Soil Party]], and a founding member and chair of the committee that organized the founding convention for the  [[Massachusetts Republican Party]] in 1854.\n\nHoar may be best known in American history for his 1844 trip to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] as an appointed Commissioner of the state of [[Massachusetts]]. He went to South Carolina to investigate and contest the laws of that state, which allowed the seizure of sailors who were free African Americans (often who were citizens of Massachusetts) and placed into bondage, if such sailors disembarked from their ship. Hoar was prevented from undertaking his appointed tasks by resolutions of the legislature and efforts of the governor of South Carolina, and was escorted back onto a ship by Charleston citizens fearing mob violence against the agent from Massachusetts. News of the thwarting of Hoar inspired anti-slavery political reaction in Massachusetts.\n\n==Early life==\nHoar was a born in the town of [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]], and as an adult lived in neighboring [[Concord, Massachusetts]].  He graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] in 1802, and was admitted to the bar in 1805. On October 13, 1812 he married Sarah Sherman (1785\u20131862) of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Sarah was the youngest child of [[Roger Sherman]] and his second wife, [[Rebecca Minot Prescott]]. Roger Sherman was a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].\n\n== Political and legal career ==\nHoar was delegate to the Massachusetts constitutional convention in 1820.

South Carolina had enacted laws prohibiting the emancipation of slaves, or the entry into the state of free [[African American]]s. South Carolina agents would arrest free African American seamen from Massachusetts, members of the crew aboard ships that arrived at South Carolina [[sea port]]s; if the arrestee or the captain of the ship failed to pay fines for the criminal entry into the state, the arrestee would be sold into [[slavery]] to pay the fines.\n\nIn 1844 the Massachusetts legislature authorized the governor to appoint a Commissioner to reside in Charleston, South Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana, to collect information as to the number from Massachusetts citizens unlawfully seized in those cities, and to prosecute some of the suits before higher courts for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the laws under which the forcible seizures were being made.  In 1844, Massachusetts governor [[George N. Briggs]] (Whig party) appointed Hoar commissioner to South Carolina.<ref name = 'Flower-History Republican Party-1884'>\n{{cite book | last = Flower | first = Frank A.| title = History of the Republican Party, Embracing its Origin Growth and Mission: Together with Appendices of Statistics and Information required by Enlightened Politicians and Patriotic Citizens | publisher = Union Book Company | year = 1884 | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.A. | pages = [https://archive.org/details/historyrepublic00flowgoog/page/n83 65]\u201369 | url = https://archive.org/details/historyrepublic00flowgoog | doi =  | isbn = }} \n</ref>\n\nUpon receipt of the letter from Massachusetts Governor Briggs announcing Hoar's appointment, South Carolina Governor [[James H.

On his arrival, with daughter Elizabeth Sherman Hoar, in Charleston, December 1844, local citizens warned Hoar to leave town. Local leading citizens secretly escorted the Hoars out of their hotel, to a ship, in advance of feared mob violence.<ref name=\"Robbins-UUHS-Hoar\"/>\nWhen news of this incident reached Massachusetts it aroused much ire, contributing to a developing sentiment in Massachusetts against slavery and in favor of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]].<ref name=\"S.Hoar-Bio Dir of US Congress\"/><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/massgovs/gbriggs.htm Governors of Massachusetts: George Nixon Briggs (1796-1861): Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1844-1851 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215172222/http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/massgovs/gbriggs.htm |date=2006-12-15 }} Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

A member of a prominent political family in Massachusetts, he was a leading 19th century lawyer of that state. He was associated with the [[Federalist Party]] until its decline after the War of 1812.   Over his career, a prominent Massachusetts anti-slavery politician and spokesperson. He became a leading member of the Massachusetts [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Party, a leading and founding member of the Massachusetts  [[Free Soil Party]], and a founding member and chair of the committee that organized the founding convention for the  [[Massachusetts Republican Party]] in 1854.\n\nHoar may be best known in American history for his 1844 trip to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] as an appointed Commissioner of the state of [[Massachusetts]]. He went to South Carolina to investigate and contest the laws of that state, which allowed the seizure of sailors who were free African Americans (often who were citizens of Massachusetts) and placed into bondage, if such sailors disembarked from their ship. Hoar was prevented from undertaking his appointed tasks by resolutions of the legislature and efforts of the governor of South Carolina, and was escorted back onto a ship by Charleston citizens fearing mob violence against the agent from Massachusetts. News of the thwarting of Hoar inspired anti-slavery political reaction in Massachusetts.\n\n==Early life==\nHoar was a born in the town of [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]], and as an adult lived in neighboring [[Concord, Massachusetts]].  He graduated from [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] in 1802, and was admitted to the bar in 1805. On October 13, 1812 he married Sarah Sherman (1785\u20131862) of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. Sarah was the youngest child of [[Roger Sherman]] and his second wife, [[Rebecca Minot Prescott]]. Roger Sherman was a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].\n\n== Political and legal career ==\nHoar was delegate to the Massachusetts constitutional convention in 1820.

South Carolina had enacted laws prohibiting the emancipation of slaves, or the entry into the state of free [[African American]]s. South Carolina agents would arrest free African American seamen from Massachusetts, members of the crew aboard ships that arrived at South Carolina [[sea port]]s; if the arrestee or the captain of the ship failed to pay fines for the criminal entry into the state, the arrestee would be sold into [[slavery]] to pay the fines.\n\nIn 1844 the Massachusetts legislature authorized the governor to appoint a Commissioner to reside in Charleston, South Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana, to collect information as to the number from Massachusetts citizens unlawfully seized in those cities, and to prosecute some of the suits before higher courts for the purpose of testing the constitutionality of the laws under which the forcible seizures were being made.  In 1844, Massachusetts governor [[George N. Briggs]] (Whig party) appointed Hoar commissioner to South Carolina.<ref name = 'Flower-History Republican Party-1884'>\n{{cite book | last = Flower | first = Frank A.| title = History of the Republican Party, Embracing its Origin Growth and Mission: Together with Appendices of Statistics and Information required by Enlightened Politicians and Patriotic Citizens | publisher = Union Book Company | year = 1884 | location = Grand Rapids, Michigan, U.S.A. | pages = [https://archive.org/details/historyrepublic00flowgoog/page/n83 65]\u201369 | url = https://archive.org/details/historyrepublic00flowgoog | doi =  | isbn = }} \n</ref>\n\nUpon receipt of the letter from Massachusetts Governor Briggs announcing Hoar's appointment, South Carolina Governor [[James H.

On his arrival, with daughter Elizabeth Sherman Hoar, in Charleston, December 1844, local citizens warned Hoar to leave town. Local leading citizens secretly escorted the Hoars out of their hotel, to a ship, in advance of feared mob violence.<ref name=\"Robbins-UUHS-Hoar\"/>\nWhen news of this incident reached Massachusetts it aroused much ire, contributing to a developing sentiment in Massachusetts against slavery and in favor of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]].<ref name=\"S.Hoar-Bio Dir of US Congress\"/><ref>[http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/massgovs/gbriggs.htm Governors of Massachusetts: George Nixon Briggs (1796-1861): Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 1844-1851 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215172222/http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/massgovs/gbriggs.htm |date=2006-12-15 }} Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families \u2013 Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spst.in/temple-history/ |title=Temple History}}</ref> The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n===Travancore royal family===\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralised the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

The Deity is visible through three doors \u2013 the visage of the reclining Lord and Siva Linga underneath the hand is seen through the first door; Sridevi and Bhrigu Muni in Katusarkara, Brahma seated on a lotus emanating from the Lord's navel, hence the name, \"Padmanabha\", gold abhisheka moorthies of Lord Padmanabha, Sridevi and Bhudevi, and silver utsava moorthi of Padmanabha through the second door; the Lord's feet, and Bhudevi and Markandeya Muni in Katusarkara through the third door. The idols of two goddesses holding chamaram, [[Garuda]], [[Narada]], [[Tumburu]], the divine forms of the six weapons of Lord Vishnu, [[Surya]], [[Chandra]], [[Saptarshi]] (Seven Sages), Madhu, and Kaitabha are also there in the Sanctum. Only the King of Travancore may perform sashtanga namaskaram, or prostrate on the \"Ottakkal Mandapam\". It is traditionally held that anybody who prostrates on the mandapam has surrendered all that he possesses to the Deity.

Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple). Grand idols of [[Garuda]] and Hanuman stand with folded hands in the Valiya balikkal area.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" /> The thevara idols of Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma and [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] are housed in the south east part of the Temple.{{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Gopuram===\nThe foundation of the present [[gopuram]] was laid in 1566.<ref>{{cite book|title=The spirituality of basic ecclesial communities in the socio-religious context of Trivandrum/Kerala, India|year=1996|publisher=Editrice Pontificia Universit\u00e0 Gregoriana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zcedqS4jOusC&dq=Old+name+of+trivandrum+to+thiruvananthapuram+1991|author=Selvister Ponnumuthan|page= 62|isbn=9788876527210}}</ref> The temple has a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturemagics.com/kerala-art-tour/padmanabhaswamy-temple-kerala.shtm |title=Padmanabhaswamy Temple Thiruvananthapuram Kerala |publisher=Naturemagics.com |accessdate=3 July 2011}}</ref> 7-tier gopuram made in the [[Pandyan Dynasty|Pandyan]] style.<ref>T.

The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies \u2013 Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi \u2013 are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple \u2013 This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari</ref> Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.<ref>Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja</ref> It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. [[Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma]], grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]], is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.\n\n==Extant temple records==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nA pertinent event in the long history of the temple was the construction of a \"granta-pura\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \"Mathilakam\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known.<ref name=\"frontline.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512800.htm|title=Key to the past}}</ref> A major portion of those records (over 3000 'Cadjan' leaf-records) from the Mathikalam had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867 at the time of the formation of the latter. Each of these Cadjan leaf-records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to [[R._Nagaswamy]], noted archaeologist and historian, totalling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents \u2013 segregated under 70 \"heads\" \u2013 is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family]].

While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key. A detailed inventory of the temple assets, consisting of gold, jewels, and other valuables is yet to be made.\n\nWhile vault B remains unopened, vaults A, C, D, E and F were opened along with some of their antechambers.

The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it.

The IB cites Mr Subramaniam's report on Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as one of the instances where he relied heavily on his spiritual instincts rather than rational logic and hard facts.<ref name=\"The Economic Times, June 25, 2014\">The Economic Times, 25 June 2014</ref> In his second report on Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Mr Subramaniam himself reveals,\"It was his morning ritual of [shutting] his mind and seeking guidance, which resulted in discoveries in this direction.\"<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 9</ref>\n\nThe Amicus Curiae has also been accused of conducting poojas in the Temple in violation of its customs.<ref name=\"The Economic Times, June 25, 2014\"/> He performed poojas at the Thevarappura in the Temple and in front of the Vedavyasa Shrine. Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "text_old": "{{manual|date=August 2017}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox temple\n| image              = TVM Padmanabhaswamy Temple.jpg\n| alt                =\n| caption            =\n| coordinates        ={{coord|8|28|58|N|76|56|37|E|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline,title}}\n| country            = [[India]]\n| state              = [[Kerala]]\n| district           =\n| location           = [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n| elevation_m        =\n| deity = [[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu]]\n| architecture       = Fusion of [[Architecture of Kerala|Kerala Architecture]] and [[ Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Architecture]]\n| inscriptions       =\n| creator            =\n| website            = [http://spst.in/ Official website]\n}}\n\n{{Vaishnavism}}\nThe '''Padmanabhaswamy temple''' is a [[Hindu temple]] located in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the state capital of [[Kerala]], [[India]].

Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families \u2013 Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spst.in/temple-history/ |title=Temple History}}</ref> The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n===Travancore royal family===\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralised the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple).

The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies \u2013 Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi \u2013 are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple \u2013 This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari</ref> Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.<ref>Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja</ref> It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. [[Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma]], grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]], is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.\n\n==Extant temple records==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nA pertinent event in the long history of the temple was the construction of a \"granta-pura\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \"Mathilakam\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known.<ref name=\"frontline.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512800.htm|title=Key to the past|publisher=}}</ref> A major portion of those records (over 3000 'Cadjan' leaf-records) from the Mathikalam had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867 at the time of the formation of the latter. Each of these Cadjan leaf-records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to [[R._Nagaswamy]], noted archaeologist and historian, totalling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents \u2013 segregated under 70 \"heads\" \u2013 is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]].

While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key. A detailed inventory of the temple assets, consisting of gold, jewels, and other valuables is yet to be made.\n\nWhile vault B remains unopened, vaults A, C, D, E and F were opened along with some of their antechambers.

This was possibly an antechamber of any of the Vaults A or C or D or E or F that may not have been opened yet. This was necessitated due to the severe economic depression that India was going through as was the entire world. The Palace and State Treasuries had run almost dry. The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it. They were full of gold jewellery encrusted with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds. Besides these, were four more chests of old coins (not of gold), and they were carried back to the Palace and State Treasuries for counting from.<ref name=\"a.srivathsan\"/>\n\n===Vault (Nilavara) B (\"The Forbidden Zone\")===\nThe Bhagavata Purana says that Lord [[Balarama]] visited  Phalgunam (more commonly known as Thiruvananthapuram), took bath in Panchapsaras (Padmateertham) and made a gift of ten thousand cows to holy men.<ref>\"Srimad Bhagavata\" (Page 381 of Volume Three). Translated by Swami Tapasyananda. Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai</ref> Though the sannidhyam of Lord Padmanabha has always been present in the holy land of Thiruvananthapuram making it a pilgrim spot even during the time of Balarama, the present-day Temple for the Lord came up later. The southwest part of the Chuttambalam was constructed at the holy spot where Lord Balarama is believed to have donated cows to holy men. This portion came to be known as Mahabharatakonam and covered the ground underneath which both Kallara B and Kallara A were situated.<ref>Letter of His Holiness the Pushpanjali Swamiyar to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan</ref>\n\nAccording to a popular legend, many Devas and Sages devoted to Lord Balarama visited Him on the banks of Padmateertham. They requested Him that they may be permitted to reside there worshipping the Lord. Balarama granted them their wish. It is believed that these Devas and Sages reside in Kallara B worshipping the Lord. [[N\u0101ga|Naga]] Devathas devoted to the Lord also dwell in this Kallara.<ref>\"Sri Padmanabho Rakshatu\" by G Sekharan Nair, Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 17 September 2017</ref> [[Kanjirottu Yakshi]], whose enchanting and ferocious forms are painted on the south-west part of the main Sanctum, resides in this Kallara worshipping Lord Narasimha.<ref>Bayi, Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi.

Lord Ugra [[Narasimha]] of Thekkedom is said to be the Protector of Kallara B. There is a serpent's image on Kallara B indicating danger to anyone who opens it. A four-day [[Ashtamangala prasnam|Ashtamangala Devaprasnam]] conducted in August 2011 declared Kallara B as \"forbidden zone\".<ref name=\"The Hindu dated July 7, 2011\">The Hindu dated 7 July 2011</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the antechamber to Kallara B was opened by the Observers appointed by the Supreme Court of India.<ref>The Hindu dated 29 June 2011</ref> But the Observers could not open Kallara B. However, Gopal Subramanium in his report submitted to the Supreme Court in April 2014, recommended its opening after conducting another Devaprasnam. The two Pushpanjali Swamiyars are the highest spiritual dignitaries of Padmanabha Swamy Temple. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Naduvil Madhom sent letters to the Chairperson of the Administrative Committee and the Executive Officer on 8 February 2016 expressing his strong opposition to the opening of Kallara B.<ref>Mathrubhumi, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 26 February 2016</ref> The Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Munchira Madhom led a Ratha Yathra from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in May 2018 campaigning against opening the sacred Kallara. [[Azhvanchery Thamprakkal]], the supreme spiritual leader of Kerala Brahmins, while addressing a meeting held in connection with the Ratha Yathra also demanded that faith should not be trampled upon by opening Kallara B.<ref>Mathrubhumi and Malayala Manorama, Thiruvananthapuram Edition dated 14 May 2018</ref>\n\n[[Mukilan's invasion of Venad|Mukilan]], a Muslim marauder, invaded vast chunks of Venad in 1680 AD.<ref>Menon, P Shungoonny.

Padmanabhan Thampi, arch rival of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma, marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces and tried to loot the vaults of the Temple. Thampi stayed at Sri Varaham and sent his mercenaries to Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. It is said that divine serpents materialised in hundreds and scared away Thampi's men. Emboldened by this heavenly intervention, [[Pallichal Pillai]] and local people opposed Padmanabhan Thampi and ensured that the mercenaries did not proceed with the misadventure.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that Kallara B was opened after the 1880s. An article by Emily Gilchrist,  a visiting Englishwoman in the 1933, recalls in her book 'Travancore: A Guide Book for the Visitor' (Oxford University Press, 1933) about an unsuccessful attempt to open one Kallara in 1908: \"About 25 years ago, when the State needed additional money, it was thought expedient to open these chests and use the wealth they contained.\" \"A group of people\" got together and attempted to enter the vaults with torches.

Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "Script-assisted fixes: perCS1andMOS:ITALICS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmanabhaswamy_Temple"}

The gonads, in a \"bipotential state\", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" /> Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.\n\nAt around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In typical female differentiation, the [[M\u00fcllerian duct|M\u00fcllerian duct system]] develops into the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tubes]], and inner third of the vagina.\nIn males, the M\u00fcllerian duct-inhibiting hormone [[Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone|MIH]] causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the [[Wolffian duct|Wolffian duct system]], which develops into the [[vas deferens]], seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" />\nBy birth, the typical fetus has been completely \"sexed\" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.\n\n===Signs===\nThere are a variety of symptoms that can occur. Ambiguous genitalia being the most common sign, there can be [[micropenis]], [[clitoromegaly]], partial [[labial fusion]], electrolyte abnormalities, delayed or absent puberty, unexpected changes at puberty, hypospadias, labial or inguinal (groin) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls and  [[undescended testes]] (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Ambiguous genitalia====\n\nAmbiguous genitalia may appear as a large [[clitoris]] or as a small penis.\n[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]\nBecause there is variation in all of the processes of the [[Sex organ#Development|development of the sex organs]], a child can be born with a [[sexual anatomy]] that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average [[clitoris]] ([[clitoral hypertrophy]]) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average [[penis]] that is open along the underside.

List of conditions\n|-\n! Sex chromosomes !! Name !! Description\n |-\n | XX || [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) || The most common cause of sexual ambiguity is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an endocrine condition in which the [[adrenal gland]]s produce atypically high levels of virilizing hormones in utero. The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of ''Sexing the Body'', \"a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested.\" To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, can begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because \"the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials\", it does allow physicians to detect CAH, therefore enabling the start of treatment right after birth. Starting treatment as soon as an XX-CAH baby is born not only minimizes but also may even eliminate the chances of genital surgery from being performed.<ref name=\"Anne_Fausto-Sterling_2000\" /> However, the necessity of such surgery itself is disputed.\n\nMeta-analysis of the studies supporting the use of dexamethasone on CAH at-risk fetuses found \"less than one half of one percent of published 'studies' of this intervention were regarded as being of high enough quality to provide meaningful data for a meta-analysis. Even these four studies were of low quality\" ... \"in ways so slipshod as to breach professional standards of medical ethics\"<ref name=\"pmid22904609\">{{cite journal|last=Dreger|first=Alice|author2=Ellen K.

The latter applies in particular to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]], which is the most common form of CAH.\n\nIndividuals born with XX chromosomes affected by [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency]] are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.\n\nSee below for XY CAH 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency.\n |-\n | XX || [[Progestin-induced virilisation]] || In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of [[progestin]], a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals typically have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males.{{mcn|date=April 2018}}\n |-\n | XX || [[Freemartin]]ism || This condition occurs commonly in all species of [[Bovinae|cattle]] and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the [[placenta]]e of [[fraternal twins]] usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a ''freemartin'' is very like a typical female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a [[Castration|castrated]] male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs{{spaced ndash}}in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop typically for their chromosomal sex.\n |-\n | XY || [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) || People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees.\n\nCases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a [[vagina]] and no [[uterus]], [[cervix]], or [[ovaries]], and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.\n\nIn mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as [[clitoromegaly]], or a small penis, which is called [[micropenis]] or microphallus; hypospadias and [[cryptorchidism]] may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.\n |-\n | XY || [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5-ARD) || The condition affects individuals with a [[Y chromosome]], making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |title=eMedicine article on 5-ARD |publisher=Emedicine.com |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193051/http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth. Such individuals are usually raised as girls. The lack of DHT also limits the development of facial hair.\n |-\n | XY || [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH) || In individuals with a Y chromosome (typically XY) who have [[Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency]], CAH inhibits virilization, unlike cases without a Y chromosome.\n |-\n | XY || [[Persistent M\u00fcllerian duct syndrome]] (PMDS) || The child has XY chromosomes typical of a male. The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce [[M\u00fcllerian inhibiting factor]] during fetal development.\n |-\n | XY || [[Anorchia]] || Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce [[gamete]]s necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to [[gender dysphoria]], as anorchic individuals are typically [[sex assignment|assigned male at birth]].\n |-\n|XY||Gonadal dysgenesis|| It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. <br /> It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly.

The gonads, in a \"bipotential state\", may develop into either testes (the male gonads) or ovaries (the female gonads), depending on the consequent events.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" /> Through the seventh week, genetically female and genetically male fetuses appear identical.\n\nAt around eight weeks of gestation, the gonads of an XY embryo differentiate into functional testes, secreting testosterone. Ovarian differentiation, for XX embryos, does not occur until approximately week 12 of gestation. In typical female differentiation, the [[M\u00fcllerian duct|M\u00fcllerian duct system]] develops into the [[uterus]], [[Fallopian tubes]], and inner third of the vagina.\nIn males, the M\u00fcllerian duct-inhibiting hormone [[Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone|MIH]] causes this duct system to regress. Next, androgens cause the development of the [[Wolffian duct|Wolffian duct system]], which develops into the [[vas deferens]], seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts.<ref name=\"Kolodny\" />\nBy birth, the typical fetus has been completely \"sexed\" male or female, meaning that the genetic sex (XY-male or XX-female) corresponds with the phenotypical sex; that is to say, genetic sex corresponds with internal and external gonads, and external appearance of the genitals.\n\n===Signs===\nThere are a variety of symptoms that can occur. Ambiguous genitalia being the most common sign, there can be [[micropenis]], [[clitoromegaly]], partial [[labial fusion]], electrolyte abnormalities, delayed or absent puberty, unexpected changes at puberty, hypospadias, labial or inguinal (groin) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls and  [[undescended testes]] (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n====Ambiguous genitalia====\n\nAmbiguous genitalia may appear as a large [[clitoris]] or as a small penis.\n[[File:Quigley scale for androgen insensitivity syndrome.jpg|thumb|The [[Quigley scale]] is a method for describing genital development in AIS.]]\nBecause there is variation in all of the processes of the [[Sex organ#Development|development of the sex organs]], a child can be born with a [[sexual anatomy]] that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average [[clitoris]] ([[clitoral hypertrophy]]) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average [[penis]] that is open along the underside.

The genes that cause CAH can now be detected in the developing embryo. As Fausto-Sterling mentioned in chapter 3 of ''Sexing the Body'', \"a woman who suspects she may be pregnant with a CAH baby (if she or someone in her family carries CAH) can undergo treatment and then get tested.\" To prevent an XX-CAH child's genitalia from becoming masculinized, a treatment, which includes the use of the steroid dexamethasone, can begin as early as four weeks after formation. Many do not favor this process because \"the safety of this experimental therapy has not been established in rigorously controlled trials\", it does allow physicians to detect CAH, therefore enabling the start of treatment right after birth.

The latter applies in particular to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency]], which is the most common form of CAH.\n\nIndividuals born with XX chromosomes affected by [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency|17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency]] are born with female internal and external anatomy, but, at puberty, neither the adrenals nor the ovaries can produce sex-hormones, inhibiting breast development and the growth of pubic hair.\n\nSee below for XY CAH 17\u03b1-hydroxylase deficiency.\n |-\n | XX || [[Progestin-induced virilisation]] || In this case, the excess androgen hormones are caused by the use of [[progestin]], a drug that was used in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent miscarriage. These individuals typically have internal and external female anatomy, with functional ovaries and will therefore have menstruation. They develop, however, some male secondary sex characteristics and they frequently have unusually large clitorises. In very advanced cases, such children have initially been identified as males.{{mcn|date=April 2018}}\n |-\n | XX || [[Freemartin]]ism || This condition occurs commonly in all species of [[Bovinae|cattle]] and affects most females born as a twin to a male. It is rare or unknown in other mammals, including humans. In cattle, the [[placenta]]e of [[fraternal twins]] usually fuse at some time during the pregnancy, and the twins then share their blood supply. If the twins are of different sexes, male hormones produced in the body of the fetal bull find their way into the body of the fetal heifer (female), and masculinize her. Her sexual organs do not develop fully, and her ovaries may even contain testicular tissue. When adult, such a ''freemartin'' is very like a typical female in external appearance, but she is infertile, and behaves more like a [[Castration|castrated]] male (a steer). The male twin is not significantly affected, although (if he remains entire) his testes may be slightly reduced in size. The degree of masculinization of the freemartin depends on the stage of pregnancy at which the placental fusion occurs{{spaced ndash}}in about ten percent of such births no fusion occurs and both calves develop typically for their chromosomal sex.\n |-\n | XY || [[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) || People with AIS have a Y chromosome, (typically XY), but are unable to metabolize androgens in varying degrees.\n\nCases with typically female appearance and genitalia are said to have complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS). People with CAIS have a [[vagina]] and no [[uterus]], [[cervix]], or [[ovaries]], and are infertile. The vagina may be shorter than usual, and, in some cases, is nearly absent. Instead of female internal reproductive organs, a person with CAIS has undescended or partially descended testes, of which the person may not even be aware.\n\nIn mild and partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (MAIS and PAIS), the body is partially receptive to androgens, so there is virilization to varying degrees. PAIS can result in genital ambiguity, due to limited metabolization of the androgens produced by the testes. Ambiguous genitalia may present as a large clitoris, known as [[clitoromegaly]], or a small penis, which is called [[micropenis]] or microphallus; hypospadias and [[cryptorchidism]] may also be present, with one or both testes undescended, and hypospadias appearing just below the glans on an otherwise typical male penis, or at the base of the shaft, or at the perineum and including a bifid (or cleft) scrotum.\n |-\n | XY || [[5-alpha-reductase deficiency]] (5-ARD) || The condition affects individuals with a [[Y chromosome]], making their bodies unable to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is necessary for the development of male genitalia in utero, and plays no role in female development, so its absence tends to result in ambiguous genitalia at birth; the effects can range from infertility with male genitalia to male underdevelopment with hypospadias to female genitalia with mild clitoromegaly. The frequency is unknown, and children are sometimes misdiagnosed as having AIS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |title=eMedicine article on 5-ARD |publisher=Emedicine.com |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017193051/http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic1980.htm |archivedate=17 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Individuals can have testes, as well as vagina and labia, and a small penis capable of ejaculation that looks like a clitoris at birth.

The child has a male body and an internal uterus and fallopian tubes because his body did not produce [[M\u00fcllerian inhibiting factor]] during fetal development.\n |-\n | XY || [[Anorchia]] || Individuals with XY chromosomes whose gonads were lost after 14 weeks of fetal development. People with anorchia have no ability to produce the hormones responsible for developing male secondary sex characteristics nor the means to produce [[gamete]]s necessary for reproduction due to the lack of gonads. They may develop typically feminine secondary sex characteristics without or despite the administration of androgens to artificially initiate physical sex differentiation (typically planned around the age of puberty). Psychological and neurological gender identity may solidify before the administration of androgens, leading to [[gender dysphoria]], as anorchic individuals are typically [[sex assignment|assigned male at birth]].\n |-\n|XY||Gonadal dysgenesis|| It has various causes and are not all genetic; a catch-all category. <br /> It refers to individuals (mostly XY) whose gonads don't develop properly.
