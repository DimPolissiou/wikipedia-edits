In the 1480s there was at least some sort of settlement, perhaps with a church that no longer stands today as well.  \n\nThe present village is built on a hill and had a its church built in the early 1900s.  The architecture of the village is said to be typical Hungarian style for the time period.  A famous house in Szentendre Village became a museum and is known as the \"V\u00f6ck\u00f6ndi house.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Zala}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vockond}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Zala County]]\n\n{{Zala-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6ck%C3%B6nd"}

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915.       \n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.   \n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these members, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), would distinguish himself with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win a Military Medal for bravery in the field on 21st of December, 1916.  The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA.  On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.<br />\n\n==Unit distinctions==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:    \n\n*'''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit\u00a0within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was the only active Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n*'''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

King Edward VIII unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of French President Albert Lebrun and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including 6,200 attendees from Canada. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen Elizabeth II re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. 18 original 87th Battalion (CGG) members participated in the 1936 Vimy Ridge pilgrimage.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915.       \n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.   \n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these members, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), would distinguish himself with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win a Military Medal for bravery in the field on 21st of December, 1916.  The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA.  On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.<br />\n\n==Unit distinctions==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:    \n\n*'''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit\u00a0within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was the only active Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n*'''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.
