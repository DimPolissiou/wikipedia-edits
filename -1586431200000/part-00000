Along with [[Mark Arm]], [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]], and [[Jeff Ament]], he is one of its founding members. He is also the founder, drummer, and songwriter for the band [[Ex's With Benefits]]; as well as a founder and guitar player for the band [[Thee Deception]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\nVincent attended the [[Northwest School, Seattle|Northwest School]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] with future bandmates [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]] and [[Stone Gossard]] (as well as future [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|Presidents of the United States of America]] drummer, [[Jason Finn (musician)|Jason Finn]]). He was the [[drummer]] for the band [[Spluii Numa]] and later pioneered the [[grunge]] scene as a founding member of [[Green River (band)|Green River]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13088/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Green River|last=Huey|first=Steve|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> \n\nAfter the disbanding of Green River in 1987, he returned to college, eventually ending up in [[Japan]] as a student of international studies at [[Sophia University]] ([[\u4e0a\u667a\u5927\u5b66]]) in [[Tokyo]]. He moved back to the [[United States]] in 1995 to work in politics and labor union-related organizations.\n\nIn 2012, he formed the punk band Ex's With Benefits with Dmitra Smith, Dave Place, and Pascal Faivre. In 2016, he formed Thee Deception with Dave Place, Samuel Bligh, [[Regan Hagar]], and Cody Davis.\n\n=== Green River ===\n{{Main|Green River (band)}}\n\nVincent and Turner became acquainted with fellow Seattle musician [[Mark Arm]] while playing shows in and around Seattle in the early 1980s. In mid-1984, the three decided to form a band. They snapped up local bassist [[Jeff Ament]] after his band at the time, [[Deranged Diction]], had broken up. The foursome called themselves Green River. Stone Gossard joined shortly thereafter. \"We knew we wanted Ament,\" said Vincent. \"Stone was in another band with Jonathan Evison called March of Crimes. [Stone] got fired from them and we picked him up just before we recorded the first demo.\"<ref name=\"Interview with Alex Vincent\">Interview with Alex Vincent</ref> By the time the band finished the recording of its debut EP, ''[[Come on Down (EP)|Come on Down]]'', Turner decided to leave the group, citing his distaste with Ament and Gossard's [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] leanings.<ref name=\"allmusicgr\">Huey, Steve. \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13088|pure_url=yes}} Green River]\". [[Allmusic]]. Retrieved on June 13, 2005.</ref> [[Bruce Fairweather]], Ament's former Deranged Diction bandmate, replaced Turner.\n\nThe band released the EP ''Come on Down'' in 1985 and followed it up with ''[[Dry As a Bone]]'' in 1987, the first release on [[Sub Pop]] records.<ref name=\"subpopbio\">[http://www.subpop.com/bio/green_river Sub Pop Records biography]</ref> The band's only full-length studio album, ''[[Rehab Doll]]'', was released in 1988.<ref name=\"subpopbio\" /> In-fighting within the band lead to the group's break-up during the recording of ''Rehab Doll''. A stylistic division had developed between Ament and Gossard on one side, and Arm on the other.<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]''. Little Brown and Company, 2001. {{ISBN|0-316-78753-1}}, pg. 422</ref> Ament and Gossard wanted to pursue a major-label deal, while Arm wanted to remain [[independent music|independent]], viewing the duo as being too careerist.<ref name=\"allmusicgr\" /> The band achieved a considerable local reputation in Seattle and had a significant influence on the genre later known as ''grunge'', with Green River being described as \"arguably the first grunge band.\"<ref name=\"allmusicgr\" />\n\nIn 2008, Green River reunited for the 20-year anniversary of the [[Sub Pop]] record label and have played several live shows since.\n\n=== Ex's With Benefits ===\n\nEx's With Benefits formed in 2012 after Vincent had written music for possible future recordings by Green River that never materialized. Not wanting the music to go to waste, he held on to it hoping to hear what it sounded like with vocals. He reconnected with an old high school friend, Dmitra Smith (who was fronting the San Francisco-based band [[Static People]]), sending her some of the songs to see if she'd be able to record on top of them. Almost immediately, it became a real collaboration.<ref name=\"ewbws\">{{cite web|title=Ex's With Benefits|url=http://exswithbenefits.com/|website=Ex's With Benefits Band Web Site|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> Soon after, Dmitra's husband, Pascal Faivre, joined on guitar with Dave Place on bass.<ref name=\"ewbws\"/>\n\n=== Big in Japan ===\n\nIn October 2010, Vincent played himself in the semi-documentary film, [[Big in Japan (Movie)|Big in Japan]], directed by [[John Jeffcoat]].<ref name=\"biginjapan\">{{cite web|title=Big in Japan|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3324702/|website=imdb.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> It premiered in March 2014 at the [[South By Southwest]] Music and Film Festival.<ref name=\"biginjapan\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nVincent currently lives in [[Seattle]], Washington.

He is also the founder, drummer, and songwriter for the band [[Ex's With Benefits]]; as well as a founder and guitar player for the band [[Thee Deception]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\nVincent attended the [[Northwest School]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] with future bandmates [[Steve Turner (guitarist)|Steve Turner]] and [[Stone Gossard]] (as well as future [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|Presidents of the United States of America]] drummer, [[Jason Finn (musician)|Jason Finn]]). He was the [[drummer]] for the band [[Spluii Numa]] and later pioneered the [[grunge]] scene as a founding member of [[Green River (band)|Green River]].<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13088/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Green River|last=Huey|first=Steve|publisher=[[All Media Guide|AMG]]|accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> \n\nAfter the disbanding of Green River in 1987, he returned to college, eventually ending up in [[Japan]] as a student of international studies at [[Sophia University]] ([[\u4e0a\u667a\u5927\u5b66]]) in [[Tokyo]]. He moved back to the [[United States]] in 1995 to work in politics and labor union-related organizations.\n\nIn 2012, he formed the punk band Ex's With Benefits with Dmitra Smith, Dave Place, and Pascal Faivre. In 2016, he formed Thee Deception with Dave Place, Samuel Bligh, [[Regan Hagar]], and Cody Davis.\n\n=== Green River ===\n{{Main|Green River (band)}}\n\nVincent and Turner became acquainted with fellow Seattle musician [[Mark Arm]] while playing shows in and around Seattle in the early 1980s. In mid-1984, the three decided to form a band. They snapped up local bassist [[Jeff Ament]] after his band at the time, [[Deranged Diction]], had broken up. The foursome called themselves Green River. Stone Gossard joined shortly thereafter. \"We knew we wanted Ament,\" said Vincent. \"Stone was in another band with Jonathan Evison called March of Crimes. [Stone] got fired from them and we picked him up just before we recorded the first demo.\"<ref name=\"Interview with Alex Vincent\">Interview with Alex Vincent</ref> By the time the band finished the recording of its debut EP, ''[[Come on Down (EP)|Come on Down]]'', Turner decided to leave the group, citing his distaste with Ament and Gossard's [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] leanings.<ref name=\"allmusicgr\">Huey, Steve. \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13088|pure_url=yes}} Green River]\".

Not wanting the music to go to waste, he held on to it hoping to hear what it sounded like with vocals. He reconnected with an old high school friend, Dmitra Smith (who was fronting the San Francisco-based band [[Static People]]), sending her some of the songs to see if she'd be able to record on top of them. Almost immediately, it became a real collaboration.<ref name=\"ewbws\">{{cite web|title=Ex's With Benefits|url=http://exswithbenefits.com/|website=Ex's With Benefits Band Web Site|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> Soon after, Dmitra's husband, Pascal Faivre, joined on guitar with Dave Place on bass.<ref name=\"ewbws\"/>\n\n=== Big in Japan ===\n\nIn October 2010, Vincent played himself in the semi-documentary film, [[Big in Japan (Movie)|Big in Japan]], directed by [[John Jeffcoat]].<ref name=\"biginjapan\">{{cite web|title=Big in Japan|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3324702/|website=imdb.com|accessdate=26 July 2016}}</ref> It premiered in March 2014 at the [[South By Southwest]] Music and Film Festival.<ref name=\"biginjapan\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nVincent currently lives in [[Seattle]], Washington.

This is reflected in the street names Chase Road (which leads due north from the station to [[Oakwood, London|Oakwood]], and was formerly the avenue into the Chase) and Chase Side.  There is a blue plaque on a building on the site of the south gate. A little further to the south was another small medieval settlement called South Street which had grown up around a village green; by 1829 the two settlements had merged and the village green became today's Southgate Green.<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=Bertram|title=Old Southgate and Palmers Green|year=2008|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|isbn=9781840334241|page=3|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nBecoming separate from [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]] in 1881, Southgate had a population in 1891 of just 10,970. By 1901 the figure had moved up to 14,993, and by 1911 the figure had ballooned to 33,612, aided by the nearby railway station in [[Palmers Green, London, England|Palmers Green]].\n[[File:Southgate Club.jpg|thumbnail|Rare survivors of 1930s development: The Southgate Club (built 1889) and adjacent [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terrace in Chase Side.<ref>https://new.enfield.gov.uk/services/planning/enfield-local-heritage-list-may-18-planning.pdf</ref>]]\nSouthgate was predominantly developed in the 1930s: largish semi-detached houses were built on the hilly former estates (Walker, Osidge, Monkfrith, etc.) following increased transport development. In 1933, the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] was completed through Edmonton and Southgate, and also in 1933, the [[London Underground]] Piccadilly line was extended from Arnos Grove (where it had reached the previous year), through [[Southgate tube station]], on to Enfield West (now known as [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]]). This unleashed a building boom, and by 1939 the area had become almost fully developed.\n\nBy 1951, the population had grown to 73,377 \u2013 falling by about 1,000 ten years later as many moved to new towns nearby.\n\n===Status===\nIn 1894 an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[Middlesex]], called Southgate, was created by the [[Local Government Act 1894]]. In 1933 a [[municipal borough]] called Southgate was created. The [[Municipal Borough of Southgate]] was abolished in 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]], which also created the [[London Borough of Enfield]]. This borough also included the area that had been within the [[Municipal Borough of Enfield]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Edmonton]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring areas'''\n|Northwest = [[East Barnet]]\n|North     = [[Oakwood, London|Oakwood]]\n|Northeast = [[Grange Park, Enfield|Grange Park]]\n|West      = [[Osidge]]\n|Centre    = Southgate\n|East      = [[Winchmore Hill]]\n|Southwest = [[Brunswick Park]]\n|South     = [[Arnos Grove]]\n|Southeast = [[Palmers Green]]\n}}\n\n== Local features ==\n[[File:Southgate Station, London N14 - geograph.org.uk - 1605783.jpg|thumbnail|Southgate underground station]]\nWithin the area is the art deco Grade II* [[Southgate tube station]] designed by [[Charles Holden]]. The area has several large green parks such as [[Grovelands Park]] which covers ninety-two acres and contains a former boating lake of seven acres adjoining dense woods and bracken. In Waterfall Road is [[Christ Church, Southgate|Christ Church]], built in 1862 by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir Gilbert Scott]]; adjacent to its grounds stands the Minchenden Oak. Across the road from the church lies the [[John Walker's Ground|Walker Cricket Ground]]; a regular Middlesex venue which was first used in 1859 and is named after the cricketer [[John Walker (cricketer, born 1826)|John Walker]]. \n\nThe Southgate Green conservation area contains several notable Grade II listed buildings such as [[Arnoside House and Essex House]], [[Sandford House & Norbury House]], [[Old House & Essex Coach House]], [[40 The Green, Southgate|40 The Green]] and the [[Valentine Poole houses, Southgate|Valentine Poole houses]]. The adjoining Cannon Hill features [[Arnos Grove house]] and the High Street features [[Southgate House]].\n\nSouthgate station on the [[Piccadilly line]] is the nearest tube stop to most of Southgate's residential area.

By 1901 the figure had moved up to 14,993, and by 1911 the figure had ballooned to 33,612, aided by the nearby railway station in [[Palmers Green, London, England|Palmers Green]].\n[[File:Southgate Club.jpg|thumbnail|Rare survivors of 1930s development: The Southgate Club (built 1889) and adjacent [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terrace in Chase Side.<ref>https://new.enfield.gov.uk/services/planning/enfield-local-heritage-list-may-18-planning.pdf</ref>]]\nSouthgate was predominantly developed in the 1930s: largish semi-detached houses were built on the hilly former estates (Walker, Osidge, Monkfrith, etc.) following increased transport development. In 1933, the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] was completed through Edmonton and Southgate, and also in 1933, the [[London Underground]] Piccadilly line was extended from Arnos Grove (where it had reached the previous year), through [[Southgate tube station]], on to Enfield West (now known as [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]]). This unleashed a building boom, and by 1939 the area had become almost fully developed.\n\nBy 1951, the population had grown to 73,377 \u2013 falling by about 1,000 ten years later as many moved to new towns nearby.\n\n===Status===\nIn 1894 an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[Middlesex]], called Southgate, was created by the [[Local Government Act 1894]]. In 1933 a [[municipal borough]] called Southgate was created. The [[Municipal Borough of Southgate]] was abolished in 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]], which also created the [[London Borough of Enfield]]. This borough also included the area that had been within the [[Municipal Borough of Enfield]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Edmonton]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring areas'''\n|Northwest = [[East Barnet]]\n|North     = [[Oakwood, London|Oakwood]]\n|Northeast = [[Grange Park, Enfield|Grange Park]]\n|West      = [[Osidge]]\n|Centre    = Southgate\n|East      = [[Winchmore Hill]]\n|Southwest = [[Brunswick Park]]\n|South     = [[Arnos Grove]]\n|Southeast = [[Palmers Green]]\n}}\n\n== Local features ==\n[[File:Southgate Station, London N14 - geograph.org.uk - 1605783.jpg|thumbnail|Southgate underground station]]\nWithin the area is the art deco Grade II* [[Southgate tube station]] designed by [[Charles Holden]]. The area has several large green parks such as [[Grovelands Park]] which covers ninety-two acres and contains a former boating lake of seven acres adjoining dense woods and bracken. In Waterfall Road is [[Christ Church, Southgate|Christ Church]], built in 1862 by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir Gilbert Scott]]; adjacent to its grounds stands the Minchenden Oak. Across the road from the church lies the [[John Walker's Ground|Walker Cricket Ground]]; a regular Middlesex venue which was first used in 1859 and is named after the cricketer [[John Walker (cricketer, born 1826)|John Walker]]. \n\nThe Southgate Green conservation area contains several notable Grade II listed buildings such as [[Arnoside House and Essex House]], [[Sandford House & Norbury House]], [[Old House & Essex Coach House]], [[40 The Green, Southgate|40 The Green]] and the [[Valentine Poole houses, Southgate|Valentine Poole houses]]. The adjoining Cannon Hill features [[Arnos Grove house]] and the High Street features [[Southgate House]].\n\nSouthgate station on the [[Piccadilly line]] is the nearest tube stop to most of Southgate's residential area. Other stations are at [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]] (to the north) and [[Arnos Grove tube station|Arnos Grove]] (to the south west).\n\n\n==Demography==\nSouthgate is a [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] district.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down.

incidents==\n* On 26 March 1991, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 117]], operated by an [[Airbus A310]], was hijacked by four Pakistani terrorists. The flight landed in Changi Airport at 22:15. The [[Special Operations Force (Singapore)|Singapore Special Operations Force]] stormed the plane, on the morning of 27 March. All four hijackers were killed, with no fatalities among the 123 passengers and crew that were held hostage for more than eight hours.\n* On 4 November 2010, [[Qantas Flight 32]], operated by an [[Airbus A380-800]], suffered an [[Turbine engine failure|uncontained engine failure]] and made an [[emergency landing]] in Changi Airport. Upon landing, one of the engines could not be shut down due to ruptured control cables and had to be doused for three hours by airport firefighters to forcefully shut it down. There were no crew or passenger injuries, and all 469 people on board survived this incident.\n* On 27 June 2016, [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], operated by a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], suffered an engine problem while flying from Singapore to Milan. During the diversionary landing in Singapore, the right engine and wing caught fire. The fire was quickly extinguished by airport fire services. There were no injuries among the 241 people on board.\n*On 20 April 2017, a Australian, Jason Peter Darragh, was involved in an altercation with 2 [[Singapore Police Force|Singapore police force officers]] in the early hours in an intoxicated state. He was jailed for six and half months at a resulting court hearing. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/australian-man-jailed-for-assaulting-policemen-at-changi-airport-9173332|title=Australian man jailed for assaulting policemen at Changi Airport|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n* On 16 May 2017, a fire broke out at the departure hall in Terminal 2.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |title='Small fire' at Changi Airport T2 sparks evacuation, flight delays |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=16 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519050018/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/small-fire-at-changi-airport-t2-sparks-evacuation-flight-delays-8854078 |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> The fire caused 40 flights at Terminal 2 to be delayed and diverted to Terminal 3.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=fbcna |title=Changi Airport fire: About 40 flights affected by Terminal 2 closure |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |access-date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519081305/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/changi-airport-fire-about-40-flights-affected-by-terminal-2-8854800?cid=FBcna |archive-date=19 May 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}\n</ref> Terminal 2 was closed from 17:30 to 22:45.\n* On 29 November 2017, a tow truck towing a Singapore Airlines [[Boeing 777-200]] caught fire, covering the aircraft in black soot.

At a distance of about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}}, the expressway was built almost entirely on reclaimed land, thus minimising disruptions to the existing road network in Singapore's East Coast.\n\nDespite the four main passenger terminal buildings being relatively close to each other, the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|CAAS]] (Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore) decided to build the [[Changi Airport Skytrain]] people-mover system to facilitate quicker and more convenient transfers between the terminals for travellers. The system was upgraded in 2007 with new technologies supplied by Mitsubishi, connecting to Terminal 3 and separating checked-in passengers from the general public on distinct tracks.\n\n===Inter-terminal transportation===\n[[File:Changi Airport Skytrain Crystal Mover.JPG|thumb|Changi Airport Skytrain]]\n\n[[File:Changi Airport MRT Station (EWL - Changi Branch) - Platform A.jpg|thumb|[[Changi Airport MRT station]] platforms]]\n{{main|Changi Airport Skytrain}}\n\nTerminals 1, 2 and 3 are connected by the free [[Changi Airport Skytrain|Skytrain]] service, which operates from 05:00 to 02:30.

[[Changi Airport MRT station]] is located underground between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3.

On March 10, 2020, Yang endorsed [[Joe Biden]] for president.\n\nIn April 2018, Yang released ''[[The War on Normal People]]'', a book discussing job displacement, [[automation]], and [[universal basic income]] (UBI), which are central to his campaign. Initially considered a longshot candidate, Yang gained significant support in early 2019 after appearing on the popular [[podcast]], ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]''. He later appeared on numerous other podcasts, shows, and interviews during his campaign. In 2019, his campaign raised $1.7 million, $2.8 million, and $10 million in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. In the fourth quarter, he raised $16.5 million, a 65% increase from the last quarter. Yang qualified for and participated in all six [[2020 Democratic Party presidential debates|Democratic primary debates]] held in 2019. In 2020, Yang did not meet the polling requirement for the seventh debate, but he later qualified for and participated in the eighth debate.\n\nYang's campaign strategy and platform attracted attention, especially for its heavy reliance upon [[Internet]]-based campaigning. The centerpiece of his campaign was the \"Freedom Dividend,\" a UBI of $1,000 a month to every American adult. Another key aspect of his candidacy was what he called \"Human-Centered Capitalism\". The main focus of Yang's campaign was the issue of the displacement of American [[Technological unemployment|workers through automation]], a problem Yang claims was a major reason [[Donald Trump]] won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Andrew Yang}}\nYang graduated from [[Brown University]] in 1996, concentrating in [[economics]] and [[political science]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/alum-makes-2020-presidential-bid/ |title=Alum makes 2020 presidential bid |last=Davies |first=Emily |date=April 13, 2018 |website=[[The Brown Daily Herald]] |accessdate=September 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706134607/http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/alum-makes-2020-presidential-bid/ |archive-date=July 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> He then attended [[Columbia Law School]], earning a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/us/andrew-yang-fast-facts/index.html |title=Andrew Yang Fast Facts |date=August 28, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829175055/https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/us/andrew-yang-fast-facts/index.html |archive-date=August 29, 2019 |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> In 2011, Yang founded [[Venture for America]] (VFA), a [[nonprofit organization]] that encourages [[entrepreneurship]] by matching recent college graduates with [[startups]] in various cities across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/business/no-six-figure-pay-but-making-a-difference.html |title=No Six-Figure Pay, but Making a Difference |last=Seligson |first=Hannah |date=July 13, 2013 |website=The New York Times |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214124449/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/business/no-six-figure-pay-but-making-a-difference.html |archive-date=February 14, 2018 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref> In 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] recognized Yang as a \"[[Champion of Change]]\" for his work with VFA.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/04/27/celebrating-year-champions-change-president-obama-meets-12-champions-who-are-making- |title=Celebrating a Year of Champions of Change \u2013 President Obama Meets with 12 Champions Who Are Making a Difference in Their Communities |last=Carson |first=Jon |date=April 27, 2012 |website=Obama White House |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131081202/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/04/27/celebrating-year-champions-change-president-obama-meets-12-champions-who-are-making- |archive-date=January 31, 2018 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref> In 2015, Obama further recognized Yang as a \"[[Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/05/11/airbnb-kind-snacks-white-house-celebrates-entrepreneurs-around-world |title=The White House Celebrates Entrepreneurs Around the World |last=Brayton |first=Jenna |date=May 11, 2015 |website=Obama White House |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729213916/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/05/11/airbnb-kind-snacks-white-house-celebrates-entrepreneurs-around-world |archive-date=July 29, 2019 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref> Yang stepped down as VFA's leader in March 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siliconbayounews.com/2017/03/29/andrew-yang-steps-venture-america-ceo/ |title=Andrew Yang Steps Down as Venture for America CEO |last=Ballard |first=Julia |date=March 29, 2017 |website=Silicon Bayou News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107181103/http://siliconbayounews.com/2017/03/29/andrew-yang-steps-venture-america-ceo/ |archive-date=January 7, 2019 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nYang has stated that he first took an interest in [[universal basic income]] (UBI) after reading [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]]'s book ''[[Rise of the Robots (book)|Rise of the Robots]]''.

It's one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president! We need to be laser-focused on solving the real challenges of today, like the fact that the most common jobs in America may not exist in a decade, or that most Americans cannot pay their bills.

Yang suspended his campaign on February 11, 2020, the night of the [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. On March 10, 2020, Yang endorsed [[Joe Biden]] for president.\n\nIn April 2018, Yang released ''[[The War on Normal People]]'', a book discussing job displacement, [[automation]], and [[universal basic income]] (UBI), which are central to his campaign. Initially considered a longshot candidate, Yang gained significant support in early 2019 after appearing on the popular [[podcast]], ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]''. He later appeared on numerous other podcasts, shows, and interviews during his campaign. In 2019, his campaign raised $1.7 million, $2.8 million, and $10 million in the first, second, and third quarters, respectively. In the fourth quarter, he raised $16.5 million, a 65% increase from the last quarter. Yang qualified for and participated in all six [[2020 Democratic Party presidential debates|Democratic primary debates]] held in 2019. In 2020, Yang did not meet the polling requirement for the seventh debate, but he later qualified for and participated in the eighth debate.\n\nYang's campaign strategy and platform attracted attention, especially for his heavy reliance upon [[Internet]]-based campaigning. The centerpiece of his campaign was the \"Freedom Dividend,\" a UBI of $1,000 a month to every American adult. Another key aspect of his candidacy was what he called \"Human-Centered Capitalism\". The main focus of Yang's campaign was the issue of the displacement of American [[Technological unemployment|workers through automation]], a problem Yang claims was a major reason [[Donald Trump]] won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Andrew Yang}}\nYang graduated from [[Brown University]] in 1996, concentrating in [[economics]] and [[political science]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/alum-makes-2020-presidential-bid/ |title=Alum makes 2020 presidential bid |last=Davies |first=Emily |date=April 13, 2018 |website=[[The Brown Daily Herald]] |accessdate=September 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706134607/http://www.browndailyherald.com/2018/04/13/alum-makes-2020-presidential-bid/ |archive-date=July 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> He then attended [[Columbia Law School]], earning a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/us/andrew-yang-fast-facts/index.html |title=Andrew Yang Fast Facts |date=August 28, 2019 |publisher=[[CNN]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829175055/https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/us/andrew-yang-fast-facts/index.html |archive-date=August 29, 2019 |accessdate=August 29, 2019}}</ref> In 2011, Yang founded [[Venture for America]] (VFA), a [[nonprofit organization]] that encourages [[entrepreneurship]] by matching recent college graduates with [[startups]] in various cities across the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/business/no-six-figure-pay-but-making-a-difference.html |title=No Six-Figure Pay, but Making a Difference |last=Seligson |first=Hannah |date=July 13, 2013 |website=The New York Times |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214124449/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/business/no-six-figure-pay-but-making-a-difference.html |archive-date=February 14, 2018 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref> In 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] recognized Yang as a \"[[Champion of Change]]\" for his work with VFA.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/04/27/celebrating-year-champions-change-president-obama-meets-12-champions-who-are-making- |title=Celebrating a Year of Champions of Change \u2013 President Obama Meets with 12 Champions Who Are Making a Difference in Their Communities |last=Carson |first=Jon |date=April 27, 2012 |website=Obama White House |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180131081202/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/04/27/celebrating-year-champions-change-president-obama-meets-12-champions-who-are-making- |archive-date=January 31, 2018 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref> In 2015, Obama further recognized Yang as a \"[[Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship]]\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/05/11/airbnb-kind-snacks-white-house-celebrates-entrepreneurs-around-world |title=The White House Celebrates Entrepreneurs Around the World |last=Brayton |first=Jenna |date=May 11, 2015 |website=Obama White House |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729213916/https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/05/11/airbnb-kind-snacks-white-house-celebrates-entrepreneurs-around-world |archive-date=July 29, 2019 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref> Yang stepped down as VFA's leader in March 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siliconbayounews.com/2017/03/29/andrew-yang-steps-venture-america-ceo/ |title=Andrew Yang Steps Down as Venture for America CEO |last=Ballard |first=Julia |date=March 29, 2017 |website=Silicon Bayou News |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107181103/http://siliconbayounews.com/2017/03/29/andrew-yang-steps-venture-america-ceo/ |archive-date=January 7, 2019 |accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nYang has stated that he first took an interest in [[universal basic income]] (UBI) after reading [[Martin Ford (author)|Martin Ford]]'s book ''[[Rise of the Robots (book)|Rise of the Robots]]''.
