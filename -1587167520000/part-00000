Their current lineup consists of guitarists Jim Matheos and Michael Abdow, vocalist Ray Alder, bassist Joey Vera, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek.\n\nFates Warning has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one VHS, three DVDs (each featuring live concerts) and four demo tapes.

Mainly influenced by Iron Maiden and other heavy metal bands, in songs like the title track and, particularly, \"Damnation,\" there were [[Progressive rock|prog]] aspects that would be further developed in subsequent albums. ''[[The Spectre Within]]'', which was released in 1985, featured a more progressive approach with songs like \"The Apparition\", \"Epitaph\", \"Pirates of the Underground\" and \"Traveler in Time\", with many tempo changes, a greater complexity in the arrangements, and fantasy lyrics full of symbolism and double meaning .{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=55-56}}\n\nIn 1986, original guitarist Victor Arduini left the band and was replaced by [[Frank Aresti]].\nThe third album, ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]'', regarded as a groundbreaking and essential [[Progressive metal]] release<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Essential Progressive Metal Album|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-10-23/10-essential-progressive-metal-albums|website=TeamRock}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wagner|first1=Jeff|title=Awaken The Guardian|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/03/02/fates-warning-awaken-the-guardian/|website=Decibel Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Awaken The Guardian|url=https://powerofprog.com/fates-warning-awaken-the-guardian-30th-anniversary-retrospective/|website=Power of Prog}}</ref>, was launched that year, working towards creating a more mythical atmosphere and a more fully realized progressive approach in song form; with complex and unusual riffs, and numerous tempo changes amidst frenetic and evocative vocal lines, however maintaining a basic fluidity.{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=56-57}}\n[[File:Fates Warning during the Keep It True Festival, Germany, 2016 (2).jpg|alt=Fates Warning|left|thumb|Fates Warning @ KIT Festival (2016)]]\n[[File:Fates Warning during the Keep It True Festival, Germany, 2016 (1).jpg|alt=Fates Warning|thumb|Fates Warning @ KIT Festival (2016)]]\n\n===Lineup changes and rise to near fame (1987\u22121993)===\nIn 1987, original vocalist John Arch left the band prior to the start of work on the band's next album. [[Ray Alder]] joined the band later that year. The first album with Alder, ''[[No Exit (Fates Warning album)|No Exit]]'' was released in 1988 and further developed the direction taken by the prior album with a more powerful sound all the while setting aside the fantasy themes and atmospheres. It featured one of the first [[Progressive metal|prog metal]] suite of the genre, \"The Ivory Gate of Dreams,\" which is based on the [[Gates of horn and ivory]].\n\nFollowing the tour in support of ''No Exit'', original drummer Steve Zimmerman left the band in 1988. He was replaced by [[Mark Zonder]] in 1989. ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Fates Warning album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' was released later that year. The album abandoned the aggressive sound of No Exit, in favor of a more melodic and experimental one along with a melancholic atmosphere and intimate lyrics. ''Perfect Symmetry'' was full of extremely complex arrangements and an unusual and very articulated rhythm section,{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=60-61}}, and is often regarded as a seminal prog metal album, \"which laid the foundations of the sound of the 90s\".<ref name=\"rocking.gr\">{{cite web|title=The Absolute Guide To Progressive Metal|url=http://www.rocking.gr/articles/en/The-Absolute-Guide-To-Progressive-Metal/17150/|website=rocking.gr}}</ref> [[Kevin Moore]] (keyboardist for [[Dream Theater]] at the time) was featured as a guest on the song \"At Fate's Hands\", while the cover was designed by [[Hugh Syme]], famous for his work with the Canadian [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]].\n\n1991 saw the release of ''[[Parallels (album)|Parallels]]'', distributed by [[Warner Music Group|Warner]]. The album, which started the collaboration with Rush producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]], contains more accessible and streamlined songs than in the past, except for tracks such as \"The Eleventh Hour\" and \"Life in Still Water.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2010|p=62}} Parallels is considered by some an essential album that \"has influenced a great amount of subsequent musicians\"<ref name=\"rocking.gr\"/> and is possibly the band's most commercially successful record.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parallels|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/parallels-mw0000676962|website=AllMusic}}</ref> [[James LaBrie]] (who had just joined [[Dream Theater]]) provided guest vocals on the song \"Life in Still Water\".\n\n===Later years (1994\u22122009)===\nSlowing down after the commercial success of previous releases, the band took two and a half years to complete 1994's ''[[Inside Out (Fates Warning album)|Inside Out]]'', which continued in the general vein of the previous album while adding more melody to their songs.  The band's lineup also remained intact between albums for the first time since ''Spectre Within''. Band members have attributed the album's comparative lack of success to confusion while writing this album in the wake of the success of Parallels and their subsequent failure to maintain creative momentum. ''Inside Out'' was followed by a 1995 compilation, ''[[Chasing Time (compilation)|Chasing Time]],'' which included two previously unreleased songs.\n\nIn 1996, both Joe DiBiase and Frank Aresti left the group.\n\nThe three remaining members, Alder, Matheos and Zonder, joined by new member [[Joey Vera]] on bass and [[Kevin Moore]] as a guest keyboardist, released ''[[A Pleasant Shade of Gray]]'' in 1997. Written as a [[concept album]], ''A Pleasant Shade of Gray'' revealed a much darker and bleaker mood in writing style than had been heard before from the band. The album consists of a single 53-minute song split into twelve parts, making it the longest track Fates Warning has ever recorded.\n\nA live two-CD set, ''[[Still Life (Fates Warning album)|Still Life]]'', was released in 1998, containing ''A Pleasant Shade of Gray'' performed live in its entirety. Joey Vera (bass), [[Redemption (band)|Bernie Versailles]] (guitars) and Jason Keazer (keyboards) accompanied the group on this album. A Japanese version included a studio cover of the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]', \"In Trance.\"\n\nThe lineup for [[A Pleasant Shade of Gray]] consisting of Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Vera, and Moore, returned to record ''[[Disconnected (Fates Warning album)|Disconnected]]'' in 2000. In 2003, [[Frank Aresti]] was asked to fill in on a tour with [[Dream Theater]] and [[Queensr\u00ffche]].

''[[The Spectre Within]]'', which was released in 1985, featured a more progressive approach with songs like \"The Apparition\", \"Epitaph\", \"Pirates of the Underground\" and \"Traveler in Time\", with many tempo changes, a greater complexity in the arrangements, and fantasy lyrics full of symbolism and double meaning .{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=55-56}}\n\nIn 1986, original guitarist Victor Arduini left the band and was replaced by [[Frank Aresti]].\nThe third album, ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]'', regarded as a groundbreaking and essential [[Progressive metal]] release<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Essential Progressive Metal Album|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2016-10-23/10-essential-progressive-metal-albums|website=TeamRock}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wagner|first1=Jeff|title=Awaken The Guardian|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/03/02/fates-warning-awaken-the-guardian/|website=Decibel Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Awaken The Guardian|url=https://powerofprog.com/fates-warning-awaken-the-guardian-30th-anniversary-retrospective/|website=Power of Prog}}</ref>, was launched that year, working towards creating a more mythical atmosphere and a more fully realized progressive approach in song form; with complex and unusual riffs, and numerous tempo changes amidst frenetic and evocative vocal lines, however maintaining a basic fluidity.{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=56-57}}\n[[File:Fates Warning during the Keep It True Festival, Germany, 2016 (2).jpg|alt=Fates Warning|left|thumb|Fates Warning @ KIT Festival (2016)]]\n[[File:Fates Warning during the Keep It True Festival, Germany, 2016 (1).jpg|alt=Fates Warning|thumb|Fates Warning @ KIT Festival (2016)]]\n\n===Lineup changes and rise to near fame (1987\u22121993)===\nIn 1987, original vocalist John Arch left the band prior to the start of work on the band's next album.

It featured one of the first [[Progressive metal|prog metal]] suite of the genre, \"The Ivory Gate of Dreams,\" which is based on the [[Gates of horn and ivory]].\n\nFollowing the tour in support of ''No Exit'', original drummer Steve Zimmerman left the band in 1988. He was replaced by [[Mark Zonder]] in 1989. ''[[Perfect Symmetry (Fates Warning album)|Perfect Symmetry]]'' was released later that year. The album abandoned the aggressive sound of No Exit, in favor of a more melodic and experimental one along with a melancholic atmosphere and intimate lyrics. ''Perfect Symmetry'' was full of extremely complex arrangements and an unusual and very articulated rhythm section,{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=60-61}}, and is often regarded as a seminal prog metal album, \"which laid the foundations of the sound of the 90s\".<ref name=\"rocking.gr\">{{cite web|title=The Absolute Guide To Progressive Metal|url=http://www.rocking.gr/articles/en/The-Absolute-Guide-To-Progressive-Metal/17150/|website=rocking.gr}}</ref> [[Kevin Moore]] (keyboardist for [[Dream Theater]] at the time) was featured as a guest on the song \"At Fate's Hands\", while the cover was designed by [[Hugh Syme]], famous for his work with the Canadian [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]].\n\n1991 saw the release of ''[[Parallels (album)|Parallels]]'', distributed by [[Warner Music Group|Warner]]. The album, which started the collaboration with Rush producer [[Terry Brown (record producer)|Terry Brown]], contains more accessible and streamlined songs than in the past, except for tracks such as \"The Eleventh Hour\" and \"Life in Still Water.\"{{sfn|Wagner|2010|p=62}} Parallels is considered by some an essential album that \"has influenced a great amount of subsequent musicians\"<ref name=\"rocking.gr\"/> and is possibly the band's most commercially successful record.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parallels|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/parallels-mw0000676962|website=AllMusic}}</ref> [[James LaBrie]] (who had just joined [[Dream Theater]]) provided guest vocals on the song \"Life in Still Water\".\n\n===Later years (1994\u22122009)===\nSlowing down after the commercial success of previous releases, the band took two and a half years to complete 1994's ''[[Inside Out (Fates Warning album)|Inside Out]]'', which continued in the general vein of the previous album while adding more melody to their songs.  The band's lineup also remained intact between albums for the first time since ''Spectre Within''. Band members have attributed the album's comparative lack of success to confusion while writing this album in the wake of the success of Parallels and their subsequent failure to maintain creative momentum. ''Inside Out'' was followed by a 1995 compilation, ''[[Chasing Time (compilation)|Chasing Time]],'' which included two previously unreleased songs.\n\nIn 1996, both Joe DiBiase and Frank Aresti left the group.\n\nThe three remaining members, Alder, Matheos and Zonder, joined by new member [[Joey Vera]] on bass and [[Kevin Moore]] as a guest keyboardist, released ''[[A Pleasant Shade of Gray]]'' in 1997. Written as a [[concept album]], ''A Pleasant Shade of Gray'' revealed a much darker and bleaker mood in writing style than had been heard before from the band. The album consists of a single 53-minute song split into twelve parts, making it the longest track Fates Warning has ever recorded.\n\nA live two-CD set, ''[[Still Life (Fates Warning album)|Still Life]]'', was released in 1998, containing ''A Pleasant Shade of Gray'' performed live in its entirety. Joey Vera (bass), [[Redemption (band)|Bernie Versailles]] (guitars) and Jason Keazer (keyboards) accompanied the group on this album. A Japanese version included a studio cover of the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]]', \"In Trance.\"\n\nThe lineup for [[A Pleasant Shade of Gray]] consisting of Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Vera, and Moore, returned to record ''[[Disconnected (Fates Warning album)|Disconnected]]'' in 2000. In 2003, [[Frank Aresti]] was asked to fill in on a tour with [[Dream Theater]] and [[Queensr\u00ffche]].  He officially rejoined the band as a full time member in 2005.\n\nTheir tenth studio release ''[[FWX]]'' was released in 2004. Drummer [[Mark Zonder]] stated it would be his last album with the band, as he wished to pursue other interests, and left in 2005. Although an official member again, Frank Aresti did not appear on the album because the writing had been completed and contracts had been signed already.\n\n''[[Live in Athens (Fates Warning video album)|Live in Athens]]'', a concert DVD, was released in 2005; this DVD included guest drummer [[Nick D'Virgilio]].\n\nIn the liner notes to the 2005 expanded edition of ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]'', [[Dream Theater]] drummer [[Mike Portnoy]] noted that \"very often fans and critics credit Dream Theater for creating a whole new genre of progressive metal music in the late '80s/early '90s, [...] but the truth is Fates Warning were doing it years before us.\"<ref>Review of the album ''Awaken the Guardian'' at [http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/f/fateswarning-awaken.shtml PopMatters.com]</ref>\n\nThe band has recorded songs for various \"tribute\" albums, including the tracks \"[[Closer to the Heart]]\" on the tribute to [[Rush (band)|Rush]], ''[[Working Man]]'', \"Saints in Hell\" on the 1997 ''Legends of Metal'', a [[Judas Priest]] tribute, and \"Sign of the Southern Cross\" on the 2000 ''Holy Dio'' [[Ronnie James Dio]] tribute. {{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Reunions with former members, ''Darkness in a Different Light'' and ''Theories of Flight'' (2010\u22122017)===\nIn 2010, Fates Warning played select dates with the ''[[Parallels (album)|Parallels]]'' lineup (Alder, Matheos, Zonder, Aresti and DiBiase) to celebrate the reissued, remastered and expanded edition of the classic album.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011, an announcement was made that Matheos and original vocalist John Arch had formed a band called [[Arch/Matheos]]. Their debut album was released in the autumn of that year, also featuring [[Joey Vera]] on bass guitar, [[Bobby Jarzombek]] on drums, and [[Frank Aresti]] on additional lead guitar.<ref>[http://www.bravewords.com/news/154379 Arch / Matheos Project Launched Featuring Past And Present Fates Warning Members; Band Tracking In The Studio] bravewords.com. 2011-01-19.

Everyone is kind of doing their own thing. I'm sure that will come out soon enough, of what everyone is doing. For the meantime, there are no plans to write another Fates Warning album \u2014 not in the near future, at least.\" Alder also commented on the band's future, saying: \"Right now, there's just no plans to go into the studio or write. But, people are working on different things and we're working on another tour right now for South America, so that is still a little up in the air. It's 90 percent sure, but we'll see what happens with that.

Guayanilla is spread over 16 wards and Guayanilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the [[Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nGuayanilla was founded by Puerto Rican [[criollo (people)|criollo]]s. The original name was Guadianilla in memory of a river of the same name in [[Spain]]. However, it was changed to Guayanilla to resemble a native word in the [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]] dialect. The name Guayanilla is derived from a combination of [[Guaynia]] and [[Santa Maria de Guadianilla]].\n\nThe first Europeans settled in this area in 1511. In 1756, Yauco was founded as a [[town]]. Then Guayanilla was a borough of Yauco. Due to the very fertile lands and access to the local port where most of the local commerce occurred, Guayanilla became an important agricultural center, grew quickly, and was established as a separate municipality on February 27, 1833 by [[Governor]] [[Miguel de la Torre]].\n\n===Roanoke Colonists===\n{{Further|Roanoke Colony}}\nOn April 27, 1584, [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] dispatched an expedition led by [[Philip Amadas]] and [[Arthur Barlowe]] to explore the Eastern coast of North America. They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4,<ref name=\"Quinn1985\">{{cite book|last=Quinn|first=David B.|title=Set Fair for Roanoke: Voyages and Colonies, 1584\u20131606|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvA0Az4owikC|accessdate=3 June 2011|date=February 1985|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-0-8078-4123-5|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530034945/http://books.google.com/books?id=DvA0Az4owikC|archive-date=30 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>{{rp|32}} and soon established relations with the local natives, the [[Secotan]]s and [[Croatan|Croatoan]]s. Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named [[Manteo (Croatan)|Manteo]] and [[Wanchese (chief)|Wanchese]], who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh.<ref name=\"Quinn1985\"/>{{rp|44\u201345}} Based on this information, Raleigh organized a second expedition, to be led by [[Richard Grenville|Sir Richard Grenville]], Raleigh's distant cousin.\n\nGrenville's fleet departed [[Plymouth]] on April 9, 1585, with five main ships: the ''Tiger'' (Grenville's), the ''Roebuck'', the ''Red Lion'', the ''Elizabeth'', and the ''Dorothy''. Unfortunately, a severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated the ''Tiger'' from the rest of the fleet.<ref name=\"Quinn1985\"/>{{rp|57}} The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated, which was to meet up again in [[Puerto Rico]], and the ''Tiger'' arrived in the \"Baye of Muskito\"<ref name=\"nps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/fora/forteachers/teacher-handbook-to-roanoke-revisited.htm|title=Teacher Handbook to Roanoke Revisited|work=Fort Raleigh National Historic Site|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=10 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111134625/http://www.nps.gov/fora/forteachers/teacher-handbook-to-roanoke-revisited.htm|archive-date=2012-01-11|url-status=live}}</ref> (Guayanilla Bay) on May 11.\n\n[[File:Fort Elizabeth, Guyanilla Bay, Puerto Rico, by John White.jpg|thumb|right|A watercolor of the fort in Guayanilla Bay, which is likely similar to the fort constructed on Roanoke]]\nWhile waiting for the other ships, Grenville established relations with the [[Spain|Spanish]] there while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them,<ref name=\"Quinn1985\"/>{{rp|62}} and also built a fort.

Guayanilla is spread over 16 wards and Guayanilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the [[Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nGuayanilla was founded by Puerto Rican [[criollo (people)|criollo]]s. The original name was Guadianilla in memory of a river of the same name in [[Spain]]. However, it was changed to Guayanilla to resemble a native word in the [[Ta\u00edno language|Ta\u00edno]] dialect. The name Guayanilla is derived from a combination of [[Guaynia]] and [[Santa Maria de Guadianilla]].\n\nThe first Europeans settled in this area in 1511. In 1756, Yauco was founded as a [[town]]. Then Guayanilla was a borough of Yauco. Due to the very fertile lands and access to the local port where most of the local commerce occurred, Guayanilla became an important agricultural center, grew quickly, and was established as a separate municipality on February 27, 1833 by [[Governor]] [[Miguel de la Torre]].\n\n===Roanoke Colonists===\n{{Further|Roanoke Colony}}\nOn April 27, 1584, [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] dispatched an expedition led by [[Philip Amadas]] and [[Arthur Barlowe]] to explore the Eastern coast of North America.

Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation.

Lee filled in for [[Clive Bull]] for two weeks in late 2004, until he presented on Friday-Sunday 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am.\n\nIn October 2005, Lee moved from weekends to the drivetime slot from 4{{nbsp}}pm to 7{{nbsp}}pm. Lee titled the show ''The 3 Hour 4 'Till 7 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show.''. In January 2006, Lee moved again to 3{{nbsp}}pm to 6:30{{nbsp}}pm, with the show being renamed to ''The 3 and a Half Hour 3 'Till 6.30 Iain Lee Afternoon Wireless Show''.\n\nFor just over two years (9 September 2005 to 16 September 2007) Lee hosted \"Triple M\", a feature where calls go straight to air, live and unscreened. Other talk radio presenters have also hosted similar features, including [[Nick Abbot]], [[Tommy Boyd]] and [[Clive Bull]]. Initially, Lee would host the feature every Friday evening during the last half-hour of the show. Originally called \"Mental Mayhem\", it was renamed to \"Mick's Mental Mayhem\" (after a caller named Mick), then simply \"Triple M\". The rising popularity of the format, along with a change in show times in May 2006 led to Lee presenting a whole three-hour show on Sunday evenings from 10{{nbsp}}pm to 1{{nbsp}}am to Triple M, being called \"Sunday Night Triple M\", from 7 May 2006 to 16 September 2007. At the time, management favoured the unique format as they hoped that it would introduce exclusive listeners to the radio station.\n\nFrom January 2007 to his resignation in November, Lee presented the evening slot from 7{{nbsp}}pm to 10{{nbsp}}pm preceding Bull in the newly titled show, \"''Iain Lee's Good Evening''\". Lee chose the name after seeking advice from his friend and comedian [[Mackenzie Crook]]. The afternoon show was taken over by then weekend breakfast show host [[Paul Ross]].\n\nA change of radio station management (when [[Global Radio]] purchased LBC) in mid-2007 led to the demise of the Sunday Night Triple M show altogether, with the last show on 16 September 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/06/commercialradio.radio?gusrc=rss&feed=media | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lee leaves LBC evening slot | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=6 November 2007 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Lee's style of presenting fell out of favour with the new management, with returning topical and news-led conversation.

Listeners were also invited to interact with the show by sending [[AudioBoo]]s, to be included in the recording.\n\nThe podcast also included Lee interviewing guests and celebrity news with the Daily Express's Elisa Roche.\n\n===2012\u20132015: BBC Three Counties Radio and BBC WM===\n[[File:Next Radio 2015 (21274340969).jpg|left|upright|thumb|Lee in 2015]]\nBetween 2012 and 2015, Lee presented the breakfast radio show on [[BBC Three Counties Radio]], broadcast across Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire from [[Luton]] and [[Dunstable]].
