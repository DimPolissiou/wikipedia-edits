It is normally followed by further celebration on the morning of [[New Year's Day]] (1 January) or, in some cases, 2 January\u2014a [[Bank holidays in Scotland|Scottish bank holiday]].\n\nThe origins of Hogmanay are unclear, but it may be derived from [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] observances.

The earliest proposed etymology comes from the 1693 ''Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence'', which held that the term was a corruption of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el-Latn|ag\u00eda m\u00edne}} ({{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}), or \"holy month\".<ref name=\"SPE\">{{cite book |title=Scotch Presbyterian eloquence display'd |publisher=J.

The [[Viking]]s celebrated [[Yule]],<ref name=Johnson/> which later contributed to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]], or the \"Daft Days\" as they were sometimes called in Scotland. Christmas was not celebrated as a festival and Hogmanay was the more traditional celebration in Scotland.<ref name=\"scotland.org\" /> This may have been a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]] after which Christmas was seen as \"too [[Papist]]\".<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1230_021231_hogmanay.html Bogle, Lara Suziedelis. \"Scots Mark New Year With Fiery Ancient Rites\", ''National Geographic News'', 31 December 2002]</ref>\n\n==Customs==\nThere are many customs, both national and local, associated with Hogmanay.  The most widespread national custom is the practice of [[first-footing]], which starts immediately after midnight. This involves being the first person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbour and often involves the giving of symbolic gifts such as [[salt]] (less common today), [[coal]], [[shortbread]], [[whisky]], and [[black bun]] (a rich [[fruit cake]]), intended to bring different kinds of luck to the householder. Food and drink (as the gifts) are then given to the guests. This may go on throughout the early hours of the morning and well into the next day (although modern days see people visiting houses well into the middle of January). The first-foot is supposed to set the luck for the rest of the year. Traditionally, tall, dark-haired men are preferred as the first-foot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/highlandsandislands/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8434000/8434760.stm|title=Hogmanay traditions, old and new|publisher=BBC|date=30 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Local customs===\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Stonehave fireballs 2003.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Stonehaven Fireballs Ceremony 2003|[[Stonehaven]] Fireballs Ceremony 2003]][[File:Catalonian Sun Goddess.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Catalan Sun Goddess from the Hogmanay Street Party, [[Edinburgh]] 2005]]\nAn example of a local Hogmanay custom is the fireball swinging that takes place in [[Stonehaven]], [[Aberdeenshire]], in northeast Scotland.

Early on New Year's morning, householders drink and then sprinkle 'magic water' from 'a dead and living [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]' around the house (a 'dead and living ford' refers to a river ford that is routinely crossed by both the living and the dead). After the sprinkling of the water in every room, on the beds and all the inhabitants, the house is sealed up tight and branches of juniper are set on fire and carried throughout the house and byre. The juniper smoke is allowed to thoroughly fumigate the buildings until it causes sneezing and coughing among the inhabitants.  Then all the doors and windows are flung open to let in the cold, fresh air of the new year.  The woman of the house then administers 'a restorative' from the whisky bottle, and the household sits down to its New Year breakfast.<ref>{{Cite book| first =F.

Still, in Scotland Hogmanay and New Year's Day are as important as [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Christmas Day]].\n\nAlthough Christmas Day held its normal religious nature in Scotland amongst its [[Catholic Church in Scotland|Catholic]] and Episcopalian communities, the Presbyterian national church, the [[Church of Scotland]], discouraged the celebration of Christmas for nearly 400 years; it only became a public holiday in Scotland in 1958. Conversely, 1 and 2 January are public holidays and Hogmanay still is associated with as much celebration as Christmas in Scotland.\n\n[[File:Edinburgh Hogmanay Longship.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Viking longship]] is burnt during Edinburgh's annual Hogmanay celebrations (though Edinburgh has no historical connection with those [[Norse in Scotland|Norse who invaded]] Scotland).]]\n\n==Major celebrations==\nAs in much of the world, the largest Scottish cities \u2013 [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen]] \u2013 hold all-night celebrations, as do [[Stirling]] and [[Inverness]].

Customs vary throughout Scotland, and usually include [[gift-giving]] and visiting the homes of friends and neighbours, with special attention given to the [[first-foot]], the first guest of the new year.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] of the word is obscure. The earliest proposed etymology comes from the 1693 ''Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence'', which held that the term was a corruption of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{transl|el|ag\u00eda m\u00edne}}'' ({{lang|el|\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}}), or \"holy month\".<ref name=\"SPE\">{{cite book |title=Scotch Presbyterian eloquence display'd |publisher=J.

The most widespread national custom is the practice of [[first-footing]], which starts immediately after midnight. This involves being the first person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbour and often involves the giving of symbolic gifts such as [[salt]] (less common today), [[coal]], [[shortbread]], [[whisky]], and [[black bun]] (a rich [[fruit cake]]), intended to bring different kinds of luck to the householder. Food and drink (as the gifts) are then given to the guests. This may go on throughout the early hours of the morning and well into the next day (although modern days see people visiting houses well into the middle of January). The first-foot is supposed to set the luck for the rest of the year.

It is now common to sing this in a circle of linked arms that are crossed over one another as the clock strikes midnight for New Year's Day, though it is only intended that participants link arms at the beginning of the final verse, before rushing in to the centre as a group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/auld-lang-syne-could-be-lost-as-only-3-per-cent-know-the-words-1-4648493|title=Auld Lang Syne could be lost as only 3 per cent know the words|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref>\n\n==In the media==\nBetween 1957 and 1968, a New Year's Eve television programme, ''[[The White Heather Club]]'', was presented to herald in the Hogmanay celebrations.\nThe show was presented by [[Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart]] who always began by singing \"Come in, come in, it's nice to see you....\" The show always ended with Andy Stewart and the cast singing, \"Haste ye Back\":\n\n{{quote|<poem>Haste ye back, we loue you dearly,\nCall again you're welcome here.\nMay your days be free from sorrow,\nAnd your friends be ever near.\n\nMay the paths o'er which you wander,\nBe to you a joy each day.\nHaste ye back we loue you dearly,\nHaste ye back on friendship's way.</poem>}}\n\nThe performers were [[Jimmy Shand]] and band, [[Ian Powrie]] and his band, Scottish country dancers: Dixie Ingram and the Dixie Ingram Dancers, Joe Gordon Folk Four, James Urquhart, Ann & Laura Brand, [[Moira Anderson]] & [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]]. All the male dancers and Andy Stewart wore kilts, and the female dancers wore long white dresses with tartan sashes.\nFollowing the demise of the ''White Heather Club'', Andy Stewart continued to feature regularly in TV Hogmanay shows until his retirement.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/a-funny-wee-idea-for-a-show-ian-jack-misses-andy-stewart-and-the-whole-white-heather-club-crowd-1511360.html|title=A funny wee idea for a show: Ian Jack misses Andy Stewart and the whole 'White Heather Club' crowd|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 October 1993}}</ref> His last appearance was in 1992.\n\nIn the 1980s comedian [[Andy Cameron]] presented the ''Hogmanay Show'' (on STV in 1983 and 1984 and from 1985 to 1990 on [[BBC Scotland]]) while Peter Morrison presented the show ''A Highland Hogmanay'' on STV/Grampian, axed in 1993.\n\nFor many years, a staple of New Year's Eve television programming in Scotland was the [[comedy sketch]] show ''[[Scotch and Wry]]'', featuring the comedian [[Rikki Fulton]], which invariably included a hilarious monologue from him as the gloomy Reverend I.M. Jolly.\n\nSince 1993, the programmes that have been mainstays on BBC Scotland on Hogmanay have been ''[[Hogmanay Live]]'' and [[Jonathan Watson]]'s football-themed sketch comedy show, ''[[Only an Excuse?]]''.\n\n==Presbyterian influence==\nThe 1693 ''Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence'' contained one of the first mentions of the holiday in official church records.<ref name=\"SPE\"/> Hogmanay was treated with general disapproval. Still, in Scotland Hogmanay and New Year's Day are as important as [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Christmas Day]].\n\nAlthough Christmas Day held its normal religious nature in Scotland amongst its [[Catholic Church in Scotland|Catholic]] and Episcopalian communities, the Presbyterian national church, the [[Church of Scotland]], discouraged the celebration of Christmas for nearly 400 years; it only became a public holiday in Scotland in 1958. Conversely, 1 and 2 January are public holidays and Hogmanay still is associated with as much celebration as Christmas in Scotland.\n\n[[File:Edinburgh Hogmanay Longship.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Viking longship]] is burnt during Edinburgh's annual Hogmanay celebrations (though Edinburgh has no historical connection with those [[Norse in Scotland|Norse who invaded]] Scotland).]]\n\n==Major celebrations==\nAs in much of the world, the largest Scottish cities \u2013 [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen]] \u2013 hold all-night celebrations, as do [[Stirling]] and [[Inverness]].
