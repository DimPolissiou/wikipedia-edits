The efforts to rebuild parts of it began in the 1950s with the [[R\u00f6mer]] city hall, which was built as a modern office building behind the old fa\u00e7ade still standing after the war, and parts of the surrounding [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square, building an underground [[multi-storey car park]], and on top of that the modern ''Technisches Rathaus''<ref>[[c:Category:Technisches_Rathaus|Photos of the former Technisches Rathaus Frankfurt]]</ref> (''Technical City Hall'', built 1972\u201374), whose fa\u00e7ade paid homage to the historic context of the city with the [[timber frame|timber frame design (''Fachwerk'')]] of the pre-war architecture, but within the context of \"[[Brutalist architecture]]\".

Only a few historical buildings remained, and in the [[History of Germany (1945\u20131990)|post-war]] period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favour of \"car-friendly\" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings and the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind.\n\nOnly the area between R\u00f6merberg and the cathedral remained after the rubble clearance wasteland, over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement, but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, beneath the area of the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt, which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache. The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom/R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions, dominated the former old town, not taking into account of the small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite web|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|periodical=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\n[[File:Technischesrathaus-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Technical City Hall, 2007]]\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall .

For the concrete facades, a completely new design with a perforated facade made of natural stone was planned, for future use in the four-story base the city library as well as shops and restaurants. In addition, around 160 apartments were to be created in the three towers.

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings with facades and roofs that fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century. 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Altstadt \u2013 KSP gewinnen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr Zentrum von Frankfurt (19.

The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbor from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\n[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Hof zum-Rebstock-0918.jpg|thumb|''Hof zum Rebstock'' , left part of the back of ''Markt 2'']]\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' .

The three-storey Renaissance building from the 16th century was designed by ''Dreysse Architects'' , Frankfurt am Main and ''Jourdan & M\u00fcller'', Frankfurt am Main, reconstructed. The vaulted hall, whose six cross vaults rest on two central pillars, is a reminder of its former importance as a trade fair building . The new building is used by the Evangelical Regional Association Frankfurt am Main as the parish hall of the Paulsgemeinde and the Indonesian community.\n\nThe only reconstruction on the south side of the alley is the house ''Goldene Schere'' (Markt 22, side entrance, formerly Hinter dem L\u00e4mmchen 1) by the architects ''Hans Kollhoff'' , Berlin and ''Jourdan & M\u00fcller'' , Frankfurt am Main.<ref name=\"domroemer.de\"/> The four-story building in classicist forms was created in the 18th century by conversion from two older predecessor buildings. The overhangs of the two upper floors were still preserved on their facade to the alley ''behind the lamb'' . The neighboring building to the west is the rear building of the ''old department store'' (Markt 30, formerly Hinter dem L\u00e4mmchen 3).<ref name=\"Markt 30\" /> The baroque sandstone portal built into the back is the largest film used in the Dom-R\u00f6mer project with a width of around five meters and a height of 3.50 meters.

The largest spolia is a baroque portal five meters wide and three and a half meters high. It originally belonged to a garden house behind the ''Kleine Taubenhof'' in northwestern Neustadt , which had already been demolished in 1872 for the construction of the new stock exchange .

The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a ''locus celeber'' , a ''celebrated site'' . He describes the old town withNietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21'' . In contrast, the Technical City Hall, \"rammed as a concrete juggernaut in the middle of the previously closed row of houses on Braubachstrasse\", had remained a provocative and ignorant foreign body in the urban fabric for decades. In spite of its architectural quality, this was his doom.<ref>Dieter Bartetzko: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/umbaumassnahmen-in-der-frankfurter-altstadt-13531714.html ''Mut zum Traum''], in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11.

It is a piece of civic pride that manifests itself in these houses, and the best craftsmen, artists, monument experts and architects contribute to it ... The citizen of the almost digitally located society insures the lost anchor of its origin and provides it with rock solid reinforcement made of cement.\"<ref>Dankwart Guratzsch: [https://www.welt.de/print/welt_kompakt/kultur/article139250653/Aber-bitte-richtig-alt.html ''Warum uns st\u00e4dtische Rekonstruktion gut tut \u2013 Frankfurt baut sein pr\u00e4chtiges historisches Zentrum neu auf.''] In: ''[[Die Welt]]'', 8.

It is a fairytale world, the danger is great that \u201conly a dollhouse will be created, a backdrop for photographing tourists, selfie stick drawn and thumbs up. What characterizes historic old towns cannot be ordered and also not simply built. \u201dThe ''creative replicas'' are\u201c fake architecture \u201d,\u201c between the concrete structure and the exposed stone wall, the insulation wool peels out and proves that history is even possible in the face of today's building regulations cannot be reproduced true to the original \u201d.<ref>[[J\u00fcrgen Tietz]]: [https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/frankfurts-rekonstruierte-altstadt-maerchenstunde-am-main-ld.152278 ''Frankfurts rekonstruierte \u00abAltstadt\u00bb: M\u00e4rchenstunde am Main.''] In: ''[[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung]]'', 20.

This is no coincidence, \"the reconstruction architecture in Germany is currently developing into a key medium of authoritarian, ethnic, historical revisionist rights\". It was \"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\". The new old town is \"a sub-complex heal-world building that reduces history to a one-dimensional concert of your dreams ... A history in which National Socialism, the German wars of aggression and the Holocaust still survive as anecdotes of an otherwise unbroken national history\".<ref>Stephan Tr\u00fcby: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/neue-frankfurter-altstadt-durch-rechtsradikalen-initiiert-15531133.html Wir haben das Haus am rechten Fleck] In: [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung]], 8.

The debate about the old town has historical roots, since 1880 the design has always been struggling anew, with opponents and advocates of reconstructions not fitting in a right-left scheme. The reconstruction of the R\u00f6merberg-Ostzeile was based on an idea by the SPD Mayor Rudi Arndt . At the same time, Linke and Spontis had instigated the Frankfurt house fight , \u201csociologists see today as the beginning of a second homeland security movement\u201d.<ref name=\"db1\" /> Te \"storm of indignation\", which was triggered by the \"remarkably mediocre facade views\" of the winning design from the 2005 competition, was decisive for the reconstruction project of the new old town. \"Unlike the second-place design ... which u. a.

They obtain their legitimation primarily from two sources: their craft quality and their civic acceptance. Both are given in Frankfurt. \u201c<ref>Matthias Alexander: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/debatte-um-neue-frankfurter-altstadt-15587280.html ''Neue Frankfurter Altstadt: Wir waren schon weiter.''] In: ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 16. Mai 2018.</ref>\n\nHanno Rauterberg contradicts the thesis that the reconstruction of the old town goes hand in hand with the erasure of history and guilt. The debate alone leads to more people thinking about the destruction and its background. On the other hand, \u201cno one in Frankfurt felt reminded of the bomb war and Shoah when they saw the now demolished Technical Town Hall.\u201d Most critics mocked questions of taste. \"It is often said that this type of architecture is just a backdrop, untrue, inauthentic ...

Starting with the planning and the careful construction, all parties involved, builders, architects, planners and construction companies pulled together in Frankfurt. \"One would wish that so much attention to detail and care would be put into a construction project that did not pretend that the Second World War had never existed.\".<ref>Laura Wei\u00dfm\u00fcller: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/frankfurter-altstadt-im-korsett-des-turbokapitalismus-1.3974063 ''Frankfurter Altstadt: Das Wirtschaftssystem entscheidet, wie gebaut wird.''] In: ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 14.

One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects \u201cthat one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details \u201d. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \"totally limited\". \u201cIt was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier. \u201dHe personally likes the two new buildingsBest with ''the Three Romans'' (Markt 40) and ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8); the least successful are the ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) and her neighbor ''Alter Burggraf'' .<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

He recalls an earlier article that he wrote about the planned demolition of the Technical Town Hall and reconstructions in the old town for Die Zeit , and in which he made fun of the \u201chalf-timbered longing\u201d, the \u201clonging for a city like this looks like the cities that Frankfurt might like to visit as tourists \u201d. <ref>{{citation|surname1=Andreas Maier|periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|title=Fachwerk f\u00fcr Alle!|date=2006-05-18|language=German|url=https://www.zeit.de/2006/21/Archi_Frankfurt_xml/komplettansicht|access-date= 2018-11-23\n}}</ref> After a tour of the construction site, however, he was impressed by the quality of the construction and also the architecture, and the enthusiasm of the craftsmen. He states: \u201cValuable materials, traditional craftsmanship, everything at its finest. With its new old town, which is also in the ManufactumCatalog, Frankfurt makes itself a gift. And there is the Belvederchen as praline on top. \u201dIn addition to the Belvederchen, he is particularly impressed by the ''Sch\u00f6nau'' house (Market 10) -\u201c a very narrow thing with a slate facade pulled down deep\u2026 and a slightly convex curvature of the elegantly stepped front.

The old city had already been thoroughly changed in 1904 by hewing several aisles for wide streets into the medieval cluster of insalubrious houselets and small alley ways, clearing the way for a tramway line through the historic centre.\n\nDue to the heavy [[bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II]] with many [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] buildings, most of the city's old town was destroyed. The efforts to rebuild parts of it began in the 1950s with the [[R\u00f6mer]] city hall, which was built as a modern office building behind the old fa\u00e7ade still standing after the war, and parts of the surrounding [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square, building an underground [[multi-storey car park]], and on top of that the modern ''Technisches Rathaus''<ref>[[c:Category:Technisches_Rathaus|Photos of the former Technisches Rathaus Frankfurt]]</ref> (''Technical City Hall'', built 1972\u201374), whose fa\u00e7ade paid homage to the historic context of the city with the [[timber frame|timber frame design (''Fachwerk'')]] of the pre-war architecture, but within the context of \"[[Brutalist architecture]]\".

The areas marked in dark red were torn down in 1927.]]\n[[File:Frankfurt 1945 June destructions after bombing raids old town aerial.JPG|thumb|The destroyed old town in June 1945]]\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] old town of Frankfurt am Main , until then one of the best preserved in Central Europe, was almost completely destroyed by bombing. Only a few historical buildings remained, and in the [[History of Germany (1945\u20131990)|post-war]] period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favour of \"car-friendly\" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings and the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind.\n\nOnly the area between R\u00f6merberg and the cathedral remained after the rubble clearance wasteland, over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement, but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, beneath the area of the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt, which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache. The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom/R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions, dominated the former old town, not taking into account of the small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite web|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|periodical=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\n[[File:Technischesrathaus-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Technical City Hall, 2007]]\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall . According to plans by the Frankfurt office of ''Stefan Forster Architects'', the building complex was to be divided into two houses by an alley from Braubachstrasse to the roundel of the Schirn Kunsthallebe to be created. For the concrete facades, a completely new design with a perforated facade made of natural stone was planned, for future use in the four-story base the city library as well as shops and restaurants. In addition, around 160 apartments were to be created in the three towers. The leasing contract with the city could have been extended to 20 years, subject to the modified use of the building.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\" />\n[[File:Technisches-Rathaus-Frankfurt 2007 LWS0780.jpg|thumb|The facades of the technical town hall, July 2008]]\n[[File:Frankfurt Altstadt-Goldene Waage.jpg|thumb|House of the Golden Libra , around 1900]]\nThe city council then decided in December 2004 to carry out an urban planning ideas competition in which both variants (renovation or demolition with subsequent small-scale development) were to be run through.

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings with facades and roofs that fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century. 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

These provided that the city would not buy back the property, but that the leasing model would continue.<ref name=\"faz.net\" />\n\nIn August 2005, the Free Voters in the R\u00f6mer submitted an application for the planned Dom-R\u00f6mer area to approach the historic streets and squares and to reconstruct some important buildings in terms of urban planning, such as the ''Haus zur Goldenen Waage'' or the ''Haus zum Esslinger'' ( also known as ''Young Esslinger'' or ''Aunt Melber's house'' ). However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Altstadt \u2013 KSP gewinnen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr Zentrum von Frankfurt (19.

The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbor from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\n[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Hof zum-Rebstock-0918.jpg|thumb|''Hof zum Rebstock'' , left part of the back of ''Markt 2'']]\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' . The neighboring house ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock''(Market 8), however, keeps the original parcel. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between the two buildings.

The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a ''locus celeber'' , a ''celebrated site'' . He describes the old town withNietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21'' . In contrast, the Technical City Hall, \"rammed as a concrete juggernaut in the middle of the previously closed row of houses on Braubachstrasse\", had remained a provocative and ignorant foreign body in the urban fabric for decades. In spite of its architectural quality, this was his doom.<ref>Dieter Bartetzko: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/umbaumassnahmen-in-der-frankfurter-altstadt-13531714.html ''Mut zum Traum''], in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11.

It is a piece of civic pride that manifests itself in these houses, and the best craftsmen, artists, monument experts and architects contribute to it ...

This is no coincidence, \"the reconstruction architecture in Germany is currently developing into a key medium of authoritarian, ethnic, historical revisionist rights\". It was \"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\". The new old town is \"a sub-complex heal-world building that reduces history to a one-dimensional concert of your dreams ... A history in which National Socialism, the German wars of aggression and the Holocaust still survive as anecdotes of an otherwise unbroken national history\".<ref>Stephan Tr\u00fcby: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/neue-frankfurter-altstadt-durch-rechtsradikalen-initiiert-15531133.html Wir haben das Haus am rechten Fleck] In: [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung]], 8.

The debate about the old town has historical roots, since 1880 the design has always been struggling anew, with opponents and advocates of reconstructions not fitting in a right-left scheme. The reconstruction of the R\u00f6merberg-Ostzeile was based on an idea by the SPD Mayor Rudi Arndt .

The debate alone leads to more people thinking about the destruction and its background. On the other hand, \u201cno one in Frankfurt felt reminded of the bomb war and Shoah when they saw the now demolished Technical Town Hall.\u201d Most critics mocked questions of taste. \"It is often said that this type of architecture is just a backdrop, untrue, inauthentic ...

One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects \u201cthat one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details \u201d. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \"totally limited\". \u201cIt was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier. \u201dHe personally likes the two new buildingsBest with ''the Three Romans'' (Markt 40) and ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8); the least successful are the ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) and her neighbor ''Alter Burggraf'' .<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

After causing chaos at a wild west themed attraction, Pops ditches them and drives off with a woman ([[Christie Brinkley]] reprising her role as the flirty woman from the movie), and Erica tells Adam and Barry that they're not moving out but are moving on to the next chapter of their lives, not knowing that Beverly overheard them. Meanwhile, Erica worries about \"something important\" Geoff wants to tell her when they return, thinking he wants to break up. After their car breaks down, Adam tells Barry and Erica he will be glad that they're not in the house anymore, causing Beverly to demand that they tell her the truth about going to college and never looking back. She decides they should all just go home. But just then, Geoff picks them up and tells Erica that he just wanted to inform her he's taking a gap year rather than attending college right away. They arrive at Disneyland with Pops joining them after he arrived. After being told by the security guard that the park is closed but that it opens in 15 minutes, Beverly lies about their adventure, and the Goldbergs get into the park before the actual opening and finally enjoy their last family vacation. \n\n'''Featured Songs''': \"[[Holiday Road]]\" by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\" by [[Vangelis]]\n |LineColor=E2E78B \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Goldbergs (season 7)\n |EpisodeNumber = 142\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Dana's Back\n |DirectedBy = [[Jay Chandrasekhar]]\n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|t=Mike Sikowitz|s=[[Adam F.

Dana is disappointed, telling Adam she really needed his unconditional friendship. Meanwhile, Barry and Erica's college move-in day goes awry when they discover they have nowhere to live on campus. They accuse Beverly of purposely not mailing in their housing checks, but to their shock, learn that it was Murray.

She and Barry concoct a plan to tell Beverly that the college is instead holding a \"parents Thursday\". Beverly sees through the ruse, and Barry insists it was all Erica's idea, resulting in getting Beverly's tasty treats and lavish gifts all to himself. Ren gives Erica some perspective when her own parents don't care enough to show up at all that weekend. Elsewhere, Adam learns that Dana is trying out for Juliet in the school play, and is determined to win the part of Romeo over the popular Andrew Gallery. Adam wins the part of Romeo, but the part of Juliet goes to Vic's daughter Asha. When Asha and Adam passionately kiss in rehearsal, Dana gets jealous, while Dave Kim insists that Asha must be into Adam because she scrawled \"A.G.\" on her notebook. Vic learns from Miss Cinoman that the kiss was \"sizzling\", and he forces Principal Ball to clean up the script. This results in Asha quitting and Dana stepping in as Juliet. Adam then learns that Asha was just acting, and that the \"A.G.\" on her notebook is for Andrew Gallery. He tells Dana that he only wanted to be Romeo because he didn't want to see her opposite Gallery, and Dana is pleased to hear this.

This leads to the two arguing about the balance between hard work and letting off some steam while in school. At home, Beverly and Adam become convinced that there is a ghost in the house when Bev's newly acquired classical nude paintings keep falling off the wall. Thinking that both of them are morons for believing in ghosts, Murray invites Dr. Katman ([[Steve Guttenberg]]), a science teacher from William Penn, to come over and give legitimate reasons for the paintings falling.

After causing chaos at a wild west themed attraction, Pops ditches them and drives off with a woman ([[Christie Brinkley]] reprising her role as the flirty woman from the movie), and Erica tells Adam and Barry that they're not moving out but are moving on to the next chapter of their lives, not knowing that Beverly overheard them. Meanwhile, Erica worries about \"something important\" Geoff wants to tell her when they return, thinking he wants to break up. After their car breaks down, Adam tells Barry and Erica he will be glad that they're not in the house anymore, causing Beverly to demand that they tell her the truth about going to college and never looking back. She decides they should all just go home. But just then, Geoff picks them up and tells Erica that he just wanted to inform her he's taking a gap year rather than attending college right away. They arrive at Disneyland with Pops joining them after he arrived. After being told by the security guard that the park is closed but that it opens in 15 minutes, Beverly lies about their adventure, and the Goldbergs get into the park before the actual opening and finally enjoy their last family vacation. \n\n'''Featured Songs''': \"[[Holiday Road]]\" by [[Lindsey Buckingham]], \"[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]\" by [[Vangelis]]\n |LineColor=E2E78B \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Goldbergs (season 7)\n |EpisodeNumber = 142\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Dana's Back\n |DirectedBy = [[Jay Chandrasekhar]]\n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|t=Mike Sikowitz|s=[[Adam F.

Vic learns from Miss Cinoman that the kiss was \"sizzling\", and he forces Principal Ball to clean up the script. This results in Asha quitting and Dana stepping in as Juliet. Adam then learns that Asha was just acting, and that the \"A.G.\" on her notebook is for Andrew Gallery.
