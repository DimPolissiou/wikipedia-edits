It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]]. It is also the 9th [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchise]] of all time, with an estimated revenue above {{US$|36 billion|long=no}}.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Mario franchise characters}}\n\n== Video games ==\n{{Main|List of video games featuring Mario}}\n\n=== Origin games ===\n\n==== ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' ====\n{{Main|Donkey Kong (video game)}}\n[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|thumb|125px|A replica of a ''Donkey Kong'' arcade cabinet.]]\n\nAfter the commercial failure of ''[[Radar Scope]]'', Nintendo's company president referred to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] to create an arcade game to save the company. Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

This gameplay is further offered by the level creator game ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', released on [[Wii U]] in 2015. A sequel, ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', was released on Nintendo Switch in June 2019.\n\nIn 2016, the team behind ''New Super Mario Bros.'' released ''[[Super Mario Run]]'' that became Nintendo's first real [[smartphone]] game and one of the few instances a ''Mario'' game was developed for non-Nintendo hardware.<ref name=\"MarioRun\">{{cite web|last1=Ingraham|first1=Nathan|title='Super Mario Run' is just as much fun as we'd hoped|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/08/super-mario-run-iphone-hands-on/|publisher=Engadet|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Puzzle games ===\n{{Main|List of Mario puzzle games}}\n\n==== ''Dr. Mario'' series ====\n[[File:Dr. Mario series logo.png|thumb|The ''Dr. Mario'' series logo.]]\n\n{{nihongo foot|'''''Dr. Mario'''''|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa|Dokut\u0101 Mario|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (stylized as ''D\u211e.

The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each [[level (video gaming)|level]].\n\n<!-- Titles -->\nThere have been 4 ''[[Dr. Mario]]'' games released for home consoles and two portable games, for a total of six original titles.

These games did not use the ''Mario'' branding and only featured Mario in the capacity of a cameo. He then appeared in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' for the Virtual Boy. After this, [[Camelot Software Planning]] released ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' for the Nintendo 64. They would subsequently develop other games in this series: ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the GameCube and Wii, ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour|Power Tour]]'' for the Game Boy Advance, ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS, ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash|Ultra Smash]]'' for the Wii U, and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces|Aces]]'' for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n==== ''Mario Golf'' series ====\nThe first use of Mario's likeness in a golf game was that the golfer in ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'' for NES and Game Boy featured a mustached man resembling Mario. Later, ''[[NES Open Tournament Golf]]'' was released. It featured Mario and Luigi as the golfers, with [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and [[Princess Daisy]] as their caddies.

Few of these games were platformers; most sought to teach skills such as typing, mathematics or history. They are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo. The games were developed independently by Software Toolworks, Interplay and Brainstorm. Nine educational games were released from 1991 to 1996.\n\n=== Games not published by Nintendo ===\nThis section covers games [[Video game developer|developed]] by other companies without Nintendo involvement. These games are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo.\n\n==== Hudson ====\n[[Hudson Soft]] released two games based on ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' and another similar to ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''\n\n''[[Mario Bros. Special]]'' is a video game released in 1984 for the Japanese computers [[NEC PC-6001]]mkII, [[NEC PC-6601]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[FM-7]] and [[Sharp X1]].

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled. Philips was given permission to use [[Nintendo]] characters in CD-i games due to their taking part in developing an unreleased [[Video game accessory|add-on]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).<ref name=\"SNES-CD\">{{cite web|title=SNES-CD Profile|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217040049/http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archivedate=February 17, 2008|publisher=N-Sider|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> ''Hotel Mario'' did not gain much success, with Nintendo rarely acknowledging it as part of the ''Mario'' series.<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |title=CD-i Games: Nintendo |first=Danny |last=Cowan |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=April 25, 2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120720182316/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |archivedate=July 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"GD\">{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Workman|title=Mascots Gone Wild: Nintendo Characters' Worst Moments (Hotel Mario)|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012232126/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archivedate=October 12, 2008|date=December 12, 2007|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' is a cancelled [[video game]] planned for the CD-i, developed by [[NovaLogic]], which attempted to duplicate the gameplay of ''[[Super Mario World]]''. Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' in 1993. The latter lost a large amount of money at the box office and was widely considered to be a [[Box office bomb|failure]].<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. 1993\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=supermariobros.htm |title=Super Mario Bros.

It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990. Based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' video game, the cartoon shows Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad fighting against Bowser and his [[Koopalings]], who went by different names on the show. Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]]. It is the third and currently last [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] based on the ''Mario'' series. The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. Episodes of ''Super Mario World'' were later shown as part of the [[Television syndication|syndication]] package ''Captain N and the Video Game Masters''. Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

It was part of a licensing deal with [[Nintendo]], featuring characters from their [[video game]]s and the [[cartoon]]s based on them. Valiant's ''Super Mario Bros.'' comic books were based on the three main ''Mario'' games on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], as well as ''[[Super Mario Bros. (TV)|The Super Mario Bros. Super Show]]''. The ''Mario'' line was renewed for 1991 with two different books\u2014''Super Mario Bros.'' and ''Adventures of the Super Mario Bros.''\n\nThe ''[[Nintendo Adventure Book]]'' series was published from 1991 to 1992 by Archway books, and Mammoth books in the [[United Kingdom]]. There are twelve in all. They are formatted like the popular [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] books, where the reader makes decisions that change the outcome of the story. Ten of the books are about the [[Mario Bros.]]' adventures in the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] and are based primarily on the [[Valiant Comics|Valiant comics]] published for the [[Nintendo Comics System]] imprint.\n\n{{nihongo foot|''[[Super Mario Adventures]]''|SUPER MARIO ADVENTURES \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u5927\u5192\u967a|''Mario no daib\u014dken''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha|<ref>\"[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006QBMK0 Super Mario Adventures Official Nintendo Comic Book (Paperback)].\" ''Amazon.com''.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the Mario franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into 4 kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario Land]]''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of [[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]].\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

A fifth sequel, ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020]]'', was released on Nintendo Switch in November 2019.\n\n=== Educational games ===\n{{Main|List of Mario educational games}}\nIn the early 1990s, many [[educational game]]s were released in the ''Mario'' series. Few of these games were platformers; most sought to teach skills such as typing, mathematics or history. They are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo. The games were developed independently by Software Toolworks, Interplay and Brainstorm. Nine educational games were released from 1991 to 1996.\n\n=== Games not published by Nintendo ===\nThis section covers games [[Video game developer|developed]] by other companies without Nintendo involvement. These games are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo.\n\n==== Hudson ====\n[[Hudson Soft]] released two games based on ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' and another similar to ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''\n\n''[[Mario Bros.

It is a remake of the original ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', with new stages, mechanics and gameplay.\n\n''[[Punch Ball Mario Bros.]]'' is a video game released in 1984 for the Japanese computers NEC PC-6001mkII, NEC PC-6601, NEC PC-8801, FM-7 and Sharp X1. It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled. Philips was given permission to use [[Nintendo]] characters in CD-i games due to their taking part in developing an unreleased [[Video game accessory|add-on]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).<ref name=\"SNES-CD\">{{cite web|title=SNES-CD Profile|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217040049/http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archivedate=February 17, 2008|publisher=N-Sider|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> ''Hotel Mario'' did not gain much success, with Nintendo rarely acknowledging it as part of the ''Mario'' series.<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |title=CD-i Games: Nintendo |first=Danny |last=Cowan |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=April 25, 2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120720182316/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |archivedate=July 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"GD\">{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Workman|title=Mascots Gone Wild: Nintendo Characters' Worst Moments (Hotel Mario)|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012232126/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archivedate=October 12, 2008|date=December 12, 2007|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' is a cancelled [[video game]] planned for the CD-i, developed by [[NovaLogic]], which attempted to duplicate the gameplay of ''[[Super Mario World]]''. Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' in 1993. The latter lost a large amount of money at the box office and was widely considered to be a [[Box office bomb|failure]].<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. 1993\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=supermariobros.htm |title=Super Mario Bros.

The show was produced by [[DIC Entertainment]] and was distributed for syndicated television by [[Viacom Enterprises]] (full rights have since reverted to DiC through [[Nintendo]]).\n\n''[[King Koopa's Kool Kartoons]]'' was a [[live action]] children's [[Television program|television show]] broadcast in [[Southern California]] during the holiday season of 1989/1990. The show starred King Koopa (also known as [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]), the main antagonist of the ''Mario'' series. The 30-minute program was originally broadcast during the after-school afternoon time-slots on [[Los Angeles]]-based [[KTTV|KTTV Fox 11]].\n\n''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is the second TV series based on the ''Mario'' NES games. It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990. Based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' video game, the cartoon shows Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad fighting against Bowser and his [[Koopalings]], who went by different names on the show. Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]]. It is the third and currently last [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] based on the ''Mario'' series. The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. Episodes of ''Super Mario World'' were later shown as part of the [[Television syndication|syndication]] package ''Captain N and the Video Game Masters''. Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989. These generally featured Mario as the hero, Peach as the damsel and Bowser as the villain, with other Mario characters playing supporting roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5835648/there-were-worse-mario-cartoons-than-the-american-one/gallery/1|title=There Were Worse Mario Cartoons Than the American One|publisher=Kotaku|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=August 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Films ===\n{{Main|Super Mario Bros.

Miyamoto found Meledandri's creative process similar to his own, and decided he would be the proper lead for a Mario film.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the Mario franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in [[Super Mario Odyssey]].\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of [[Mario Tennis Aces]].\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into 4 kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario Land]]''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of [[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]].\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* [[Super Mario Odyssey]] introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

It was adopted in August 1949. While the first three conventions dealt with combatants, the Fourth Geneva Convention was the first to deal with humanitarian protections for civilians in a war zone. There are currently [[List of parties to the Geneva Conventions|196 countries]] party to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], including this and the other three treaties.<ref name=\"Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries 2010\">{{cite web | title=Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949 | website=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries | date=23 March 2010 | url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Treaty.xsp?documentId=AE2D398352C5B028C12563CD002D6B5C&action=openDocument | access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted a report from the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] and a Commission of Experts which concluded that the Geneva Conventions had passed into the body of [[customary international law]], thus making them binding on non-signatories to the Conventions whenever they engage in armed conflicts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/icty/icty.html|title=United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law|publisher=United Nations|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Part I.

Geneva, 12 August 1949. COMMENTARY OF 1958], p. 52 (derogations)</ref> Derogation is limited to individuals \"definitely suspected of\" or \"engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State.\" In paragraph two of the article, \"spy or saboteur\" is mentioned.\n\n== Part II. General Protection of Populations Against Certain Consequences of War ==\n===Article 13: Field of application of part II===\n:The provisions of Part II cover the whole of the populations of the countries in conflict, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on '''[[Race (human classification)|race]]''', '''nationality''', '''religion''' or '''[[Political party|political opinion]]''', and are intended to alleviate the sufferings caused by war.\n\nThe list of basis on which distinction might be drawn is not exhaustive.\n\n== Part III. Status and Treatment of Protected Persons ==\n\n=== Section I. Provisions common to the territories of the parties to the conflict and to occupied territories ===\n\n==== Article 32: Prohibition of corporal punishment, torture, etc. ====\nA protected person may not have anything done  \"of such a character as to cause physical suffering or extermination... the physical suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands. This prohibition applies to murder, [[torture]], [[corporal punishment]]s, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments not necessitated by the medical treatment. While popular debate remains on what constitutes a legal definition of torture, the ban on corporal punishment simplifies the matter; even the most mundane physical abuse is thereby forbidden by Article 32, as a precaution against alternate definitions of torture.\n\nThe prohibition on scientific experiments was added, in part, in response to experiments by German and Japanese doctors during [[World War II]] of whom [[Josef Mengele]] was the most infamous.\n\n==== Article 33: Individual responsibility, collective penalties, pillage and reprisals ====\n\n: No protected person may be punished for any offense he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of [[intimidation]] or of [[terrorism]] are prohibited. \n:[[Pillage]] is prohibited.\n:[[Reprisal]]s against protected persons and their [[property]] is prohibited.\"\n\nUnder the 1949 Geneva Conventions, [[collective punishment]] is a [[war crime]]. By collective punishment, the drafters of the Geneva Conventions had in mind the reprisal killings of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the First World War, the Germans executed Belgian villagers in mass retribution for [[Resistance movement|resistance]] activity during the [[Rape of Belgium]]. In World War II, both the Germans and the Japanese carried out a form of collective punishment to suppress resistance. Entire villages or towns or districts were held responsible for any resistance activity that occurred at those places.<ref name=keylor>Keylor, William R., \"The Twentieth-Century World and Beyond,\" Oxford University Press, New York: 2011.</ref> The conventions, to counter this, reiterated the principle of individual responsibility. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) Commentary to the conventions states that parties to a conflict often would resort to \"intimidatory measures to terrorize the population\" in hopes of preventing hostile acts, but such practices \"strike at guilty and innocent alike. They are opposed to all principles based on humanity and justice.\"\n\nAdditional Protocol II of 1977 explicitly forbids collective punishment. But as fewer states have ratified this protocol than GCIV, GCIV Article 33 is the one more commonly quoted.\n\n=== Section III. Occupied territories ===\n\nArticles 47\u201378 impose substantial obligations on occupying powers.  As well as numerous provisions for the general welfare of the inhabitants of an occupied territory, an occupier may not forcibly deport protected persons, or deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into occupied territory (Art.49).\n\n==== Article 49: Deportations, transfers, evacuations ====\n\n:Article 49. Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.\n\n:Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bounds of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.\n\n:The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.\n\n:The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.\n\nThe reference in the last paragraph to \"[[deportation]]\", is commonly understood as the ''expulsion'' of foreign nationals, whereas the expulsion of nationals would be called ''extradition, banishment'' or ''exile''. If ethnic groups are affected by ''deportation'', it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. ''Transfer'' in this case literally means to move or pass from one place to another. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] has expressed the political opinion, \"that international humanitarian law prohibits the establishment of settlements, as these are a form of population transfer into occupied territory.\"<ref>[https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/occupation-faq-051010.htm What does the law say about the establishment of settlements in occupied territory?]</ref> This is a political opinion by the ICRC, and not a legal finding.\n\n==== Article 50: Children ====\n\n:Article 50. The Occupying Power shall, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall take all necessary steps to facilitate the identification of children and the registration of their parentage. It may not, in any case, change their personal status, nor enlist them in formations or organizations subordinate to it.\n\n:Should the local institutions be inadequate for the purpose, the Occupying Power shall make arrangements for the maintenance and education, if possible by persons of their own nationality, language and religion, of children who are orphaned or separated from their parents as a result of the war and who cannot be adequately cared for by a near relative or friend.\n\n:A special section of the Bureau set up in accordance with Article 136 shall be responsible for taking all necessary steps to identify children whose identity is in doubt. Particulars of their parents or other near relatives should always be recorded if available.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall not hinder the application of any preferential measures in regard to food, medical care and protection against the effects of war which may have been adopted prior to the occupation in favour of children under fifteen years, expectant mothers, and mothers of children under seven\n\n==== Article 53: Prohibited destruction ====\n\n:Article 53. Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.\n\nIn [[The Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. Commentary]], [[Jean Pictet]] writes:\n\n{{blockquote|To dissipate any misconception in regard to the scope of Article 53, it must be pointed out that the property referred to is not accorded general protection; the Convention merely provides here for its protection in occupied territory. The scope of the Article is therefore limited to destruction resulting from action by the Occupying Power. It will be remembered that Article 23 (g) of the [[Hague Regulations]] forbids the unnecessary destruction of enemy property; since that rule is placed in the section entitled \"hostilities\", it covers all property in the territory involved in a war; its scope is therefore much wider than that of the provision under discussion, which is only concerned with property situated in occupied territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries \u2013 Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949\u201353: Commentary of 1958|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600060?OpenDocument|publisher=International Red Cross}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Article 56: Hygiene and public health ====\n\nArticle 56 describes the medical obligations the occupying power has in the occupied territory:\n\n:To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the cooperation of national and local authorities, the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics. Medical personnel of all categories shall be allowed to carry out their duties.\n\n:If new hospitals are set up in occupied territory and if the competent organs of the occupied State are not operating there, the occupying authorities shall, if necessary, grant them the recognition provided for in Article 18. In similar circumstances, the occupying authorities shall also grant recognition to hospital personnel and transport vehicles under the provisions of Articles 20 and 21.\n\n:In adopting measures of health and hygiene and in their implementation, the Occupying Power shall take into consideration the moral and ethical susceptibilities of the population of the occupied territory.\n\n==== Article 78: Security measures. Internment and assigned residence. Right of appeal ====\nArticle 78 deals with [[internment]]. It allows the occupying power for \"imperative reasons of security\" to \"subject them [protected persons] to assigned residence or to internment.\" The article does not allow the occupying power to take collective measures: each case must be decided separately.\n\n==Part IV. Execution of the Convention==\nThis part contains \"the formal or diplomatic provisions which it is customary to place at the end of an international Convention to settle the procedure for bringing it into effect are grouped together under this heading (1). They are similar in all four Geneva Conventions.<ref>[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600172?OpenDocument Commentary: Part IV : Execution of the convention #Section II : Final provisions].

of Civilian Persons in Time of War''', commonly referred to as the '''Fourth Geneva Convention''' and abbreviated as '''GCIV''', is one of the four [[treaties]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It was adopted in August 1949. While the first three conventions dealt with combatants, the Fourth Geneva Convention was the first to deal with humanitarian protections for civilians in a war zone. There are currently [[List of parties to the Geneva Conventions|196 countries]] party to the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]], including this and the other three treaties.<ref name=\"Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries 2010\">{{cite web | title=Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949 | website=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries | date=23 March 2010 | url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Treaty.xsp?documentId=AE2D398352C5B028C12563CD002D6B5C&action=openDocument | access-date=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted a report from the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] and a Commission of Experts which concluded that the Geneva Conventions had passed into the body of [[customary international law]], thus making them binding on non-signatories to the Conventions whenever they engage in armed conflicts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/icty/icty.html|title=United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law|publisher=United Nations|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Part I.

Geneva, 12 August 1949. COMMENTARY OF 1958], p. 52 (derogations)</ref> Derogation is limited to individuals \"definitely suspected of\" or \"engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State.\" In paragraph two of the article, \"spy or saboteur\" is mentioned.\n\n== Part II. General Protection of Populations Against Certain Consequences of War ==\n===Article 13: Field of application of part II===\n:The provisions of Part II cover the whole of the populations of the countries in conflict, without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on '''[[Race (human classification)|race]]''', '''nationality''', '''religion''' or '''[[Political party|political opinion]]''', and are intended to alleviate the sufferings caused by war.\n\nThe list of basis on which distinction might be drawn is not exhaustive.\n\n== Part III. Status and Treatment of Protected Persons ==\n\n=== Section I. Provisions common to the territories of the parties to the conflict and to occupied territories ===\n\n==== Article 32: Prohibition of corporal punishment, torture, etc. ====\nA protected person may not have anything done  \"of such a character as to cause physical suffering or extermination... the physical suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands. This prohibition applies to murder, [[torture]], [[corporal punishment]]s, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments not necessitated by the medical treatment. While popular debate remains on what constitutes a legal definition of torture, the ban on corporal punishment simplifies the matter; even the most mundane physical abuse is thereby forbidden by Article 32, as a precaution against alternate definitions of torture.\n\nThe prohibition on scientific experiments was added, in part, in response to experiments by German and Japanese doctors during [[World War II]] of whom [[Josef Mengele]] was the most infamous.\n\n==== Article 33: Individual responsibility, collective penalties, pillage and reprisals ====\n\n: No protected person may be punished for any offense he or she has not personally committed. Collective penalties and likewise all measures of [[intimidation]] or of [[terrorism]] are prohibited. \n:[[Pillage]] is prohibited.\n:[[Reprisal]]s against protected persons and their [[property]] is prohibited.\"\n\nUnder the 1949 Geneva Conventions, [[collective punishment]] is a [[war crime]]. By collective punishment, the drafters of the Geneva Conventions had in mind the reprisal killings of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In the First World War, the Germans executed Belgian villagers in mass retribution for [[Resistance movement|resistance]] activity during the [[Rape of Belgium]]. In World War II, both the Germans and the Japanese carried out a form of collective punishment to suppress resistance. Entire villages or towns or districts were held responsible for any resistance activity that occurred at those places.<ref name=keylor>Keylor, William R., \"The Twentieth-Century World and Beyond,\" Oxford University Press, New York: 2011.</ref> The conventions, to counter this, reiterated the principle of individual responsibility. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) Commentary to the conventions states that parties to a conflict often would resort to \"intimidatory measures to terrorize the population\" in hopes of preventing hostile acts, but such practices \"strike at guilty and innocent alike. They are opposed to all principles based on humanity and justice.\"\n\nAdditional Protocol II of 1977 explicitly forbids collective punishment. But as fewer states have ratified this protocol than GCIV, GCIV Article 33 is the one more commonly quoted.\n\n=== Section III. Occupied territories ===\n\nArticles 47\u201378 impose substantial obligations on occupying powers.  As well as numerous provisions for the general welfare of the inhabitants of an occupied territory, an occupier may not forcibly deport protected persons, or deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into occupied territory (Art.49).\n\n==== Article 49: Deportations, transfers, evacuations ====\n\n:Article 49. Individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory to the territory of the Occupying Power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, are prohibited, regardless of their motive.\n\n:Nevertheless, the Occupying Power may undertake total or partial evacuation of a given area if the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand. Such evacuations may not involve the displacement of protected persons outside the bounds of the occupied territory except when for material reasons it is impossible to avoid such displacement. Persons thus evacuated shall be transferred back to their homes as soon as hostilities in the area in question have ceased.\n\n:The Occupying Power undertaking such transfers or evacuations shall ensure, to the greatest practicable extent, that proper accommodation is provided to receive the protected persons, that the removals are effected in satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated.\n\n:The Protecting Power shall be informed of any transfers and evacuations as soon as they have taken place.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall not detain protected persons in an area particularly exposed to the dangers of war unless the security of the population or imperative military reasons so demand.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.\n\nThe reference in the last paragraph to \"[[deportation]]\", is commonly understood as the ''expulsion'' of foreign nationals, whereas the expulsion of nationals would be called ''extradition, banishment'' or ''exile''. If ethnic groups are affected by ''deportation'', it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. ''Transfer'' in this case literally means to move or pass from one place to another. The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] has expressed the political opinion, \"that international humanitarian law prohibits the establishment of settlements, as these are a form of population transfer into occupied territory.\"<ref>[https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/occupation-faq-051010.htm What does the law say about the establishment of settlements in occupied territory?]</ref> This is a political opinion by the ICRC, and not a legal finding.\n\n==== Article 50: Children ====\n\n:Article 50. The Occupying Power shall, with the cooperation of the national and local authorities, facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall take all necessary steps to facilitate the identification of children and the registration of their parentage. It may not, in any case, change their personal status, nor enlist them in formations or organizations subordinate to it.\n\n:Should the local institutions be inadequate for the purpose, the Occupying Power shall make arrangements for the maintenance and education, if possible by persons of their own nationality, language and religion, of children who are orphaned or separated from their parents as a result of the war and who cannot be adequately cared for by a near relative or friend.\n\n:A special section of the Bureau set up in accordance with Article 136 shall be responsible for taking all necessary steps to identify children whose identity is in doubt. Particulars of their parents or other near relatives should always be recorded if available.\n\n:The Occupying Power shall not hinder the application of any preferential measures in regard to food, medical care and protection against the effects of war which may have been adopted prior to the occupation in favour of children under fifteen years, expectant mothers, and mothers of children under seven\n\n==== Article 53: Prohibited destruction ====\n\n:Article 53. Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.\n\nIn [[The Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949. Commentary]], [[Jean Pictet]] writes:\n\n{{blockquote|To dissipate any misconception in regard to the scope of Article 53, it must be pointed out that the property referred to is not accorded general protection; the Convention merely provides here for its protection in occupied territory. The scope of the Article is therefore limited to destruction resulting from action by the Occupying Power. It will be remembered that Article 23 (g) of the [[Hague Regulations]] forbids the unnecessary destruction of enemy property; since that rule is placed in the section entitled \"hostilities\", it covers all property in the territory involved in a war; its scope is therefore much wider than that of the provision under discussion, which is only concerned with property situated in occupied territory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries \u2013 Geneva Convention (IV) on Civilians, 1949\u201353: Commentary of 1958|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600060?OpenDocument|publisher=International Red Cross}}</ref>}}\n\n==== Article 56: Hygiene and public health ====\n\nArticle 56 describes the medical obligations the occupying power has in the occupied territory:\n\n:To the fullest extent of the means available to it, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring and maintaining, with the cooperation of national and local authorities, the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics. Medical personnel of all categories shall be allowed to carry out their duties.\n\n:If new hospitals are set up in occupied territory and if the competent organs of the occupied State are not operating there, the occupying authorities shall, if necessary, grant them the recognition provided for in Article 18. In similar circumstances, the occupying authorities shall also grant recognition to hospital personnel and transport vehicles under the provisions of Articles 20 and 21.\n\n:In adopting measures of health and hygiene and in their implementation, the Occupying Power shall take into consideration the moral and ethical susceptibilities of the population of the occupied territory.\n\n==== Article 78: Security measures. Internment and assigned residence. Right of appeal ====\nArticle 78 deals with [[internment]]. It allows the occupying power for \"imperative reasons of security\" to \"subject them [protected persons] to assigned residence or to internment.\" The article does not allow the occupying power to take collective measures: each case must be decided separately.\n\n==Part IV. Execution of the Convention==\nThis part contains \"the formal or diplomatic provisions which it is customary to place at the end of an international Convention to settle the procedure for bringing it into effect are grouped together under this heading (1).

It follows the adventures of Roary and his racing car friends at Silver Hatch race track.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Plot===\nThe series follows the lives and adventures of racing vehicles Roary, Maxi, Zizzy, Dragga, Tin Top, and the people they work for, Big Chris the mechanic and Marsha the race marshall and the owner of the race track, Mr. Carburettor. Also there's Officer Pete, Farmer Green, Molecom, Furz and many more. The plot sometimes revolves around other vehicle characters, such as Rusty, Trucksy, Nick, Lugga, Zippee, Hellie, Breeze, Conrod, James, and Loada.\n\n===Setting===\n''Roary the Racing Car'' is set around a fictional [[Auto racing|motor racing]] circuit called Silver Hatch (a portmanteau of the names of the two [[British Grand Prix]] racing circuits, ''[[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]'' and ''[[Brands Hatch]]''). The majority of the action takes place at the track's [[Pit stop|pits]] and workshop, although we often follow the cars on their laps around the track. Occasionally, the characters venture to external locations such as the nearby beach.\n\n===Narration===\nEvery story begins and ends with a brief [[narrator|narration]] from racing car driver [[Sir Stirling Moss]]. He is also used as a [[voice-over]]. The US version is narrated by [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|American stock car]] driver [[Sam Hornish Jr.]]\n\n==Characters and voice cast==\n\n*'''Roary''' (from the [[United Kingdom]], voiced by [[Maria Darling]]) is a young and excitable racing car who is the series' protagonist. He is Big Chris's \"Number One Star\" and best car friend. Roary is new to Silver Hatch, but with the help of his friends, he is quickly learning the ropes at Silver Hatch. He always wants to impress Big Chris and copy all of his friends's moves. Roary does not know too much about racing yet, but he has won quite a few races and is slowly learning how to become a star racing car. His signature colours are red and white. He wears a white baseball cap with a checkered pattern at the bottom and a red star emblazoned with the number 1 at the top. Roary is occasionally Zizzy and Trucksy's best friends and always wants to play with them. He is so full of energy and has the mindset of a schoolboy. There is a sibling rivalry between Maxi and Roary. They compete over everything. Roary does not like it when Maxi bullies him, but he will occasionally bully him as well. However, most of the time, they are shown to be good friends with each other. Roary can occasionally be slightly rebellious, but has a good heart and is the most sensible of the cars. He often assumes a role of leadership among the other cars. Overall, Roary is very playful and enjoys racing around the track. His catchphrase is \"Light 'em up!\". He is based on a [[Formula Ford]] race car.\n\n*'''Trucksy''' (voiced by [[Dominic Frisby]]), Roary's other best friend, is Farmer Green's [[pickup truck]]. He is usually seen with Farmer Green or playing with two of his best friends, Roary and Zizzy. He has a West Country accent. His main catchphrase is \"Roary's my best friend!\" He is loosely based on a [[Chevrolet Advance Design|Chevrolet 3100]].\n\n*'''Zizzy''' (from [[France]], voiced by [[Maria Darling]]), Roary's best friend, is a young, cute bright pink and purple stunt car with the number 3 painted in a purple circle on her front and doors. She is an electric [[Rallying|Rally Car]] and carries [[solar panel]]s on her roof. She has a flirtatious attitude and is always challenging Roary to catch her if he can during races. Because Zizzy is from France and is the only female car in the show, she has a squeaky [[French accent]]. She is one of Roary's best friends and the first car to talk to and race Roary on his first day. Zizzy is also Roary's girlfriend, but she has a massive crush on Maxi, though she is often very impressed by Roary as well. Zizzy can often act coy. Her two catchphrases are \"Catch me if you can!\" and \"Race you!\" She is based on a first generation [[Citro\u00ebn C1 ev'ie|electric Citro\u00ebn C1]].\n\n*'''Maxi''' (from [[Italy]], voiced by [[Marc Silk]]) is an older yellow [[Formula 1]] type racing car who was the star of Silver Hatch before Roary arrived. He is temperamental and expects the best of everything - including first use of the tyre warmers. He wears [[sunglasses]] and a blue cap and sports the number 5. Maxi is Italian and is the favourite of Mr. Carburettor. Because of this, he has an Italian accent, although this is de-emphasized in the US voiceover. When starting a race, Maxi can make flames erupt from his exhausts. There is a healthy sibling rivalry between Maxi and Roary. Maxi's catchphrase is \"Mamma Mia!\" He is based on a [[Formula One car|Formule One racing car]].\n\n*'''Tin Top''' (from the [[United States of America]], voiced by [[Kerry Shale]]) is a big and powerful stock car. He often takes his corners too fast and wide and regularly ends up in either the [[run-off area|sand trap]], the [[safety barrier]], or the mud, generally in a tangled heap of disconnected parts. Tin Top's catchphrase is appropriate given his frequent visits to the workshop: \"Tape me up, hammer me in, and send me out!\" He sports the number 88 and, in the UK dub, he speaks in a mock-American accent, and [[Peter Kay]] voices him. Like Maxi, Tin Top can make flames come out of his tailpipes. In the US version, Tin Top speaks in a stereotypical \"urban\" accent, and does not appear to have a catchphrase. He is loosely based off a [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] [[Stock car racing|Stock car.]]\n\n*'''Dragga''' (from [[Japan]], voiced by [[Marc Silk]]) is a very hi-tech [[Drifting (motorsport)|Drift]] racing car. In line with his name, he can be observed to exhibit extreme oversteer handling characteristics, with his tail end swinging out wide on every corner. He has an on-board computer with a head-up display in his windscreen. Dragga has a fabulous dragon on his sides and also sports blue neon undertray lighting and he wears the number 6 on the top of his front windshield and back windshield. He speaks in a mock Japanese accent. Drifter's catchphrase in the UK version is \"Go-go, nitro boost!\" but he does not have a catchphrase in the US version. He is loosely based on a [[Nissan Silvia S15]] and a [[Nissan R-34|Nissan R-34 Skyline.]] \n\n*'''Rusty the [[Caravan (towed trailer)|Caravan]]''' (voiced by [[Dominic Frisby]]) is Big Chris' home on wheels who lives at Silver Hatch. He is often found to be sleeping, but rarely minds being woken up by the other characters and he enjoys reminiscing about his time as a mobile caravan. He can give useful advice, but often entirely by accident. Big Chris lives in Rusty. \n\n*'''Lugga''' (voiced by [[Marc Silk]]) is a [[4x4]] off-road vehicle or \"mud-plugger\". Plugger is the most laid-back character at Silver Hatch and he never gets rushed or panic-stricken. In the UK version, he speaks with a soft Caribbean accent; in the US version, he speaks in a mild Southern drawl. He often uses his telescopic winch to rescue Roary and Maxi from mud, gravel, or sand. Lugga can often be heard uttering his catchphrase, \"No need to race, Lugga's on the case!\" He is based on a fourth generation [[Mitsubishi L200]].\n\n*'''Zippee''' is Marsha's [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooter]]. She is of indeterminate gender as the only vocalizations made by Zippee are a beeping sound, similar to a small [[Car horn#Signalling and vehicle horns|car horn]], which is her catchphrase, \"Beep-beep!\" (She's the only vehicle character on ''Roary The Racing Car'' who does not talk.) She is based on a [[Vespa]] motor scooter.\n\n*'''Hellie''' is a bright red and purple [[helicopter]], who transports Mr. Carburettor around the track. He has a large [[headphones|headset]] which he uses to communicate with the ground-crew, usually broadcasting a booming \"Hellie is go!\" [[Marc Silk]] voices him.\n\n*'''James''' is a silver British classic sports car who takes Mamma Mia wherever she needs to go. He has several gizmos and gadgets including an ejector seat, an umbrella, water cannons, and a towel. His catchphrase is \"The name's James!\" and he speaks with a posh English accent. He is named after [[James Bond]] and [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him. He is loosely based off an [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n\n*'''Nick''' is the Silver Hatch police car who works with Officer Pete to keep the cars safe. He enjoys playing with the other cars and he wishes he could race with them too. His catchphrase is \"Wicked!\" [[Marc Silk]] voices him. He is based on a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]].\n\n*'''Breeze''' (from [[Australia]]) is a turquoise beach buggy who lives at the beach at Silver Hatch. She is good at stunts, like Zizzy, and loves it when the other cars come to visit. Her catchphrase is \"Life's a breeze!\" and has a very fake Australian accent. [[Maria Darling]] voices her. She is based off a [[Meyers Manx]] dune buggy.\n\n*'''Loada''' is a transport truck who takes the cars to special occasions. He has lots of different stories from the road and he enjoys telling them to his friends. His catchphrase is \"Lock n' Loada!\" and he has an Eastern European accent. [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him. He is a European Style [[Cab over]] type [[Lorry]].\n\n*'''Conrod''' (from Australia) is a race car who is named after the stretch of the racetrack at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]] in [[Bathurst, New South Wales]]. He has a big noisy V8 and arrives without warning at Silver Hatch. In the UK version, Australian V8 Supercar champion [[Craig Lowndes]] voices him. In the US version, [[Marc Silk]] voices him. He is based off a  [[Team vodafone|Team Vodafone]] [[Ford Falcon (FG)|FG Ford Falcon]] of the [[V8 supercars]] touring car race series. \n\n*'''Big Chris''' is Silver Hatch race track's [[mechanic]]. He occasionally commentates and starts races. He lives in Rusty the caravan and looks after the race track and cars. Big Chris has a typically northern catchphrase, \"If you bend it, you mend it!\" (The US version, much less mellifluous, is \"If you bend it, you fix it!\") Big Chris is portrayed as being very messy and absent-minded, often \"losing\" objects directly in his line of sight, and eternally surprised by his own [[walkie-talkie]]. While working on the cars, he often practices his [[karaoke]] with an out-of-tune version of a song called \"Motor Man\". Comedian [[Peter Kay]] voices him in the UK dub, while in the US dub, [[Kerry Shale]] voices him.\n\n*'''Marsha''' is a race Marshall and the unofficial [[Administration (business)|administrator]] of the Silver Hatch race track. She loves things to be tidy and organized, which often puts her into conflict with Big Chris. She is very fit and enjoys a good run. She speaks with a thick British accent and her UK catchphrase is \"Gears to go, brakes to slow!\" while in the US version, she doesn't have a catchphrase. [[Maria Darling]] voices her.\n\n*'''Mr. \"Sergio\" Carburettor''' is the flamboyant owner of Silver Hatch race track. In the UK version, he has with a pronounced Italian accent, while in the US version, he has a New York accent. His favourite car is Maxi, who he considers to be the greatest car in all the world. He also has a [[Fixed prosthodontics|gold tooth]], which sparkles in the sun when he smiles. In addition to that, he even has a very quick temper, usually turning his face red, making steam come out of his ears, and often saying that the thing of his anger \"is driving me up-a the ceiling!\" He is a perfectionist who sometimes berates Big Chris for tardiness, although Marsha often covers for Big Chris in front of Mr. Carburettor. Mr. Carburettor often likes to watch his cars race around the track, usually cheering for Maxi, although he does congratulate the winner (not Maxi), whoever it may be. Mr. Carbutettor can't pronounce Tin Top's name right. He shares the same catchphrase as Maxi, \"Mamma Mia!\" and he can often be heard singing opera. [[Tim Whitnall]] voices him.\n\n*'''[[Farmer]] Green''' owns the farm located just to the side of the Silver Hatch race track. He often waves as the cars zoom past. He owns Dinkie the Donkey and likes to invent [[Biofuel|bio-fuels]], which sometimes work, but often don't. His UK catchphrase is \"Green by name, green by nature!\" though, like many of the other characters in the US dub, he doesn't have a catchphrase. [[Tim Whitnall]] voices him.\n\n*'''Mamma Mia''' is of Mr. Carburettor's mother and the owner of James. When she first visited Silver Hatch, it was thanks to Flash that she enjoyed the race (which resulted in every car, except Roary crashing). Now she is a regular visitor to the racetrack. Her catchphrase is \"Home James!\" and she speaks with an Italian accent. [[Maria Darling]] voices her.\n\n*'''Officer Pete''' is the Silver Hatch policeman and Marsha's younger brother. When he sees one of the race cars speeding away from the track, he calls to his police car, Nick to follow them. His catchphrase is \"Follow that car!\" [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''The Track [[Inspector]]''' is the inspector who sometimes comes to the track to be shown around the track. When he first visited the track, the cars went through ice at \"Skid Slope\" and began skating around and Mr. Carburettor believed it was a disaster, but the inspector didn't think it was bad. He later appears in \"Motormouth\". [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''Hugo Amarillo''' is a racing car designer who once came to the track to be shown around. Marsha has a crush on him. Big Chris repaired Tin Top in time for Hugo's visit and during the visit, when Mr. Carburettor showed him Maxi racing, the latter crashed and lost a tyre, causing it to roll backwards toward everyone and Tin Top rushed to stop it and ended up crashing, but Hugo was impressed and decided to design a car like Tin Top. Big Chris, after being introduced to him, says, \"Is this the way to Hugo Amarillo?\" referencing the song ''[[Is This the Way to Amarillo]]'', which the actor for Big Chris and Tin Top, [[Peter Kay]] is known for performing. [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*The '''Pizza Boy''' is a boy who delivers pizza to Big Chris as seen in \"Silver Hatch Fun Run\". [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''Murray Walker''' is the world's class commentator, he had a go on Furz's skateboard on the stunt track to show his aerobics, and visits Silver Hatch in \"It's Go, Go, Go, at Silver Hatch\" and \"Motormouth\". He is voiced by [[Murray Walker|Murray Walker OBE]].\n\n*'''Furz''' is an anthropomorphic [[rabbit]], who lives under a tree on the edge of the track at \"Hare-Pin Bend\" (a play on '[[hairpin turn]]'). He regularly tries to cause mischief, from small things like hiding equipment to intentionally trying to cause accidents by moving [[traffic cones]] around to divert the racing cars the wrong way. Furz really wants to be a racing driver and often challenges the Silver Hatch cars to race against him as he rides his high-powered [[skateboard]]. When Furz is caught getting up to no good, you will often hear his main catchphrases: \"Furz...must fly!\" and \"Chew my carrots!\" being two repeated ones. [[Marc Silk]] voices him.\n\n*'''Molecom''', Furz's best friend, is a bespectacled [[Mole (animal)|mole]] who is often found clearing up the mess left behind after Furz has tried to cause havoc. Being a mole, he lives underground, and often digs out, causing [[molehill]]s to appear when he comes up. By some kind of sixth sense, Molecom never seems to dig out through the track, although he is often seen digging out through the [[concrete]] pit stop area. His rhyming catchphrase is \"I'm a mole with a role!\" [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''Dinkie the [[Donkey]]''' is an old, grey [[donkey]] who is often seen at the side of the race track (and occasionally on it), with his ears flapping after the cars race past him. [[Tim Whitnall]] performs his vocal effects.\n\n== Production ==\nThe series uses a combination of [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[stop-motion animation]]; the stop frame animation was initially provided by [[Cosgrove Hall Films]], the producer of ''[[Noddy's Toyland Adventures]]'', the 2004 ''[[Postman Pat]]'' series, and many other shows produced by said company, and latterly by Chapman Entertainment's own in-house studio. The series was originated by David Jenkins, who spent four years working in senior management at Brands Hatch Race Circuit. The idea was conceived while watching the Grand Prix on television with his then-18-month-old son, Tom. It was designed and developed by [[Keith Chapman]], creative director of Chapman Entertainment and the creator of ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' (both 1998 and 2015 series), ''[[Fifi and the Flowertots]]'', and ''[[PAW Patrol]]'', and the series executive producer is Greg Lynn.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (2007)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It follows the adventures of Roary and his racing car friends at Silver Hatch race track.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n===Plot===\nThe series follows the lives and adventures of racing vehicles Roary, Maxi, Cici, Dragga, Tin Top, and the people they work for, Big Chris the mechanic and Marsha the race marshall and the owner of the race track, Mr. Carburettor. Also there's Officer Pete, Farmer Green, Molecom, Flash the Rabbit and many more. The plot sometimes revolves around other vehicle characters, such as Rusty, Trucksy, Nick, Plugga, Zippee, Hellie, Breeze, Conrod, James, and Loada.\n\n===Setting===\n''Roary the Racing Car'' is set around a fictional [[Auto racing|motor racing]] circuit called Silver Hatch (a portmanteau of the names of the two [[British Grand Prix]] racing circuits, ''[[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]'' and ''[[Brands Hatch]]''). The majority of the action takes place at the track's [[Pit stop|pits]] and workshop, although we often follow the cars on their laps around the track. Occasionally, the characters venture to external locations such as the nearby beach.\n\n===Narration===\nEvery story begins and ends with a brief [[narrator|narration]] from racing car driver [[Sir Stirling Moss]]. He is also used as a [[voice-over]]. The US version is narrated by [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|American stock car]] driver [[Sam Hornish Jr.]]\n\n==Characters and voice cast==\n\n*'''Roary''' (from the [[United Kingdom]], voiced by [[Maria Darling]]) is a young and excitable racing car who is the series' protagonist. He is Big Chris's \"Number One Star\" and best car friend. Roary is new to Silver Hatch, but with the help of his friends, he is quickly learning the ropes at Silver Hatch. He always wants to impress Big Chris and copy all of his friends's moves. Roary does not know too much about racing yet, but he has won quite a few races and is slowly learning how to become a star racing car. His signature colours are red and white. He wears a white baseball cap with a checkered pattern at the bottom and a red star emblazoned with the number 1 at the top. Roary is occasionally Zizzy and Trucksy's best friends and always wants to play with them. He is so full of energy and has the mindset of a schoolboy. There is a sibling rivalry between Maxi and Roary. They compete over everything. Roary does not like it when Maxi bullies him, but he will occasionally bully him as well. However, most of the time, they are shown to be good friends with each other. Roary can occasionally be slightly rebellious, but has a good heart and is the most sensible of the cars. He often assumes a role of leadership among the other cars. Overall, Roary is very playful and enjoys racing around the track. His catchphrase is \"Light 'em up!\". He is based on a [[Formula Ford]] race car.\n\n*'''Trucksy''' (voiced by [[Dominic Frisby]]), Roary's other best friend, is Farmer Green's [[pickup truck]]. He is usually seen with Farmer Green or playing with two of his best friends, Roary and Zizzy. He has a West Country accent. His main catchphrase is \"Roary's my best friend!\" He is loosely based on a [[Chevrolet Advance Design|Chevrolet 3100]].\n\n*'''Zizzy''' (from [[France]], voiced by [[Maria Darling]]), Roary's best friend, is a young, cute bright pink and purple stunt car with the number 3 painted in a purple circle on her front and doors. She is an electric [[Rallying|Rally Car]] and carries [[solar panel]]s on her roof. She has a flirtatious attitude and is always challenging Roary to catch her if he can during races. Because Zizzy is from France and is the only female car in the show, she has a squeaky [[French accent]]. She is one of Roary's best friends and the first car to talk to and race Roary on his first day. Zizzy is also Roary's girlfriend, but she has a massive crush on Maxi, though she is often very impressed by Roary as well. Zizzy can often act coy. Her two catchphrases are \"Catch me if you can!\" and \"Race you!\" She is based on a first generation [[Citro\u00ebn C1 ev'ie|electric Citro\u00ebn C1]].\n\n*'''Maxi''' (from [[Italy]], voiced by [[Marc Silk]]) is an older yellow [[Formula 1]] type racing car who was the star of Silver Hatch before Roary arrived. He is temperamental and expects the best of everything - including first use of the tyre warmers. He wears [[sunglasses]] and a blue cap and sports the number 5. Maxi is Italian and is the favourite of Mr. Carburettor. Because of this, he has an Italian accent, although this is de-emphasized in the US voiceover. When starting a race, Maxi can make flames erupt from his exhausts. There is a healthy sibling rivalry between Maxi and Roary. Maxi's catchphrase is \"Mamma Mia!\" He is based on a [[Formula One car|Formule One racing car]].\n\n*'''Tin Top''' (from the [[United States of America]], voiced by [[Kerry Shale]]) is a big and powerful stock car. He often takes his corners too fast and wide and regularly ends up in either the [[run-off area|sand trap]], the [[safety barrier]], or the mud, generally in a tangled heap of disconnected parts. Tin Top's catchphrase is appropriate given his frequent visits to the workshop: \"Tape me up, hammer me in, and send me out!\" He sports the number 88 and, in the UK dub, he speaks in a mock-American accent, and [[Peter Kay]] voices him. Like Maxi, Tin Top can make flames come out of his tailpipes. In the US version, Tin Top speaks in a stereotypical \"urban\" accent, and does not appear to have a catchphrase. He is loosely based off a [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] [[Stock car racing|Stock car.]]\n\n*'''Dragga''' (from [[Japan]], voiced by [[Marc Silk]]) is a very hi-tech [[Drifting (motorsport)|Drift]] racing car. In line with his name, he can be observed to exhibit extreme oversteer handling characteristics, with his tail end swinging out wide on every corner. He has an on-board computer with a head-up display in his windscreen. Dragga has a fabulous dragon on his sides and also sports blue neon undertray lighting and he wears the number 6 on the top of his front windshield and back windshield. He speaks in a mock Japanese accent. Drifter's catchphrase in the UK version is \"Go-go, nitro boost!\" but he does not have a catchphrase in the US version. He is loosely based on a [[Nissan Silvia S15]] and a [[Nissan R-34|Nissan R-34 Skyline.]] \n\n*'''Rusty the [[Caravan (towed trailer)|Caravan]]''' (voiced by [[Dominic Frisby]]) is Big Chris' home on wheels who lives at Silver Hatch. He is often found to be sleeping, but rarely minds being woken up by the other characters and he enjoys reminiscing about his time as a mobile caravan. He can give useful advice, but often entirely by accident. Big Chris lives in Rusty. \n\n*'''Lugga''' (voiced by [[Marc Silk]]) is a [[4x4]] off-road vehicle or \"mud-plugger\". Plugger is the most laid-back character at Silver Hatch and he never gets rushed or panic-stricken. In the UK version, he speaks with a soft Caribbean accent; in the US version, he speaks in a mild Southern drawl. He often uses his telescopic winch to rescue Roary and Maxi from mud, gravel, or sand. Lugga can often be heard uttering his catchphrase, \"No need to race, Lugga's on the case!\" He is based on a fourth generation [[Mitsubishi L200]].\n\n*'''Zippee''' is Marsha's [[Scooter (motorcycle)|motor scooter]]. She is of indeterminate gender as the only vocalizations made by Zippee are a beeping sound, similar to a small [[Car horn#Signalling and vehicle horns|car horn]], which is her catchphrase, \"Beep-beep!\" (She's the only vehicle character on ''Roary The Racing Car'' who does not talk.) She is based on a [[Vespa]] motor scooter.\n\n*'''Hellie''' is a bright red and purple [[helicopter]], who transports Mr. Carburettor around the track. He has a large [[headphones|headset]] which he uses to communicate with the ground-crew, usually broadcasting a booming \"Hellie is go!\" [[Marc Silk]] voices him.\n\n*'''James''' is a silver British classic sports car who takes Mamma Mia wherever she needs to go. He has several gizmos and gadgets including an ejector seat, an umbrella, water cannons, and a towel. His catchphrase is \"The name's James!\" and he speaks with a posh English accent. He is named after [[James Bond]] and [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him. He is loosely based off an [[Aston Martin DB5]].\n\n*'''Nick''' is the Silver Hatch police car who works with Officer Pete to keep the cars safe. He enjoys playing with the other cars and he wishes he could race with them too. His catchphrase is \"Wicked!\" [[Marc Silk]] voices him. He is based on a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]].\n\n*'''Breeze''' (from [[Australia]]) is a turquoise beach buggy who lives at the beach at Silver Hatch. She is good at stunts, like Zizzy, and loves it when the other cars come to visit. Her catchphrase is \"Life's a breeze!\" and has a very fake Australian accent. [[Maria Darling]] voices her. She is based off a [[Meyers Manx]] dune buggy.\n\n*'''Loada''' is a transport truck who takes the cars to special occasions. He has lots of different stories from the road and he enjoys telling them to his friends. His catchphrase is \"Lock n' Loada!\" and he has an Eastern European accent. [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him. He is a European Style [[Cab over]] type [[Lorry]].\n\n*'''Conrod''' (from Australia) is a race car who is named after the stretch of the racetrack at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]] in [[Bathurst, New South Wales]]. He has a big noisy V8 and arrives without warning at Silver Hatch. In the UK version, Australian V8 Supercar champion [[Craig Lowndes]] voices him. In the US version, [[Marc Silk]] voices him. He is based off a  [[Team vodafone|Team Vodafone]] [[Ford Falcon (FG)|FG Ford Falcon]] of the [[V8 supercars]] touring car race series. \n\n*'''Big Chris''' is Silver Hatch race track's [[mechanic]]. He occasionally commentates and starts races. He lives in Rusty the caravan and looks after the race track and cars. Big Chris has a typically northern catchphrase, \"If you bend it, you mend it!\" (The US version, much less mellifluous, is \"If you bend it, you fix it!\") Big Chris is portrayed as being very messy and absent-minded, often \"losing\" objects directly in his line of sight, and eternally surprised by his own [[walkie-talkie]]. While working on the cars, he often practices his [[karaoke]] with an out-of-tune version of a song called \"Motor Man\". Comedian [[Peter Kay]] voices him in the UK dub, while in the US dub, [[Kerry Shale]] voices him.\n\n*'''Marsha''' is a race Marshall and the unofficial [[Administration (business)|administrator]] of the Silver Hatch race track. She loves things to be tidy and organized, which often puts her into conflict with Big Chris. She is very fit and enjoys a good run. She speaks with a thick British accent and her UK catchphrase is \"Gears to go, brakes to slow!\" while in the US version, she doesn't have a catchphrase. [[Maria Darling]] voices her.\n\n*'''Mr. \"Sergio\" Carburettor''' is the flamboyant owner of Silver Hatch race track. In the UK version, he has with a pronounced Italian accent, while in the US version, he has a New York accent. His favourite car is Maxi, who he considers to be the greatest car in all the world. He also has a [[Fixed prosthodontics|gold tooth]], which sparkles in the sun when he smiles. In addition to that, he even has a very quick temper, usually turning his face red, making steam come out of his ears, and often saying that the thing of his anger \"is driving me up-a the ceiling!\" He is a perfectionist who sometimes berates Big Chris for tardiness, although Marsha often covers for Big Chris in front of Mr. Carburettor. Mr. Carburettor often likes to watch his cars race around the track, usually cheering for Maxi, although he does congratulate the winner (not Maxi), whoever it may be. Mr. Carbutettor can't pronounce Tin Top's name right. He shares the same catchphrase as Maxi, \"Mamma Mia!\" and he can often be heard singing opera. [[Tim Whitnall]] voices him.\n\n*'''[[Farmer]] Green''' owns the farm located just to the side of the Silver Hatch race track. He often waves as the cars zoom past. He owns Dinkie the Donkey and likes to invent [[Biofuel|bio-fuels]], which sometimes work, but often don't. His UK catchphrase is \"Green by name, green by nature!\" though, like many of the other characters in the US dub, he doesn't have a catchphrase. [[Tim Whitnall]] voices him.\n\n*'''Mamma Mia''' is of Mr. Carburettor's mother and the owner of James. When she first visited Silver Hatch, it was thanks to Flash that she enjoyed the race (which resulted in every car, except Roary crashing). Now she is a regular visitor to the racetrack. Her catchphrase is \"Home James!\" and she speaks with an Italian accent. [[Maria Darling]] voices her.\n\n*'''Officer Pete''' is the Silver Hatch policeman and Marsha's younger brother. When he sees one of the race cars speeding away from the track, he calls to his police car, Nick to follow them. His catchphrase is \"Follow that car!\" [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''The Track [[Inspector]]''' is the inspector who sometimes comes to the track to be shown around the track. When he first visited the track, the cars went through ice at \"Skid Slope\" and began skating around and Mr. Carburettor believed it was a disaster, but the inspector didn't think it was bad. He later appears in \"Motormouth\". [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''Hugo Amarillo''' is a racing car designer who once came to the track to be shown around. Marsha has a crush on him. Big Chris repaired Tin Top in time for Hugo's visit and during the visit, when Mr. Carburettor showed him Maxi racing, the latter crashed and lost a tyre, causing it to roll backwards toward everyone and Tin Top rushed to stop it and ended up crashing, but Hugo was impressed and decided to design a car like Tin Top. Big Chris, after being introduced to him, says, \"Is this the way to Hugo Amarillo?\" referencing the song ''[[Is This the Way to Amarillo]]'', which the actor for Big Chris and Tin Top, [[Peter Kay]] is known for performing. [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*The '''Pizza Boy''' is a boy who delivers pizza to Big Chris as seen in \"Silver Hatch Fun Run\". [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''Murray Walker''' is the world's class commentator, he had a go on Furz's skateboard on the stunt track to show his aerobics, and visits Silver Hatch in \"It's Go, Go, Go, at Silver Hatch\" and \"Motormouth\". He is voiced by [[Murray Walker|Murray Walker OBE]].\n\n*'''Furz''' is an anthropomorphic [[rabbit]], who lives under a tree on the edge of the track at \"Hare-Pin Bend\" (a play on '[[hairpin turn]]'). He regularly tries to cause mischief, from small things like hiding equipment to intentionally trying to cause accidents by moving [[traffic cones]] around to divert the racing cars the wrong way. Furz really wants to be a racing driver and often challenges the Silver Hatch cars to race against him as he rides his high-powered [[skateboard]]. When Furz is caught getting up to no good, you will often hear his main catchphrases: \"Furz...must fly!\" and \"Chew my carrots!\" being two repeated ones. [[Marc Silk]] voices him.\n\n*'''Molecom''', Furz's best friend, is a bespectacled [[Mole (animal)|mole]] who is often found clearing up the mess left behind after Furz has tried to cause havoc. Being a mole, he lives underground, and often digs out, causing [[molehill]]s to appear when he comes up. By some kind of sixth sense, Molecom never seems to dig out through the track, although he is often seen digging out through the [[concrete]] pit stop area. His rhyming catchphrase is \"I'm a mole with a role!\" [[Dominic Frisby]] voices him.\n\n*'''Dinkie the [[Donkey]]''' is an old, grey [[donkey]] who is often seen at the side of the race track (and occasionally on it), with his ears flapping after the cars race past him. [[Tim Whitnall]] performs his vocal effects.\n\n== Production ==\nThe series uses a combination of [[computer-generated imagery]] and [[stop-motion animation]]; the stop frame animation was initially provided by [[Cosgrove Hall Films]], the producer of ''[[Noddy's Toyland Adventures]]'', the 2004 ''[[Postman Pat]]'' series, and many other shows produced by said company, and latterly by Chapman Entertainment's own in-house studio. The series was originated by David Jenkins, who spent four years working in senior management at Brands Hatch Race Circuit. The idea was conceived while watching the Grand Prix on television with his then-18-month-old son, Tom. It was designed and developed by [[Keith Chapman]], creative director of Chapman Entertainment and the creator of ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' (both 1998 and 2015 series), ''[[Fifi and the Flowertots]]'', and ''[[PAW Patrol]]'', and the series executive producer is Greg Lynn.\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (2007)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

McConnell was born to a farming family in the [[Muskoka]] region of [[Ontario]]. He left home as a boy of fourteen to find employment in the city of [[Toronto]], Ontario. His first job paid $3 a week, but as an employee at Standard Chemical Co., he worked his way up to a management position that eventually led to a transfer to Montreal in 1901. The then 23-year-old lived for a time in a room at the Montreal [[YMCA]], an institution that he would later thank through his volunteering to help lead a successful fund-raising campaign. In 1905, he married Lily May Griffith. They had four children.\n\n==St. Lawrence Sugar==\nAlthough he had very limited education, McConnell was a principled and brilliant business visionary with a strong work ethic. Within a few years, he turned his savings into sizeable investments and, in 1912, he gained majority control of [[St. Lawrence Sugar]], a company founded in 1879 to compete with Montreal's [[Redpath Sugar]] refinery. The sugar refinery was struggling at the time McConnell stepped in but, renamed St. Lawrence Sugar Refineries, Limited, he turned it into a very profitable business and would retain ownership for the rest of his life.\n\n==Montreal Star==\nDuring [[World War I]], McConnell played a key role in helping organize [[war bond]] drives. His business skills were put to use by the [[Government of Canada]], which appointed him to the unpaid position of Director of Licences for the Wartime Trade Board. In the decade following the end of the war, he sought out more business opportunities, and in 1925, he bought the publishing business belonging to [[Hugh Graham, 1st Baron Atholstan|Lord Atholstan]] (1848\u20131938), which included the ''[[Montreal Star]]'' newspaper. Under McConnell's leadership, the newspapers and magazines flourished.\n\nAn extremely wealthy man, the respect he earned in the Montreal business community led to invitations for him to sit on the [[board of directors]] of a number of major corporations, including the [[Bank of Montreal]], [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], [[Sun Life Assurance]], [[CVRD Inco|International Nickel Company]], [[Dominion Bridge Company|Dominion Bridge Company Limited]], [[Holt Renfrew]], and [[Dominion Rubber Company]]. At the same time, his increasing community work resulted in him being offered a seat on the board of management of the [[Montreal General Hospital]] in 1922. As well, he was made a governor of [[McGill University]] in 1927 and of the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] the following year, both institutions benefiting greatly from his generosity.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMcConnell quietly set about becoming one of his country\u2019s greatest philanthropists. He shunned publicity, and his own newspaper was never allowed to mention any of his charitable donations. To aid in the treatment of [[cancer]], he purchased a [[cobalt]] 60Co therapy machine for the Imperial Cancer Campaign, and he donated them to the [[Jewish General Hospital]], the [[H\u00f4pital Notre-Dame]], the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Montr\u00e9al]], and the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec]] in [[Quebec City]]. In 1937, McConnell founded the McConnell Foundation.\n\nA major benefactor of McGill University, McConnell served on the Board of Governors for 30 years (1928\u201358). He gave the university Purvis Hall in 1942, Chancellor Day Hall ([[James Ross (Canadian businessman)|James Ross]] mansion) in 1948, the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] in 1952, and the McConnell Winter Stadium in 1956. In 1959, he donated the funds to build the McConnell Engineering Building, which doubled the number of engineering classrooms and offices, and in 1961, built Presbyterian College (Morrice Hall).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/donorreport/timeline/ |title=A Report on Private Giving |publisher=McGill University |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2010-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502111618/http://www.mcgill.ca/donorreport/timeline/ |archive-date=2006-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  After his death, the McConnell Foundation undertook the 1971 renovations to the [[McCord Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|author=David Johnson |url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/McCord_Museum.html |title=McCord Museum (formerly Student Union Building) |publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University |date= |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], after the United States [[Lend-lease]] program was launched in March 1941, fellow Canadian businessman [[Max Aitken]], the then volunteer British [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], asked McConnell to help finance the training of pilots, such as [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]] in the [[United States]], to ferry American-built aircraft across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. McConnell donated $1 million for the \"Wings for Britain\" campaign and in recognition of his contribution, a flying squadron was given his name.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950's, McConnell contributed money to build the following Boys, later Boys and Girls clubs. Service clubs and community groups participated in appropriate fundraising as well. 1949 Rosemount Boys Club. Followed by the 1950 East End Boys and Girls Club(Maisonneuve district) followed in short order by the Point St. Charles Boys and Girls Club in the Point,Unity Boys and Girls Club, in lower Westmount bordering on St. Henri, Dawson Boys and Girls Club in Verdun, plus one in Trois - Rivi\u00e8res.

McConnell was born to a farming family in the [[Muskoka]] region of [[Ontario]]. He left home as a boy of fourteen to find employment in the city of [[Toronto]], Ontario. His first job paid $3 a week, but as an employee at Standard Chemical Co., he worked his way up to a management position that eventually led to a transfer to Montreal in 1901. The then 23-year-old lived for a time in a room at the Montreal [[YMCA]], an institution that he would later thank through his volunteering to help lead a successful fund-raising campaign. In 1905, he married Lily May Griffith. They had four children.\n\n==St. Lawrence Sugar==\nAlthough he had very limited education, McConnell was a principled and brilliant business visionary with a strong work ethic. Within a few years, he turned his savings into sizeable investments and, in 1912, he gained majority control of [[St. Lawrence Sugar]], a company founded in 1879 to compete with Montreal's [[Redpath Sugar]] refinery. The sugar refinery was struggling at the time McConnell stepped in but, renamed St. Lawrence Sugar Refineries, Limited, he turned it into a very profitable business and would retain ownership for the rest of his life.\n\n==Montreal Star==\nDuring [[World War I]], McConnell played a key role in helping organize [[war bond]] drives. His business skills were put to use by the [[Government of Canada]], which appointed him to the unpaid position of Director of Licences for the Wartime Trade Board. In the decade following the end of the war, he sought out more business opportunities, and in 1925, he bought the publishing business belonging to [[Hugh Graham, 1st Baron Atholstan|Lord Atholstan]] (1848\u20131938), which included the ''[[Montreal Star]]'' newspaper. Under McConnell's leadership, the newspapers and magazines flourished.\n\nAn extremely wealthy man, the respect he earned in the Montreal business community led to invitations for him to sit on the [[board of directors]] of a number of major corporations, including the [[Bank of Montreal]], [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], [[Sun Life Assurance]], [[CVRD Inco|International Nickel Company]], [[Dominion Bridge Company|Dominion Bridge Company Limited]], [[Holt Renfrew]], and [[Dominion Rubber Company]]. At the same time, his increasing community work resulted in him being offered a seat on the board of management of the [[Montreal General Hospital]] in 1922. As well, he was made a governor of [[McGill University]] in 1927 and of the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] the following year, both institutions benefiting greatly from his generosity.\n\n==Philanthropy==\nMcConnell quietly set about becoming one of his country\u2019s greatest philanthropists. He shunned publicity, and his own newspaper was never allowed to mention any of his charitable donations. To aid in the treatment of [[cancer]], he purchased a [[cobalt]] 60Co therapy machine for the Imperial Cancer Campaign, and he donated them to the [[Jewish General Hospital]], the [[H\u00f4pital Notre-Dame]], the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Montr\u00e9al]], and the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec]] in [[Quebec City]]. In 1937, McConnell founded the McConnell Foundation.\n\nA major benefactor of McGill University, McConnell served on the Board of Governors for 30 years (1928\u201358). He gave the university Purvis Hall in 1942, Chancellor Day Hall ([[James Ross (Canadian businessman)|James Ross]] mansion) in 1948, the McConnell Brain Imaging Centre at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] in 1952, and the McConnell Winter Stadium in 1956. In 1959, he donated the funds to build the McConnell Engineering Building, which doubled the number of engineering classrooms and offices, and in 1961, built Presbyterian College (Morrice Hall).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/donorreport/timeline/ |title=A Report on Private Giving |publisher=McGill University |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2010-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502111618/http://www.mcgill.ca/donorreport/timeline/ |archive-date=2006-05-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  After his death, the McConnell Foundation undertook the 1971 renovations to the [[McCord Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|author=David Johnson |url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/McCord_Museum.html |title=McCord Museum (formerly Student Union Building) |publisher=Canadian Architecture Collection, McGill University |date= |accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], after the United States [[Lend-lease]] program was launched in March 1941, fellow Canadian businessman [[Max Aitken]], the then volunteer British [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], asked McConnell to help finance the training of pilots, such as [[Jacqueline Cochran|Jackie Cochran]] in the [[United States]], to ferry American-built aircraft across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. McConnell donated $1 million for the \"Wings for Britain\" campaign and in recognition of his contribution, a flying squadron was given his name.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950's, McConnell contributed money to build the following Boys, later Boys and Girls clubs. Service clubs and community groups participated in appropriate fundraising as well. 1949 Rosemount Boys Club. Followed by the 1950 East End Boys and Girls Club(Maisonneuve district) followed in short order by the Point St. Charles Boys and Girls Club in the Point,Unity Boys and Girls Club, in lower Westmount bordering on St. Henri, Dawson Boys and Girls Club in Verdun, plus one in Trois - Rivi\u00e8res. McConnell's benevolent works extended to individuals such as [[Maureen Forrester]], who recounted in her biography how he had learned of the difficulty she was experiencing holding down a job while trying to develop her singing career. He contacted her and offered to cover her expenses for three years so she could train professionally \u2014 on the condition she never reveal his name.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 54 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born mothers or fathers. There were violent confrontations between the Catholic and the Protestant (\"Orange\") Irish especially in the 1840s.<ref>Scott W.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sjport.com|title= Port of Saint John}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union strike===\nThe 1949 Canadian Seamen's Union (CSU) strike for many shows a striking bit of history in Canadian labour and is a story about anti-union shipping companies who had a clear disregard for the law. The companies demanded the removal from the contract of the hiring hall. This concession was totally unacceptable to the union as it would mean the end of the CSU. When the union discovered the shipping companies were signing back-door agreements with the Seafarer's International Union (SIU) they had implemented strike action. With SIU crews operating the ships and the longshoremen handling the cargo, the CSU strike in Saint John was, for all intents and purposes, over. The union had been destroyed by a corrupt American union, led by gangster Hal Banks, who was supported by the American labour movement, the Canadian government and the Shipping Federation of Canada. The strike was now ineffective in Saint John, but the vibrations from the strike would be felt in the city for many years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union Strike The Saint John Story|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/the-1949-canadian-seamen-s-union-strike/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Martin|first2=Geoff|title=The Myth of the Competitive Challenge: The Irving Oil Refinery Strike, 1994\u201396 and the Canadian Petroleum Industry|url=http://spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/view/6728|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Uptown Saint John, from Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east on the Saint John Throughway, right before the Harbour Bridge and the now closed (since 2011) toll plaza]]\n[[File:June 2009 Saint John Transit Bus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saint John Transit]] bus in uptown]]\n\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the [[Saint John Airport|Saint John Airport/A\u00e9roport de Saint-Jean]], near Loch Lomond {{convert|8|NM|lk=in}} east northeast of the central business district<ref name=\"CFS\">{{CFS}}</ref> or approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} by road northeast of the city centre.

Route 1 extends west to [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], and northeast towards [[Moncton, New Brunswick|Moncton]]. A second major highway, [[New Brunswick Route 7|Route 7]], connects Saint John with [[Fredericton]]. There are two main road crossings over the Saint John River: the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Reversing Falls Bridge]], approximately {{convert|1|nmi|km|lk=in}} upstream.\n\nThe [[Reversing Falls Railway Bridge]] carries rail traffic for the [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]] on the route from Saint John to [[Maine]]. Saint John was serviced by the [[Atlantic (train)|\"Atlantic\" Line]] of [[Via Rail]] passenger service. Passenger rail service in Saint John was discontinued in December 1994, although the [[Canadian National Railway]] and New Brunswick Southern Railway continue to provide freight service.\n\n[[Bay Ferries]] operates a ferry service, {{MV|Fundy Rose}}, across the Bay of Fundy to [[Digby, Nova Scotia]]. The [[Summerville to Millidgeville Ferry]], a free propeller (as opposed to cable) ferry service operated by the [[New Brunswick Department of Transportation]], connects the [[Millidgeville, New Brunswick|Millidgeville]] neighbourhood with Summerville, New Brunswick, across the [[Kennebecasis River]] on the [[Kingston Peninsula]].\n\nBus service is provided by [[Saint John Transit]] (Greater Saint John Area) and [[Maritime Bus]] (Inter-city). [[Acadian Lines]] used to operate regular inter-city bus services between New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Bangor, as well as [[Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup]], [[Quebec]] (connecting with [[Orl\u00e9ans Express]]). In November 2012, Acadian Lines ceased operations.\n\n==Culture==\nThe presence of Irish, British and French heritage is very apparent along with maritime traditions. Saint John's economy has long ties to the fisheries and shipbuilding, and is known for the ''Marco Polo'' as its flagship vessel. However, the city's economy has begun a transition from resource-based sectors and manufacturing to include growing IT and research sectors. The city has always been a traditional hub for the arts on the east coast, boasting many notable artists, actors and musicians, including [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and [[Miller Brittain]].\n\nWhat is considered the golden age of the Saint John arts community was during the post-war era from 1940 to 1970 when the city produced renowned artists and writers such as poet [[Clara Kathleen Smith| Kay Smith]], painters [[Jack Humphrey]], Miller Brittain, [[Bruno Bobak]], Fred Ross, and sculptor [[John Hooper (sculptor)|John Hooper]] and folk-singer Tom Connors. Poet Bliss Carman once wrote about Saint John, \"All the beauty and mystery Of life were there, adventure bold, Youth, and the glamour of the sea, And all its sorrows old.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Saint John: City of Firsts |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1950/6/15/saint-john-city-of-firsts |publisher=Maclean's}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Saint John, NB, historical Church (Brennans) St..jpg|thumb|Saint John is known for its pub and restaurant scene throughout uptown.

Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high-culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became [[Symphony New Brunswick]]. Some musicians from Saint John include Berkley Chadwick, [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], [[Ken Tobias]], Stevedore Steve,<ref>{{cite news|title=Stevedore Steve, writer of Lester the Lobster, dead at 80|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/stevedore-steve-obit-1.3806926|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> Jane Coop, Bruce Holder, Frances James, the songwriter Michael F.

Prior to 1950 it was known as Moosepath Park.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|The Commons at the University of New Brunswick]]\nIn 1964, the [[University of New Brunswick]] created UNB Saint John in buildings throughout the uptown CBD. In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]].

Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 54 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born mothers or fathers. There were violent confrontations between the Catholic and the Protestant (\"Orange\") Irish especially in the 1840s.<ref>Scott W.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sjport.com|title= Port of Saint John}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union strike===\nThe 1949 Canadian Seamen's Union (CSU) strike for many shows a striking bit of history in Canadian labour and is a story about anti-union shipping companies who had a clear disregard for the law. The companies demanded the removal from the contract of the hiring hall. This concession was totally unacceptable to the union as it would mean the end of the CSU. When the union discovered the shipping companies were signing back-door agreements with the Seafarer's International Union (SIU) they had implemented strike action. With SIU crews operating the ships and the longshoremen handling the cargo, the CSU strike in Saint John was, for all intents and purposes, over. The union had been destroyed by a corrupt American union, led by gangster Hal Banks, who was supported by the American labour movement, the Canadian government and the Shipping Federation of Canada. The strike was now ineffective in Saint John, but the vibrations from the strike would be felt in the city for many years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union Strike The Saint John Story|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/the-1949-canadian-seamen-s-union-strike/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement.

Saint John's economy has long ties to the fisheries and shipbuilding, and is known for the ''Marco Polo'' as its flagship vessel. However, the city's economy has begun a transition from resource-based sectors and manufacturing to include growing IT and research sectors. The city has always been a traditional hub for the arts on the east coast, boasting many notable artists, actors and musicians, including [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and [[Miller Brittain]].\n\nWhat is considered the golden age of the Saint John arts community was during the post-war era from 1940 to 1970 when the city produced renowned artists and writers such as poet [[Clara Kathleen Smith| Kay Smith]], painters [[Jack Humphrey]], Miller Brittain, [[Bruno Bobak]], Fred Ross, and sculptor [[John Hooper (sculptor)|John Hooper]] and folk-singer Tom Connors.

Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high-culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became [[Symphony New Brunswick]].

Prior to 1950 it was known as Moosepath Park.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|The Commons at the University of New Brunswick]]\nIn 1964, the [[University of New Brunswick]] created UNB Saint John in buildings throughout the uptown CBD. In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

The AFL encourages the building of such rivalries, as a method of increasing publicity for the league, to the point of designating one round each year as ''Rivalry Round'' where many of these match-ups are held on the one weekend.<ref name=\"ABC\">Lonergan, Dan; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070610152638/http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200704/s1896078.htm?afl AFL arch rivals - a thing of the past]; 2007-04-13</ref>  Whilst some rivalries, such as between teams from adjacent areas, are still strong, the designation of an entire round of fixtures as ''Rivalry Round'' is often criticised due to some arbitrary match-ups, or ignoring stronger, more recent rivalries.<ref name=\"baum\">Baum, G;[http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/footys-drowning-in-a-sea-of-medals/2008/04/11/1207856837505.html Footy's drowning in a sea of medals]; The Age; 2008-04-12</ref>\n\nWith a 22-game season and 18 teams (16 teams from 1995 until 2010 with the introduction of the Gold Coast Football Club and the Greater Western Sydney Giants in 2011 and 2012 respectively), the AFL fixtures are not equal with each team playing seven other teams twice and eight teams once. Choosing to play certain games twice, such as the [[Local derby|local derbies]] and blockbusters (games between the ''Big 4'' Victorian clubs of Collingwood, Carlton, Essendon and Richmond, are known as ''blockbuster'' games), results in a skewed fixture which is rarely evened out over time.\n\n==Victorian rivalries==\n[[File:AFL teams locations Melbourne.PNG|thumb|Locations of AFL teams in Melbourne prior to 1965]]\n\n===[[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{main|Collingwood-Carlton Rivalry}}\n\nArgued by some to be the greatest and longest standing rivalry in the competition.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> Two clubs in close proximity, fuelled by the rivalry between white (Carlton) and blue collar (Collingwood) suburbs; the rivalry is intensified because the teams have met in six memorable grand finals (Carlton winning five, Collingwood one), including Carlton's 44-point comeback in 1970, and the famous Harmes-Sheldon goal in 1979. Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are in finals contention or not.\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]===\n{{main|Carlton-Essendon rivalry}}\n\nAs is the case with two successful sides in any competition, fans of each club love to defeat the other.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> The two clubs share the record for the most premierships with 16, with the clubs meeting in 6 grand finals ( with each team having won 3 flags against the other) including a 1 point victory by Carlton against Essendon in 1947 and a drought-breaking flag in 1968 in which Carlton became the first team to have kicked fewer goals than the loser.<ref>http://www.blueseum.org/Grand+Final%2C+1968</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the rivalry went to new levels with the two teams competing in several memorable contests. In 1981 the clubs would meet in the Escort cup grand final which Essendon would win. Later on in the season in Round 20 in 1981, with Carlton leading by 26 points with 10 minutes left to play, with goals from Neale Danniher helping get the Bombers across the line by 1 point. The game is most famous for Carlton skipper Mike Fitzpatrick having the ball taken off him for wasting time. In 1993 Carlton and Essendon met in quite a few memorable affairs, including the 1993 Grand Final in which the Baby Bombers got up to win the game by 44 points against a favoured Carlton side most remembered for Michael Longs dashing goal in the first quarter, a few weeks earlier the Blues had beaten the Bombers in the first night qualifying final by 2 points and in round 2 the two teams both drew the game, after Stephen Kernahan had a chance to win the game for Carlton only to kick it out on the full in what was the highest draw game in AFL/VFL history.<ref>https://afltables.com/afl/seas/1993.html</ref> Carlton famously upset the heavily favoured Essendon side by 1 point in the 1999 Preliminary Final. \n\nIn 2007 Essendon led Carlton by 48 points deep into the second quarter of their Round 3 2007 match at the MCG, only to be overrun by Carlton in what would go down as their greatest ever come from behind victory; however, Essendon went on to defeat Carlton over the next 6 encounters, with Carlton finally breaking Essendon's winning streak with an emphatic 76 point win in Round 19, 2010.\n\nFollowing the 2000 Preliminary final the two teams wouldn't meet in a final until the 2011 Elimination Final and would be Carlton's first finals win in 10 years.<ref>https://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=5337</ref> In 2018 after Carlton's worst start to the season in the clubs 121 years in the competition, the Blues would secure their first win for the season in Round 8 against Essendon.<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2018/8/carl-v-ess</ref>\n\n===[[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{see also|Queen's Birthday match}}\n\nA traditional white collar (Melbourne) v blue collar (Collingwood) rivalry, additionally fuelled by a narrow loss to Collingwood which stopped Melbourne from winning a fourth flag in a row in 1958 and Melbourne restricting Collingwood to 14 points in the 1960 grand final. Half of Melbourne's twelve premierships came against Collingwood and the teams have met in seven grand finals, the most of any pairing.<!-- For completeness, Essendon and Melbourne have also met in seven, if the 1948 Replay is counted --> Since 2001, Melbourne has hosted Collingwood in an annual match at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] on the Queen's Birthday public holiday Monday in June.\n\n===[[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{see also|Jack Dyer-Lou Richards Trophy}}\nArising from the fact that the two areas neighbour each other, Richmond and Collingwood were both highly successful in the late 1920s to the early 1930s; the clubs played against each other in five grand finals between 1919 and 1929 (Collingwood won in 1919, 1927, 1928 and 1929, while Richmond won in 1920). In the 1980 Grand Final, Richmond handed Collingwood an 81-point defeat, a record at the time, causing Collingwood to lose an 8th Grand Finals in a row.\n\nBoth clubs continue to draw large crowds to their meetings in each season, and the two were the subject of a 'recruiting war' throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with David Cloke, Geoff Raines, Brian Taylor, Wally Lovett, Phillip Walsh, Steven Roach, Gerald Betts, Neil Peart, Peter McCormack, Kevin Morris, Craig Stewart, Ross Brewer, Michael Lockman, Rod Oborne, Allan Edwards, John Annear, Noel Lovell and [[Bob Heard]] all exchanging clubs, as well as coach [[Tom Hafey]] (moving to Collingwood in 1977 following four flags at Punt Road).\n\nMelees have been fought between the teams in two recent matches \u2013 Round 20, 2009, and Round 2, 2012 \u2013 with almost all players from both teams involved in the altercations.\n\nBoth teams played each other 3 times during 2018, with all three games pulling off massive crowds. Crowds of 72,157 and 88,180 was attended between both home and away games with Richmond winning both times, until Collingwood unexpectedly pulled off a massive upset, smashing Richmond in the preliminary final in front of a crowd of 94,959 which caused the rivalry to reach its highest point since 1980. Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are in finals contention or not.\n\n===[[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] v [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]===\n[[File:Before the bounce at the MCG.jpg|thumb|Games between the Hawks and the Bombers have proved spectacular, due to wild brawls]]\n\nThe clubs contested the Grand Final in three consecutive seasons between 1983 and 1985, and the rough nature of these games and other matches between the clubs made them strong rivals during the 1980s. In 1992, Hawthorn inflicted a record MCG score of 32.24 216 against Essendon. In the 2000s, the clubs have played two matches which saw bench-clearing brawls: the \"[[Line in the Sand Match]]\" in 2004, which resulted in four players being suspended and $70,700 in fines; and the final round of 2009, a match which would decide eighth place between the two teams, in which four players were suspended for a total of seven matches and $27,000 in fines being handed out. The latter brawl was famously sparked by [[Matthew Lloyd]] who applied a very hard bump, knocking out [[Brad Sewell]], in what would be Lloyd's last game.\n\n===[[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] v [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]===\nA rivalry based on geographical proximity and large supporter bases, the rivalry intensified as both clubs contested several grand finals between 1969 and 1982,<ref name=\"ABC\"/> including the 1972 Grand Final where Richmond equalled the highest score ever in a grand final, only to be bettered by Carlton in the same match. The following year Richmond won the 1973 Grand Final in an even more physically bitter contest than in recent encounters between the two sides; Carlton got their revenge in 1982 by defeating Richmond in their last grand final appearance until their win over Adelaide in 2017. In 2013, Carlton beat Richmond by 20 points in an elimination final, which was Richmond's first final since 2001, and third final since 1982.\n\nSince 2008, the first game of each season played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] has been played between Carlton and Richmond on a Thursday night early in the season, with an average crowd of 80,000 and a monster 90,000 crowd in 2018 when Richmond unflured their 2017 premiership flag. A record crowd of 94,690 attended the 2013 Elimination Final between these two traditional rivals. It was the largest crowd for the 2013 season excluding the grand final, and the largest week one finals crowd since 1972. Carlton has never beat Richmond in a game since this final.<ref>http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-08/record-crowd-rocks-the-mcg-during-tigersblues-final</ref>\nCarlton has also received more finals losses (16) to Richmond than any other team. Richmond has also inflicted a total of four grand final losses on Carlton (1921, 1932, 1969 and 1973). Carlton has only beaten Richmond in two grand finals (1972 and 1982). Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are in finals contention or not.<ref>http://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/2013-09-02/a-great-traditional-rivalry</ref>\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{see also|Anzac Day match}}\nSince 1995, the rivalry has been defined by the [[Anzac Day]] clash, a match generally draws a crowd in excess of 90,000. The inaugural Anzac Day Clash in 1995 was famously drawn, the 2009 match was won by Essendon in the final minute with a goal from youngster [[David Zaharakis]], and the 2012 match was won by Collingwood by one point after [[Jarryd Blair]]'s game-winning goal was reviewed by video replay before being awarded.<ref>{{cite news|last=Edmond|first=Sam|title=Collingwood defeats Essendon by one point in Anzac Day epic|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/live-magpies-v-bombers/story-e6frexwr-1226338293526|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=25 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]===\n{{see also|Dreamtime at the 'G}}\nA rivalry born out of the fact that the two clubs are both part of the \"Big 4\" clubs in Melbourne as the highly supported teams. Since 2005, Essendon and Richmond have contested the annual '''Dreamtime at the 'G''' match, a celebration of Aboriginal players and their contribution to the league, typically held near the midway point of the season. These games usually tend to get a crowd of 80,000 or above.\n\n===[[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] v [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]===\nBoth teams entered the VFL in the 1925 expansion, and were generally unsuccessful through the first few decades, but the two teams were both very strong through the 1970s, sparking a rivalry between the clubs. The clubs played three Grand Finals against each other in four years, with North Melbourne winning their first ever premiership in 1975 by 55 points, Hawthorn winning in 1976 by five goals, and Hawthorn winning in 1978 by three goals. \n\nMelees have been fought between the two teams in recent matches \u2013 Round 16, 2014, and Round 5, 2015 \u2013 with almost all players in both teams involved in the altercations.\n\n===[[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] v [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]===\n{{see also|Beyondblue Cup (AFL)|Kennett curse}}\nThe rivalry between these two clubs is noted as creating a propensity for close matches, with a number of well-known, controversial incidents arising from this rivalry.\n\n====History====\n\n=====Bruns Incident=====\n\nWhile Hawthorn and Geelong had previously played against each other in several high-profile matches including the [[1963 AFL Grand Final|1963 Grand Final]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/geelong-cats-premiership-years/1963-geelong-cats-premiership-brilliant-lastquarter-blitz-sinks-hawthorn/news-story/a84f5cb0e3f3627a7301f6922e3b23ba|title=1963 Gelong Cats premiership: Brilliant last-quarter blitz sinks Hawthorn|newspaper=Geelong Advertiser|date=October 7, 1963|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> the rivalry between the two teams is widely held to have begun in their round 12 match during the [[1985 VFL season|1985 season]].<ref name=Bruns>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/footy-history/2018/03/05/2018-3-4-an-oral-history-of-the-geelong-v-hawthorn-rivalry-part-one-the-bruns-incident/|title=An Oral History Of The Geelong V Hawthorn Rivalry Part One \u2013 The Bruns Incident|website=The Mongrel Punt|last1=Myers|first1=H.B.|date=March 5, 2018|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> During the match, Hawthorn star [[Leigh Matthews]] struck Geelong player [[Neville Bruns]] in the jaw, breaking it and causing Bruns to miss five games.<ref name=Bruns/> Matthews was deregistered by the AFL for a month for the incident, and became the only player in the history of the VFL/AFL to be charged with criminal offences for an act committed on-field.

He proceeded to get up, vomit, and continued to play. This was one of many examples of Geelong 'playing the man', resulting in major injuries for several Hawks players during the game. Hawthorn controlled the game, leading by approximately 40 points for most of the match; in the last quarter, Geelong almost managed to come from behind to win, but fell short by six points. \n\n=====2008 Grand Final=====\nIn the [[2008 AFL Grand Final|2008 Grand Final]], Geelong was the heavily backed favourite and had lost only one match for the season, but Hawthorn upset Geelong by 26 points; Geelong won its next eleven matches against Hawthorn over the following five years, under a curse, which was dubbed the \"[[Kennett curse]]\" which was attributed to disrespectful comments made by Hawthorn president [[Jeff Kennett]] following the 2008 Grand Final. It was later revealed that after the 2008 grand final, Paul Chapman initiated a pact between other Geelong players to never lose to Hawthorn again. The curse was broken in a preliminary final in 2013, after Paul Chapman played his final match for Geelong the previous week.<ref>http://finalsiren.com/PreviousGames.asp?Team1ID=4&Team2ID=16&Go=Go</ref>\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]]===\n{{see also|Essendon v Kangaroos (2001 AFL season)}}\n\nEssendon and North Melbourne share a rivalry that has its roots during the formation of the VFL in 1896. North were denied by Essendon to join the breakaway competition because both clubs drew supporters from the same area and Essendon felt threatened by North's proximity to them which in turn drummed up fears that North could drain Essendon's talent pool if they were allowed to participate in the VFL. Essendon and North Melbourne were both strong in the latter part of the 1990s and early 2000s, and built a bigger rivalry during that time. The defining moment of this rivalry came in Round 16 of 2001, when Essendon came from 69 points down in the second quarter to win by 12 points. Essendon and North Melbourne have played in one Grand Final, in 1950, which Essendon won by 38 points.\n\n===[[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] v [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]===\nGeelong won their first flag in 1925 over Collingwood, in 1930 Collingwood defeated Geelong in the grand final making it four flags in-a-row for the Pies. Geelong would later deny Collingwood three successive premierships in 1937, winning a famous grand final by 32 points.\n\nThe two sides played against each other in 6 finals between 1951 and 1955, including the 1952 Grand Final when Geelong easily beat Collingwood by 46 points. In 1953, Collingwood ended Geelong's record 23-game winning streak in the home and away season, and later defeated them by 12 points in the grand final, denying the Cats a third successive premiership.\n\nSince 2007, the clubs have again both been at the top of the ladder and have met regularly in finals. Geelong won a memorable preliminary final by five points on their way to their first flag in 44 years. In 2008, Collingwood inflicted Geelong's only home-and-away loss, by a massive 86 points, but the teams did not meet in the finals. They would meet in preliminary finals in 2009 and 2010, each winning one ''en route'' to a premiership. They finally met in a Grand Final in 2011, which Geelong won by 38 points; Geelong inflicted Collingwood's only three losses for the 2011 season.<ref>http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2013-05-14/an-epic-rivalry</ref>\n\n==Local derbies==\nThere are four '[[local derby|local derbies]]' in the AFL, with each of the clubs competing against their cross-town rivals at least twice every year.\n\n===[[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] v [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]]===\n{{main|Western Derby}}\n\nThe two Western Australian-based teams contest the '''Western Derby'''. The [[West Coast Eagles]] won the first nine derbies, stretching from the inaugural derby in May 1995 until July 1999, but the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] managed a seven match consecutive winning streak in derby matches, commencing in August 2007 and ending in May 2011. Of the 50 derbies played, West Coast holds a 30\u201320 advantage.

The first showdown occurred in April 1997, following the introduction of Port Adelaide into the league that year. Of the 47 Showdowns that have been contested, Adelaide holds a 24\u201323 advantage over Port. The best performed player in each showdown is awarded the '''Showdown Medal'''. Following the death of then coach of [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] and assistant coach of [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Power]] for 11 years, [[Phil Walsh (Australian footballer)|Phil Walsh]], the Showdown medal was renamed after Walsh to commemorate his life, in the highest attended game between the two and the lowest ever margin.

The teams met each other six times between September 2005 and March 2007, including both Grand Finals and two Qualifying Finals; the final margins of these games were: 4, 4, 2, 1, 1 and 1, with Sydney winning the 2005 Grand Final, and West Coast winning the 2006 Grand Final. The sum of margins of 13 points across six consecutive meetings is by far the narrowest in VFL/AFL history, with 28 points (South Melbourne vs Melbourne, 28 points, 1898\u20131900) the nearest challenger.\n\n===[[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\nThe rivalry between the West Coast Eagles and Collingwood Magpies steams from a series of finals matches since the VFL became the AFL.<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-09-23/eagles-v-magpies-an-incredible-finals-rivalry</ref> With it routes in the 1990 Qualifying Final in which West Coast and Collingwood drew the match, requiring a replay the following week, the two sides drew a final on another occasion in 2007 which went into extra time which Collingwood won. The two clubs have met 8 times in finals since 1990, including a 2 point victory by the Eagles in the 1994 Qualifying final.The two clubs met for the first time in a Grand Final in 2018, with the Eagles winning by 5 points to claim their fourth premiership.<ref>https://www.bigfooty.com/forum/threads/west-coast-vs-collingwood-the-rivalry.1206603/</ref>.

Pre-merger [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] was a neighbouring suburb to Collingwood, with the boundary being based on Smith Street,<ref>http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/About-Yarra/Maps/</ref> along with the fact that Fitzroy and Collingwood topped the VFL/AFL premiership tally during the early existence of what was then the VFL competition. The [[Brisbane Bears]] also had a bit of beef with the Magpies as the Bears' number one draft pick [[Nathan Buckley]] famously defected to Collingwood after one season on the Bears list, citing that he wanted to win premierships and play finals footy, and that Brisbane had no future.<ref>http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/buckley-still-haunted-by-flag-failures-20120116-1q38x.html</ref> The Bears also lost their final regular season match in their final season (1996) to the Magpies, costing the Bears the minor premiership that season.<ref name=\"forever.collingwoodfc.com.au\">https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/matches/1996-collingwood-vs-brisbane-round-22/</ref> However the rivalry between the Lions and the Magpies was properly ignited post-merger, it began in late 1999 when Collingwood played their last ever VFL/AFL game at their spiritual home ground, [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]] with the Lions emerging 42 point victors that day and consigning the Magpies to their second wooden spoon in their VFL/AFL history that day.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1086</ref> The rivalry between the two clubs went to the next level as the clubs played off in two consecutive Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003, with the Lions emerging victors on both occasions.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1654</ref><ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1839</ref> These grand final results further fueled the hatred that Collingwood supporters have towards the Brisbane Lions to this day, despite the Lions having a poor decade on the field after their golden era.\n\n=== [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] v [[Sydney]] ===\nFrom 2011 until 2014 these two clubs shares a heated rivalry and have met four times in do or die games in the finals. In the 2011 Semi Final which Hawthorn won, 2012 Grand Final won by Sydney, 2013 Qualifying Final won by Hawthorn and 2014 Grand Final which was won by Hawthorn.\n\n===[[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] v [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]===\nWhile the St Kilda Football Club have tasted little success in the history of Australian Rules football, only acquiring one premiership in 1966 against the Collingwood Football Club, St Kilda have been a strong team in the modern era of the AFL. This is demonstrated no better than the clashes with Geelong during the 2000s and 2010s. The seasons between 2005-2011, both clubs were powerhouses, with St Kilda and Geelong both at the top of the AFL ladder during the 2009 Home and Away season. Both teams, still undefeated after 13 matches so far in the season, would finally meet in Round 14 at Etihad Stadium. This match, which broke the Etihad Stadium record of attendance at a Home and Away match in Etihad Stadium, would be known as one of the famous regular season matches in AFL history. The game also broke the record set in Round 8, 1991 between West Coast and Essendon as being the latest into a season that two undefeated teams had played against each other. St Kilda narrowly defeated Geelong, and asserted themselves atop alone in the AFL standings. These two teams would eventually meet again in the 2009 AFL Grand Final, but Geelong would defeat St Kilda late into the last quarter.\n\nThis rivalry would continue into the 2010-2011 seasons, and was still present in 2016, with the last three matches between the teams resulting in one win each for St Kilda and Geelong, with a draw in 2015.\n\n=== [[Western Bulldogs]] v [[Greater Western Sydney|GWS]] ===\nA fairly recent rivalry between the Western Bulldogs and the Greater Western Sydney has been going on since the 2016 AFL season finals series. It was the preliminary final that would kickstart the rivalry between the two clubs. In the final moments of the game both teams would be on top of each other trying to win the game, with Bulldogs trying to make their first AFL grand final appearance in 55 years while the Giants would be trying to make their first. The Bulldogs manage to win the game by 6 points and would latter go on to win the premiership the following week. Since then the two clubs would play each other in the home and away season with the Giants always winning over the Bulldogs. It wasn't until round 22 of the 2019 home and away season that Bulldogs would smash GWS in A 61 point win on the same ground of that of the famous 2016 preliminary final, it was also the first time the two teams played each other there since that day. Three weeks later on week one of the 2019 AFL finals series the two faced of in the 2nd elimination final where the Giants would thump the Bulldogs in a 58 point win. In that game GWS and the Bulldogs would be in all out fights on field with GWS attacking Western Bulldogs super star Marcus Bontempelli. It would also have GWS superstar Toby Greene gouge Bontempelli's right eye. This could been because of round 22 when Bontempelli charged with engaging in Rough Conduct against Giants defender Nick Haynes. Both teams would go on to become rivals, with more fights and injuries from matches with these two in the future.\n\n== Overall head to head ==\nAll clubs head to head win percentages.

between many teams, most of which typically draw large crowds and interest regardless of both teams' positions on the ladder. The AFL encourages the building of such rivalries, as a method of increasing publicity for the league, to the point of designating one round each year as ''Rivalry Round'' where many of these match-ups are held on the one weekend.<ref name=\"ABC\">Lonergan, Dan; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070610152638/http://www.abc.net.au/sport/columns/200704/s1896078.htm?afl AFL arch rivals - a thing of the past]; 2007-04-13</ref>  Whilst some rivalries, such as between teams from adjacent areas, are still strong, the designation of an entire round of fixtures as ''Rivalry Round'' is often criticised due to some arbitrary match-ups, or ignoring stronger, more recent rivalries.<ref name=\"baum\">Baum, G;[http://www.realfooty.com.au/news/news/footys-drowning-in-a-sea-of-medals/2008/04/11/1207856837505.html Footy's drowning in a sea of medals]; The Age; 2008-04-12</ref>\n\nWith a 22-game season and 18 teams (16 teams from 1995 until 2010 with the introduction of the Gold Coast Football Club and the Greater Western Sydney Giants in 2011 and 2012 respectively), the AFL fixtures are not equal with each team playing seven other teams twice and eight teams once. Choosing to play certain games twice, such as the [[Local derby|local derbies]] and blockbusters (games between the ''Big 4'' Victorian clubs of Collingwood, Carlton, Essendon and Richmond, are known as ''blockbuster'' games), results in a skewed fixture which is rarely evened out over time.\n\n==Victorian rivalries==\n[[File:AFL teams locations Melbourne.PNG|thumb|Locations of AFL teams in Melbourne prior to 1965]]\n\n===[[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{main|Collingwood-Carlton Rivalry}}\n\nArgued by some to be the greatest and longest standing rivalry in the competition.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> Two clubs in close proximity, fuelled by the rivalry between white (Carlton) and blue collar (Collingwood) suburbs; the rivalry is intensified because the teams have met in six memorable grand finals (Carlton winning five, Collingwood one), including Carlton's 44-point comeback in 1970, and the famous Harmes-Sheldon goal in 1979. Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are in finals contention or not.\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]===\n{{main|Carlton-Essendon rivalry}}\n\nAs is the case with two successful sides in any competition, fans of each club love to defeat the other.<ref name=\"ABC\"/> The two clubs share the record for the most premierships with 16, with the clubs meeting in 6 grand finals ( with each team having won 3 flags against the other) including a 1 point victory by Carlton against Essendon in 1947 and a drought-breaking flag in 1968 in which Carlton became the first team to have kicked fewer goals than the loser.<ref>http://www.blueseum.org/Grand+Final%2C+1968</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the rivalry went to new levels with the two teams competing in several memorable contests. In 1981 the clubs would meet in the Escort cup grand final which Essendon would win. Later on in the season in Round 20 in 1981, with Carlton leading by 26 points with 10 minutes left to play, with goals from Neale Danniher helping get the Bombers across the line by 1 point. The game is most famous for Carlton skipper Mike Fitzpatrick having the ball taken off him for wasting time. In 1993 Carlton and Essendon met in quite a few memorable affairs, including the 1993 Grand Final in which the Baby Bombers got up to win the game by 44 points against a favoured Carlton side most remembered for Michael Longs dashing goal in the first quarter, a few weeks earlier the Blues had beaten the Bombers in the first night qualifying final by 2 points and in round 2 the two teams both drew the game, after Stephen Kernahan had a chance to win the game for Carlton only to kick it out on the full in what was the highest draw game in AFL/VFL history.<ref>https://afltables.com/afl/seas/1993.html</ref> Carlton famously upset the heavily favoured Essendon side by 1 point in the 1999 Preliminary Final. \n\nIn 2007 Essendon led Carlton by 48 points deep into the second quarter of their Round 3 2007 match at the MCG, only to be overrun by Carlton in what would go down as their greatest ever come from behind victory; however, Essendon went on to defeat Carlton over the next 6 encounters, with Carlton finally breaking Essendon's winning streak with an emphatic 76 point win in Round 19, 2010.\n\nFollowing the 2000 Preliminary final the two teams wouldn't meet in a final until the 2011 Elimination Final and would be Carlton's first finals win in 10 years.<ref>https://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=5337</ref> In 2018 after Carlton's worst start to the season in the clubs 121 years in the competition, the Blues would secure their first win for the season in Round 8 against Essendon.<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/match-centre/2018/8/carl-v-ess</ref>\n\n===[[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{see also|Queen's Birthday match}}\n\nA traditional white collar (Melbourne) v blue collar (Collingwood) rivalry, additionally fuelled by a narrow loss to Collingwood which stopped Melbourne from winning a fourth flag in a row in 1958 and Melbourne restricting Collingwood to 14 points in the 1960 grand final. Half of Melbourne's twelve premierships came against Collingwood and the teams have met in seven grand finals, the most of any pairing.<!-- For completeness, Essendon and Melbourne have also met in seven, if the 1948 Replay is counted --> Since 2001, Melbourne has hosted Collingwood in an annual match at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] on the Queen's Birthday public holiday Monday in June.\n\n===[[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{see also|Jack Dyer-Lou Richards Trophy}}\nArising from the fact that the two areas neighbour each other, Richmond and Collingwood were both highly successful in the late 1920s to the early 1930s; the clubs played against each other in five grand finals between 1919 and 1929 (Collingwood won in 1919, 1927, 1928 and 1929, while Richmond won in 1920). In the 1980 Grand Final, Richmond handed Collingwood an 81-point defeat, a record at the time, causing Collingwood to lose an 8th Grand Finals in a row.\n\nBoth clubs continue to draw large crowds to their meetings in each season, and the two were the subject of a 'recruiting war' throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with David Cloke, Geoff Raines, Brian Taylor, Wally Lovett, Phillip Walsh, Steven Roach, Gerald Betts, Neil Peart, Peter McCormack, Kevin Morris, Craig Stewart, Ross Brewer, Michael Lockman, Rod Oborne, Allan Edwards, John Annear, Noel Lovell and [[Bob Heard]] all exchanging clubs, as well as coach [[Tom Hafey]] (moving to Collingwood in 1977 following four flags at Punt Road).\n\nMelees have been fought between the teams in two recent matches \u2013 Round 20, 2009, and Round 2, 2012 \u2013 with almost all players from both teams involved in the altercations.\n\nBoth teams played each other 3 times during 2018, with all three games pulling off massive crowds. Crowds of 72,157 and 88,180 was attended between both home and away games with Richmond winning both times, until Collingwood unexpectedly pulled off a massive upset, smashing Richmond in the preliminary final in front of a crowd of 94,959 which caused the rivalry to reach its highest point since 1980. Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are in finals contention or not.\n\n===[[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] v [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]===\n[[File:Before the bounce at the MCG.jpg|thumb|Games between the Hawks and the Bombers have proved spectacular, due to wild brawls]]\n\nThe clubs contested the Grand Final in three consecutive seasons between 1983 and 1985, and the rough nature of these games and other matches between the clubs made them strong rivals during the 1980s. In 1992, Hawthorn inflicted a record MCG score of 32.24 216 against Essendon. In the 2000s, the clubs have played two matches which saw bench-clearing brawls: the \"[[Line in the Sand Match]]\" in 2004, which resulted in four players being suspended and $70,700 in fines; and the final round of 2009, a match which would decide eighth place between the two teams, in which four players were suspended for a total of seven matches and $27,000 in fines being handed out. The latter brawl was famously sparked by [[Matthew Lloyd]] who applied a very hard bump, knocking out [[Brad Sewell]], in what would be Lloyd's last game.\n\n===[[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] v [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]===\nA rivalry based on geographical proximity and large supporter bases, the rivalry intensified as both clubs contested several grand finals between 1969 and 1982,<ref name=\"ABC\"/> including the 1972 Grand Final where Richmond equalled the highest score ever in a grand final, only to be bettered by Carlton in the same match. The following year Richmond won the 1973 Grand Final in an even more physically bitter contest than in recent encounters between the two sides; Carlton got their revenge in 1982 by defeating Richmond in their last grand final appearance until their win over Adelaide in 2017. In 2013, Carlton beat Richmond by 20 points in an elimination final, which was Richmond's first final since 2001, and third final since 1982.\n\nSince 2008, the first game of each season played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] has been played between Carlton and Richmond on a Thursday night early in the season, with an average crowd of 80,000 and a monster 90,000 crowd in 2018 when Richmond unflured their 2017 premiership flag. A record crowd of 94,690 attended the 2013 Elimination Final between these two traditional rivals. It was the largest crowd for the 2013 season excluding the grand final, and the largest week one finals crowd since 1972. Carlton has never beat Richmond in a game since this final.<ref>http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-08/record-crowd-rocks-the-mcg-during-tigersblues-final</ref>\nCarlton has also received more finals losses (16) to Richmond than any other team. Richmond has also inflicted a total of four grand final losses on Carlton (1921, 1932, 1969 and 1973). Carlton has only beaten Richmond in two grand finals (1972 and 1982). Games between these two clubs regularly attract large crowds regardless of whether they are in finals contention or not.<ref>http://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/2013-09-02/a-great-traditional-rivalry</ref>\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\n{{see also|Anzac Day match}}\nSince 1995, the rivalry has been defined by the [[Anzac Day]] clash, a match generally draws a crowd in excess of 90,000. The inaugural Anzac Day Clash in 1995 was famously drawn, the 2009 match was won by Essendon in the final minute with a goal from youngster [[David Zaharakis]], and the 2012 match was won by Collingwood by one point after [[Jarryd Blair]]'s game-winning goal was reviewed by video replay before being awarded.<ref>{{cite news|last=Edmond|first=Sam|title=Collingwood defeats Essendon by one point in Anzac Day epic|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/live-magpies-v-bombers/story-e6frexwr-1226338293526|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=25 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]]===\n{{see also|Dreamtime at the 'G}}\nA rivalry born out of the fact that the two clubs are both part of the \"Big 4\" clubs in Melbourne as the highly supported teams. Since 2005, Essendon and Richmond have contested the annual '''Dreamtime at the 'G''' match, a celebration of Aboriginal players and their contribution to the league, typically held near the midway point of the season. These games usually tend to get a crowd of 80,000 or above.\n\n===[[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] v [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]===\nBoth teams entered the VFL in the 1925 expansion, and were generally unsuccessful through the first few decades, but the two teams were both very strong through the 1970s, sparking a rivalry between the clubs. The clubs played three Grand Finals against each other in four years, with North Melbourne winning their first ever premiership in 1975 by 55 points, Hawthorn winning in 1976 by five goals, and Hawthorn winning in 1978 by three goals. \n\nMelees have been fought between the two teams in recent matches \u2013 Round 16, 2014, and Round 5, 2015 \u2013 with almost all players in both teams involved in the altercations.\n\n===[[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] v [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]===\n{{see also|Beyondblue Cup (AFL)|Kennett curse}}\nThe rivalry between these two teams is noted for its propensity to close matches, and for the long tradition it has in historical events.\n\n====History====\n\n=====Bruns Incident=====\n\nWhile Hawthorn and Geelong had previously played against each other in several high-profile matches including the [[1963 AFL Grand Final|1963 Grand Final]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/sport/afl/geelong-cats-premiership-years/1963-geelong-cats-premiership-brilliant-lastquarter-blitz-sinks-hawthorn/news-story/a84f5cb0e3f3627a7301f6922e3b23ba|title=1963 Gelong Cats premiership: Brilliant last-quarter blitz sinks Hawthorn|newspaper=Geelong Advertiser|date=October 7, 1963|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> the rivalry between the two teams is widely held to have begun in their round 12 match during the [[1985 VFL season|1985 season]].<ref name=Bruns>{{cite web|url=https://themongrelpunt.com/footy-history/2018/03/05/2018-3-4-an-oral-history-of-the-geelong-v-hawthorn-rivalry-part-one-the-bruns-incident/|title=An Oral History Of The Geelong V Hawthorn Rivalry Part One \u2013 The Bruns Incident|website=The Mongrel Punt|last1=Myers|first1=H.B.|date=March 5, 2018|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> During the match, Hawthorn star [[Leigh Matthews]] struck Geelong player [[Neville Bruns]] in the jaw, breaking it and causing Bruns to miss five games.<ref name=Bruns/> Matthews was deregistered by the AFL for a month for the incident, and became the only player in the history of the VFL/AFL to be charged with criminal offences for an act committed on-field.

He proceeded to get up, vomit, and continued to play. This was one of many examples of Geelong 'playing the man', resulting in major injuries for several Hawks players during the game. Hawthorn controlled the game, leading by approximately 40 points for most of the match; in the last quarter, Geelong almost managed to come from behind to win, but fell short by six points. \n\n=====2008 Grand Final=====\nIn the [[2008 AFL Grand Final|2008 Grand Final]], Geelong was the heavily backed favourite and had lost only one match for the season, but Hawthorn upset Geelong by 26 points; Geelong won its next eleven matches against Hawthorn over the following five years, under a curse, which was dubbed the \"[[Kennett curse]]\" which was attributed to disrespectful comments made by Hawthorn president [[Jeff Kennett]] following the 2008 Grand Final. It was later revealed that after the 2008 grand final, Paul Chapman initiated a pact between other Geelong players to never lose to Hawthorn again. The curse was broken in a preliminary final in 2013, after Paul Chapman played his final match for Geelong the previous week.<ref>http://finalsiren.com/PreviousGames.asp?Team1ID=4&Team2ID=16&Go=Go</ref>\n\n===[[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] v [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]]===\n{{see also|Essendon v Kangaroos (2001 AFL season)}}\n\nEssendon and North Melbourne share a rivalry that has its roots during the formation of the VFL in 1896. North were denied by Essendon to join the breakaway competition because both clubs drew supporters from the same area and Essendon felt threatened by North's proximity to them which in turn drummed up fears that North could drain Essendon's talent pool if they were allowed to participate in the VFL. Essendon and North Melbourne were both strong in the latter part of the 1990s and early 2000s, and built a bigger rivalry during that time. The defining moment of this rivalry came in Round 16 of 2001, when Essendon came from 69 points down in the second quarter to win by 12 points. Essendon and North Melbourne have played in one Grand Final, in 1950, which Essendon won by 38 points.\n\n===[[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] v [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]===\nGeelong won their first flag in 1925 over Collingwood, in 1930 Collingwood defeated Geelong in the grand final making it four flags in-a-row for the Pies. Geelong would later deny Collingwood three successive premierships in 1937, winning a famous grand final by 32 points.\n\nThe two sides played against each other in 6 finals between 1951 and 1955, including the 1952 Grand Final when Geelong easily beat Collingwood by 46 points. In 1953, Collingwood ended Geelong's record 23-game winning streak in the home and away season, and later defeated them by 12 points in the grand final, denying the Cats a third successive premiership.\n\nSince 2007, the clubs have again both been at the top of the ladder and have met regularly in finals. Geelong won a memorable preliminary final by five points on their way to their first flag in 44 years. In 2008, Collingwood inflicted Geelong's only home-and-away loss, by a massive 86 points, but the teams did not meet in the finals. They would meet in preliminary finals in 2009 and 2010, each winning one ''en route'' to a premiership. They finally met in a Grand Final in 2011, which Geelong won by 38 points; Geelong inflicted Collingwood's only three losses for the 2011 season.<ref>http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2013-05-14/an-epic-rivalry</ref>\n\n==Local derbies==\nThere are four '[[local derby|local derbies]]' in the AFL, with each of the clubs competing against their cross-town rivals at least twice every year.\n\n===[[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] v [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]]===\n{{main|Western Derby}}\n\nThe two Western Australian-based teams contest the '''Western Derby'''. The [[West Coast Eagles]] won the first nine derbies, stretching from the inaugural derby in May 1995 until July 1999, but the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] managed a seven match consecutive winning streak in derby matches, commencing in August 2007 and ending in May 2011. Of the 50 derbies played, West Coast holds a 30\u201320 advantage. The best performed player in each Western Derby is awarded the '''Glendinning-Allan Medal'''.\n\n===[[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]] v [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]]===\n{{main|Showdown (AFL)}}\n\nThe two teams based in South Australia, the [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] and the [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Power]], contest the '''Showdown'''. The first showdown occurred in April 1997, following the introduction of Port Adelaide into the league that year. Of the 47 Showdowns that have been contested, Adelaide holds a 24\u201323 advantage over Port. The best performed player in each showdown is awarded the '''Showdown Medal'''. Following the death of then coach of [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] and assistant coach of [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Power]] for 11 years, [[Phil Walsh (Australian footballer)|Phil Walsh]], the Showdown medal was renamed after Walsh to commemorate his life, in the highest attended game between the two and the lowest ever margin. [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide Crows]] won 116 - 113.\n\n===[[Brisbane Lions]] v [[Gold Coast Suns|Gold Coast]]===\n{{main|QClash}}\nThe '''QClash''' is a derby between the only two Queensland clubs.

The teams met each other six times between September 2005 and March 2007, including both Grand Finals and two Qualifying Finals; the final margins of these games were: 4, 4, 2, 1, 1 and 1, with Sydney winning the 2005 Grand Final, and West Coast winning the 2006 Grand Final. The sum of margins of 13 points across six consecutive meetings is by far the narrowest in VFL/AFL history, with 28 points (South Melbourne vs Melbourne, 28 points, 1898\u20131900) the nearest challenger.\n\n===[[West Coast Eagles|West Coast]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\nThe rivalry between the West Coast Eagles and Collingwood Magpies steams from a series of finals matches since the VFL became the AFL.<ref>https://www.afl.com.au/news/2018-09-23/eagles-v-magpies-an-incredible-finals-rivalry</ref> With it routes in the 1990 Qualifying Final in which West Coast and Collingwood drew the match, requiring a replay the following week, the two sides drew a final on another occasion in 2007 which went into extra time which Collingwood won. The two clubs have met 8 times in finals since 1990, including a 2 point victory by the Eagles in the 1994 Qualifying final.The two clubs met for the first time in a Grand Final in 2018, with the Eagles winning by 5 points to claim their fourth premiership.<ref>https://www.bigfooty.com/forum/threads/west-coast-vs-collingwood-the-rivalry.1206603/</ref>. The two clubs also share a common coach in Mick Malthouse who led West Coast to their first two flags in 1992 and 1994 and took Collingwood to their 15th and most recent premiership in 2010.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-05/coach-mick-malthouse-inductees-australian-football-hall-of-fame/11180666</ref>\n\n===[[Brisbane Lions]] v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]===\nAngst between supporters of [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] had been caused by plenty of history between the two clubs, despite the Brisbane Lions having a relatively short existence as a merged club. Pre-merger [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] was a neighbouring suburb to Collingwood, with the boundary being based on Smith Street,<ref>http://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/About-Yarra/Maps/</ref> along with the fact that Fitzroy and Collingwood topped the VFL/AFL premiership tally during the early existence of what was then the VFL competition. The [[Brisbane Bears]] also had a bit of beef with the Magpies as the Bears' number one draft pick [[Nathan Buckley]] famously defected to Collingwood after one season on the Bears list, citing that he wanted to win premierships and play finals footy, and that Brisbane had no future.<ref>http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/buckley-still-haunted-by-flag-failures-20120116-1q38x.html</ref> The Bears also lost their final regular season match in their final season (1996) to the Magpies, costing the Bears the minor premiership that season.<ref name=\"forever.collingwoodfc.com.au\">https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/matches/1996-collingwood-vs-brisbane-round-22/</ref> However the rivalry between the Lions and the Magpies was properly ignited post-merger, it began in late 1999 when Collingwood played their last ever VFL/AFL game at their spiritual home ground, [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]] with the Lions emerging 42 point victors that day and consigning the Magpies to their second wooden spoon in their VFL/AFL history that day.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1086</ref> The rivalry between the two clubs went to the next level as the clubs played off in two consecutive Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003, with the Lions emerging victors on both occasions.<ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1654</ref><ref>http://www.footywire.com/afl/footy/ft_match_statistics?mid=1839</ref> These grand final results further fueled the hatred that Collingwood supporters have towards the Brisbane Lions to this day, despite the Lions having a poor decade on the field after their golden era.\n\n=== [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] v [[Sydney]] ===\nFrom 2011 until 2014 these two clubs shares a heated rivalry and have met four times in do or die games in the finals. In the 2011 Semi Final which Hawthorn won, 2012 Grand Final won by Sydney, 2013 Qualifying Final won by Hawthorn and 2014 Grand Final which was won by Hawthorn.\n\n===[[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] v [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]===\nWhile the St Kilda Football Club have tasted little success in the history of Australian Rules football, only acquiring one premiership in 1966 against the Collingwood Football Club, St Kilda have been a strong team in the modern era of the AFL. This is demonstrated no better than the clashes with Geelong during the 2000s and 2010s. The seasons between 2005-2011, both clubs were powerhouses, with St Kilda and Geelong both at the top of the AFL ladder during the 2009 Home and Away season. Both teams, still undefeated after 13 matches so far in the season, would finally meet in Round 14 at Etihad Stadium. This match, which broke the Etihad Stadium record of attendance at a Home and Away match in Etihad Stadium, would be known as one of the famous regular season matches in AFL history. The game also broke the record set in Round 8, 1991 between West Coast and Essendon as being the latest into a season that two undefeated teams had played against each other. St Kilda narrowly defeated Geelong, and asserted themselves atop alone in the AFL standings. These two teams would eventually meet again in the 2009 AFL Grand Final, but Geelong would defeat St Kilda late into the last quarter.\n\nThis rivalry would continue into the 2010-2011 seasons, and was still present in 2016, with the last three matches between the teams resulting in one win each for St Kilda and Geelong, with a draw in 2015.\n\n=== [[Western Bulldogs]] v [[Greater Western Sydney|GWS]] ===\nA fairly recent rivalry between the Western Bulldogs and the Greater Western Sydney has been going on since the 2016 AFL season finals series. It was the preliminary final that would kickstart the rivalry between the two clubs. In the final moments of the game both teams would be on top of each other trying to win the game, with Bulldogs trying to make their first AFL grand final appearance in 55 years while the Giants would be trying to make their first. The Bulldogs manage to win the game by 6 points and would latter go on to win the premiership the following week. Since then the two clubs would play each other in the home and away season with the Giants always winning over the Bulldogs. It wasn't until round 22 of the 2019 home and away season that Bulldogs would smash GWS in A 61 point win on the same ground of that of the famous 2016 preliminary final, it was also the first time the two teams played each other there since that day. Three weeks later on week one of the 2019 AFL finals series the two faced of in the 2nd elimination final where the Giants would thump the Bulldogs in a 58 point win. In that game GWS and the Bulldogs would be in all out fights on field with GWS attacking Western Bulldogs super star Marcus Bontempelli. It would also have GWS superstar Toby Greene gouge Bontempelli's right eye. This could been because of round 22 when Bontempelli charged with engaging in Rough Conduct against Giants defender Nick Haynes. Both teams would go on to become rivals, with more fights and injuries from matches with these two in the future.\n\n== Overall head to head ==\nAll clubs head to head win percentages.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

Pushkin wrote the story in autumn 1833 in [[Boldino]],<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 424.</ref> and it was first published in the literary magazine {{transl|ru|Biblioteka dlya chteniya}} in March [[1834 in literature|1834]].<ref>Binyon, ''Pushkin: A Biography'', p. 444.</ref>\n\nThe story was the basis of the operas ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (1890) by [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], {{lang|fr|La dame de pique}} (1850) by [[Fromental Hal\u00e9vy]] and {{lang|de|[[Pique Dame (Supp\u00e9)|Pique Dame]]}} (1864) by [[Franz von Supp\u00e9]]<ref>[http://www.operatoday.com/content/2005/10/the_operatic_pu.php The Operatic Pushkin].</ref> (the overture to the Supp\u00e9 work is all that remains in today's repertoire). It has been filmed numerous times.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Spb 06-2012 Obukhov Hospital.jpg|thumb|Obukhov Hospital in St. Petersburg, Russia, where Hermann is committed at the story's conclusion]]\nHermann, an [[German diaspora|ethnic German]], is an officer of the [[military engineer|engineers]] in the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in [[France]], she lost a fortune at [[Faro (card game)|faro]], and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious [[Count of St. Germain]]. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\n\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to frightening the countess to death with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\n\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble at faro for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace\u2014but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the [[Queen of spades|Queen of Spades]], rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace! Three, seven, queen!\"\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of the old countess was inspired by Princess [[Natalya Golitsyna|Natalya Petrovna Golitsyna]], who served as the lady-in-waiting for five Russian emperors and was 92 at the time Pushkin wrote \"The Queen of Spades\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=umQbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT623&dq=the+queen+of+spades+pushkin+avarice#v=onepage |title=Delphi Collected Works of Alexander Pushkin (Illustrated) |last=Pushkin |first=Alexander |date=2013-11-17 |publisher=Delphi Classics |isbn=9781908909688 |language=en}}</ref> According to legend, Galitzine had been a successful gambler.

Saint-Germain serves as the namesake for the story's protagonist, Hermann. Beyond this, the historical Saint-Germain may represent a father figure for Hermann, the antithesis to Hermann's character, or a former love interest of the countess who seeks revenge for her death by causing Hermann to pick the wrong cards.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Corwell |first=Neil |date=2002-01-01 |title=\"You've heard of the Count Saint-Germain ...\" \u2014in Pushkin's 'The Queen of Spades' and Far Beyond |jstor=40922261 |journal=New Zealand Slavonic Journal |pages=49\u201366}}</ref>\n\nThe card game of [[Faro (card game)|faro]] also plays an important role in Pushkin's story. The game is played by having a player bet on a winning card. The dealer then begins turning over cards, burning the first (known as \"soda\") to his left. The second card is placed face up to his right; this is the first winning card. The third card is placed face up in the left pile, as a losing card. The dealer continues turning over cards, alternating piles until the bet has been won or lost.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bicyclecards.ca/game-rules/faro/9.php?page_id=32 |title=Playing Cards, Card Games and Rules, Games and Family Fun from Bicycle |website=www.bicyclecards.ca |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n\n=== Reality vs. the supernatural ===\n[[File:\u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f 74 \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d \u0414\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0444\u0438\u0442\u0438.JPG|thumb|240px|Graffiti in [[Kharkiv]], 2008]]\nAccording to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], Pushkin\u2019s tale represents \u201cthe pinnacle of the art of the fantastic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book |title=F.\u00a0M.

Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text. These critics focus on three elements: the origin of the three, seven and ace; whether Hermann could have identified the cards without the ghost\u2019s intervention, and possible explanations for Hermann\u2019s mistake with the last card.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent critics have presented contradicting supernatural or rational views of Hermann\u2019s final mistake. The critic Gary Rosenshield claims that, by making the wrong choice of cards, Hermann actually did the right thing: as a man obsessed with gambling, having won the money would have meant that he could never gamble again, and therefore would have never again lived.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosenshield |first=Gary |date=1994-01-01 |title=Choosing the Right Card: Madness, Gambling, and the Imagination in Pushkin's \"The Queen of Spades\" |jstor=462967 |journal=PMLA |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=995\u20131008 |doi=10.2307/462967}}</ref>\n\nOther critics with rational explanations, such as Nathan Rosen and Viktor Vonogradov, claim that Hermann may have simply seen a likeness between the Countess who gave him the secret and the Queen card, leading him to make a mistake.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosen |first=Nathan |date=1975-01-01 |title=The Magic Cards in The Queen of Spades |jstor=306284 |journal=The Slavic and East European Journal |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=255\u2013275 |doi=10.2307/306284}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://feb-web.ru/feben/pushkin/serial/v36/v36-074-.htm |author=Vinogradov |title=Stil' \"Pikovoi damy\" |date=1936 |website=feb-web.ru |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> This explanation focuses on Pushkin\u2019s quote in the story that \u201cTwo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two bodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world.\u201d Here, Hermann cannot separate the actual cards from the Countess who reveals them to him, leading him to accidentally choose the queen instead of an ace.\n\nIn contrast to these rational explanations, other critics claim that Hermann entered the world of the supernatural and that the card actually changed after Hermann had picked it. These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta\u2014a concession he had made to acquire the secret\u2014her ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann\u2019s downfall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Storytelling ===\nPushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \"telling stories\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances. It is as if he is set within a story told by others, and feels inspired to write his own.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://pushkiniana.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200:clayton-articles1213&catid=133&Itemid=256|title=\"The Queen of Spades\": A Seriously Intended Joke / \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a|last=Douglas|first=Clayton, J.|website=The Pushkin Review|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> \n\nA reading of ''The Queen of Spades'' holds that the story reveals the Russian stereotype of the German, one who is cold and calculating person bent on accumulating wealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold Fusion: Aspects of the German Cultural Presence in Russia|last=Barabtarlo|first=Gennady|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2000|isbn=1571811885|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\n=== Avarice ===\nRosenshield describes Pushkin\u2019s Queen of Spades as an \u201ceternal tale of gambling and avarice\u201d.<ref>Gregg, Richard. \u201cGermann the Confessor and the Stony, Seated Countess: The Moral Subtext of Pushkin's 'the Queen of Spades'\u201d. ''The Slavonic and East European Review'' 78.4 (2000): 612\u2013624.</ref> In the story, Hermann becomes obsessed by gambling, even before the Countess grants him her secret to the cards. According to critic Nathan Rosen, Hermann\u2019s fatal mistake at the end of the story constitutes an act of self-punishment: Hermann punishes himself for the avarice of his corrupted soul.<ref>Rosen, Nathan. \"The Magic Cards in the Queen of Spades\". ''The Slavic and East European Journal'' 19.3 (1975): 255\u2013275.</ref> Beyond this greed in the form of his gambling obsession, Hermann\u2019s avarice manifests itself in his dealings with Lizavyeta and the Countess. From the moment when he first sets eye on her, Hermann manipulates Lizaveta and her \u201cinjured innocence\u201d to gain access to the Countess and the gambling secrets she holds; however, Hermann\u2019s \u201cdepravity becomes fully manifest in the climactic bedroom scene\u201d when he trespasses into the Countess\u2019 room and causes her death.<ref>Rosenshield, Gary. Pushkin and the Genres of Madness: The Masterpieces of 1833. Madison, WI: U of Wisconsin, 2003. Print.</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nPushkin uses metapoetic moments throughout the story to question the reliability of the narrator and to discern the genre of the work. These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form. After her departure, Hermann immediately writes down his vision, recording it on paper and writing a small story within the larger story of ''The Queen of Spades''.<ref name=\":1\" /> A second example is when Tomsky and his grandmother talk about traditional plot lines within a Russian novel, of which his grandmother denies the existence.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Adaptations ==\nOne of the most notable adaptations of The Queen of Spades was a film produced by [[Anatole de Grunwald]] completed in 1949. This film is recognized for its fidelity to the original story with few differences such as the depiction of the backstory about how the Countess acquired the secret of the three winning cards.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Classic Horror Films and the Literature That Inspired Them |last=Backer |first=Ron |publisher=McFarland |year=2015 |isbn=9780786498963 |location=Jefferson, NC |pages=40}}</ref> This film was directed by [[Thorold Dickinson]].

Readers must decide whether the countess appeared only to Hermann in his mind, a realistic solution, or whether Hermann has entered the world of the supernatural. Critics have attempted to answer this question using a variety of cryptographic clues within the text. These critics focus on three elements: the origin of the three, seven and ace; whether Hermann could have identified the cards without the ghost\u2019s intervention, and possible explanations for Hermann\u2019s mistake with the last card.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDifferent critics have presented contradicting supernatural or rational views of Hermann\u2019s final mistake. The critic Gary Rosenshield claims that, by making the wrong choice of cards, Hermann actually did the right thing: as a man obsessed with gambling, having won the money would have meant that he could never gamble again, and therefore would have never again lived.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosenshield |first=Gary |date=1994-01-01 |title=Choosing the Right Card: Madness, Gambling, and the Imagination in Pushkin's \"The Queen of Spades\" |jstor=462967 |journal=PMLA |volume=109 |issue=5 |pages=995\u20131008 |doi=10.2307/462967}}</ref>\n\nOther critics with rational explanations, such as Nathan Rosen and Viktor Vonogradov, claim that Hermann may have simply seen a likeness between the Countess who gave him the secret and the Queen card, leading him to make a mistake.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Rosen |first=Nathan |date=1975-01-01 |title=The Magic Cards in The Queen of Spades |jstor=306284 |journal=The Slavic and East European Journal |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=255\u2013275 |doi=10.2307/306284}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://feb-web.ru/feben/pushkin/serial/v36/v36-074-.htm |author=Vinogradov |title=Stil' \"Pikovoi damy\" |date=1936 |website=feb-web.ru |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> This explanation focuses on Pushkin\u2019s quote in the story that \u201cTwo fixed ideas can no more exist together in the moral world than two bodies can occupy one and the same place in the physical world.\u201d Here, Hermann cannot separate the actual cards from the Countess who reveals them to him, leading him to accidentally choose the queen instead of an ace.\n\nIn contrast to these rational explanations, other critics claim that Hermann entered the world of the supernatural and that the card actually changed after Hermann had picked it. These explanations argue that the Countess sought revenge on Hermann for her death. Critic Sergei Davydov argues that, since the Countess doubted that Hermann would indeed marry Lizavyeta\u2014a concession he had made to acquire the secret\u2014her ghost caused a magical transformation of the cards that led to Hermann\u2019s downfall.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Storytelling ===\nPushkin's tale is considered to be a work about \"telling stories\". Hermann, who is an author within the context of the story, in a way attempts to author his own fate by setting up a gambling situation in which he is guaranteed to win. Hermann's motivations to set up the scenario also come primarily from gossip, or word of mouth from his acquaintances. It is as if he is set within a story told by others, and feels inspired to write his own.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://pushkiniana.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=200:clayton-articles1213&catid=133&Itemid=256|title=\"The Queen of Spades\": A Seriously Intended Joke / \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a|last=Douglas|first=Clayton, J.|website=The Pushkin Review|access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref> \n\nA reading of ''The Queen of Spades'' holds that the story reveals the Russian stereotype of the German, one who is cold and calculating person bent on accumulating wealth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold Fusion: Aspects of the German Cultural Presence in Russia|last=Barabtarlo|first=Gennady|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2000|isbn=1571811885|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\n=== Avarice ===\nRosenshield describes Pushkin\u2019s Queen of Spades as an \u201ceternal tale of gambling and avarice\u201d.<ref>Gregg, Richard. \u201cGermann the Confessor and the Stony, Seated Countess: The Moral Subtext of Pushkin's 'the Queen of Spades'\u201d. ''The Slavonic and East European Review'' 78.4 (2000): 612\u2013624.</ref> In the story, Hermann becomes obsessed by gambling, even before the Countess grants him her secret to the cards. According to critic Nathan Rosen, Hermann\u2019s fatal mistake at the end of the story constitutes an act of self-punishment: Hermann punishes himself for the avarice of his corrupted soul.<ref>Rosen, Nathan. \"The Magic Cards in the Queen of Spades\". ''The Slavic and East European Journal'' 19.3 (1975): 255\u2013275.</ref> Beyond this greed in the form of his gambling obsession, Hermann\u2019s avarice manifests itself in his dealings with Lizavyeta and the Countess. From the moment when he first sets eye on her, Hermann manipulates Lizaveta and her \u201cinjured innocence\u201d to gain access to the Countess and the gambling secrets she holds; however, Hermann\u2019s \u201cdepravity becomes fully manifest in the climactic bedroom scene\u201d when he trespasses into the Countess\u2019 room and causes her death.<ref>Rosenshield, Gary. Pushkin and the Genres of Madness: The Masterpieces of 1833. Madison, WI: U of Wisconsin, 2003. Print.</ref>\n\n== Style ==\nPushkin uses metapoetic moments throughout the story to question the reliability of the narrator and to discern the genre of the work. These metapoetic moments refer to the story dealing with stories internally. One of the clearest example of this takes place after Hermann\u2019s encounter with the countess\u2019 ghostly form. After her departure, Hermann immediately writes down his vision, recording it on paper and writing a small story within the larger story of ''The Queen of Spades''.<ref name=\":1\" /> A second example is when Tomsky and his grandmother talk about traditional plot lines within a Russian novel, of which his grandmother denies the existence.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Adaptations ==\nOne of the most notable adaptations of The Queen of Spades was a film produced by [[Anatole de Grunwald]] completed in 1949. This film is recognized for its fidelity to the original story with few differences such as the depiction of the backstory about how the Countess acquired the secret of the three winning cards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Classic Horror Films and the Literature That Inspired Them|last=Backer|first=Ron|publisher=McFarland|year=2015|isbn=9780786498963|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=40}}</ref> This film was directed by [[Thorold Dickinson]] and it received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for the BAFTA award for Best British Film.\n\nPushkin's story has been adapted numerous times into multiple mediums.
