According to Gnielka's report, approximately 50,000 compensation claims were sitting unprocessed in a large heap.   Applicants were being treated with a marked absence of courtesy, and old Nazi-era [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] songs could sometimes be heard from the back offices.<ref name=TGlautRG/>\n\n===Visit from an Auschwitz survivor===\nOn 14 January 1959 Gnielka received a visit from as [[List of victims and survivors of Auschwitz|an Auschwitz survivor]] called [[Emil Wulkan]].    [[Auschwitz concentration camp|The concentration camp]] had been (formally) liberated on 27 January 1945.   In May 1945 Wulkan had found himself in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau (as Wroc\u0142aw was still known at the time)]].   Wulkan arrived with a little bundle of files neatly tied up with red ribbon, which had been rescued by Wulkan or a friend from outside what remained of [[Schutzstaffel|SS-main building]] and, adjacent to it, \"Polizeigerichts XV\" (''\"Police court 15\"''), in the rubble that had been the Agnesstra\u00dfe.   The files, a somewhat grisly souvenir of the destructive [[Siege of Breslau]], had been blown into the street by the fire storm that engulfed the buildings on 8 May 1945.<ref name=Spiegel511963/> Wulkan stated that there had been more papers, but when they had gone back to retrieve these, they found the papers they were looking for had been destroyed by fire.   Thirteen years later, still in possession of those papers, Wulkan had read Gnielka's article about the situation in the [[Wiesbaden]] [[:de:Versorgungsamt|Social Security Office]] and had come to invoke Gnielka's support in his attempts to progress his own compensation claim.<ref name=TGlautRG/> When Wulkan left the office, on top of the little sideboard that might normally have accommodated a drink or a small portion of cheese, there was instead the bundle of papers, still tied around with the red ribbon.<ref name=Spiegel511963/><ref name=TGlautRG/>\n\nWhen he looked at the files left behind by Emil Wulkan, Gnielka found that they dated from 1942.   They included a numbered listing compiled with characteristic care and precision which showed the names of [[List of victims and survivors of Auschwitz|Auschwitz detainees]] who had allegedly been \"shot while trying to escape\" (''\"auf der Flucht erschossen\"'').  Also identified by name were the \"successful\" [[Schutzstaffel|National Socialist paramilitaries (''\"SS-members\"'')]] involved in the shootings.   The document was stated to have been completed by the camp commander (''\"\"Kommandatur Konzentrationslager Auschwitz\"\"'') and it was indeed personally signed by [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]] who had overseen the construction of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|concentration camp complex]] around an old army barracks, and served between 1940 and 1943 as camp commander.<ref name=TGlautRG/><ref name=Prozess>{{cite web |url=http://www.auschwitz-prozess.de/index.php |work= Faksimile, Blatt 73 |publisher=[[:de:Fritz Bauer Institut|Fritz Bauer Institute]] & Directmedia Publishing, Berlin |title=1.

Finding evidence that would stand up in court was a major challenge for Bauer, however.<ref name=Spiegel511963/><ref name=TGlautRG/> On the evening of 14 January 1959, after working through the files he had received from Emil Wulkan, Thomas Gnielka arrived home looking \"really green faced\" (''er ist \"ziemlich gr\u00fcn im Gesicht nach Hause gekommen\"''), according to [[Ingeborg Euler|his wife]].  Ingeborg Euler recalled that Thomas Gnielka made a telephone call to [[Fritz Bauer|Prosecutor Bauer]], and a car was sent round to collect the files later that evening.   Other sources state that it was only on the next day, 15 January 1959, that the journalist sent the papers with the signature of the concentration camp commander over to the prosecutor's office.<ref name=TGlautRG/> They arrived with a brief (seventeen line) cover letter from Thomas Gnielka.   Bauer immediately allocated two staff in his office to the case.   The named perpetrators of the shootings had managed to leave their Nazi pasts behind them, but they were now sought out and, over time, arrested.   In the end the prosecutor managed to find some 1,500 witnesses.

Applicants were being treated with a marked absence of courtesy, and old Nazi-era [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] songs could sometimes be heard from the back offices.<ref name=TGlautRG/>\n\n===Visit from an Auschwitz survivor===\nOn 14 January 1959 Gnielka received a visit from as [[List of victims and survivors of Auschwitz|an Auschwitz survivor]] called [[Emil Wulkan]].    [[Auschwitz concentration camp|The concentration camp]] had been (formally) liberated on 27 January 1945.   In May 1945 Wulkan had found himself in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau (as Wroc\u0142aw was still known at the time)]].   Wulkan arrived with a little bundle of files neatly tied up with red ribbon, which had been rescued by Wulkan or a friend from outside what remained of [[Schutzstaffel|SS-main building]] and, adjacent to it, \"Polizeigerichts XV\" (''\"Police court 15\"''), in the rubble that had been the Agnesstra\u00dfe.   The files, a somewhat grisly souvenir of the destructive [[Siege of Breslau]], had been blown into the street by the fire storm that engulfed the buildings on 8 May 1945.<ref name=Spiegel511963/> Wulkan stated that there had been more papers, but when they had gone back to retrieve these, they found the papers they were looking for had been destroyed by fire.   Thirteen years later, still in possession of those papers, Wulkan had read Gnielka's article about the situation in the [[Wiesbaden]] [[:de:Versorgungsamt|Social Security Office]] and had come to invoke Gnielka's support in his attempts to progress his own compensation claim.<ref name=TGlautRG/> When Wulkan left the office, on top of the little sideboard that might normally have accommodated a drink or a small portion of cheese, there was instead the bundle of papers, still tied around with the red ribbon.<ref name=Spiegel511963/><ref name=TGlautRG/>\n\nWhen he looked at the files left behind by Emil Wulkan, Gnielka found that they dated from 1942.   They included a numbered listing compiled with characteristic care and precision which showed the names of [[List of victims and survivors of Auschwitz|Auschwitz detainees]] who had allegedly been \"shot while trying to escape\" (''\"auf der Flucht erschossen\"'').  Also identified by name were the \"successful\" [[Schutzstaffel|National Socialist paramilitaries (''\"SS-members\"'')]] involved in the shootings.   The document was stated to have been completed by the camp commander (''\"\"Kommandatur Konzentrationslager Auschwitz\"\"'') and it was indeed personally signed by [[Rudolf H\u00f6ss|Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]] who had overseen the construction of the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|concentration camp complex]] around an old army barracks, and served between 1940 and 1943 as camp commander.<ref name=TGlautRG/><ref name=Prozess>{{cite web |url=http://www.auschwitz-prozess.de/index.php |work= Faksimile, Blatt 73 |publisher=[[:de:Fritz Bauer Institut|Fritz Bauer Institute]] & Directmedia Publishing, Berlin |title=1.

Finding evidence that would stand up in court was a major challenge for Bauer, however.<ref name=Spiegel511963/><ref name=TGlautRG/> On the evening of 14 January 1959, after working through the files he had received from Emil Wulkan, Thomas Gnielka arrived home looking \"really green faced\" (''er ist \"ziemlich gr\u00fcn im Gesicht nach Hause gekommen\"''), according to [[Ingeborg Euler|his wife]].  Ingeborg Euler recalled that Thomas Gnielka made a telephone call to [[Fritz Bauer|Prosecutor Bauer]], and a car was sent round to collect the files later that evening.   Other sources state that it was only on the next day, 15 January 1959, that the journalist sent the papers with the signature of the concentration camp commander over to the prosecutor's office.<ref name=TGlautRG/> They arrived with a brief (seventeen line) cover letter from Thomas Gnielka.   Bauer immediately allocated two staff in his office to the case.   The named perpetrators of the shootings had managed to leave their Nazi pasts behind them, but they were now sought out and, over time, arrested.

People could move freely between the western enclaves and the eastern half of the city, administered by the [[Soviet Union]], until well into the 1950s.   In 1948 Ingeborg Euler learned for herself that there were differences, however.   As early as April 1946 she had placed herself on record as an advocate of open free speech.   Writing a review in [[:de:Horizont (Jugendzeitschrift)|Horizont]] about a meeting at the local cinema in [[Rangsdorf]], held in anticipation of the first democratic local elections since [[Machtergreifung|1933]], she urged her young readers, who had grown up till that point learning the advisability of remaining \"silent\" on political matters, to speak out:  \"How can we seek to built a democratic state if we dare not say what we think?\" (''\"Wie wollen wir uns denn einen demokratischen Staat aufbauen,  wenn wir nicht einmal  wagen, unsere Meinung zu sagen?\"'').   With the twelve Nazi years having come to an end, it was a time of hope.   During the next couple of years the cinema became a regular meeing point for a group of young people who founded a theatre group, on the initiative of the local Soviet commander:  Ingeborg Euler became a star of this improvised local stage.<ref name=IElautGH/> \n\nTrue to her belief in sharing her views, in 1948 Ingeborg Euler addressed a letter to the allied military commanders controlling Berlin.

People could move freely between the western enclaves and the eastern half of the city, administered by the [[Soviet Union]], until well into the 1950s.   In 1948 Ingeborg Euler learned for herself that there were differences, however.   As early as April 1946 she had placed herself on record as an advocate of open free speech.   Writing a review in [[:de:Horizont (Jugendzeitschrift)|Horizont]] about a meeting at the local cinema in [[Rangsdorf]], held in anticipation of the first democratic local elections since [[Machtergreifung|1933]], she urged her young readers, who had grown up till that point learning the advisability of remaining \"silent\" on political matters, to speak out:  \"How can we seek to built a democratic state if we dare not say what we think?\" (''\"Wie wollen wir uns denn einen demokratischen Staat aufbauen,  wenn wir nicht einmal  wagen, unsere Meinung zu sagen?\"'').   With the twelve Nazi years having come to an end, it was a time of hope.   During the next couple of years the cinema became a regular meeing point for a group of young people who founded a theatre group, on the initiative of the local Soviet commander:  Ingeborg Euler became a star of this improvised local stage.<ref name=IElautGH/> \n\nTrue to her belief in sharing her views, in 1948 Ingeborg Euler addressed a letter to the allied military commanders controlling Berlin.   She was promptly arrested and detained in a Soviet administered jail in [[East Berlin]].   Here she was accused of espionage.   It was only through the energetic persistence of her mother, who was able to call upon backing from prominent celebrities in good standing with the Soviet authorities, including [[Johannes R. Becher]], [[Gustav von Wangenheim]] and [[G\u00fcnther Weisenborn]], that after eleven days she was released and unceremoniously flown out of the city, ending up in [[Frankfurt am Main]], which was in the western part of occupied Germany and a principal administrative base for the [[:de:Amerikanische Besatzungszone|United States occupation zone]].   She quickly moved on to [[Munich]], also in the American zone, which is where she now built a new life.<ref name=IElautGH/><ref name=\"Heukenkamp199601\"/>   \n\nIt was in Munich that she met [[Thomas Gnielka]].

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], [[The Last Unicorn]], Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and [[David Lynch]] was a big influence in how when you watch [[Twin Peak]].<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of the promotional action for series, Netflix launched on April 19, 2020 on its YouTube channel a live with a countdown to series. Throughout the live, small portions of the episode were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Surrealism]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Mike L.

This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find the new situation relieving. This does not last long as they are hit with a cure that, ironically, causes those still left as zombies to devour them.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production was they need to know how much of the episodes will be story to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell the parts of podcast who entered the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. The episodes should have a balance so that the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation people would not pay attention to everything at the same time. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Acording Trussell the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]] lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], [[The Last Unicorn]], Liquid Television; Aeon Flux and [[David Lynch]] was a big influence in how when you watch [[Twin Peak]].<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, that it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. Acording to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that somewhat was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of the promotional action for series, Netflix launched on April 19, 2020 on its YouTube channel a live with a countdown to series. Throughout the live, small portions of the episode were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20.

In 1918, during the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|German Revolution]], the ruling [[house of Wittelsbach]], which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|socialist republic]] was declared.\n\nIn the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]. The first attempt of the Nazi movement to take over the German government in 1923 with the [[Feldherrnhalle|Beer Hall Putsch]] was stopped by the Bavarian police in Munich with gunfire. After the Nazis' rise to power, Munich was declared their \"Capital of the Movement\". During World War II, Munich was heavily bombed and more than 50% of the entire city and up to 90% of the historic centre were destroyed. After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'', or \"economic miracle\". Unlike many other German cities which were heavily bombed, Munich restored most of its traditional cityscape and hosted the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. The 1980s brought strong economic growth, high-tech industries and scientific institutions, and population growth. The city is home to major corporations like [[BMW]], [[Siemens]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[The Linde Group|Linde]], [[Allianz SE|Allianz]] and [[Munich Re|MunichRE]].\n\nMunich is home to many universities, museums and theatres.

The foundation date is not considered the year 1158, the date the city was first mentioned in a document. The document was signed in [[Augsburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmf.bayern.de/ueber_uns/ausstellung_foyer/muenchner_pfennig/ |title=Ausstellung im Foyer |publisher=Stmf.bayern.de |accessdate=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306014325/http://www.stmf.bayern.de/ueber_uns/ausstellung_foyer/muenchner_pfennig/ |archivedate=6 March 2012 }}</ref> By then, the [[House of Welf|Guelph]] [[Henry the Lion]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Bavaria]], had built a toll bridge over the river Isar next to the monk settlement and on the salt route. But as part of the archaeological excavations at Marienhof in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn from 2012 shards of vessels from the eleventh century were found, which prove again that the settlement Munich must be older than their first documentary mention from 1158.\n\nIn 1175 Munich received city status and fortification. In 1180 with the trial of Henry the Lion, [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto I Wittelsbach]] became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Bishop of Freising]]. (Wittelsbach's heirs, the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach dynasty]], ruled Bavaria until 1918.) In 1240, Munich was transferred to [[Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto II Wittelsbach]] and in 1255, when the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of [[Upper Bavaria]].\n\nDuke [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]], a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income. In the late 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of [[gothic art]]s: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest [[gothic architecture|gothic]] church \u2013 the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] \u2013 now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.\n\n===Capital of reunited Bavaria===\n[[File:Marcktzumuenchen.png|thumb|left|[[Marienplatz]], Munich about 1650]]\n[[File:Mun flags frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners with the colours of Munich (left) and Bavaria (right) with the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in the background]]\n\nWhen Bavaria was reunited in 1506, Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court (see [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlando di Lasso]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]). During the 16th century, Munich was a centre of the German [[Counter-Reformation|counter reformation]], and also of [[renaissance]] arts. Duke [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Wilhelm V]] commissioned the Jesuit [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|Michaelskirche]], which became a centre for the counter-reformation, and also built the [[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]] for brewing brown beer in 1589. The [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] was founded in Munich in 1609.\n\nIn 1623, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Munich became electoral residence when [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria]] was invested with the [[prince-elector|electoral dignity]], but in 1632 the city was occupied by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolph of Sweden]]. When the [[bubonic plague]] broke out in 1634 and 1635, about one third of the population died. Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of baroque life, but also had to suffer under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] occupations in 1704 and 1742.\n\nIn 1806 the city became the capital of the new [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], with the state's parliament (the ''[[Landtag]]'') and the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|archdiocese of Munich and Freising]] being located in the city. Twenty years later, [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Landshut University]] was moved to Munich. Many of the city's finest buildings belong to this period and were built under the first three Bavarian kings. Especially [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig I]] rendered outstanding services to Munich's status as a centre of the arts, attracting numerous artists and enhancing the city's architectural substance with grand boulevards and buildings. On the other hand, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]], known the world over as the fairytale king, was mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside. Nevertheless, his patronage of [[Richard Wagner]] secured his posthumous reputation, as do his castles, which still generate significant tourist income for Bavaria. Later, Prince Regent [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]]'s years as regent were marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich, enhancing its status as a cultural force of global importance (see [[Franz Stuck|Franz von Stuck]] and [[Der Blaue Reiter]]).\n\n===World War I to World War II===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_119-1486,_Hitler-Putsch,_M\u00fcnchen,_Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|Unrest during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]]]\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.\n\nAfter World War I, the city was at the centre of an substantial political unrest. In November 1918 on the eve of German revolution, [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]] and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|premier of Bavaria]] [[Kurt Eisner]] in February 1919 by [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley]], the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was proclaimed. When Communists took power, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], who had lived in Munich some years before, sent a congratulatory telegram, but the Soviet Republic was ended on 3 May 1919 by the [[Freikorps]]. While the republican government had been restored, Munich became a hotbed of extremist politics, among which [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] soon rose to prominence.\n\n[[File:wardamage2.jpg|thumb|Bombing damage to the Altstadt. Note the roofless and pockmarked Altes Rathaus looking up the Tal. The roofless [[Heiliggeistkirche (Munich)|Heilig-Geist-Kirche]] is on the right of the photo. Its spire, without the copper top, is behind the church. The [[Talburgtor|Talbruck gate tower]] is missing completely.]]\n\nIn 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt to overthrow the [[Weimar Republic]] and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP). The city again became important to the Nazis when they took power in Germany in 1933. The party created its first [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the ''Hauptstadt der Bewegung'' (\"Capital of the Movement\"). The NSDAP headquarters were in Munich and many ''F\u00fchrerbauten'' (\"''F\u00fchrer''-buildings\") were built around the [[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]], some of which still survive.\n\nThe city is known as the site of the culmination of the policy of [[Munich Agreement|appeasement]] by Britain and France leading up to World War II. It was in Munich that British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] assented to the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region into Greater Germany in the hopes of sating the desires of Hitler's [[Third Reich]].\n\nMunich was the base of the [[White Rose]], a student [[resistance movement]] from June 1942 to February 1943. The core members were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets in [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]] by Hans and Sophie Scholl.\n\nThe city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II by 71 air raids over five years.\n\n===Postwar===\nAfter US occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid. In 1957, Munich's population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname ''Heimliche Hauptstadt'' (\"secret capital\") in the decades after World War II.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nMunich was the site of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], during which 11 [[Israel|Israeli]] athletes were murdered by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorists in the [[Munich massacre]], when gunmen from the Palestinian \"[[Black September (group)|Black September]]\" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nMost Munich residents enjoy a high quality of life.

The local rivers are the [[Isar]] and the [[W\u00fcrm]].\nMunich is situated in the Northern [[Foothills|Alpine Foreland]]. The northern part of this sandy plateau includes a highly fertile [[flint]] area which is no longer affected by the [[fold (geology)|folding]] processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is covered with [[moraine|morainic]] hills.

The warmest month, on average, is July. The coolest is January.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer. The most precipitation occurs in June, on average. Winter tends to have less precipitation, the least in February.\n\nThe higher elevation and proximity to the Alps cause the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of Germany. The Alps affect the city's climate in other ways too; for example, the warm downhill wind from the Alps ([[f\u00f6hn wind]]), which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter.\n\nBeing at the centre of Europe, Munich is subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European cities, especially those further west and south of the Alps.\n\nAt Munich's official [[weather station]]s, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are {{convert|37.5|C|F|0}}, on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and {{convert|-31.6|C|F|1}}, on 12 February 1929 in Botanic Garden of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Extremwertetafel2|title=Extremwertetafel (M\u00fcnchen-Riem)|website=SKlima.de|access-date=February 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sklima.de/datenbank/monat_extrem.php|title=Extremwertetafel (M\u00fcnchen-Botanischer Garten)|website=SKlima.de|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/Extremwertetafel|archive-date=February 12, 2019|url-status=|access-date=February 12, 2019}}</ref><!-- The archiving was done in addition to preserving the data facilitate access, since it only works by filling out the form of the site, without direct access to it.\nThe archived version was made in an upload version since this type of link would only return the form page and could be lost as often, see data from some Swiss stations. -->\n{{Weather box\n|location = Munich (Dreim\u00fchlenviertel), elevation: 515 m and 535 m, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1954\u2013present{{efn|Two meteorological stations are responsible for the climatological data so that they are interpolated.<ref>[ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate/annual/kl/historical/jahreswerte_KL_03379_19550101_20171231_hist.zip Stationsgeschichte der Messger\u00e4te]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|DWD]].

Its tower contains the [[Rathaus-Glockenspiel]]. Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive \u2013 the [[Isartor]] in the east, the [[Sendlinger Tor]] in the south and the [[Karlstor]] in the west of the inner city. The Karlstor leads up to the [[Karlsplatz (Stachus)|Stachus]], a square dominated by the [[Justizpalast (Munich)|Justizpalast]] (Palace of Justice) and a fountain.\n\nThe [[St. Peter's Church, Munich|Peterskirche]] close to Marienplatz is the oldest church of the inner city. It was first built during the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period, and was the focus of the early monastic settlement in Munich before the city's official foundation in 1158. Nearby St. Peter the Gothic hall-church [[Heiliggeistkirche (Munich)|Heiliggeistkirche]] (The Church of the Holy Spirit) was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the [[Viktualienmarkt]].\n\nThe [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] serves as the cathedral for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising]]. The nearby [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|Michaelskirche]] is the largest [[renaissance]] church north of the Alps, while the [[Theatine Church, Munich|Theatinerkirche]] is a [[basilica]] in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on Southern German [[baroque]] architecture. Its dome dominates the [[Odeonsplatz]]. Other baroque churches in the inner city include the [[B\u00fcrgersaalkirche (Munich)|B\u00fcrgersaalkirche]], the [[Trinity Church (Munich)|Trinity Church]] and the [[St. Anna Damenstiftskirche (Munich)|St. Anna Damenstiftskirche]]. The [[Asamkirche, Munich|Asamkirche]] was endowed and built by the Brothers [[Cosmas Damian Asam|Asam]], pioneering artists of the rococo period.\n\nThe large [[Munich Residenz|Residenz]] palace complex (begun in 1385) on the edge of Munich's Old Town, Germany's largest urban palace, ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Having undergone several extensions, it contains also the treasury and the splendid rococo [[Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre]]. Next door to the Residenz the neo-classical opera, the [[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]] was erected. Among the baroque and neoclassical mansions which still exist in Munich are the [[Palais Porcia]], the [[Palais Preysing]], the [[Palais Holnstein]] and the [[Prinz-Carl-Palais]]. All mansions are situated close to the Residenz, same as the [[Alter Hof|Alte Hof]], a medieval castle and first residence of the Wittelsbach dukes in Munich.\n\nLehel, a middle-class quarter east of the Altstadt, is characterised by numerous well-preserved townhouses. The [[Parish Church of St. Anna (Lehel, Munich)|St. Anna im Lehel]] is the first [[rococo]] church in Bavaria. [[St. Luke's Church, Munich|St. Lukas]] is the largest Protestant Church in Munich.\n\n===Royal avenues and squares===\n[[File:Ludwigstra\u00dfeMUC.jpg|thumb|[[Ludwigstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Ludwigstra\u00dfe]] from above, [[Highlight Towers]] in the background]]\n\nFour grand royal avenues of the 19th century with official buildings connect Munich's inner city with its then-suburbs:\n\nThe neoclassical [[Brienner Stra\u00dfe (Munich)|Brienner Stra\u00dfe]], starting at [[Odeonsplatz]] on the northern fringe of the Old Town close to the Residenz, runs from east to west and opens into the [[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]], designed with the \"[[Doric order|Doric]]\" [[Propylaea (Munich)|Propyl\u00e4en]], the \"[[Ionic order|Ionic]]\" [[Glyptothek]] and the \"[[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]\" [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen|State Museum of Classical Art]], behind it [[St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich|St. Boniface's Abbey]] was erected. The area around K\u00f6nigsplatz is home to the [[Kunstareal]], Munich's gallery and museum quarter (as described [[Munich#Museums|below]]).\n\n[[Ludwigstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Ludwigstra\u00dfe]] also begins at [[Odeonsplatz]] and runs from south to north, skirting the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t]], the [[Ludwigskirche (Munich)|St. Louis church]], the [[Bavarian State Library]] and numerous state ministries and palaces. The southern part of the avenue was constructed in Italian renaissance style, while the north is strongly influenced by Italian Romanesque architecture. The\n[[Siegestor]] (gate of victory) sits at the northern end of Ludwigstra\u00dfe, where the latter passes over into Leopoldstra\u00dfe and the district of [[Schwabing]] begins.\n[[File:K\u00f6nigsplatz - Propyl\u00e4en und Glyptothek.jpg|thumb|[[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]]]]\n\nThe neo-Gothic [[Maximilianstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Maximilianstra\u00dfe]] starts at [[Max-Joseph-Platz]], where the Residenz and the National Theatre are situated, and runs from west to east. The avenue is framed by elaborately structured neo-Gothic buildings which house, among others, the [[Munich Kammerspiele|Schauspielhaus]], the Building of the district government of Upper Bavaria and the [[State Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology]]. After crossing the river Isar, the avenue circles the [[Maximilianeum]], which houses the [[Landtag of Bavaria|state parliament]]. The western portion of Maximilianstra\u00dfe is known for its designer shops, luxury boutiques, jewellery stores, and one of Munich's foremost five-star hotels, the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten.\n\n[[Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe]] runs parallel to Maximilianstra\u00dfe and begins at [[Prinz-Carl-Palais]]. Many museums are on the avenue, such as the [[Haus der Kunst]], the [[Bavarian National Museum]] and the [[Schackgalerie]]. The avenue crosses the Isar and circles the [[Angel of Peace|Friedensengel]] monument, then passing the [[Villa Stuck]] and Hitler's old apartment. The [[Prinzregententheater]] is at Prinzregentenplatz further to the east.\n\n===Other boroughs===\n[[File:Leopoldstra\u00dfe_153_(M\u00fcnchen-Schwabing).JPG|thumb|Building in Schwabing]]\nIn [[Schwabing]] and [[Maxvorstadt]], many beautiful streets with continuous rows of [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] buildings can be found. Rows of elegant town houses and spectacular urban palais in many colours, often elaborately decorated with ornamental details on their fa\u00e7ades, make up large parts of the areas west of [[Leopoldstra\u00dfe]] (Schwabing's main shopping street), while in the eastern areas between Leopoldstra\u00dfe and [[Englischer Garten]] similar buildings alternate with almost rural-looking houses and whimsical mini-castles, often decorated with small towers. Numerous tiny alleys and shady lanes connect the larger streets and little plazas of the area, conveying the legendary artist's quarter's flair and atmosphere convincingly like it was at the turn of the 20th century. The wealthy district of [[Bogenhausen]] in the east of Munich is another little-known area (at least among tourists) rich in extravagant architecture, especially around Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe. One of Bogenhausen's most beautiful buildings is [[Villa Stuck]], famed residence of painter [[Franz von Stuck]].\n[[File:Image-Schloss Nymphenburg Munich CC edit3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Nymphenburg Palace]]]]\nTwo large baroque palaces in [[Nymphenburg]] and [[Oberschleissheim]] are reminders of Bavaria's royal past. Schloss Nymphenburg ([[Nymphenburg Palace]]), some {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} north west of the city centre, is surrounded by an park and is considered{{by whom|date=December 2019}} to be one of Europe's most beautiful royal residences. {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Nymphenburg Palace is Schloss Blutenburg ([[Blutenburg Castle]]), an old ducal country seat with a late-Gothic palace church. Schloss F\u00fcrstenried ([[F\u00fcrstenried Palace]]), a baroque palace of similar structure to Nymphenburg but of much smaller size, was erected around the same time in the south west of Munich.\n\n[[File:Schloss oberschleissheim-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|325x325px|[[Schleissheim Palace]]]]\n\nThe second large baroque residence is Schloss Schleissheim ([[Schleissheim Palace]]), located in the suburb of [[Oberschlei\u00dfheim|Oberschleissheim]], a palace complex encompassing three separate residences: Altes Schloss Schleissheim (the old palace), Neues Schloss Schleissheim (the new palace) and Schloss Lustheim (Lustheim Palace). Most parts of the palace complex serve as museums and art galleries. [[Deutsches Museum]]'s Flugwerft Schleissheim flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleissheim Special Landing Field. The [[Bavaria statue]] before the neo-classical [[Ruhmeshalle (Munich)|Ruhmeshalle]] is a monumental, bronze sand-cast 19th-century statue at [[Theresienwiese]]. The [[Gr\u00fcnwald castle]] is the only medieval castle in the Munich area which still exists.\n[[File:BMW Vierzylinder Tower Munich 2014 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[BMW Headquarters]]]]\n\n[[St Michael in Berg am Laim (Munich)|St Michael in Berg am Laim]] is a church in the suburbs. Another church of [[Johann Michael Fischer]] is St George in Bogenhausen. Most of the boroughs have parish churches which originate from the Middle Ages, such as the church of pilgrimage [[St. Mary's Church, Ramersdorf|St Mary in Ramersdorf]]. The oldest church within the city borders is [[Holy Cross Church, Munich|Heilig Kreuz]] in Fr\u00f6ttmaning next to the Allianz-Arena, known for its Romanesque fresco.\n\nEspecially in its suburbs, Munich features a wide and diverse array of modern architecture, although strict culturally sensitive height limitations for buildings have limited the construction of skyscrapers to avoid a loss of views to the distant Bavarian Alps. Most high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the [[Hypo-Haus]], the [[Arabella High-Rise Building]], the [[Highlight Towers]], [[Uptown Munich]], M\u00fcnchner Tor and the [[BMW Headquarters]] next to the [[Olympiapark (Munich)|Olympic Park]]. Several other high-rise buildings are located near the city centre and on the [[Siemens]] campus in southern Munich. A landmark of modern Munich is also the architecture of the sport stadiums (as described [[Munich#Sports|below]]).\n\nIn Fasangarten is the former [[McGraw Kaserne]], a former US army base, near [[Stadelheim Prison]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Parks===\n[[File:M\u00fcnchen Hofgartentempel.jpg|thumb|Hofgarten with the dome of the state chancellery near the [[Munich Residenz|Residenz]]]]\nMunich is a densely-built city but still offers numerous public parks. The [[Englischer Garten]], close to the city centre and covering an area of {{convert|3.7|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} is larger than Central Park in New York City, is one of the world's largest urban public parks. It contains a [[Naturism|naturist]] (nudist) area, numerous bicycle and jogging tracks as well as bridle-paths. It was designed and laid out by [[Benjamin Thompson]], Count of Rumford, for both pleasure and as a work area for the city's vagrants and homeless. Nowadays it is entirely a park, its southern half being dominated by wide open areas, hills, monuments and beach-like stretches (along the streams Eisbach and Schwabinger Bach). In contrast, its less-frequented northern part is much quieter, with many old trees and thick undergrowth. Multiple [[Beer garden|Biergartens]] can be found in both parts of the Englischer Garten, the most well known being located at the [[Englischer Garten#Chinese Tower|Chinese Pagoda]].\n\nOther large green spaces are the modern [[Olympiapark, Munich|Olympiapark]], [[Westpark (Munich)|Westpark]], and the parks of [[Nymphenburg Palace]] (with the [[Botanischer Garten M\u00fcnchen-Nymphenburg]] to the north), and [[Schleissheim Palace]]. The city's oldest park is the [[Hofgarten (Munich)|Hofgarten]], near the Residenz, dating back to the 16th century. The site of the largest beergarden in town, the former royal Hirschgarten was founded in 1780 for deer, which still live there.\n\nThe city's [[zoo]] is the [[Tierpark Hellabrunn]] near the Flaucher Island in the Isar in the south of the city. Another notable park is [[Ostpark (Munich)|Ostpark]] located in the [[Ramersdorf-Perlach]] borough which also houses the Michaelibad, the largest waterpark in Munich.\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sport in Munich|}}\n[[File:Allianz Arena zu verschiedenen Zeiten.jpg|thumb|[[Allianz Arena]], the home stadium of [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]]]\n[[File:M\u00fcnchen - Olympische Bauten.jpg|thumb|Olympiasee in Olympiapark, Munich]]\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|Football in Munich}}\nMunich is home to several professional [[Association football|football]] teams including [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Germany's most successful club and a multiple [[UEFA Champions League]] winner. Other notable clubs include [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], who were long time their rivals on a somewhat equal footing, but currently play in the 3rd Division [[3. Liga]] along with another former Bundesliga club [[SpVgg Unterhaching]].\n\n===Basketball===\n[[FC Bayern Munich (basketball)|FC Bayern Munich Basketball]] is currently playing in the Beko Basket Bundesliga. The city hosted the final stages of the FIBA [[EuroBasket 1993]], where the [[German national basketball team]] won the gold medal.\n\n===Ice hockey===\nThe city's ice hockey club is [[EHC Red Bull M\u00fcnchen]] who play in the [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]]. The team has won three DEL Championships, in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n===Olympics===\n\nMunich hosted the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]; the [[Munich massacre|Munich Massacre]] took place in the [[Olympic Village, Munich|Olympic village]]. It was one of the host cities for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 Football World Cup]], which was not held in Munich's [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)|Olympic Stadium]], but in a new [[Soccer-specific stadium|football specific stadium]], the [[Allianz Arena]].

Three redundant exhibition buildings that are under a protection order were converted to house the Verkehrsmuseum, which houses the land transport collections of the Deutsches Museum. Deutsches Museum's Flugwerft Schleissheim flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleissheim Special Landing Field. Several non-centralised museums (many of those are public collections at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t) show the expanded state collections of [[Pal\u00e4ontologisches Museum M\u00fcnchen|palaeontology]], geology, [[mineralogy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~Mineralogische.Staatssammlung/ |title=Museum Reich der Kristalle M\u00fcnchen |publisher=Lrz-muenchen.de |accessdate=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415161904/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~Mineralogische.Staatssammlung/ |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}</ref> [[Zoologische Staatssammlung M\u00fcnchen|zoology]], botany and anthropology.\n\nThe city has several important [[art museum|art galleries]], most of which can be found in the [[Kunstareal]], including the [[Alte Pinakothek]], the [[Neue Pinakothek]], the [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] and the [[Museum Brandhorst]]. The Alte Pinakothek contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two floors. Major displays include [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s Christ-like [[Self-Portrait (D\u00fcrer, Munich)|''Self-Portrait'' (1500)]], his ''[[The Four Apostles|Four Apostles]]'', [[Raphael]]'s paintings'' [[Canigiani Holy Family (Raphael)|The Canigiani Holy Family]]'' and'' [[Tempi Madonna (Raphael)|Madonna Tempi]]'' as well as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] large ''Judgment Day''. The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. The [[Lenbachhaus]] houses works by the group of Munich-based modernist artists known as [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider). \n[[File:BMW Welt, M\u00fanich, Alemania16.jpg|thumbnail| [[BMW Welt]] ]]\nAn important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the [[Glyptothek]] and the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen|Staatliche Antikensammlung]] (State Antiquities Collection). King Ludwig I managed to acquire such pieces as the [[Medusa Rondanini]], the [[Barberini Faun]] and figures from the [[Temple of Aphaea]] on [[Aegina]] for the Glyptothek. Another important museum in the [[Kunstareal]] is the [[Staatliche Sammlung f\u00fcr \u00c4gyptische Kunst|Egyptian Museum]].\n\nThe gothic [[Morris dance]]rs of [[Erasmus Grasser]] are exhibited in the [[Munich Stadtmuseum|Munich City Museum]] in the old gothic arsenal building in the inner city.\n\nAnother area for the arts next to the Kunstareal is the [[Altstadt-Lehel|Lehel]] quarter between the old town and the river Isar: the [[Museum Five Continents]] in Maximilianstra\u00dfe is the second largest collection in Germany of artefacts and objects from outside Europe, while the [[Bavarian National Museum]] and the adjoining [[Bavarian State Archaeological Collection]] in Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe rank among Europe's major art and cultural history museums. The nearby [[Schackgalerie]] is an important gallery of German 19th-century paintings.\n\nThe former [[Dachau concentration camp]] is {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city.\n\n===Arts and literature===\n[[File:Nationaltheater M\u00fcnchen 2.jpg|thumb|[[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]]]]\nMunich is a major international cultural centre and has played host to many prominent composers including [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlando di Lasso]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W.A. Mozart]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Max Reger]] and [[Carl Orff]]. With the [[Munich Biennale]] founded by [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the ''[[A*Devantgarde|A*DEvantgarde]]'' festival, the city still contributes to modern music theatre. Some of classical music's best-known pieces have been created in and around Munich by composers born in the area, for example Richard Strauss's tone poem ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' or Carl Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana]]''.\n\nAt the [[National Theatre Munich|Nationaltheater]] several of [[Richard Wagner]]'s operas were premiered under the patronage of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. It is the home of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] and the [[Bavarian State Orchestra]]. Next door, the modern [[Residenz Theatre]] was erected in the building that had housed the [[Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre]] before World War II. Many operas were staged there, including the premiere of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Idomeneo]]'' in 1781. The [[Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz|G\u00e4rtnerplatz Theatre]] is a ballet and musical state theatre while another opera house, the [[Prinzregententheater]], has become the home of the Bavarian Theatre Academy and the [[Munich Chamber Orchestra]].\n\n[[File:Gasteig_Philharmonie_14.jpg|thumb|[[Gasteig]]]]\nThe modern [[Gasteig]] centre houses the [[Munich Philharmonic|Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. Its primary concert venue is the Herkulessaal in the former city royal residence, the [[Munich Residenz]]. Many important conductors have been attracted by the city's orchestras, including [[Felix Weingartner]], [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Hans Rosbaud]], [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], [[Sergiu Celibidache]], [[James Levine]], [[Christian Thielemann]], [[Lorin Maazel]], [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]], [[Eugen Jochum]], Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Mariss Jansons]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Zubin Mehta]] and [[Kent Nagano]]. A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the [[Deutsches Theater M\u00fcnchen|Deutsche Theater]]. It is Germany's largest theatre for guest performances.\n[[File:FriedensengelMunchen.JPG|thumb|The Golden Friedensengel]]\n\nMunich's contributions to modern popular music are often overlooked in favour of its strong association with classical music, but they are numerous: the city has had a strong music scene in the 1960s and 1970s, with many internationally renowned bands and musicians frequently performing in its clubs. Furthermore, Munich was the centre of [[Krautrock]] in southern Germany, with many important bands such as [[Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II]], [[Embryo (band)|Embryo]] or [[Popol Vuh (band)|Popol Vuh]] hailing from the city. In the 1970s, the [[Musicland Studios]] developed into one of the most prominent recording studios in the world, with bands such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Deep Purple]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] recording albums there. Munich also played a significant role in the development of electronic music, with genre pioneer [[Giorgio Moroder]], who invented [[synth]] [[disco]] and [[electronic dance music]], and [[Donna Summer]], one of disco music's most important performers, both living and working in the city. In the late 1990s, [[Electroclash]] was substantially co-invented if not even invented in Munich, when [[DJ Hell]] introduced and assembled international pioneers of this musical genre through his [[International DeeJay Gigolo Records]] label here.<ref name=\"mjunikdisco\"/> Other examples of notable musicians and bands from Munich are [[Konstantin Wecker]], [[:de:Willy Astor|Willy Astor]], [[Spider Murphy Gang]], [[M\u00fcnchener Freiheit]], [[Lou Bega]], [[Megaherz]], [[FSK (band)|FSK]], [[Colour Haze]] and [[Sportfreunde Stiller]].\n\nMusic is so important in the Bavarian capital that the city hall gives permissions every day to ten musicians for performing in the streets around Marienplatz. This is how performers such as [[Olga Kholodnaya]] and [[Alex Jacobowitz]] are entertaining the locals and the tourists every day.\n\nNext to the Bavarian Staatsschauspiel in the Residenz Theatre (Residenztheater), the [[Munich Kammerspiele]] in the Schauspielhaus is one of the most important German language theatres in the world. Since [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s premieres in 1775 many important writers have staged their plays in Munich such as [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].\n\nThe city is known as the second largest publishing centre in the world (around 250 publishing houses have offices in the city), and many national and international publications are published in Munich, such as Arts in Munich, LAXMag and Prinz.\n\n[[File:Vassily_Kandinsky,_1908_-_Houses_in_Munich.jpg|thumb|[[Vassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Houses in Munich'' (1908)]]\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Munich, and especially its suburb of [[Schwabing]], was the preeminent cultural metropolis of Germany. Its importance as a centre for both literature and the fine arts was second to none in Europe, with numerous German and non-German artists moving there. For example, [[Wassily Kandinsky]] chose Munich over Paris to study at the [[Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste M\u00fcnchen]], and, along with many other painters and writers living in Schwabing at that time, had a profound influence on [[modern art]].\n\nProminent literary figures worked in Munich especially during the final decades of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the so-called ''Prinzregentenzeit'' (literally \"prince regent's time\") under the reign of [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria]], a period often described as a cultural Golden Age for both Munich and Bavaria as a whole. Among them were luminaries such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Paul Johann Ludwig von Heyse|Paul Heyse]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Ludwig Thoma]], [[Fanny zu Reventlow]], [[Oskar Panizza]], [[Gustav Meyrink]], [[Max Halbe]], [[Erich M\u00fchsam]] and [[Frank Wedekind]]. For a short while, [[Vladimir Lenin]] lived in Schwabing, where he wrote and published his most important work, ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' Central to Schwabing's bohemian scene (although they were actually often located in the nearby Maxvorstadt quarter) were ''K\u00fcnstlerlokale'' (artist's caf\u00e9s) like [[Caf\u00e9 Stefanie]] or Kabarett [[Simpl (Munich)|Simpl]], whose liberal ways differed fundamentally from Munich's more traditional localities. The Simpl, which survives to this day (although with little relevance to the city's contemporary art scene), was named after Munich's anti-authoritarian satirical magazine ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', founded in 1896 by [[Albert Langen]] and [[Thomas Theodor Heine]], which quickly became an important organ of the ''Schwabinger Boh\u00e8me''. Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on [[Wilhelminism|Wilhelmine]] German society were the result of countless of collaborative efforts by many of the best visual artists and writers from Munich and elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Schrimpf_oskar_maria_graf.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Oskar Maria Graf]] by [[Georg Schrimpf]] (1927)]]\nThe period immediately before World War I saw continued economic and cultural prominence for the city. [[Thomas Mann]] wrote in his novella ''Gladius Dei'' about this period: \"M\u00fcnchen leuchtete\" (literally \"Munich shone\"). Munich remained a centre of cultural life during the Weimar period, with figures such as [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Peter Paul Althaus]], [[Stefan George]], [[Ricarda Huch]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]], [[Oskar Maria Graf]], [[Annette Kolb]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Klaus Mann]] adding to the already established big names. [[Karl Valentin]] was Germany's most important cabaret performer and comedian and is to this day well-remembered and beloved as a [[cultural icon]] of his hometown. Between 1910 and 1940, he wrote and performed in many absurdist sketches and short films that were highly influential, earning him the nickname of \"Charlie Chaplin of Germany\". Many of Valentin's works wouldn't be imaginable without his congenial female partner [[Liesl Karlstadt]], who often played male characters to hilarious effect in their sketches. After World War II, Munich soon again became a focal point of the German literary scene and remains so to this day, with writers as diverse as [[Wolfgang Koeppen]], [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], [[Eugen Roth]], [[Alfred Andersch]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], [[Michael Ende]], [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]], [[Gerhard Polt]], [[John Vincent Palatine]] and [[Patrick S\u00fcskind]] calling the city their home.\n\nFrom the Gothic to the Baroque era, the fine arts were represented in Munich by artists like [[Erasmus Grasser]], [[Jan Polack]], [[Johann Baptist Straub]], [[Ignaz G\u00fcnther]], [[Hans Krumpper]], [[Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler|Ludwig von Schwanthaler]], [[Cosmas Damian Asam]], [[Egid Quirin Asam]], [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], [[Johann Michael Fischer]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]]. Munich had already become an important place for painters like [[Carl Rottmann]], [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Wilhelm von Kaulbach]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Franz Stuck|Franz von Stuck]], [[Karl Piloty]] and [[Wilhelm Leibl]] when [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), a group of expressionist artists, was established in Munich in 1911. The city was home to the Blue Rider's painters [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]] and [[Alfred Kubin]]. Kandinsky's first abstract painting was created in Schwabing.\n\nMunich was (and in some cases, still is) home to many of the most important authors of the [[New German Cinema]] movement, including [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Edgar Reitz]] and [[Herbert Achternbusch]]. In 1971, the [[Filmverlag der Autoren]] was founded, cementing the city's role in the movement's history. Munich served as the location for many of Fassbinder's films, among them ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]''. The Hotel [[Deutsche Eiche]] near G\u00e4rtnerplatz was somewhat like a centre of operations for Fassbinder and his \"clan\" of actors. New German Cinema is considered by far the most important artistic movement in German cinema history since the era of [[German Expressionism]] in the 1920s.\n\n[[File:Bavaria_Film-_und_Fernsehstudios_logo.svg|thumb|Logo of [[Bavaria Film]]]]\nIn 1919, the [[Bavaria Film Studios]] were founded, which developed into one of Europe's largest film studios. Directors like [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Billy Wilder]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Huston]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Fritz Umgelter]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and [[Wim Wenders]] made films there. Among the internationally well-known films produced at the studios are ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925) by Alfred Hitchcock, ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963) by [[John Sturges]], ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) by Stanley Kubrick, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971) by [[Mel Stuart]] and both ''[[Das Boot]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Neverending Story (film)|The Neverending Story]]'' (1984) by [[Wolfgang Petersen]].

[[Helles]], a [[pale lager]] with a translucent gold colour is the most popular Munich beer today, although it's not old (only introduced in 1895) and is the result of a change in beer tastes. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, [[Dunkel|Dunkles]], which gets its colour from roasted malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century, but it is now more of a speciality. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with 6%\u20139% alcohol content. It is dark amber in colour and has a heavy malty taste. It is available and is sold particularly during the Lenten ''Starkbierzeit'' (strong beer season), which begins on or before St. Joseph's Day (19 March). The beer served at [[Oktoberfest]] is a special type of M\u00e4rzen beer with a higher alcohol content than regular Helles.\n[[File:Biergarten_at_Night_2.JPG|thumb|left|Beer garden in Munich]]\nThere are countless ''Wirtsh\u00e4user'' (traditional Bavarian ale houses/restaurants) all over the city area, many of which also have small outside areas. ''Bierg\u00e4rten'' ([[beer garden]]s) are popular fixtures of Munich's gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city's culture and serve as a kind of melting pot for members of all walks of life, for locals, expatriates and tourists alike. It is allowed to bring one's own food to a beer garden, however, it is forbidden to bring one's own drinks. There are many smaller beer gardens and around twenty major ones, providing at least a thousand seats, with four of the largest in the [[Englischer Garten]]: Chinesischer Turm (Munich's second largest beer garden with 7,000 seats), Seehaus, Hirschau and Aumeister. Nockherberg, Hofbr\u00e4ukeller (not to be confused with the [[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]]) and L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukeller are other beer gardens. Hirschgarten is the largest beer garden in the world, with 8,000 seats.\n\nThere are six main breweries in Munich: [[Augustiner-Br\u00e4u]], [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery|Hacker-Pschorr]], [[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus|Hofbr\u00e4u]], [[L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u]], [[Paulaner]] and [[Spaten-Franziskaner-Br\u00e4u]] (separate brands Spaten and Franziskaner, the latter of which mainly for Weissbier).\n\nAlso much consumed, though not from Munich and thus without the right to have a tent at the Oktoberfest, are [[Tegernseer]] and [[Schneider Weisse]], the latter of which has a major beer hall in Munich.  Smaller breweries are becoming more prevalent in Munich, such as [[Giesinger Br\u00e4u]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.giesinger-braeu.de|title=Giesinger Br\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen|website=Giesinger Br\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206065642/http://www.giesinger-braeu.de/|archive-date=6 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  However, these breweries do not have tents at Oktoberfest.\n\n===Circus===\nThe [[Circus Krone]] based in Munich is one of the largest circuses in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.munichfound.com/sightseeing/all_landmarks/circuskrone/ |title=Circus Krone: Europe's largest traditional circus |publisher=Munichfound.com |date=December 2005 |accessdate=1 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531021339/http://www.munichfound.com/sightseeing/all_landmarks/circuskrone/ |archive-date=31 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first and still is one of only a few in Western Europe to also occupy a [[Circus Krone Building|building]] of its own.\n\n===Nightlife===\n[[File:Alte Utting 6144.jpg|thumb|The party ship [[Alte Utting]]]]\n[[Nightlife]] in Munich is located mostly in the city centre ([[Altstadt-Lehel]]) and the boroughs [[Maxvorstadt]], [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]], [[Au-Haidhausen]] and [[Schwabing]]. Between [[Sendlinger Tor]] and [[Maximiliansplatz]] lies the so-called Feierbanane (party banana), a roughly banana-shaped unofficial party zone spanning {{convert|1.3|km|1|abbr=off}} along Sonnenstra\u00dfe, characterised by a high concentration of clubs, bars and restaurants. The Feierbanane has become the mainstream focus of Munich's nightlife and tends to become crowded, especially at weekends. It has also been the subject of some debate among city officials because of alcohol-related security issues and the party zone's general impact on local residents as well as day-time businesses.\n\n[[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]]'s two main quarters, G\u00e4rtnerplatzviertel and Glockenbachviertel, are both considered decidedly less mainstream than most other nightlife hotspots in the city and are renowned for their many hip and laid back bars and clubs as well as for being Munich's main centres of gay culture. On warm spring or summer nights, hundreds of young people gather at G\u00e4rtnerplatz to relax, talk with friends and drink beer.\n\n[[File:Bahnw\u00e4rter Thiel Nightclub Munich Subway Floor 1.jpg|thumb|[[Bahnw\u00e4rter Thiel]]]]\n[[Maxvorstadt]] has many smaller bars that are especially popular with university students, whereas [[Schwabing]], once Munich's first and foremost party district with legendary clubs such as Big Apple, PN, Domicile, Hot Club, Piper Club, Tiffany, Germany's first large-scale disco [[Blow Up (club)|Blow Up]] and the underwater nightclub Yellow Submarine,<ref name=\"mjunikdisco\">{{cite book |last1=Hecktor |first1=Mirko |last2=von Uslar |first2=Moritz |last3=Smith |first3=Patti |last4=Neumeister |first4=Andreas |date=1 November 2008 |title=Mjunik Disco \u2013 from 1949 to now|isbn=978-3936738476|language=de}}</ref> as well as many bars such as [[Schwabinger 7]] or Schwabinger Podium, has lost much of its nightlife activity in the last decades, mainly due to gentrification and the resulting high rents.

The system is supervised by the [[Munich Transport and Tariff Association]] (''M\u00fcnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung|GmbH]]''). The [[Munich tramway]] is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city, which has been in operation since 1876. Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines.\n\nThe extensive network of subway and tram lines assist and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre. The 700m-long Kaufinger Stra\u00dfe, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east\u2013west spine that traverses almost the entire centre. Similarly, Weinstra\u00dfe leads off northwards to the Hofgarten. These major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike. The transformation of the historic area into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes result from applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permability\"]], which selectively restricts the number of roads that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the [[Fused Grid]].\n\n====Munich Public Transportation Statistics====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min. 11% of public transit users, spend more than two hours travelling each day.

The growing number of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle lanes]] are widely used throughout the year. Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets, although the newer and/or renovated ones are much easier to tell apart from pavements than older ones. The cycle paths usually involve a longer route than by the road, as they are diverted around objects, and the presence of pedestrians can make them quite slow.\n\nA modern [[Call a Bike|bike hire system]] is available within the area bounded by the ''Mittlerer Ring''.\n\n===M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof===\n{{Main|M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof}}\n[[File:Morning Munich HB June 2014 - 2 (14181545380).jpg|thumb|Munich main railway station]]\n\n[[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof]] is the main [[railway station]] located in the city centre and is one of three long distance stations in Munich, the others being [[M\u00fcnchen Ost railway station|M\u00fcnchen Ost]] (to the east) and [[M\u00fcnchen-Pasing railway station|M\u00fcnchen-Pasing]] (to the west).

Traffic jams are commonplace during rush hour as well as at the beginning and end of major holidays in Germany. There are few \"green waves\" or roundabouts, and the city's prosperity often causes an abundance of obstructive construction sites. Other contributing factors are the extraordinarily high rates of car ownership per capita (multiple times that of Berlin), the city's historically grown and largely preserved centralised urban structure, which leads to a very high concentration of traffic in specific areas, and sometimes poor planning (for example bad traffic light synchronisation and a less than ideal ring road).\n\n===Munich International Airport===\n[[File:Flughafen turm.png|thumb|[[Munich Airport|Munich International Airport]] (MUC)]]\n[[Munich Airport|Franz Josef Strauss International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: MUC, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles de Gaulle]], [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankfurt]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Atat\u00fcrk International Airport|Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk]].

It derives from the monks of the [[Benedictine order]], who ran a monastery at the place that was later to become the Old Town of Munich; hence the monk depicted on [[Coat of arms of Munich|the city's coat of arms]].

In 1918, during the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|German Revolution]], the ruling [[house of Wittelsbach]], which had governed Bavaria since 1180, was forced to abdicate in Munich and a short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|socialist republic]] was declared.\n\nIn the 1920s, Munich became home to several political factions, among them the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]]. The first attempt of the Nazi movement to take over the German government in 1923 with the [[Feldherrnhalle|Beer Hall Putsch]] was stopped by the Bavarian police in Munich with gunfire. After the Nazis' rise to power, Munich was declared their \"Capital of the Movement\". During World War II, Munich was heavily bombed and more than 50% of the entire city and up to 90% of the historic centre were destroyed. After the end of postwar American occupation in 1949, there was a great increase in population and economic power during the years of ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'', or \"economic miracle\". Unlike many other German cities which were heavily bombed, Munich restored most of its traditional cityscape and hosted the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. The 1980s brought strong economic growth, high-tech industries and scientific institutions, and population growth. The city is home to major corporations like [[BMW]], [[Siemens]], [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[The Linde Group|Linde]], [[Allianz SE|Allianz]] and [[Munich Re|MunichRE]].\n\nMunich is home to many universities, museums and theatres.

The foundation date is not considered the year 1158, the date the city was first mentioned in a document. The document was signed in [[Augsburg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmf.bayern.de/ueber_uns/ausstellung_foyer/muenchner_pfennig/ |title=Ausstellung im Foyer |publisher=Stmf.bayern.de |accessdate=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306014325/http://www.stmf.bayern.de/ueber_uns/ausstellung_foyer/muenchner_pfennig/ |archivedate=6 March 2012 }}</ref> By then, the [[House of Welf|Guelph]] [[Henry the Lion]], [[Duchy of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]] and [[List of rulers of Bavaria|Bavaria]], had built a toll bridge over the river Isar next to the monk settlement and on the salt route. But as part of the archaeological excavations at Marienhof in advance of the expansion of the S-Bahn from 2012 shards of vessels from the eleventh century were found, which prove again that the settlement Munich must be older than their first documentary mention from 1158.\n\nIn 1175 Munich received city status and fortification. In 1180 with the trial of Henry the Lion, [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto I Wittelsbach]] became Duke of Bavaria, and Munich was handed to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Bishop of Freising]]. (Wittelsbach's heirs, the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach dynasty]], ruled Bavaria until 1918.) In 1240, Munich was transferred to [[Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto II Wittelsbach]] and in 1255, when the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was split in two, Munich became the ducal residence of [[Upper Bavaria]].\n\nDuke [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]], a native of Munich, was elected German king in 1314 and crowned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1328. He strengthened the city's position by granting it the salt monopoly, thus assuring it of additional income. In the late 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of [[gothic art]]s: the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest [[gothic architecture|gothic]] church \u2013 the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] \u2013 now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years, starting in 1468.\n\n===Capital of reunited Bavaria===\n[[File:Marcktzumuenchen.png|thumb|left|[[Marienplatz]], Munich about 1650]]\n[[File:Mun flags frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|upright|Banners with the colours of Munich (left) and Bavaria (right) with the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] in the background]]\n\nWhen Bavaria was reunited in 1506, Munich became its capital. The arts and politics became increasingly influenced by the court (see [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlando di Lasso]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]). During the 16th century, Munich was a centre of the German [[Counter-Reformation|counter reformation]], and also of [[renaissance]] arts. Duke [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Wilhelm V]] commissioned the Jesuit [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|Michaelskirche]], which became a centre for the counter-reformation, and also built the [[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]] for brewing brown beer in 1589. The [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] was founded in Munich in 1609.\n\nIn 1623, during the [[Thirty Years' War]], Munich became electoral residence when [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria]] was invested with the [[prince-elector|electoral dignity]], but in 1632 the city was occupied by [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolph of Sweden]]. When the [[bubonic plague]] broke out in 1634 and 1635, about one third of the population died. Under the regency of the Bavarian electors, Munich was an important centre of baroque life, but also had to suffer under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] occupations in 1704 and 1742.\n\nIn 1806 the city became the capital of the new [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], with the state's parliament (the ''[[Landtag]]'') and the new [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|archdiocese of Munich and Freising]] being located in the city. Twenty years later, [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Landshut University]] was moved to Munich. Many of the city's finest buildings belong to this period and were built under the first three Bavarian kings. Especially [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|Ludwig I]] rendered outstanding services to Munich's status as a centre of the arts, attracting numerous artists and enhancing the city's architectural substance with grand boulevards and buildings. On the other hand, [[Ludwig II of Bavaria|Ludwig II]], known the world over as the fairytale king, was mostly aloof from his capital and focused more on his fanciful castles in the Bavarian countryside. Nevertheless, his patronage of [[Richard Wagner]] secured his posthumous reputation, as do his castles, which still generate significant tourist income for Bavaria. Later, Prince Regent [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold]]'s years as regent were marked by tremendous artistic and cultural activity in Munich, enhancing its status as a cultural force of global importance (see [[Franz Stuck|Franz von Stuck]] and [[Der Blaue Reiter]]).\n\n===World War I to World War II===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_119-1486,_Hitler-Putsch,_M\u00fcnchen,_Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|Unrest during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]]]\n\nFollowing the outbreak of World War I in 1914, life in Munich became very difficult, as the Allied blockade of Germany led to food and fuel shortages. During French air raids in 1916, three bombs fell on Munich.\n\nAfter World War I, the city was at the centre of an substantial political unrest. In November 1918 on the eve of German revolution, [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|Ludwig III]] and his family fled the city. After the murder of the first republican [[List of Ministers-President of Bavaria|premier of Bavaria]] [[Kurt Eisner]] in February 1919 by [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley]], the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was proclaimed. When Communists took power, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], who had lived in Munich some years before, sent a congratulatory telegram, but the Soviet Republic was ended on 3 May 1919 by the [[Freikorps]]. While the republican government had been restored, Munich became a hotbed of extremist politics, among which [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] soon rose to prominence.\n\n[[File:wardamage2.jpg|thumb|Bombing damage to the Altstadt. Note the roofless and pockmarked Altes Rathaus looking up the Tal. The roofless [[Heiliggeistkirche (Munich)|Heilig-Geist-Kirche]] is on the right of the photo. Its spire, without the copper top, is behind the church. The [[Talburgtor|Talbruck gate tower]] is missing completely.]]\n\nIn 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters, who were concentrated in Munich, staged the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt to overthrow the [[Weimar Republic]] and seize power. The revolt failed, resulting in Hitler's arrest and the temporary crippling of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP). The city again became important to the Nazis when they took power in Germany in 1933. The party created its first [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} north-west of the city. Because of its importance to the rise of National Socialism, Munich was referred to as the ''Hauptstadt der Bewegung'' (\"Capital of the Movement\"). The NSDAP headquarters were in Munich and many ''F\u00fchrerbauten'' (\"''F\u00fchrer''-buildings\") were built around the [[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]], some of which still survive.\n\nThe city is known as the site of the culmination of the policy of [[Munich Agreement|appeasement]] by Britain and France leading up to World War II. It was in Munich that British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] assented to the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region into Greater Germany in the hopes of sating the desires of Hitler's [[Third Reich]].\n\nMunich was the base of the [[White Rose]], a student [[resistance movement]] from June 1942 to February 1943. The core members were arrested and executed following a distribution of leaflets in [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich University]] by Hans and Sophie Scholl.\n\nThe city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II by 71 air raids over five years.\n\n===Postwar===\nAfter US occupation in 1945, Munich was completely rebuilt following a meticulous plan, which preserved its pre-war street grid. In 1957, Munich's population surpassed one million. The city continued to play a highly significant role in the German economy, politics and culture, giving rise to its nickname ''Heimliche Hauptstadt'' (\"secret capital\") in the decades after World War II.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nMunich was the site of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], during which 11 [[Israel|Israeli]] athletes were murdered by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] terrorists in the [[Munich massacre]], when gunmen from the Palestinian \"[[Black September (group)|Black September]]\" group took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nMost Munich residents enjoy a high quality of life.

The warmest month, on average, is July. The coolest is January.\n\nShowers and thunderstorms bring the highest average monthly precipitation in late spring and throughout the summer. The most precipitation occurs in June, on average. Winter tends to have less precipitation, the least in February.\n\nThe higher elevation and proximity to the Alps cause the city to have more rain and snow than many other parts of Germany. The Alps affect the city's climate in other ways too; for example, the warm downhill wind from the Alps ([[f\u00f6hn wind]]), which can raise temperatures sharply within a few hours even in the winter.\n\nBeing at the centre of Europe, Munich is subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there are more variable than in other European cities, especially those further west and south of the Alps.\n\nAt Munich's official [[weather station]]s, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are {{convert|37.5|C|F|0}}, on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and {{convert|-31.6|C|F|1}}, on 12 February 1929 in Botanic Garden of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/Extremwertetafel2|title=Extremwertetafel (M\u00fcnchen-Riem)|website=SKlima.de|access-date=February 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sklima.de/datenbank/monat_extrem.php|title=Extremwertetafel (M\u00fcnchen-Botanischer Garten)|website=SKlima.de|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/Extremwertetafel|archive-date=February 12, 2019|url-status=|access-date=February 12, 2019}}</ref><!-- The archiving was done in addition to preserving the data facilitate access, since it only works by filling out the form of the site, without direct access to it.\nThe archived version was made in an upload version since this type of link would only return the form page and could be lost as often, see data from some Swiss stations. -->\n{{Weather box\n|location = Munich (Dreim\u00fchlenviertel), elevation: 515 m and 535 m, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1954\u2013present{{efn|Two meteorological stations are responsible for the climatological data so that they are interpolated.<ref>[ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_germany/climate/annual/kl/historical/jahreswerte_KL_03379_19550101_20171231_hist.zip Stationsgeschichte der Messger\u00e4te]{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|DWD]].

because historic buildings destroyed in World War II were reconstructed, and new landmarks were built. A survey by the Society's Centre for Sustainable Destinations for the [[National Geographic Traveller]] chose over 100 historic destinations around the world and ranked Munich 30th.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/historic-destinations-rated/list-text |title=Best 110 historic places worldwide |publisher=Traveler.nationalgeographic.com |accessdate=14 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027093556/http://traveler.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/historic-destinations-rated/list-text |archive-date=27 October 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Inner city===\nAt the centre of the city is the [[Marienplatz]] \u2013 a large open square named after the Mariens\u00e4ule, a [[Marian and Holy Trinity columns|Marian column]] in its centre \u2013 with the [[Old Town Hall, Munich|Old]] and the [[New Town Hall, Munich|New Town Hall]]. Its tower contains the [[Rathaus-Glockenspiel]]. Three gates of the demolished medieval fortification survive \u2013 the [[Isartor]] in the east, the [[Sendlinger Tor]] in the south and the [[Karlstor]] in the west of the inner city. The Karlstor leads up to the [[Karlsplatz (Stachus)|Stachus]], a square dominated by the [[Justizpalast (Munich)|Justizpalast]] (Palace of Justice) and a fountain.\n\nThe [[St. Peter's Church, Munich|Peterskirche]] close to Marienplatz is the oldest church of the inner city. It was first built during the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] period, and was the focus of the early monastic settlement in Munich before the city's official foundation in 1158. Nearby St. Peter the Gothic hall-church [[Heiliggeistkirche (Munich)|Heiliggeistkirche]] (The Church of the Holy Spirit) was converted to baroque style from 1724 onwards and looks down upon the [[Viktualienmarkt]].\n\nThe [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] serves as the cathedral for the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising]]. The nearby [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|Michaelskirche]] is the largest [[renaissance]] church north of the Alps, while the [[Theatine Church, Munich|Theatinerkirche]] is a [[basilica]] in Italianate high baroque, which had a major influence on Southern German [[baroque]] architecture. Its dome dominates the [[Odeonsplatz]]. Other baroque churches in the inner city include the [[B\u00fcrgersaalkirche (Munich)|B\u00fcrgersaalkirche]], the [[Trinity Church (Munich)|Trinity Church]] and the [[St. Anna Damenstiftskirche (Munich)|St. Anna Damenstiftskirche]]. The [[Asamkirche, Munich|Asamkirche]] was endowed and built by the Brothers [[Cosmas Damian Asam|Asam]], pioneering artists of the rococo period.\n\nThe large [[Munich Residenz|Residenz]] palace complex (begun in 1385) on the edge of Munich's Old Town, Germany's largest urban palace, ranks among Europe's most significant museums of interior decoration. Having undergone several extensions, it contains also the treasury and the splendid rococo [[Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre]]. Next door to the Residenz the neo-classical opera, the [[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]] was erected. Among the baroque and neoclassical mansions which still exist in Munich are the [[Palais Porcia]], the [[Palais Preysing]], the [[Palais Holnstein]] and the [[Prinz-Carl-Palais]]. All mansions are situated close to the Residenz, same as the [[Alter Hof|Alte Hof]], a medieval castle and first residence of the Wittelsbach dukes in Munich.\n\nLehel, a middle-class quarter east of the Altstadt, is characterised by numerous well-preserved townhouses. The [[Parish Church of St. Anna (Lehel, Munich)|St. Anna im Lehel]] is the first [[rococo]] church in Bavaria. [[St. Luke's Church, Munich|St. Lukas]] is the largest Protestant Church in Munich.\n\n===Royal avenues and squares===\n[[File:Ludwigstra\u00dfeMUC.jpg|thumb|[[Ludwigstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Ludwigstra\u00dfe]] from above, [[Highlight Towers]] in the background]]\n\nFour grand royal avenues of the 19th century with official buildings connect Munich's inner city with its then-suburbs:\n\nThe neoclassical [[Brienner Stra\u00dfe (Munich)|Brienner Stra\u00dfe]], starting at [[Odeonsplatz]] on the northern fringe of the Old Town close to the Residenz, runs from east to west and opens into the [[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]], designed with the \"[[Doric order|Doric]]\" [[Propylaea (Munich)|Propyl\u00e4en]], the \"[[Ionic order|Ionic]]\" [[Glyptothek]] and the \"[[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]\" [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen|State Museum of Classical Art]], behind it [[St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich|St. Boniface's Abbey]] was erected. The area around K\u00f6nigsplatz is home to the [[Kunstareal]], Munich's gallery and museum quarter (as described [[Munich#Museums|below]]).\n\n[[Ludwigstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Ludwigstra\u00dfe]] also begins at [[Odeonsplatz]] and runs from south to north, skirting the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t]], the [[Ludwigskirche (Munich)|St. Louis church]], the [[Bavarian State Library]] and numerous state ministries and palaces. The southern part of the avenue was constructed in Italian renaissance style, while the north is strongly influenced by Italian Romanesque architecture. The\n[[Siegestor]] (gate of victory) sits at the northern end of Ludwigstra\u00dfe, where the latter passes over into Leopoldstra\u00dfe and the district of [[Schwabing]] begins.\n[[File:K\u00f6nigsplatz - Propyl\u00e4en und Glyptothek.jpg|thumb|[[K\u00f6nigsplatz, Munich|K\u00f6nigsplatz]]]]\n\nThe neo-Gothic [[Maximilianstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Maximilianstra\u00dfe]] starts at [[Max-Joseph-Platz]], where the Residenz and the National Theatre are situated, and runs from west to east. The avenue is framed by elaborately structured neo-Gothic buildings which house, among others, the [[Munich Kammerspiele|Schauspielhaus]], the Building of the district government of Upper Bavaria and the [[State Museum of Ethnology|Museum of Ethnology]]. After crossing the river Isar, the avenue circles the [[Maximilianeum]], which houses the [[Landtag of Bavaria|state parliament]]. The western portion of Maximilianstra\u00dfe is known for its designer shops, luxury boutiques, jewellery stores, and one of Munich's foremost five-star hotels, the Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten.\n\n[[Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe (Munich)|Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe]] runs parallel to Maximilianstra\u00dfe and begins at [[Prinz-Carl-Palais]]. Many museums are on the avenue, such as the [[Haus der Kunst]], the [[Bavarian National Museum]] and the [[Schackgalerie]]. The avenue crosses the Isar and circles the [[Angel of Peace|Friedensengel]] monument, then passing the [[Villa Stuck]] and Hitler's old apartment. The [[Prinzregententheater]] is at Prinzregentenplatz further to the east.\n\n===Other boroughs===\n[[File:Leopoldstra\u00dfe_153_(M\u00fcnchen-Schwabing).JPG|thumb|Building in Schwabing]]\nIn [[Schwabing]] and [[Maxvorstadt]], many beautiful streets with continuous rows of [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] buildings can be found. Rows of elegant town houses and spectacular urban palais in many colours, often elaborately decorated with ornamental details on their fa\u00e7ades, make up large parts of the areas west of [[Leopoldstra\u00dfe]] (Schwabing's main shopping street), while in the eastern areas between Leopoldstra\u00dfe and [[Englischer Garten]] similar buildings alternate with almost rural-looking houses and whimsical mini-castles, often decorated with small towers. Numerous tiny alleys and shady lanes connect the larger streets and little plazas of the area, conveying the legendary artist's quarter's flair and atmosphere convincingly like it was at the turn of the 20th century. The wealthy district of [[Bogenhausen]] in the east of Munich is another little-known area (at least among tourists) rich in extravagant architecture, especially around Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe. One of Bogenhausen's most beautiful buildings is [[Villa Stuck]], famed residence of painter [[Franz von Stuck]].\n[[File:Image-Schloss Nymphenburg Munich CC edit3.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Nymphenburg Palace]]]]\nTwo large baroque palaces in [[Nymphenburg]] and [[Oberschleissheim]] are reminders of Bavaria's royal past. Schloss Nymphenburg ([[Nymphenburg Palace]]), some {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} north west of the city centre, is surrounded by an park and is considered{{by whom|date=December 2019}} to be one of Europe's most beautiful royal residences. {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Nymphenburg Palace is Schloss Blutenburg ([[Blutenburg Castle]]), an old ducal country seat with a late-Gothic palace church. Schloss F\u00fcrstenried ([[F\u00fcrstenried Palace]]), a baroque palace of similar structure to Nymphenburg but of much smaller size, was erected around the same time in the south west of Munich.\n\n[[File:Schloss oberschleissheim-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|325x325px|[[Schleissheim Palace]]]]\n\nThe second large baroque residence is Schloss Schleissheim ([[Schleissheim Palace]]), located in the suburb of [[Oberschlei\u00dfheim|Oberschleissheim]], a palace complex encompassing three separate residences: Altes Schloss Schleissheim (the old palace), Neues Schloss Schleissheim (the new palace) and Schloss Lustheim (Lustheim Palace). Most parts of the palace complex serve as museums and art galleries. [[Deutsches Museum]]'s Flugwerft Schleissheim flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleissheim Special Landing Field. The [[Bavaria statue]] before the neo-classical [[Ruhmeshalle (Munich)|Ruhmeshalle]] is a monumental, bronze sand-cast 19th-century statue at [[Theresienwiese]]. The [[Gr\u00fcnwald castle]] is the only medieval castle in the Munich area which still exists.\n[[File:BMW Vierzylinder Tower Munich 2014 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[BMW Headquarters]]]]\n\n[[St Michael in Berg am Laim (Munich)|St Michael in Berg am Laim]] is a church in the suburbs. Another church of [[Johann Michael Fischer]] is St George in Bogenhausen. Most of the boroughs have parish churches which originate from the Middle Ages, such as the church of pilgrimage [[St. Mary's Church, Ramersdorf|St Mary in Ramersdorf]]. The oldest church within the city borders is [[Holy Cross Church, Munich|Heilig Kreuz]] in Fr\u00f6ttmaning next to the Allianz-Arena, known for its Romanesque fresco.\n\nEspecially in its suburbs, Munich features a wide and diverse array of modern architecture, although strict culturally sensitive height limitations for buildings have limited the construction of skyscrapers to avoid a loss of views to the distant Bavarian Alps. Most high-rise buildings are clustered at the northern edge of Munich in the skyline, like the [[Hypo-Haus]], the [[Arabella High-Rise Building]], the [[Highlight Towers]], [[Uptown Munich]], M\u00fcnchner Tor and the [[BMW Headquarters]] next to the [[Olympiapark (Munich)|Olympic Park]]. Several other high-rise buildings are located near the city centre and on the [[Siemens]] campus in southern Munich. A landmark of modern Munich is also the architecture of the sport stadiums (as described [[Munich#Sports|below]]).\n\nIn Fasangarten is the former [[McGraw Kaserne]], a former US army base, near [[Stadelheim Prison]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Parks===\n[[File:M\u00fcnchen Hofgartentempel.jpg|thumb|Hofgarten with the dome of the state chancellery near the [[Munich Residenz|Residenz]]]]\nMunich is a densely-built city but still offers numerous public parks. The [[Englischer Garten]], close to the city centre and covering an area of {{convert|3.7|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}} is larger than Central Park in New York City, is one of the world's largest urban public parks. It contains a [[Naturism|naturist]] (nudist) area, numerous bicycle and jogging tracks as well as bridle-paths. It was designed and laid out by [[Benjamin Thompson]], Count of Rumford, for both pleasure and as a work area for the city's vagrants and homeless. Nowadays it is entirely a park, its southern half being dominated by wide open areas, hills, monuments and beach-like stretches (along the streams Eisbach and Schwabinger Bach). In contrast, its less-frequented northern part is much quieter, with many old trees and thick undergrowth. Multiple [[Beer garden|Biergartens]] can be found in both parts of the Englischer Garten, the most well known being located at the [[Englischer Garten#Chinese Tower|Chinese Pagoda]].\n\nOther large green spaces are the modern [[Olympiapark, Munich|Olympiapark]], [[Westpark (Munich)|Westpark]], and the parks of [[Nymphenburg Palace]] (with the [[Botanischer Garten M\u00fcnchen-Nymphenburg]] to the north), and [[Schleissheim Palace]]. The city's oldest park is the [[Hofgarten (Munich)|Hofgarten]], near the Residenz, dating back to the 16th century. The site of the largest beergarden in town, the former royal Hirschgarten was founded in 1780 for deer, which still live there.\n\nThe city's [[zoo]] is the [[Tierpark Hellabrunn]] near the Flaucher Island in the Isar in the south of the city. Another notable park is [[Ostpark (Munich)|Ostpark]] located in the [[Ramersdorf-Perlach]] borough which also houses the Michaelibad, the largest waterpark in Munich.\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sport in Munich|}}\n[[File:Allianz Arena zu verschiedenen Zeiten.jpg|thumb|[[Allianz Arena]], the home stadium of [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]]]\n[[File:M\u00fcnchen - Olympische Bauten.jpg|thumb|Olympiasee in Olympiapark, Munich]]\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|Football in Munich}}\nMunich is home to several professional [[Association football|football]] teams including [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], Germany's most successful club and a multiple [[UEFA Champions League]] winner. Other notable clubs include [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]], who were long time their rivals on a somewhat equal footing, but currently play in the 3rd Division [[3.

Three redundant exhibition buildings that are under a protection order were converted to house the Verkehrsmuseum, which houses the land transport collections of the Deutsches Museum. Deutsches Museum's Flugwerft Schleissheim flight exhibition centre is located nearby, on the Schleissheim Special Landing Field. Several non-centralised museums (many of those are public collections at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t) show the expanded state collections of [[Pal\u00e4ontologisches Museum M\u00fcnchen|palaeontology]], geology, [[mineralogy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~Mineralogische.Staatssammlung/ |title=Museum Reich der Kristalle M\u00fcnchen |publisher=Lrz-muenchen.de |accessdate=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415161904/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~Mineralogische.Staatssammlung/ |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}</ref> [[Zoologische Staatssammlung M\u00fcnchen|zoology]], botany and anthropology.\n\nThe city has several important [[art museum|art galleries]], most of which can be found in the [[Kunstareal]], including the [[Alte Pinakothek]], the [[Neue Pinakothek]], the [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] and the [[Museum Brandhorst]]. The Alte Pinakothek contains a treasure trove of the works of European masters between the 14th and 18th centuries. The collection reflects the eclectic tastes of the Wittelsbachs over four centuries, and is sorted by schools over two floors. Major displays include [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s Christ-like [[Self-Portrait (D\u00fcrer, Munich)|''Self-Portrait'' (1500)]], his ''[[The Four Apostles|Four Apostles]]'', [[Raphael]]'s paintings'' [[Canigiani Holy Family (Raphael)|The Canigiani Holy Family]]'' and'' [[Tempi Madonna (Raphael)|Madonna Tempi]]'' as well as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] large ''Judgment Day''. The gallery houses one of the world's most comprehensive Rubens collections. The [[Lenbachhaus]] houses works by the group of Munich-based modernist artists known as [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider). \n[[File:BMW Welt, M\u00fanich, Alemania16.jpg|thumbnail| [[BMW Welt]] ]]\nAn important collection of Greek and Roman art is held in the [[Glyptothek]] and the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen|Staatliche Antikensammlung]] (State Antiquities Collection). King Ludwig I managed to acquire such pieces as the [[Medusa Rondanini]], the [[Barberini Faun]] and figures from the [[Temple of Aphaea]] on [[Aegina]] for the Glyptothek. Another important museum in the [[Kunstareal]] is the [[Staatliche Sammlung f\u00fcr \u00c4gyptische Kunst|Egyptian Museum]].\n\nThe gothic [[Morris dance]]rs of [[Erasmus Grasser]] are exhibited in the [[Munich Stadtmuseum|Munich City Museum]] in the old gothic arsenal building in the inner city.\n\nAnother area for the arts next to the Kunstareal is the [[Altstadt-Lehel|Lehel]] quarter between the old town and the river Isar: the [[Museum Five Continents]] in Maximilianstra\u00dfe is the second largest collection in Germany of artefacts and objects from outside Europe, while the [[Bavarian National Museum]] and the adjoining [[Bavarian State Archaeological Collection]] in Prinzregentenstra\u00dfe rank among Europe's major art and cultural history museums. The nearby [[Schackgalerie]] is an important gallery of German 19th-century paintings.\n\nThe former [[Dachau concentration camp]] is {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} outside the city.\n\n===Arts and literature===\n[[File:Nationaltheater M\u00fcnchen 2.jpg|thumb|[[National Theatre Munich|National Theatre]]]]\nMunich is a major international cultural centre and has played host to many prominent composers including [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlando di Lasso]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W.A. Mozart]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Max Reger]] and [[Carl Orff]]. With the [[Munich Biennale]] founded by [[Hans Werner Henze]], and the ''[[A*Devantgarde|A*DEvantgarde]]'' festival, the city still contributes to modern music theatre. Some of classical music's best-known pieces have been created in and around Munich by composers born in the area, for example Richard Strauss's tone poem ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' or Carl Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana]]''.\n\nAt the [[National Theatre Munich|Nationaltheater]] several of [[Richard Wagner]]'s operas were premiered under the patronage of [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]]. It is the home of the [[Bavarian State Opera]] and the [[Bavarian State Orchestra]]. Next door, the modern [[Residenz Theatre]] was erected in the building that had housed the [[Cuvilli\u00e9s Theatre]] before World War II. Many operas were staged there, including the premiere of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Idomeneo]]'' in 1781. The [[Staatstheater am G\u00e4rtnerplatz|G\u00e4rtnerplatz Theatre]] is a ballet and musical state theatre while another opera house, the [[Prinzregententheater]], has become the home of the Bavarian Theatre Academy and the [[Munich Chamber Orchestra]].\n\n[[File:Gasteig_Philharmonie_14.jpg|thumb|[[Gasteig]]]]\nThe modern [[Gasteig]] centre houses the [[Munich Philharmonic|Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The third orchestra in Munich with international importance is the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]]. Its primary concert venue is the Herkulessaal in the former city royal residence, the [[Munich Residenz]]. Many important conductors have been attracted by the city's orchestras, including [[Felix Weingartner]], [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Hans Rosbaud]], [[Hans Knappertsbusch]], [[Sergiu Celibidache]], [[James Levine]], [[Christian Thielemann]], [[Lorin Maazel]], [[Rafael Kubel\u00edk]], [[Eugen Jochum]], Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Mariss Jansons]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Georg Solti]], [[Zubin Mehta]] and [[Kent Nagano]]. A stage for shows, big events and musicals is the [[Deutsches Theater M\u00fcnchen|Deutsche Theater]]. It is Germany's largest theatre for guest performances.\n[[File:FriedensengelMunchen.JPG|thumb|The Golden Friedensengel]]\n\nMunich's contributions to modern popular music are often overlooked in favour of its strong association with classical music, but they are numerous: the city has had a strong music scene in the 1960s and 1970s, with many internationally renowned bands and musicians frequently performing in its clubs. Furthermore, Munich was the centre of [[Krautrock]] in southern Germany, with many important bands such as [[Amon D\u00fc\u00fcl II]], [[Embryo (band)|Embryo]] or [[Popol Vuh (band)|Popol Vuh]] hailing from the city. In the 1970s, the [[Musicland Studios]] developed into one of the most prominent recording studios in the world, with bands such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Deep Purple]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]] recording albums there. Munich also played a significant role in the development of electronic music, with genre pioneer [[Giorgio Moroder]], who invented [[synth]] [[disco]] and [[electronic dance music]], and [[Donna Summer]], one of disco music's most important performers, both living and working in the city. In the late 1990s, [[Electroclash]] was substantially co-invented if not even invented in Munich, when [[DJ Hell]] introduced and assembled international pioneers of this musical genre through his [[International DeeJay Gigolo Records]] label here.<ref name=\"mjunikdisco\"/> Other examples of notable musicians and bands from Munich are [[Konstantin Wecker]], [[:de:Willy Astor|Willy Astor]], [[Spider Murphy Gang]], [[M\u00fcnchener Freiheit]], [[Lou Bega]], [[Megaherz]], [[FSK (band)|FSK]], [[Colour Haze]] and [[Sportfreunde Stiller]].\n\nMusic is so important in the Bavarian capital that the city hall gives permissions every day to ten musicians for performing in the streets around Marienplatz. This is how performers such as [[Olga Kholodnaya]] and [[Alex Jacobowitz]] are entertaining the locals and the tourists every day.\n\nNext to the Bavarian Staatsschauspiel in the Residenz Theatre (Residenztheater), the [[Munich Kammerspiele]] in the Schauspielhaus is one of the most important German language theatres in the world. Since [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s premieres in 1775 many important writers have staged their plays in Munich such as [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]].\n\nThe city is known as the second largest publishing centre in the world (around 250 publishing houses have offices in the city), and many national and international publications are published in Munich, such as Arts in Munich, LAXMag and Prinz.\n\n[[File:Vassily_Kandinsky,_1908_-_Houses_in_Munich.jpg|thumb|[[Vassily Kandinsky]]'s ''Houses in Munich'' (1908)]]\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Munich, and especially its suburb of [[Schwabing]], was the preeminent cultural metropolis of Germany. Its importance as a centre for both literature and the fine arts was second to none in Europe, with numerous German and non-German artists moving there. For example, [[Wassily Kandinsky]] chose Munich over Paris to study at the [[Akademie der Bildenden K\u00fcnste M\u00fcnchen]], and, along with many other painters and writers living in Schwabing at that time, had a profound influence on [[modern art]].\n\nProminent literary figures worked in Munich especially during the final decades of the Kingdom of Bavaria, the so-called ''Prinzregentenzeit'' (literally \"prince regent's time\") under the reign of [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria]], a period often described as a cultural Golden Age for both Munich and Bavaria as a whole. Among them were luminaries such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Heinrich Mann]], [[Paul Johann Ludwig von Heyse|Paul Heyse]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Ludwig Thoma]], [[Fanny zu Reventlow]], [[Oskar Panizza]], [[Gustav Meyrink]], [[Max Halbe]], [[Erich M\u00fchsam]] and [[Frank Wedekind]]. For a short while, [[Vladimir Lenin]] lived in Schwabing, where he wrote and published his most important work, ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' Central to Schwabing's bohemian scene (although they were actually often located in the nearby Maxvorstadt quarter) were ''K\u00fcnstlerlokale'' (artist's caf\u00e9s) like [[Caf\u00e9 Stefanie]] or Kabarett [[Simpl]], whose liberal ways differed fundamentally from Munich's more traditional localities. The Simpl, which survives to this day (although with little relevance to the city's contemporary art scene), was named after Munich's anti-authoritarian satirical magazine ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', founded in 1896 by [[Albert Langen]] and [[Thomas Theodor Heine]], which quickly became an important organ of the ''Schwabinger Boh\u00e8me''. Its caricatures and biting satirical attacks on [[Wilhelminism|Wilhelmine]] German society were the result of countless of collaborative efforts by many of the best visual artists and writers from Munich and elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Schrimpf_oskar_maria_graf.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Oskar Maria Graf]] by [[Georg Schrimpf]] (1927)]]\nThe period immediately before World War I saw continued economic and cultural prominence for the city. [[Thomas Mann]] wrote in his novella ''Gladius Dei'' about this period: \"M\u00fcnchen leuchtete\" (literally \"Munich shone\"). Munich remained a centre of cultural life during the Weimar period, with figures such as [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Peter Paul Althaus]], [[Stefan George]], [[Ricarda Huch]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]], [[Oskar Maria Graf]], [[Annette Kolb]], [[Ernst Toller]], [[Hugo Ball]] and [[Klaus Mann]] adding to the already established big names. [[Karl Valentin]] was Germany's most important cabaret performer and comedian and is to this day well-remembered and beloved as a [[cultural icon]] of his hometown. Between 1910 and 1940, he wrote and performed in many absurdist sketches and short films that were highly influential, earning him the nickname of \"Charlie Chaplin of Germany\". Many of Valentin's works wouldn't be imaginable without his congenial female partner [[Liesl Karlstadt]], who often played male characters to hilarious effect in their sketches. After World War II, Munich soon again became a focal point of the German literary scene and remains so to this day, with writers as diverse as [[Wolfgang Koeppen]], [[Erich K\u00e4stner]], [[Eugen Roth]], [[Alfred Andersch]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]], [[Michael Ende]], [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]], [[Gerhard Polt]], [[John Vincent Palatine]] and [[Patrick S\u00fcskind]] calling the city their home.\n\nFrom the Gothic to the Baroque era, the fine arts were represented in Munich by artists like [[Erasmus Grasser]], [[Jan Polack]], [[Johann Baptist Straub]], [[Ignaz G\u00fcnther]], [[Hans Krumpper]], [[Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler|Ludwig von Schwanthaler]], [[Cosmas Damian Asam]], [[Egid Quirin Asam]], [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], [[Johann Michael Fischer]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]]. Munich had already become an important place for painters like [[Carl Rottmann]], [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Wilhelm von Kaulbach]], [[Carl Spitzweg]], [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Franz Stuck|Franz von Stuck]], [[Karl Piloty]] and [[Wilhelm Leibl]] when [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), a group of expressionist artists, was established in Munich in 1911. The city was home to the Blue Rider's painters [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]] and [[Alfred Kubin]]. Kandinsky's first abstract painting was created in Schwabing.\n\nMunich was (and in some cases, still is) home to many of the most important authors of the [[New German Cinema]] movement, including [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Edgar Reitz]] and [[Herbert Achternbusch]]. In 1971, the [[Filmverlag der Autoren]] was founded, cementing the city's role in the movement's history. Munich served as the location for many of Fassbinder's films, among them ''[[Ali: Fear Eats the Soul]]''. The Hotel [[Deutsche Eiche]] near G\u00e4rtnerplatz was somewhat like a centre of operations for Fassbinder and his \"clan\" of actors. New German Cinema is considered by far the most important artistic movement in German cinema history since the era of [[German Expressionism]] in the 1920s.\n\n[[File:Bavaria_Film-_und_Fernsehstudios_logo.svg|thumb|Logo of [[Bavaria Film]]]]\nIn 1919, the [[Bavaria Film Studios]] were founded, which developed into one of Europe's largest film studios. Directors like [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Billy Wilder]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Huston]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Fritz Umgelter]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and [[Wim Wenders]] made films there. Among the internationally well-known films produced at the studios are ''[[The Pleasure Garden (1925 film)|The Pleasure Garden]]'' (1925) by Alfred Hitchcock, ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963) by [[John Sturges]], ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957) by Stanley Kubrick, ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (1971) by [[Mel Stuart]] and both ''[[Das Boot]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Neverending Story (film)|The Neverending Story]]'' (1984) by [[Wolfgang Petersen]]. Munich remains one of the centres of the German film and entertainment industry.\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:Hippodrom Zelt Oktoberfest.jpg|thumb|[[Oktoberfest]]]]\nAnnual \"[[High End]] Munich\" trade show.<ref>[https://www.highendsociety.de/high-end-44.html HIGH END Munich] - HIGH END Society</ref>\n\n====Starkbierfest====\nMarch and April, city-wide:<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.inside-munich.com/munich-festivals.html|title=Munich Festivals|last=Zimmermann|first=Marion Kummerow, Tobias|website=www.inside-munich.com|access-date=2019-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331084540/http://www.inside-munich.com/munich-festivals.html|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Starkbierfest is held for three weeks during [[Lent]], between [[Carnival]] and [[Easter]],<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://paulaner-nockherberg.com/strong-beer-festival/|title=Strong Beer Festival|website=Paulaner-Nockherberg|access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref> celebrating Munich's \u201cstrong [[beer]]\u201d.

M\u00fcnchner [[Weisswurst]] (\"white sausage\") was invented here in 1857. It is a Munich speciality. Traditionally eaten only before noon \u2013 a tradition dating to a time before refrigerators \u2013 these morsels are often served with [[sweet mustard]] and freshly baked [[pretzel]]s.\n\n===Beers and breweries===\n[[File:BIER IM EG.jpg|thumb|left|[[Helles]] beer]]\n[[File:MUC Westend AugustinerbrauereiA.jpg|thumb|[[Augustiner-Br\u00e4u|Augustiner brewery]]]]\nMunich is known for its breweries and the ''[[Weissbier]]'' (or ''Wei\u00dfbier'' / ''Weizenbier'', wheat beer) is a speciality from Bavaria. [[Helles]], a [[pale lager]] with a translucent gold colour is the most popular Munich beer today, although it's not old (only introduced in 1895) and is the result of a change in beer tastes. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, [[Dunkel|Dunkles]], which gets its colour from roasted malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century, but it is now more of a speciality. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, with 6%\u20139% alcohol content. It is dark amber in colour and has a heavy malty taste. It is available and is sold particularly during the Lenten ''Starkbierzeit'' (strong beer season), which begins on or before St. Joseph's Day (19 March). The beer served at [[Oktoberfest]] is a special type of M\u00e4rzen beer with a higher alcohol content than regular Helles.\n[[File:Biergarten_at_Night_2.JPG|thumb|left|Beer garden in Munich]]\nThere are countless ''Wirtsh\u00e4user'' (traditional Bavarian ale houses/restaurants) all over the city area, many of which also have small outside areas. ''Bierg\u00e4rten'' ([[beer garden]]s) are popular fixtures of Munich's gastronomic landscape. They are central to the city's culture and serve as a kind of melting pot for members of all walks of life, for locals, expatriates and tourists alike. It is allowed to bring one's own food to a beer garden, however, it is forbidden to bring one's own drinks. There are many smaller beer gardens and around twenty major ones, providing at least a thousand seats, with four of the largest in the [[Englischer Garten]]: Chinesischer Turm (Munich's second largest beer garden with 7,000 seats), Seehaus, Hirschau and Aumeister. Nockherberg, Hofbr\u00e4ukeller (not to be confused with the [[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]]) and L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukeller are other beer gardens. Hirschgarten is the largest beer garden in the world, with 8,000 seats.\n\nThere are six main breweries in Munich: [[Augustiner-Br\u00e4u]], [[Hacker-Pschorr Brewery|Hacker-Pschorr]], [[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus|Hofbr\u00e4u]], [[L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u]], [[Paulaner]] and [[Spaten-Franziskaner-Br\u00e4u]] (separate brands Spaten and Franziskaner, the latter of which mainly for Weissbier).\n\nAlso much consumed, though not from Munich and thus without the right to have a tent at the Oktoberfest, are [[Tegernseer]] and [[Schneider Weisse]], the latter of which has a major beer hall in Munich.  Smaller breweries are becoming more prevalent in Munich, such as [[Giesinger Br\u00e4u]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.giesinger-braeu.de|title=Giesinger Br\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen|website=Giesinger Br\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190206065642/http://www.giesinger-braeu.de/|archive-date=6 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>  However, these breweries do not have tents at Oktoberfest.\n\n===Circus===\nThe [[Circus Krone]] based in Munich is one of the largest circuses in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.munichfound.com/sightseeing/all_landmarks/circuskrone/ |title=Circus Krone: Europe's largest traditional circus |publisher=Munichfound.com |date=December 2005 |accessdate=1 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531021339/http://www.munichfound.com/sightseeing/all_landmarks/circuskrone/ |archive-date=31 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first and still is one of only a few in Western Europe to also occupy a [[Circus Krone Building|building]] of its own.\n\n===Nightlife===\n[[File:Alte Utting 6144.jpg|thumb|The party ship [[Alte Utting]]]]\n[[Nightlife]] in Munich is located mostly in the city centre ([[Altstadt-Lehel]]) and the boroughs [[Maxvorstadt]], [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]], [[Au-Haidhausen]] and [[Schwabing]]. Between [[Sendlinger Tor]] and [[Maximiliansplatz]] lies the so-called Feierbanane (party banana), a roughly banana-shaped unofficial party zone spanning {{convert|1.3|km|1|abbr=off}} along Sonnenstra\u00dfe, characterised by a high concentration of clubs, bars and restaurants. The Feierbanane has become the mainstream focus of Munich's nightlife and tends to become crowded, especially at weekends. It has also been the subject of some debate among city officials because of alcohol-related security issues and the party zone's general impact on local residents as well as day-time businesses.\n\n[[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]]'s two main quarters, G\u00e4rtnerplatzviertel and Glockenbachviertel, are both considered decidedly less mainstream than most other nightlife hotspots in the city and are renowned for their many hip and laid back bars and clubs as well as for being Munich's main centres of gay culture. On warm spring or summer nights, hundreds of young people gather at G\u00e4rtnerplatz to relax, talk with friends and drink beer.\n\n[[File:Bahnw\u00e4rter Thiel Nightclub Munich Subway Floor 1.jpg|thumb|[[Bahnw\u00e4rter Thiel]]]]\n[[Maxvorstadt]] has many smaller bars that are especially popular with university students, whereas [[Schwabing]], once Munich's first and foremost party district with legendary clubs such as Big Apple, PN, Domicile, Hot Club, Piper Club, Tiffany, Germany's first large-scale disco [[Blow Up (club)|Blow Up]] and the underwater nightclub Yellow Submarine,<ref name=\"mjunikdisco\">{{cite book |last1=Hecktor |first1=Mirko |last2=von Uslar |first2=Moritz |last3=Smith |first3=Patti |last4=Neumeister |first4=Andreas |date=1 November 2008 |title=Mjunik Disco \u2013 from 1949 to now|isbn=978-3936738476|language=de}}</ref> as well as many bars such as [[Schwabinger 7]] or Schwabinger Podium, has lost much of its nightlife activity in the last decades, mainly due to gentrification and the resulting high rents. It has become the city's most coveted and expensive residential district, attracting affluent citizens with little interest in partying.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, the Kunstpark Ost and its successor Kultfabrik, a former industrial complex that was converted to a large party area near [[M\u00fcnchen Ostbahnhof]] in [[Berg am Laim]], hosted more than 30 clubs and was especially popular among younger people and residents of the metropolitan area surrounding Munich.<ref name=\"munichfoundcom\">{{cite web|title=Corpus Techno: The music of the future will soon be history|url=http://www.munichfound.com/archives/id/27/article/496/|publisher=MUNICHfound.com|accessdate=5 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206184555/http://www.munichfound.com/archives/id/27/article/496/|archive-date=6 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The Kultfabrik was closed at the end of the year 2015 to convert the area into a residential and office area.

Before the Kunstpark Ost, there had already been an accumulation of internationally known nightclubs in the remains of the abandoned former [[Munich-Riem Airport#Reuse|Munich-Riem Airport]].\n\nMunich nightlife tends to change dramatically and quickly. Establishments open and close every year, and due to gentrification and the overheated housing market many survive only a few years, while others last longer. Beyond the already mentioned venues of the 1960s and 1970s, nightclubs with international recognition in recent history included Tanzlokal Gr\u00f6\u00dfenwahn, Atomic Cafe and the techno clubs Babalu, [[Ultraschall]], {{nowrap|[[KW \u2013 Das Heizkraftwerk]]}}, {{nowrap|Natraj Temple}} and {{nowrap|[[MMA Club|MMA Club (Mixed Munich Arts)]]}}.<ref name=\"zeitmagazin\">{{cite web |first=Paulina |last=Thillmann |url=https://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2017/49/technoclubs-schliessung-bundeslaender-deutschlandkarte |title=Deutschlandkarte: Legend\u00e4re Clubs |trans-title=Germany map: legendary clubs |publisher=[[Die Zeit|Zeitmagazin]] |date=29 November 2017 |access-date=20 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411005217/http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2017/49/technoclubs-schliessung-bundeslaender-deutschlandkarte |archive-date=11 April 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> From 1995 to 2001, Munich was also home to the [[Union Move]], one of the largest [[technoparade]]s in Germany.\n\n[[File:Blitz Club Munich.jpg|thumb|[[Blitz Club]]]]\nMunich has two directly connected gay quarters, which basically can be seen as one: G\u00e4rtnerplatzviertel and Glockenbachviertel, both part of the [[Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt]] district.

The Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) and the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TU or TUM), were two of the first three German universities to be awarded the title ''elite university'' by a selection committee composed of academics and members of the Ministries of Education and Research of the Federation and the German states (L\u00e4nder).

[[Flixmobility]] which offers intercity coach service is headquartered in Munich.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:Verkehrsnetz M\u00fcnchen.png|thumb|left|360px|Public transport network]]\n[[File:Westfriedhof zentral.JPG|thumb|[[Westfriedhof (Munich U-Bahn)|Westfriedhof platform]] of the [[Munich U-Bahn]]]]\n[[File:S-bahn-muenchen.jpg|thumb|[[Munich S-Bahn|Munich's S-Bahn]] at the [[Munich Marienplatz station|Marienplatz station]]]]\n\nFor its urban population of 2.6&nbsp;million people, Munich and its closest suburbs have a comprehensive network of public transport incorporating the [[Munich U-Bahn|Munich U-Bahn (underground railway)]], the [[Munich S-Bahn|Munich S-Bahn (suburban trains)]], trams and buses. The system is supervised by the [[Munich Transport and Tariff Association]] (''M\u00fcnchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung|GmbH]]''). The [[Munich tramway]] is the oldest existing public transportation system in the city, which has been in operation since 1876. Munich also has an extensive network of bus lines.\n\nThe extensive network of subway and tram lines assist and complement pedestrian movement in the city centre. The 700m-long Kaufinger Stra\u00dfe, which starts near the Main train station, forms a pedestrian east\u2013west spine that traverses almost the entire centre. Similarly, Weinstra\u00dfe leads off northwards to the Hofgarten. These major spines and many smaller streets cover an extensive area of the centre that can be enjoyed on foot and bike. The transformation of the historic area into a pedestrian priority zone enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes result from applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|\"filtered permability\"]], which selectively restricts the number of roads that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths, which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip (see image). The logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts \u2013 the [[Fused Grid]].\n\n====Munich Public Transportation Statistics====\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting to and from work with public transit in Munich on a weekday is 56 min. 11% of public transit users, spend more than two hours travelling each day.

The growing number of [[Segregated cycle facilities|bicycle lanes]] are widely used throughout the year. Cycle paths can be found alongside the majority of sidewalks and streets, although the newer and/or renovated ones are much easier to tell apart from pavements than older ones. The cycle paths usually involve a longer route than by the road, as they are diverted around objects, and the presence of pedestrians can make them quite slow.\n\nA modern [[Call a Bike|bike hire system]] is available within the area bounded by the ''Mittlerer Ring''.\n\n===M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof===\n{{Main|M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof}}\n[[File:Morning Munich HB June 2014 - 2 (14181545380).jpg|thumb|Munich main railway station]]\n\n[[M\u00fcnchen Hauptbahnhof]] is the main [[railway station]] located in the city centre and is one of three long distance stations in Munich, the others being [[M\u00fcnchen Ost railway station|M\u00fcnchen Ost]] (to the east) and [[M\u00fcnchen-Pasing railway station|M\u00fcnchen-Pasing]] (to the west).

Traffic jams are commonplace during rush hour as well as at the beginning and end of major holidays in Germany. There are few \"green waves\" or roundabouts, and the city's prosperity often causes an abundance of obstructive construction sites. Other contributing factors are the extraordinarily high rates of car ownership per capita (multiple times that of Berlin), the city's historically grown and largely preserved centralised urban structure, which leads to a very high concentration of traffic in specific areas, and sometimes poor planning (for example bad traffic light synchronisation and a less than ideal ring road).\n\n===Munich International Airport===\n[[File:Flughafen turm.png|thumb|[[Munich Airport|Munich International Airport]] (MUC)]]\n[[Munich Airport|Franz Josef Strauss International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: MUC, [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: EDDM) is the second-largest airport in Germany and seventh-largest in Europe after [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris Charles de Gaulle]], [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankfurt]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]], [[Barajas Airport|Madrid]] and [[Atat\u00fcrk International Airport|Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk]].

An additional problem is that the precise relationship between the ''Vita'' and the ''Navigatio'' traditions is uncertain.\n\nThe date when the ''Vita'' tradition began is uncertain. The earliest surviving copies are no earlier than the end of the twelfth century, but scholars suggest that a version of the ''Vita'' was composed before AD 1000.

For five years he was educated under [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]], \"the Brigid of Munster\". When he was six he was sent to [[Iarlaithe mac Loga|Jarlath]]'s monastery school at Tuam to further his education. Brendan is considered one of the \"Twelve Apostles of Ireland\", one of those said to have been tutored by the great teacher, [[Finnian of Clonard]].<ref name=kerry/>\n\n[[File:Saint Brendan the Navigator.jpg|thumb|The legend of his exploration has ensured his continued popularity as attested by the production of this non-religious small statue of Brendan]]\n==Foundations==\nAt the age of twenty-six, Brendan was ordained a priest by Erc.<ref name=eye>[http://www.irelandseye.com/irish/people/saints/brendan.shtm \"Saint Brendan the Navigator\", ''A Little Book of Celtic Saints''].</ref>  Afterwards, he founded a number of monasteries.  Brendan\u2019s first voyage took him to the [[Aran Islands]], where he founded a monastery.  He also visited Hinba ([[Argyll]]), an island off of [[Scotland]] where he is said to have met [[Saint Columba|Columcille]].  On the same voyage he traveled to [[Wales]] and finally to [[Brittany]], on the northern coast of [[France]].  Between AD 512 and 530 Brendan built monastic cells at [[Ardfert]], and [[Shanakeel]] (''Seana Cill'', usually translated as the \"Old Church\"), at the foot of [[Mount Brandon]].  From there he is supposed to have embarked on his famous voyage of 7 years for [[Paradise]].  The old Irish calendars assigned a feast for the ''\"egressio familiae Sancti Brendani\"''.<ref name=oode/>\n\n==Legendary journey==\nBrendan is primarily renowned for his legendary journey to the Isle of the Blessed as described in the ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis'' (''Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot'') of the ninth century. Many versions exist that narrate how he set out on the Atlantic Ocean with sixteen [[monk]]s (although other versions record fourteen monks and three unbelievers who joined in the last minute) to search for the [[Garden of Eden]]. One of these companions is said to have been [[Malo (saint)|Malo]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09503a.htm Grattan-Flood, William. \"St. Machutus.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 10 May 2018</ref> The voyage is dated to AD 512\u2013530, before his travel to the island of [[Great Britain]]. On his trip, Brendan is supposed to have seen [[Saint Brendan's Island]], a blessed island covered with vegetation. He also encountered a [[sea monster]], an adventure he shared with his contemporary Columcille. The most commonly illustrated adventure is his landing on an island which turned out to be a giant sea monster named \"[[Jasconius]]\". \n\n===''The Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot''===\nThe earliest extant version of the ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis'' (''Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot'') was recorded {{circa}} AD 900. There are over 100 manuscripts of the narrative throughout Europe and many translations. The ''Navigatio'' is plainly a Christian narrative, but also narrates natural phenomena and fantastical events and places, which appealed to a broad audience. The ''Navigatio'' contains many parallels and inter-textual references to ''[[The Voyage of Bran|Bran]]'' and the ''Voyage of [[M\u00e1el D\u00fain]]''.\n\nOn the Kerry coast, Brendan built a [[currach]]-like boat of [[wattle (construction)|wattle]], covered it with hides tanned in oak bark and softened with butter, and set up a mast and a sail. He and a small group of monks fasted for 40 days, and after a prayer on the shore, embarked in the name of the [[Most Holy Trinity]].<ref name=brookline>[http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic_saints/brendan.html \"The Commemoration of St. Brendan of Ardfert and Clonert\", All Saints Parish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619060640/http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic_saints/brendan.html |date=19 June 2013 }}</ref> The narrative is characterized by much literary license, e. g., it refers to [[Hell]] where \u201cgreat demons threw down lumps of fiery slag from an island with rivers of gold fire\u201d and also to \u201cgreat crystal pillars\u201d.

Irish immrama flourished during the seventh and eighth centuries. Typically, an immram is a tale that describes the hero's series of seafaring adventures. Some of these immrams involved the search for, and visits to, [[Tir na nOg]], an island far to the west, beyond the edges of the world map. There appear to be similarities with ''[[The Voyage of Bran]]'' written much earlier. In the ''Navigatio'', this style of storytelling meshed with a religious ascetic tradition in which Irish monks travel alone in boats, the same way their desert brothers isolated themselves in caves.\n\nBrendan's voyages were one of the most remarkable and enduring of European legends. With many of the facts of Brendan's journeys coming from the ''Navigatio'', it has been difficult for scholars to distinguish fact and folklore. The narrative of Brendan's voyage, developed during this time, shares some characteristics with immram. Like an immram, the ''Navigatio'' tells the story of Brendan, who, with some companion monks, sets out to find the ''terra repromissionis sanctorum'', (\"Promised Land of the Saints\"), i. e., the Earthly Paradise.<ref># John D. Anderson, ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 83, No. 4 (Apr. \u2013 May 1988), pp. 315-22.</ref>\n\nJude S. Mackley holds that efforts to identify possible, actual locations referenced in the ''Navigatio'' distract from the author's purpose of presenting a legend of \"salvation, monastic obedience and the faith required to undertake such a pilgrimage.\" <ref name=Mackley1>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kDNmPt0Kl7sC&pg=PA55&dq=saint+brendan+the+navigator Jude S. Mackley, \"The Legend of St. Brendan\", Brill, 2008] {{ISBN|9789004166622}}.</ref>\n\n====Intertextuality====\nScholars debate whether the ''Navigatio'' influenced the [[Mael Duin|''Voyage of Mael Duin'']] or vice versa. Jude Mackley suggests that an early ''Navigatio'' influenced an equally early ''Mael Duin'' and that inter-borrowing continued as the traditions developed. The ''Navigatio'' adapts the [[immram]] traditions to a Christian context.<ref name=Mackley1/>\n\nA principal similarity between ''Mael Duin'' and the ''Navigatio'' is the introduction in both of 3 additional passengers. [[Mael Duin]] is joined by his foster brothers, and Brendan by 3 additional monks. Both additions upset the equilibrium of the voyages, and only when the additional persons are no longer on board can each voyage be completed.<ref name=Mackley1/>\n\n===Early Dutch version===\nOne of the earliest extant written versions of Brendan's legend is the Dutch ''[[Folklore of the Low Countries|De Reis van Sinte Brandaen]]'' (Mediaeval Dutch for ''The Voyage of Saint Brendan'') of the twelfth century. Scholars believe it is derived from a now lost [[Middle High German]] text combined with [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] elements from Ireland and that it combines [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[fairy tale]] elements. ''De Reis van Sinte Brandaen'' describes \"Brandaen\", a monk from [[Galway]], and his voyage around the world for 9 years. The journey began as a punishment by an [[angel]] who saw that Brendan did not believe in the truth of a book of the miracles of creation and saw Brandaen throw it into a fire. The angel tells him that truth has been destroyed. On his journeys Brandaen encounters the wonders and horrors of the world, such as [[Judas Iscariot]] frozen on one side and burning on the other; people with swine heads, dog legs, and wolf teeth carrying bows and arrows; and an enormous fish that encircles Brandaen's ship by holding its tail in its mouth. The English poem the ''Life of Saint Brandan'' is a later derivation from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version.<ref>Meijer, 1971: 9-10.</ref>\n\n===Possible link to North America===\nWhile the narrative is often assumed to be a religious allegory, there has been considerable discussion as to whether the legends are based on fact. There have been many interpretations of the possible geographical location of [[Saint Brendan's Island]]. Various pre-Columbian sea charts indicated it everywhere from the southern part of [[Ireland]] to the [[Canary Islands]], [[Faroes]], or [[Azores]]; to the island of [[Madeira]]; to a point 60 degrees west of the first meridian and very near the [[equator]]. Belief in the existence of the island was almost completely abandoned when a new theory arose that the Irish were the first Europeans to encounter the Americas.\n\nThere is no reliable evidence to indicate that Brendan ever reached [[Greenland]] or the [[Americas]].<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brendan_saint_1E.html T.

He then journeyed to [[Wales]] and studied under [[Gildas]] at [[Llancarfan]], and thence to [[Iona]], for he is said to have left traces of his apostolic zeal at Kil-''brandon'' (near [[Oban]]) and Kil-''brennan'' Sound. After a mission of 3 years in [[Britain (place name)|Britain]] he returned to [[Ireland]], and evangelized further in various parts of [[Leinster]], especially at Dysart (currently in [[County Kilkenny]]), [[Killiney]] ([[Tubberboe]]), and [[Brandon Hill]]. He established churches at [[Inchiquin]] (currently in [[County Galway]]) and [[Inishglora]] (currently in [[County Mayo]]), and founded [[Clonfert]] in [[Galway]] {{circa}} AD 557. He died {{circa}} AD 577 in [[Annaghdown]], while visiting his sister Briga. Fearing that after his death his devotees might take his remains as [[relic]]s, Brendan had previously arranged to have his body secretly returned to the monastery he founded in [[Clonfert]], concealed in a luggage cart. He was interred in [[Clonfert Cathedral]]. \n\n==Veneration==\nBrendan was recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church. His feast day is celebrated on 16 May.\nAs the legend of the seven years voyage spread, crowds of pilgrims and students flocked to Ardfert. Religious houses were formed at Gallerus, Kilmalchedor, Brandon Hill, and the [[Blasket Islands]], to meet the wants of those who came for spiritual guidance from Brendan.<ref name=grattan/> Brendan is the patron saint of sailors and travellers. At the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], a large stained glass window commemorates Brendan's achievements. At [[Fenit|Fenit Harbour]], [[Tralee]], a substantial bronze sculpture by [[Tighe O'DonoghueRoss|Tighe O'Donoghue/Ross]] was erected to honour the memory of Brendan.  The project, including a Heritage Park and the Sl\u00ed Bhreanainn (the Brendan way) was headed by Fr. Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Donnchadha and completed through the work of the St. Brendan Committee. \n[[File:\"St. Brendan of the Gael\", Fenit, Co Kerry by Tigue O'Donoghue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Brendan at Fenit Harbour.]] \n\n==Patronage==\nBrendan the Navigator or Br\u00e9nainn moccu Alti as he is often known in the medieval Irish tradition is the patron sint of two Irish Dioceses, Kerry and Clonfert. He is also a patron saint of boatmen, mariners, travelers, elderly adventurers, and whales,<ref name=Mackley2>Mackley, Jude S., ''Legend of Brendan: A Comparative Study of the Latin and Anglo-Norman Versions'' (Leiden: Brill, 2008)</ref> and also of portaging canoes.<ref name=kerry>[http://dioceseofkerry.ie/page/heritage/saints/st_brendan/ \"St.Brendan\", Diocese of Kerry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115062328/http://www.dioceseofkerry.ie/page/heritage/saints/st_brendan/ |date=15 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Establishments==\nSt Brendan's activities as a churchman, however, were developed in Western Ireland, where his most important foundations are found, i.e. Ardfert (Co.

Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1959.</ref>\n\nBrendan's most celebrated foundation was [[Clonfert Cathedral]], in the year 563, over which he appointed Moinenn as Prior and Head Master. Brendan was interred in Clonfert.\n\nThe group of ecclesiastical remains at Ardfert is one of the most interesting and instructive now existing in Ireland. The ruins of the ancient Cathedral of St Brendan, and of its annexed chantries and detached chapels, form a very complete reliquary of Irish ecclesiastical architecture, in its various orders and ages, from the plain but solid Danhliag of the seventh or eighth century to some late and most ornate examples of medieval Gothic.

Tradition has it that he was born in the Kilfenora/Fenit area on the North side of the bay. He was baptised at Tubrid, near [[Ardfert]] by [[Erc of Slane]],<ref name=grattan/> and was originally to be called \"Mobh\u00ed\" but signs and portents attending his birth and baptism led to him being christened 'Broen-finn' or 'fair-drop'. For five years he was educated under [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]], \"the Brigid of Munster\". When he was six he was sent to [[Iarlaithe mac Loga|Jarlath]]'s monastery school at Tuam to further his education. Brendan is considered one of the \"Twelve Apostles of Ireland\", one of those said to have been tutored by the great teacher, [[Finnian of Clonard]].<ref name=kerry/>\n\n==Foundations==\nAt the age of twenty-six, Brendan was ordained a priest by Erc.<ref name=eye>[http://www.irelandseye.com/irish/people/saints/brendan.shtm \"Saint Brendan the Navigator\", ''A Little Book of Celtic Saints''].</ref>  Afterwards, he founded a number of monasteries.  Brendan\u2019s first voyage took him to the [[Aran Islands]], where he founded a monastery.  He also visited Hinba ([[Argyll]]), an island off of [[Scotland]] where he is said to have met [[Saint Columba|Columcille]].  On the same voyage he traveled to [[Wales]] and finally to [[Brittany]], on the northern coast of [[France]].  Between AD 512 and 530 Brendan built monastic cells at [[Ardfert]], and [[Shanakeel]] (''Seana Cill'', usually translated as the \"Old Church\"), at the foot of [[Mount Brandon]].  From there he is supposed to have embarked on his famous voyage of 7 years for [[Paradise]].  The old Irish calendars assigned a feast for the ''\"egressio familiae Sancti Brendani\"''.<ref name=oode/>\n\n==Legendary journey==\nBrendan is primarily renowned for his legendary journey to the Isle of the Blessed as described in the ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis'' (''Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot'') of the ninth century. Many versions exist that narrate how he set out on the Atlantic Ocean with sixteen [[monk]]s (although other versions record fourteen monks and three unbelievers who joined in the last minute) to search for the [[Garden of Eden]]. One of these companions is said to have been [[Malo (saint)|Malo]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09503a.htm Grattan-Flood, William. \"St. Machutus.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 10 May 2018</ref> The voyage is dated to AD 512\u2013530, before his travel to the island of [[Great Britain]]. On his trip, Brendan is supposed to have seen [[Saint Brendan's Island]], a blessed island covered with vegetation. He also encountered a [[sea monster]], an adventure he shared with his contemporary Columcille. The most commonly illustrated adventure is his landing on an island which turned out to be a giant sea monster named \"[[Jasconius]]\". \n\n===''The Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot''===\nThe earliest extant version of the ''Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis'' (''Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot'') was recorded {{circa}} AD 900. There are over 100 manuscripts of the narrative throughout Europe and many translations. The ''Navigatio'' is plainly a Christian narrative, but also narrates natural phenomena and fantastical events and places, which appealed to a broad audience. The ''Navigatio'' contains many parallels and inter-textual references to ''[[The Voyage of Bran|Bran]]'' and the ''Voyage of [[M\u00e1el D\u00fain]]''.\n\nOn the Kerry coast, Brendan built a [[currach]]-like boat of [[wattle (construction)|wattle]], covered it with hides tanned in oak bark and softened with butter, and set up a mast and a sail. He and a small group of monks fasted for 40 days, and after a prayer on the shore, embarked in the name of the [[Most Holy Trinity]].<ref name=brookline>[http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic_saints/brendan.html \"The Commemoration of St. Brendan of Ardfert and Clonert\", All Saints Parish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619060640/http://allsaintsbrookline.org/celtic_saints/brendan.html |date=19 June 2013 }}</ref> The narrative is characterized by much literary license, e. g., it refers to [[Hell]] where \u201cgreat demons threw down lumps of fiery slag from an island with rivers of gold fire\u201d and also to \u201cgreat crystal pillars\u201d.

Irish immrama flourished during the seventh and eighth centuries. Typically, an immram is a tale that describes the hero's series of seafaring adventures. Some of these immrams involved the search for, and visits to, [[Tir na nOg]], an island far to the west, beyond the edges of the world map. There appear to be similarities with ''[[The Voyage of Bran]]'' written much earlier. In the ''Navigatio'', this style of storytelling meshed with a religious ascetic tradition in which Irish monks travel alone in boats, the same way their desert brothers isolated themselves in caves.\n\nBrendan's voyages were one of the most remarkable and enduring of European legends. With many of the facts of Brendan's journeys coming from the ''Navigatio'', it has been difficult for scholars to distinguish fact and folklore. The narrative of Brendan's voyage, developed during this time, shares some characteristics with immram. Like an immram, the ''Navigatio'' tells the story of Brendan, who, with some companion monks, sets out to find the ''terra repromissionis sanctorum'', (\"Promised Land of the Saints\"), i. e., the Earthly Paradise.<ref># John D. Anderson, ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 83, No. 4 (Apr. \u2013 May 1988), pp. 315-22.</ref>\n\nJude S. Mackley holds that efforts to identify possible, actual locations referenced in the ''Navigatio'' distract from the author's purpose of presenting a legend of \"salvation, monastic obedience and the faith required to undertake such a pilgrimage.\" <ref name=Mackley1>[https://books.google.com/books?id=kDNmPt0Kl7sC&pg=PA55&dq=saint+brendan+the+navigator Jude S. Mackley, \"The Legend of St. Brendan\", Brill, 2008] {{ISBN|9789004166622}}.</ref>\n\n====Intertextuality====\nScholars debate whether the ''Navigatio'' influenced the [[Mael Duin|''Voyage of Mael Duin'']] or vice versa. Jude Mackley suggests that an early ''Navigatio'' influenced an equally early ''Mael Duin'' and that inter-borrowing continued as the traditions developed. The ''Navigatio'' adapts the [[immram]] traditions to a Christian context.<ref name=Mackley1/>\n\nA principal similarity between ''Mael Duin'' and the ''Navigatio'' is the introduction in both of 3 additional passengers. [[Mael Duin]] is joined by his foster brothers, and Brendan by 3 additional monks. Both additions upset the equilibrium of the voyages, and only when the additional persons are no longer on board can each voyage be completed.<ref name=Mackley1/>\n\n===Early Dutch version===\nOne of the earliest extant written versions of Brendan's legend is the Dutch ''[[Folklore of the Low Countries|De Reis van Sinte Brandaen]]'' (Mediaeval Dutch for ''The Voyage of Saint Brendan'') of the twelfth century. Scholars believe it is derived from a now lost [[Middle High German]] text combined with [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] elements from Ireland and that it combines [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[fairy tale]] elements. ''De Reis van Sinte Brandaen'' describes \"Brandaen\", a monk from [[Galway]], and his voyage around the world for 9 years. The journey began as a punishment by an [[angel]] who saw that Brendan did not believe in the truth of a book of the miracles of creation and saw Brandaen throw it into a fire. The angel tells him that truth has been destroyed. On his journeys Brandaen encounters the wonders and horrors of the world, such as [[Judas Iscariot]] frozen on one side and burning on the other; people with swine heads, dog legs, and wolf teeth carrying bows and arrows; and an enormous fish that encircles Brandaen's ship by holding its tail in its mouth. The English poem the ''Life of Saint Brandan'' is a later derivation from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] version.<ref>Meijer, 1971: 9-10.</ref>\n\n===Possible link to North America===\nWhile the narrative is often assumed to be a religious allegory, there has been considerable discussion as to whether the legends are based on fact. There have been many interpretations of the possible geographical location of [[Saint Brendan's Island]]. Various pre-Columbian sea charts indicated it everywhere from the southern part of [[Ireland]] to the [[Canary Islands]], [[Faroes]], or [[Azores]]; to the island of [[Madeira]]; to a point 60 degrees west of the first meridian and very near the [[equator]]. Belief in the existence of the island was almost completely abandoned when a new theory arose that the Irish were the first Europeans to encounter the Americas.\n\nThere is no reliable evidence to indicate that Brendan ever reached [[Greenland]] or the [[Americas]].<ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brendan_saint_1E.html T.

Chapman, ''The Man who Led Columbus to America'', Atlanta, Georgia, Judson Press, 1973.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBrendan travelled to [[Wales]] and the holy island of [[Iona]], off the west coast of [[Scotland]]; returning to [[Ireland]], he founded a [[monastery]] in [[Annaghdown]], where he spent the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corrandulla / Annaghdown |url=http://corrandulla.galway-ireland.ie/ |work=County Galway Guide |accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> He also founded a convent at Annaghdown for his sister Briga.<ref name=eye/> Having established the bishopric of [[Ardfert]], Brendan proceeded to [[Thomond]], and founded a monastery at Inis-da-druim (currently Coney Island), in the present parish of Killadysert, [[County Clare]], {{circa}} AD 550. He then journeyed to [[Wales]] and studied under [[Gildas]] at [[Llancarfan]], and thence to [[Iona]], for he is said to have left traces of his apostolic zeal at Kil-''brandon'' (near [[Oban]]) and Kil-''brennan'' Sound. After a mission of 3 years in [[Britain (place name)|Britain]] he returned to [[Ireland]], and evangelized further in various parts of [[Leinster]], especially at Dysart (currently in [[County Kilkenny]]), [[Killiney]] ([[Tubberboe]]), and [[Brandon Hill]]. He established churches at [[Inchiquin]] (currently in [[County Galway]]) and [[Inishglora]] (currently in [[County Mayo]]), and founded [[Clonfert]] in [[Galway]] {{circa}} AD 557. He died {{circa}} AD 577 in [[Annaghdown]], while visiting his sister Briga. Fearing that after his death his devotees might take his remains as [[relic]]s, Brendan had previously arranged to have his body secretly returned to the monastery he founded in [[Clonfert]], concealed in a luggage cart. He was interred in [[Clonfert Cathedral]].\n\n==Veneration==\nBrendan was recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church. His feast day is celebrated on 16 May.\nAs the legend of the seven years voyage spread, crowds of pilgrims and students flocked to Ardfert. Religious houses were formed at Gallerus, Kilmalchedor, Brandon Hill, and the [[Blasket Islands]], to meet the wants of those who came for spiritual guidance from Brendan.<ref name=grattan/> Brendan is the patron saint of sailors and travellers. At the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], a large stained glass window commemorates Brendan's achievements. At [[Fenit|Fenit Harbour]], [[Tralee]], a substantial bronze sculpture by [[Tighe O'DonoghueRoss|Tighe O'Donoghue/Ross]] was erected to honour the memory of Brendan.  The project, including a Heritage Park and the Sl\u00ed Bhreanainn (the Brendan way) was headed by Fr. Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Donnchadha and completed through the work of the St. Brendan Committee.\n[[File:\"St. Brendan of the Gael\", Fenit, Co Kerry by Tigue O'Donoghue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Brendan at Fenit Harbour.]]\n\n==Patronage==\nBrendan the Navigator or Br\u00e9nainn moccu Alti as he is often known in the medieval Irish tradition is the patron sint of two Irish Dioceses, Kerry and Clonfert. He is also a patron saint of boatmen, mariners, travelers, elderly adventurers, and whales,<ref name=Mackley2>Mackley, Jude S., ''Legend of Brendan: A Comparative Study of the Latin and Anglo-Norman Versions'' (Leiden: Brill, 2008)</ref> and also of portaging canoes.<ref name=kerry>[http://dioceseofkerry.ie/page/heritage/saints/st_brendan/ \"St.Brendan\", Diocese of Kerry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115062328/http://www.dioceseofkerry.ie/page/heritage/saints/st_brendan/ |date=15 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Establishments==\nSt Brendan's activities as a churchman, however, were developed in Western Ireland, where his most important foundations are found, i.e. Ardfert (Co. Kerry), Inishdadroum (Co. Clare), [[Annaghdown]] (Co. Galway), and Clonfert (Co. Galway). His name is perpetuated in numerous place names and landmarks along the Irish coast (e.g. Brandon Hill, Brandon Point, Mount Brendan, Brandon Well, Brandon Bay, Brandon Head).<ref>Selmer, Carl. Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis. Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1959.</ref>\n\nBrendan's most celebrated foundation was [[Clonfert Cathedral]], in the year 563, over which he appointed Moinenn as Prior and Head Master. Brendan was interred in Clonfert.\n\nThe group of ecclesiastical remains at Ardfert is one of the most interesting and instructive now existing in Ireland. The ruins of the ancient Cathedral of St Brendan, and of its annexed chantries and detached chapels, form a very complete reliquary of Irish ecclesiastical architecture, in its various orders and ages, from the plain but solid Danhliag of the seventh or eighth century to some late and most ornate examples of medieval Gothic. The cathedral, as it now stands, or rather as it stood before it was finally dismantled in A.D. 1641.<ref>O\u2019Donoghue, Denis. Brendaniana.

Since 1574, the \"''Chiesa di San Blandano''\" (\"Church of Saint Brendan\") replaced a chapel with such name that existed previously in the same location. The reasons for dedicating a church to Saint Brendan are still unknown and probably untraceable. \nThe [[Normans]] and the many settlers that followed the Norman invasion brought into [[Sicily]] the tradition of Saint Brendan; there are very old papers of the 13th century written in [[Sicily]] that refer to him; in 1799 the countryside surrounding Bront\u00eb became the British ''\"Duchy of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]\"''.

Homeported in [[San Diego]], [[California]], after the war, Carrier Air Group Five was re-designated CVAG-5 on 15 November 1946 in accordance with the Navy's new Carrier Air Group designation scheme and on 1 September 1948 it reverted to Carrier Air Group five (CVG-5) when the Navy again changed the Carrier Air Group designation scheme.  The Air Group quickly recorded a number of firsts, including the first squadron to land a jet aircraft aboard a carrier (1948),<ref name=\"CVW5\"/> the first jet aircraft in the Navy to shoot down enemy aircraft when two [[Grumman F9F Panther|F9F-3 Panthers]] from [[VF-51]] shot down two [[Korean People's Air Force]] [[Yakovlev Yak-9|Yak-9]] fighters on 3 July 1950,<ref>{{cite book|last=Grossnick|first=Roy|title=United States Naval Aviation 1910\u20131995|publisher=University of Michigan Library |year=1997|page=767}}</ref> the first to arrive in Yellow Sea, the first to launch jet aircraft against enemy, and the first to include both jet squadrons VF-51, [[VF-52]] with F9F-2 Panther jets, [[VF-53]] with [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsairs]], [[Second VA-54 (U.S. Navy)|VA-54]] and [[Attack Squadron 55 (U.S. Navy)|VA-55]] with [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD-1 Skyraiders]].\n\nCVG-5 was the first air group to enter the [[Korean War]], and after serving 18 months in the combat zone, had compiled more combat time than any other air group in the Korean War. CVG-5 was redesigned Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) on 20 December 1963 when the Navy reclassified its carrier air groups as carrier air wings.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\n===Vietnam War===\nIn 1964, CVW-5 was called to action in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] for a total of eight combat cruises.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nOn 5 December 1965, a [[United States military nuclear incident terminology#Broken Arrow|Broken Arrow incident]] occurred aboard {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, upon which CVW-5 was embarked.

The wing completed 111 continuous days on station in the [[North Arabian Sea]] in 1984, which the wing's official site describes as 'guarding the Straits of Hormuz and guaranteeing the continued flow of vital oil to Japan and Western Europe.'<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\n===Gulf War===\nCVW-5 began its final cruise aboard the Midway in October 1990 as part of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. From November to January 1991, the air wing participated in numerous multinational exercises and operated continuously in the Persian Gulf. On 17 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm began as CVW-5 aircraft launched a night strike deep into Iraq. For the next 43 days the air wing flew 3,383 combat sorties and expended more than four million pounds of ordnance.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nIn August 1991, {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}} replaced ''Midway''. Also, in 1991, in consideration of the surrounding communities the [[Field Carrier Landing Practice]] (FCLP), known in Japan as NLP,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} was moved to the island of Iwo Jima, {{convert|650|mi|km|-1}} away as an interim measure until another landing field could be situated within {{convert|100|nmi|km|-2}} of the base.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nUSS ''Independence'' deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] in mid-1992 and started the [[Operation Southern Watch|Southern Watch operation]], a multi-national mission to monitor Iraqi compliance with the \"[[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zone]]\" below the [[32nd parallel north]]. In August 1995, Independence and Carrier Air Wing 5 deployed to The Persian Gulf for a third time in support of [[Operation Southern Watch]].<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nIn July 1998, CVW-5 moved again, to {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' left its berth at Fleet Activities Yokosuka in early April 2000 to begin a routine deployment to the Western Pacific. The carrier had spent the previous five weeks in Yokosuka following a 12-day sea trial in February and March. She first journeyed to [[Guam]] to rendezvous with the air wing, which was participating in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program at [[Andersen Air Force Base]] until 18 April 2000. In addition to Guam, the ship made port calls throughout the Western Pacific and participated in [[Exercise Cobra Gold]] with the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\n===Afghanistan and Iraq===\n''Kitty Hawk'' with CVW-5 got under way 1 October 2001 with a mere 24-hour turnaround, after an accelerated sea trials and carrier qualifications period, carried out on short notice following the events of 11 September. The air wing contingent included eight [[F/A-18]] Hornet aircraft from [[VFA-192]] and [[VFA-195]] and pilots from [[VFA-27]]. Also in DET A were three [[S-3 Viking]]s from [[VS-21]], and two [[SH-60]] Seahawks from [[HS-14]]. The initial plan for CVW-5 was to provide air defense during the Kitty Hawk's transit to station. The Air Wing was able to work around the Special Operations mission, however, and established a more offensive mission for themselves. Air Wing aviators flew 600 missions over [[Afghanistan]] as part of the attacks, including more than 100 combat sorties during this at sea period.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nAt the same time, two [[C-2A Greyhound]]s from [[VRC-30]] Detachment 5 were based at [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]] providing logistical support to all four carriers on station, ''Kitty Hawk'', {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Carl Vinson}}. The Providers from VRC-30's Detachment 5 were the only C-2A squadron in the region qualified for night operations. The Providers lived up to their name, supplying the four carrier battle groups with 1500 passengers and 350,000 pounds of cargo.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nFrom 30 October through 16 November 2001, the strike element of the Air Wing participated in a weapons training detachment at [[Kadena Air Base]] in Okinawa. The Air Wing completed 50 sorties per day for the entire three-week period with a 98% sortie completion rate. In all there were 640 sorties flown for a total of 1,040 flight hours and over 250 tons of ordnance dropped. In spite of this rigorous training schedule, there were no mishaps or incidents of [[foreign object damage]] (FOD), and no liberty incidents. All this was done despite being uncoupled from the Air Wing's maintenance support, housed on the Kitty Hawk.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nIn 2003 was the final cruise with the F-14 Tomcat. CVW-5 deployed to the Persian Gulf and supported [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] flying from ''Kitty Hawk''. [[VF-154]] Black Knights deployed several aircraft to [[Al Udeid]] in [[Qatar]] and supported [[Special Operations Forces]] in Iraq alongside the [[USAF]] and [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft deployed to that airbase. Later that year, VF-154 departed NAF Atsugi to transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet, and VFA-27 transitioned to the F/A-18E Super Hornet while VFA-102 became part of CVW-5, flying the F/A-18F.\n\nIn August 2008, {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|6}} replaced ''Kitty Hawk'' as the U.S. Navy's forward deployed carrier and CVW-5 was reassigned to ''George Washington''.<ref>[http://www.stripes.com/news/uss-george-washington-arrives-at-yokosuka-naval-base-1.83457 Stars and Stripes 25 September 2008]</ref>\n[[File:An EA-18G Growler of VAQ-141 at Atsugi Naval Air Facility.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing EA-18G Growler|EA-18G Growler]] of [[VAQ-141]] taxies after landing at [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]], Japan in August 2016]]\nIn the 2010s, the wing's squadrons were modernized by the addition of new aircraft. During the fall of 2010, [[VFA-195]] transitioned to the [[Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet|F/A-18E Super Hornet]]. In March 2012, [[VAQ-136]] was replaced by [[VAQ-141]], equipped with the [[Boeing EA-18G Growler|EA-18G Growler]].<ref>[https://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrj/installations/naf_atsugi/about/tenant_commands/cvw_5/vaq_141.html VAQ-141] Retrieved 19 February 2017</ref> Thus, CVW-5 became the first U.S. Navy carrier air wing flying only variants of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] as strike aircraft. In 2013, the wing's helicopter squadrons were replaced. The [[MH-60S Seahawk]]-equipped [[HSC-12]] replaced [[HS-14]], and [[HSM-51|HSL-51]] was replaced by [[HSM-77]], flying the [[MH-60R Seahawk]]<ref>Erik Slaven.

Homeported in [[San Diego]], [[California]], after the war, Carrier Air Group Five was re-designated CVAG-5 on 15 November 1946 in accordance with the Navy's new Carrier Air Group designation scheme and on 1 September 1948 it reverted to Carrier Air Group five (CVG-5) when the Navy again changed the Carrier Air Group designation scheme.  The Air Group quickly recorded a number of firsts, including the first squadron to land a jet aircraft aboard a carrier (1948),<ref name=\"CVW5\"/> the first jet aircraft in the Navy to shoot down enemy aircraft when two [[Grumman F9F Panther|F9F-3 Panthers]] from [[VF-51]] shot down two [[Korean People's Air Force]] [[Yakovlev Yak-9|Yak-9]] fighters on 3 July 1950,<ref>{{cite book|last=Grossnick|first=Roy|title=United States Naval Aviation 1910\u20131995|publisher=University of Michigan Library |year=1997|page=767}}</ref> the first to arrive in Yellow Sea, the first to launch jet aircraft against enemy, and the first to include both jet squadrons VF-51, [[VF-52]] with F9F-2 Panther jets, [[VF-53]] with [[Vought F4U Corsair|F4U Corsairs]], [[VA-54]] and [[Attack Squadron 55 (U.S. Navy)|VA-55]] with [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|AD-1 Skyraiders]].\n\nCVG-5 was the first air group to enter the [[Korean War]], and after serving 18 months in the combat zone, had compiled more combat time than any other air group in the Korean War. CVG-5 was redesigned Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) on 20 December 1963 when the Navy reclassified its carrier air groups as carrier air wings.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\n===Vietnam War===\nIn 1964, CVW-5 was called to action in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] for a total of eight combat cruises.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nOn 5 December 1965, a [[United States military nuclear incident terminology#Broken Arrow|Broken Arrow incident]] occurred aboard {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|6}}, upon which CVW-5 was embarked.

The wing completed 111 continuous days on station in the [[North Arabian Sea]] in 1984, which the wing's official site describes as 'guarding the Straits of Hormuz and guaranteeing the continued flow of vital oil to Japan and Western Europe.'<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\n===Gulf War===\nCVW-5 began its final cruise aboard the Midway in October 1990 as part of [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]]. From November to January 1991, the air wing participated in numerous multinational exercises and operated continuously in the Persian Gulf. On 17 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm began as CVW-5 aircraft launched a night strike deep into Iraq. For the next 43 days the air wing flew 3,383 combat sorties and expended more than four million pounds of ordnance.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nIn August 1991, {{USS|Independence|CV-62|6}} replaced ''Midway''. Also, in 1991, in consideration of the surrounding communities the [[Field Carrier Landing Practice]] (FCLP), known in Japan as NLP,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} was moved to the island of Iwo Jima, {{convert|650|mi|km|-1}} away as an interim measure until another landing field could be situated within {{convert|100|nmi|km|-2}} of the base.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nUSS ''Independence'' deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] in mid-1992 and started the [[Operation Southern Watch|Southern Watch operation]], a multi-national mission to monitor Iraqi compliance with the \"[[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zone]]\" below the [[32nd parallel north]]. In August 1995, Independence and Carrier Air Wing 5 deployed to The Persian Gulf for a third time in support of [[Operation Southern Watch]].<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nIn July 1998, CVW-5 moved again, to {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' left its berth at Fleet Activities Yokosuka in early April 2000 to begin a routine deployment to the Western Pacific. The carrier had spent the previous five weeks in Yokosuka following a 12-day sea trial in February and March. She first journeyed to [[Guam]] to rendezvous with the air wing, which was participating in the Strike Fighter Advanced Readiness Program at [[Andersen Air Force Base]] until 18 April 2000. In addition to Guam, the ship made port calls throughout the Western Pacific and participated in [[Exercise Cobra Gold]] with the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\n===Afghanistan and Iraq===\n''Kitty Hawk'' with CVW-5 got under way 1 October 2001 with a mere 24-hour turnaround, after an accelerated sea trials and carrier qualifications period, carried out on short notice following the events of 11 September. The air wing contingent included eight [[F/A-18]] Hornet aircraft from [[VFA-192]] and [[VFA-195]] and pilots from [[VFA-27]]. Also in DET A were three [[S-3 Viking]]s from [[VS-21]], and two [[SH-60]] Seahawks from [[HS-14]]. The initial plan for CVW-5 was to provide air defense during the Kitty Hawk's transit to station. The Air Wing was able to work around the Special Operations mission, however, and established a more offensive mission for themselves. Air Wing aviators flew 600 missions over [[Afghanistan]] as part of the attacks, including more than 100 combat sorties during this at sea period.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nAt the same time, two [[C-2A Greyhound]]s from [[VRC-30]] Detachment 5 were based at [[Naval Support Activity Bahrain]] providing logistical support to all four carriers on station, ''Kitty Hawk'', {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Carl Vinson}}. The Providers from VRC-30's Detachment 5 were the only C-2A squadron in the region qualified for night operations. The Providers lived up to their name, supplying the four carrier battle groups with 1500 passengers and 350,000 pounds of cargo.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nFrom 30 October through 16 November 2001, the strike element of the Air Wing participated in a weapons training detachment at [[Kadena Air Base]] in Okinawa. The Air Wing completed 50 sorties per day for the entire three-week period with a 98% sortie completion rate. In all there were 640 sorties flown for a total of 1,040 flight hours and over 250 tons of ordnance dropped. In spite of this rigorous training schedule, there were no mishaps or incidents of [[foreign object damage]] (FOD), and no liberty incidents. All this was done despite being uncoupled from the Air Wing's maintenance support, housed on the Kitty Hawk.<ref name=\"CVW5\"/>\n\nIn 2003 was the final cruise with the F-14 Tomcat. CVW-5 deployed to the Persian Gulf and supported [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] flying from ''Kitty Hawk''. [[VF-154]] Black Knights deployed several aircraft to [[Al Udeid]] in [[Qatar]] and supported [[Special Operations Forces]] in Iraq alongside the [[USAF]] and [[Royal Air Force]] aircraft deployed to that airbase. Later that year, VF-154 departed NAF Atsugi to transition to the F/A-18F Super Hornet, and VFA-27 transitioned to the F/A-18E Super Hornet while VFA-102 became part of CVW-5, flying the F/A-18F.\n\nIn August 2008, {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|6}} replaced ''Kitty Hawk'' as the U.S. Navy's forward deployed carrier and CVW-5 was reassigned to ''George Washington''.<ref>[http://www.stripes.com/news/uss-george-washington-arrives-at-yokosuka-naval-base-1.83457 Stars and Stripes 25 September 2008]</ref>\n[[File:An EA-18G Growler of VAQ-141 at Atsugi Naval Air Facility.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing EA-18G Growler|EA-18G Growler]] of [[VAQ-141]] taxies after landing at [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]], Japan in August 2016]]\nIn the 2010s, the wing's squadrons were modernized by the addition of new aircraft. During the fall of 2010, [[VFA-195]] transitioned to the [[Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet|F/A-18E Super Hornet]]. In March 2012, [[VAQ-136]] was replaced by [[VAQ-141]], equipped with the [[Boeing EA-18G Growler|EA-18G Growler]].<ref>[https://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrj/installations/naf_atsugi/about/tenant_commands/cvw_5/vaq_141.html VAQ-141] Retrieved 19 February 2017</ref> Thus, CVW-5 became the first U.S. Navy carrier air wing flying only variants of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]] as strike aircraft. In 2013, the wing's helicopter squadrons were replaced. The [[MH-60S Seahawk]]-equipped [[HSC-12]] replaced [[HS-14]], and [[HSM-51|HSL-51]] was replaced by [[HSM-77]], flying the [[MH-60R Seahawk]]<ref>Erik Slaven.

Owned by [[Good Karma Brands]], WWGK currently airs programming from [[Doctor Radio]] (due to the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]]), but prior to that had served as a secondary [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate, alongside [[sister station]] [[WKNR]]\n\nThe WWGK studios are located in [[Downtown Cleveland]].   The transmitter tower is located on Euclid Avenue at East 81st Street in the [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]] section of Cleveland. In addition to a standard [[analog transmission]], WWGK is available online.\n\n==History==\n\n===WJMO (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Cleveland radio station [[WJMO]]}}\nThe station's roots trace back to WJMO, which went on the air on June 1, 1947 licensed to Cleveland as a daytime-only broadcaster at 1540&nbsp;kHz<ref>{{cite news|title=WJMO in Cleveland Started Yesterday|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-06-02-BC.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=June 1, 1947}}</ref> with studios at 2157 Euclid Avenue and a power of 1000 watts. The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with [[Painesville, Ohio]] station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E Communications - on October 24, 2006.\n\nFour days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" with a [[sports talk radio|sports/talk]] format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7.\n\nWWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire [[ESPN Radio]] daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station [[WAUK]]. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on [[WERE]] in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, ''Crain's Cleveland Business'' reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase [[WKNR]] for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at [[The Galleria at Erieview]].\n\nOn February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK would take the branding AM 1540 KNR2, (a play on [[ESPN2]]) in keeping with its sister station.  In April 2010, the station began branding itself as ESPN 1540 KNR2.  Today, WWGK and WKNR are often promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland.\n\nThe new schedule also made WWGK the [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Dan Patrick]] and the final hour of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, [[WKRK-FM]] 92.3 switched from [[alternative rock]] to a [[sports talk]] format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland.  AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped all sports programming and switched to a medical news/talk format, airing programming from [[Sirius XM]]'s [[Doctor Radio]] service.  This was done to provide a health-related service during the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]].  Good Karma management has stated sports programming will eventually resume as events warrant.<ref>[http://radioinsight.com/headlines/186287/1540-wwgk-cleveland-to-add-siriusxms-coronavirus-programming/ 1540 WWGK Cleveland to add Sirius XM coronavirus programming - Radio Inisight.com]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|https://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}\n*{{FCC letter|callsign=FCC History Cards for WWGK|letterid=46285}}{{AM station data|WWGK}}\n\n{{Cleveland Radio}}\n{{Sports Radio Stations in Ohio}}\n{{Daytime-only radio stations in Ohio}}\n{{ESPN Ohio}}\n{{Good Karma Broadcasting}}\n\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:ESPN Radio stations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1947]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Cleveland|WGK]]\n[[Category:Daytime-only radio stations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sports radio station in Cleveland, Ohio}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name = WWGK\n| image = \n| city = [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]\n| area = [[Greater Cleveland]] (limited)\n| branding = '''Doctor Radio'''\n| frequency = 1540 [[Kilohertz|kHz]]\n| airdate = {{start date and age|1947|6|1}}\n| format = Medical news/talk\n| power = 1,000 [[watt]]s (daytime only)\n| class = D\n| facility_id = 70659\n| coordinates = {{nowrap|{{coord|41|30|10.00|N|81|37|57.00|W|region:US-OH_type:landmark_source:FCC}}}}\n| callsign_meaning = owner Good Karma Brands\n| former_callsigns = WJMO (1947&ndash;58)<br>WABQ (1958&ndash;2006)<br>WBKC (2006)\n| affiliations = [[Doctor Radio]]\n| owner = [[Good Karma Brands]]\n| licensee = {{nowrap|Good Karma Broadcasting, LLC}}\n| sister_stations = [[WKNR]]\n| webcast = [http://espn.go.com/espnradio/affPopup?s=wwgk-am Listen Live]\n| website = {{URL|http://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}<br>{{URL|http://thelandondemand.com}}\n}}\n\n'''WWGK''' (1540 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a commercial [[Clear-channel station#Daytimers|daytime-only]] medical news/talk [[radio station]] licensed to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], providing limited coverage to [[Greater Cleveland]].  Owned by [[Good Karma Brands]], WWGK currently airs programming from [[Doctor Radio]] (due to the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]]), but prior to that had served as a secondary [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate, alongside [[sister station]] [[WKNR]]\n\nThe WWGK studios are located in [[Downtown Cleveland]].   The transmitter tower is located on Euclid Avenue at East 81st Street in the [[Fairfax, Cleveland|Fairfax]] section of Cleveland. In addition to a standard [[analog transmission]], WWGK is available online.\n\n==History==\n\n===WJMO (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Cleveland radio station [[WJMO]]}}\nThe station's roots trace back to WJMO, which went on the air on June 1, 1947 licensed to Cleveland as a daytime-only broadcaster at 1540&nbsp;kHz<ref>{{cite news|title=WJMO in Cleveland Started Yesterday|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1947/1947-06-02-BC.pdf|accessdate=28 September 2014|agency=Broadcasting|date=June 1, 1947}}</ref> with studios at 2157 Euclid Avenue and a power of 1000 watts. The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million.
