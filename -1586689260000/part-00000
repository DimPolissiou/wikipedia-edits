As of 2016, the town is home to around 372,000 residents. The total development area of Tseung Kwan O, including its industrial estate, is about {{convert|10.05|km2}}, with a planned population of 445,000.<ref>[https://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/factsheets/docs/towns&urban_developments.pdf Hong Kong: The Facts - New Towns, New Development Areas and Urban Developments]</ref> Major residential areas within the new town include Tsui Lam, [[Po Lam]], [[Hang Hau]], Tseung Kwan O Town Centre, [[Tiu Keng Leng]] (formerly known as Rennie's Mill) and Siu Chik Sha.\n\nAdministratively, the new town belongs to [[Sai Kung District]] in southeastern [[New Territories]], although it is often incorrectly regarded as part of [[Kowloon]] due to its close proximity to the city\u2014the town is bordered by the urban township of [[Kwun Tong]] to its west.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==History and urban development==\n[[File:Tseung Kwan O Town Park Pano 201405.jpg|center|thumb|800px|<center>The view from Hong Kong Velodrome Park, the town park of Tseung Kwan O.

The project was postponed for a long time owing to the extensive scale of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclamation]] in the bay, which is rather deep. The project finally took off under the name of Tseung Kwan O in 1983, when the development of the new town's Phase I was endorsed by the [[Governor-in-Council]].<ref name=pland>{{cite web |url=https://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/press/publication/nt_pamphlet02/tko_html/hist.html |title=Tseung Kwan O: Historical Background |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=[[Planning Department (Hong Kong)|Planning Department]] |access-date=2018-10-12 |quote=}}</ref> This was followed by the decision to proceed with Phase II, which entailed further reclamation and the clearance of the Kuomintang refugee village at [[Tiu Keng Leng|Rennie's Mill]] (later renamed [[Tiu Keng Leng]]), with a view to increase the planned population from 175,000 to 325,000.<ref name=pland/> The first families moved in to the new town in 1988 when public housing at the Head of the Bay ([[Po Lam Estate]]) was completed.<ref name=pland/>\n\nThe New Town was developed in three phases. The first phase encompasses Northern Tseung Kwan O, which includes [[Po Lam Station|Po Lam MTR Station]] and [[Hang Hau Station]], while the second and third phase comprise Southern Tseung Kwan O, which includes [[Tseung Kwan O Station]] (Town Centre) and [[Tiu Keng Leng Station]].\n* Phase I \u2013 [[Hang Hau]], [[Po Lam]], Siu Chik Sha, Tsui Lam\n* Phase II \u2013 Town Centre North, [[Tiu Keng Leng]]\n* Phase III \u2013 Town Centre South, [[Pak Shing Kok]], Tai Chik Sha\n\nThe design of the new town was highly [[Transit-oriented development|transit-oriented]]. Developments centred along the [[MTR]]-corridor, with more than 80% of the population living within five minutes of an MTR station, with huge residential complexes surrounding the MTR stations. As most of the residential complexes surrounds the MTR station, [[urban open space]] are usually planned at the periphery of each neighbourhood in Tseung Kwan O. Neighbourhoods are therefore separated by parks.\n\n==Geography==\nTseung Kwan O is located near the southeastern tip of the [[New Territories]] mainland, {{convert|9|to|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-southeast from the [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] of Hong Kong.\n\nThe town is bounded on the south by the namesake [[Junk Bay]], known as Tseung Kwan O (\u5c07\u8ecd\u6fb3) in Chinese. Most of the residential developments in the new town stand on land reclaimed from the bay. The mountains of [[Devil's Peak, Hong Kong|Devil's Peak]], Chiu Keng Wan Shan, Black Hill and Tai Sheung Tok form the new town's western boundary, where it borders [[Kwun Tong District]] of [[Kowloon]]. Lying to the north and southeast of the town are [[Razor Hill]] and [[High Junk Peak]], which separate the new town from the rural parts of [[Sai Kung District]].\n\nThe whole of Tseung Kwan O belongs to [[Sai Kung District]], part of the New Territories. The town is, however, situated far away from other major population centres of the New Territories, and is instead in close proximity with [[Kwun Tong]] in Kowloon. While the town is entirely within the [[New Territories East (constituency)|New Territories East geographical constituency]], a number of governmental bodies and large corporations would, for the sake of administrative convenience, classify Tseung Kwan O as part of Kowloon East, adding to the confusion of the town's residents. For example, the [[Hospital Authority]] places Tseung Kwan O under its [[Kowloon East Cluster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_text_index.asp?Content_ID=10178&Lang=ENG|title=Introduction of Clusters: Kowloon East Cluster|website=[[Hospital Authority]]|publisher=[[Hospital Authority]]|accessdate=2018-12-24}}</ref> From 1992 to 2017 Tseung Kwan O had been [[Hong Kong Police Force|policed]] under the Tseung Kwan O Division of the Kwun Tong Police District, and the upgraded Tseung Kwan O Police District still belongs to the Kowloon East Police Region.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201707/21/P2017072100570.htm|title=Establishment of Tseung Kwan O Police District|publisher=The Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|date=2017-07-21}}</ref> It is under such a situation that the new town is often incorrectly, or intentionally, referred to as part of Kowloon. This is illustrated by the fact that the two hotels in Tseung Kwan O are named [[Crowne Plaza]] Hong Kong Kowloon East and Holiday Inn Express Hong Kong Kowloon East.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:Tsang Kwan O The Wings View1 201305.jpg|thumb|Two hotels complex in Tseung Kwan O Town Centre]]\nThe development of Tseung Kwan O New Town commenced from the head of the original inlet, on reclaimed land in front of the original indigenous villages of Tseung Kwan O and Yau Yue Wan. The [[Po Lam]] neighbourhood is where the earliest developments in the new town could be found. Notably, [[Po Lam Estate]] (1988) was the first residential development in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/global-elements/estate-locator/detail.html?propertyType=1&id=2772|title=Housing Authority Property Location and Profile|publisher=[[Hong Kong Housing Authority]]|accessdate=2019-11-04}}</ref> [[Metro City (Hong Kong)|Metro City Plaza]], with its three phases surrounding the [[Po Lam Station|MTR terminus]], remains the largest shopping mall in the new town.\n\nTo the southeast of Po Lam lies the residential neighbourhood of [[Hang Hau]]. It was once a small market town that served the whole of [[Clear Water Bay Peninsula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/press/publication/nt_pamphlet02/tko_html/hist.html|title=Pamphlets on Planning for New Territories > Tseung Kwan O > Historical Background|publisher=[[Planning Department (Hong Kong)|Planning Department]]|accessdate=2019-11-04}}</ref> and was also a hub for [[ship breaking]] industries. When the new town was developed, residents of Hang Hau Town were resited into the Hang Hau Town Resite Area at the neighbourhood's northern edge, known presently as Hang Hau Village. The reclaimed part of Hang Hau is now home to a number of residential developments as well as community facilities such as the [[Tseung Kwan O Hospital|District Hospital]] and [[Sai Kung District Council]] facilities.\n\nTseung Kwan O Town Centre refers to the area to the south of Po Lam, southwest of Hang Hau and east of Tiu Keng Leng. Centered on MTR [[Tseung Kwan O Station]], this is the major growth area in the new town where new residential developments are being built. The development of the town centre commenced with the construction of [[Sheung Tak Estate]] in 1998. It has since been extended southwards to the shoreline of Junk Bay. Early private residential developments in the area include [[Sun Hung Kai Properties]]' [[Park Central (Hong Kong)|Park Central]] (2002)<ref>http://www.park-central.com.hk/chi/home.html</ref> and The Wings (2012),<ref>http://www.shkp.com/en-US/Pages/hkproperties-residential</ref><ref>http://www.thewingsii.com.hk/</ref><ref>http://ps.hket.com/project/239</ref> and [[Nan Fung Group]]'s Tseung Kwan O Plaza (2004).<ref>[http://www.tkoplazahk.com/ Official website of Tseung Kwan O Plaza] Retrieved 2011-09-18</ref>\n\n[[Tiu Keng Leng]] (formerly Rennie's Mill) was once a cottage area housing [[refugee]]s who settled in Hong Kong after [[Kuomintang]]'s defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The refugee village was cleared before the [[Handover of Hong Kong|handover]]. It has since been redeveloped into a mid-size high-rise residential neighbourhood.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe 2016 Population By-census records the population of Tseung Kwan O New Town at 398,479, a 7.12% increase from 2011.<ref name=2016bycensus>{{cite web|url=https://www.bycensus2016.gov.hk/en/bc-dp-new-town.html|title=District Profiles|website=2016 Population By-census|publisher=[[Census and Statistics Department (Hong Kong)|Census and Statistics Department]]|accessdate=2018-10-12}}</ref> This is equivalent to 86% of [[Sai Kung District]]'s total population. \n\nAmong the residents of Tseung Kwan O, 42% live in private housing, 34% in some form of subsidized home ownership housing (e.g. [[Home Ownership Scheme|HOS]] courts) and 23% in [[Public housing in Hong Kong|public rental housing]].<ref name=2016bycensus/> Each of 4 more well-developed neighbourhoods in the new town, namely [[Po Lam]], [[Hang Hau]], Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and [[Tiu Keng Leng]], is a combination of the above 3 types of housing clustering around a metro station. Private housing estates usually come in the form of podium-tower structures, where the podium levels are [[shopping mall]]s. Most [[public housing estates in Tseung Kwan O]] are equipped with their own shopping malls as well, although mostly smaller in size than their private counterparts.\n\nThe [[LOHAS Park]] residential project in the southern part of the new town will become the largest single residential enclave in Hong Kong, with 50 high-rises skyscrapers from 46 to 76 floors high after its full completion in 2025.\n\nA handful of pre-existing indigenous villages are also retained in the new town design.\n\n==Economy==\nTseung Kwan O displays the characteristics of a [[commuter town]] as only less than 10% of the workforce living there works within the same district, according to the 2016 Population By-census.<ref name=2016bycensus/>\n\n===Industries===\n[[File:Tseung_Kwan_O_Industrial_Area_201705.jpg|thumb|A bird's-eye view of [[Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate]]]]\n[[Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate]] is located in the southeastern part of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hkstp.org/en/our-stories/our-footprint/tseung-kwan-o-industrial-estate/|title=Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate|publisher=[[Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation]]|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> Apart from various manufacturing industries that could not be housed in conventional multi-storey industrial buildings, the estate is also where a number of mass media outlets locate their headquarters at, including [[TVB City]], the headquarters of Hong Kong's largest television broadcaster, and news agencies like ''[[Apple Daily]]'' and ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]''. The industrial estate hosts a high concentration of [[data centre]]s due to the fact that three out of the eight [[submarine communications cable]]s connecting to Hong Kong make their [[cable landing point|landfall]] at the marine frontage of the estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/industry_focus/telecommunications/facility_based/infrastructures/submarine_cables/index.html|title=Landing of Submarine Cables in Hong Kong|publisher=[[Office of the Communications Authority]]|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgthkdc2.com/prime-location/|title=Prime Location|publisher=TGT Hong Kong Data Centre 2|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nBus routes 797M ([[New World First Bus|NWFB]]) and 298E ([[Kowloon Motor Bus|KMB]]) connect the industrial estate to southern Tseung Kwan O. A spur line of the MTR's [[Tseung Kwan O Line]] to the [[LOHAS Park]] station was completed in July 2009 and provides easy access to the industrial estate from [[Kowloon]] and [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\n===Shopping complexes===\n[[File:Tseung Kwan O Plaza Mall.jpg|thumb|Shopping mall of Tseung Kwan O Plaza]]\nTseung Kwan O has several major shopping complexes, all sitting atop of or in close proximity to MTR stations. The largest shopping centre in the new town now is [[Metro City (Hong Kong)|Metro City Plaza]], which boasts three phases surrounding [[Po Lam station|Po Lam MTR Station]].\n\n[[Hang Hau Station|Hang Hau MTR Station]] is surrounded by an extensive network of mid-sized shopping arcades linked by footbridges. The mainstay of this multifarious complex is [[East Point City]].\n\nTseung Kwan O Town Centre ([[Tseung Kwan O Station|Tseung Kwan O MTR Station]]) is home to [[Park Central (Hong Kong)|Park Central]], PopCorn, and [[Tseung Kwan O Plaza]].\n\nThere will be an iconic 480,000-square-foot MTR shopping mall The LOHAS, with the largest indoor ice rink in Hong Kong and the largest cinema in Tseung Kwan O. There will be supermarkets and alfresco dining areas in the mall too. The mall is atop the MTR LOHAS Park Station.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n====Rail====\n[[File:Hang Hau Station Exterior View 201405.jpg|thumb|[[Hang Hau Station]] on the lower levels of the Residence Oasis development]]\nTseung Kwan O is linked to urban [[Hong Kong Island]] by the namesake [[Tseung Kwan O Line]] of the [[MTR]] metro system. The commutes from Po Lam and Tiu Keng Leng to [[Central District, Hong Kong|Central District]] take 31 and 24 minutes, respectively. Currently the line calls at five stations in the new town: [[Tiu Keng Leng Station|Tiu Keng Leng]], [[Tseung Kwan O Station|Tseung Kwan O]], [[Hang Hau Station|Hang Hau]], [[Po Lam Station|Po Lam]], and [[LOHAS Park Station|LOHAS Park]]. [[Tiu Keng Leng Station]] is also the terminus of MTR's [[Kwun Tong Line]] which connects the town with [[Kowloon East]]. All MTR stations within the new town are either connected to or in the proximity of shopping centres and large private housing developments.\n\n====Bus services====\n[[File:Hang Hau (North) Public Transport Interchange.JPG|thumb|Hang Hau (North) Bus Terminus]]\nThe new town is also well-covered by the local public [[Buses in Hong Kong|bus]] and [[Public light bus|minibus]] network. As of November 2019, a total of 50 bus routes ply between Tseung Kwan O and other districts of Hong Kong. Another 3 operate entirely within the new town. These are complemented by 37 [[green minibus]] routes. On the other hand, [[red minibus]]es are banned from entering Tseung Kwan O.\n\nHong Kong's three major bus operators all have [[List of bus routes in Hong Kong|routes]] serving Tseung Kwan O. [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], the major bus operator in the New Territories, serves mainly [[Po Lam]] and [[Hang Hau]] areas. Having successfully tendered for a package of bus routes serving southern Tseung Kwan O, [[New World First Bus]] now operates an extensive network serving [[Tiu Keng Leng]], Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and most of the town's southern part. The new town is linked to the [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] at Chek Lap Kok by a handful of [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] routes. \n\nBus termini could be found at [[Metro City (Hong Kong)|Metro City Plaza]] in Po Lam; [[Tsui Lam Estate]] and [[Hong Sing Garden]] in Tsui Lam; Hang Hau Station and Hang Hau (North) in Hang Hau; Tseung Kwan O Station and [[Sheung Tak Estate]] in Tseung Kwan O Town Centre; Tiu Keng Leng Station and [[Kin Ming Estate]] in Tiu Keng Leng; as well as at [[Oscar by the Sea]], [[LOHAS Park]] and the Industrial Estate in the town's southeastern part.\n\n====Road network====\nPart of [[Route 7 (Hong Kong)|Route 7]], the [[Tseung Kwan O Tunnel]] acts as the major road link between Tseung Kwan O and urban [[Kowloon]]. Other main roads leading to Tseung Kwan O include:\n* [[Po Lam Road]], connected to Kwun Tong.\n* Hang Hau Road and Ying Yip Road, connected to [[Sai Kung Town|Sai Kung]] and [[Clear Water Bay]].\n* Wan Po Road, connected to Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate.\n\nThe [[Tseung Kwan O \u2013 Lam Tin Tunnel]] currently under construction is set to alleviate the heavy pressure on Tseung Kwan O Tunnel. Together with the [[Cross Bay Link]] road bridge to be built across Junk Bay, the linkage between southeastern Tseung Kwan O and Kowloon will be strengthened.<ref name=cbl>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbltko.hk/en/needs.php|title=We need Cross Bay Link|website=Cross Bay Link, Tseung Kwan O|publisher=[[Civil Engineering and Development Department]]|accessdate=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n===Healthcare===\n[[File:TKO_Hospital.jpg|thumb|[[Tseung Kwan O Hospital]]]]\n[[Tseung Kwan O Hospital]] in Hang Hau North is the only [[Health care#Secondary care|secondary care]] hospital within the new town boasting a 24-hour [[emergency department]]. \n\nSituated on the western slopes of Tseung Kwan O is [[Haven of Hope Hospital]], where subacute medical care, comprehensive rehabilitation and long-term care is provided.\n\nThe two hospitals are supplemented by public healthcare facilities like the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic and Po Ning Road Health Centre, as well as the numerous private physician practices scattered among the various residential areas in the new town.\n\n===Waste management===\n{{more|Waste management in Hong Kong}}\nEast of the [[Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate]] is the 10-hectare South East New Territories Landfill (SENT), one of the three remaining landfills in Hong Kong.\n\n==Culture and recreation==\n[[File:Hong_Kong_Velodrome_View1_201405.jpg|thumb|[[Hong Kong Velodrome]]]]\n[[File:TKO_football_training_grounds_filling_underway.jpg|thumb|[[Tseung Kwan O Football Training Centre]] under construction]]\nTseung Kwan O's largest cultural and recreational complex is situated by the road interchange at the end of Tseung Kwan O Tunnel Road. It comprises a swimming Pool, an [[Leisure centre|indoor games hall]] and a public library. Additional sports centres are available in Po Lam Estate, Hang Hau and Tiu Keng Leng, albeit smaller in size. Tseung Kwan O still lacks a performing arts centre, however.\n\nLocated between Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and Hang Hau, [[Tseung Kwan O Sports Ground]] was built for the [[2009 East Asian Games]]. It was completed in early 2009 and started to host [[Hong Kong Premier League|top-division football]] matches afterwards. The adjacent [[Hong Kong Velodrome]] has also hosted world-class cycling events like the [[2017 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]], since its completion in 2013.\n\n[[Tseung Kwan O Football Training Centre]] is being developed to deliver six state of the art pitches; three artificial and three natural. It is being funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, spearheaded by [[Hong Kong Football Association]], and constructed by Projexasia.\n\nThere are two [[public library|public libraries]] in Tseung Kwan O. The amphitheatre-shaped Tseung Kwan O Public Library, which opened in 2001, is part of the new town's largest recreational complex mentioned above.<ref>[https://www.fso-createhk.gov.hk/en/locations_search_details.php?File_No=00726&search_type=1& Film Services Office Location Library - Tseung Kwan O Public Library]</ref> It was the only library in the new town until 2015, when the Tiu Keng Leng Public Library was established. Both libraries belong to the [[Hong Kong Public Libraries]] system managed by the [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]].\n\n==Education==\n[[File:HKDI_201001.JPG|thumb|The purpose-built campus of the [[Hong Kong Design Institute]] in Tiu Keng Leng]]\nTseung Kwan O has an array of 24 primary schools and 24 secondary schools teaching the local curriculum, scattering across its major residential areas. There are also more than 40 kindergartens in the new town. In 2018, the [[French International School of Hong Kong]] and Shrewsbury International School Hong Kong opened their campuses in the new town.\n\n[[Tiu Keng Leng]] is home to the [[Hong Kong Design Institute]] and Lee Wai Lee Campus of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education]] (IVE), two [[vocational education]] establishments operated by the [[Vocational Training Council]]. [[Caritas Institute of Higher Education]] is also located in the same neighbourhood. Although not located within the new town's boundaries, [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology|The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] is only a 10-minute ride from [[Hang Hau]] in the new town.\n\nThe [[Fire and Ambulance Services Academy]], where all new recruits of the [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department]] are trained, is located in [[Pak Shing Kok]] of Tseung Kwan O South.\n\n==Photo gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Dusk view of Tseung Kwan O Swimming Pool and Sports Centre.JPG|Tseung Kwan O Library at Dusk\nImage:Tseung Kwan O Swimming Pool and Sports Centre.JPG|Tseung Kwan O Swimming Pool and Sports Centre.\nImage:Tseung Kwan O Village 2004.jpg|Tseung Kwan O Village\nImage:Tsui Lam Estate.jpg|Tsui Lam Estate\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of buildings, sites and areas in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Public Housing Estates in Tseung Kwan O]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070211120930/http://www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/about/achievements/regional/regi_tko.htm Civil Engineering and Development Department: Tseung Kwan O New Town]\n* [http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hong_kong_statistics/statistical_tables/index.jsp Census and Statistics Department: Statistical Tables]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/sk/english/welcome/welcome.html Sai Kung District Council]\n* [http://www.info.gov.hk/eac/pdf/distco/maps/dc2003q1.pdf Electoral Boundary Map 1]\n* [http://www.info.gov.hk/eac/pdf/distco/maps/dc2003q2.pdf Electoral Boundary Map 2]\n* [https://www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/about-us/achievements/land/regional-development/e1-tseung-kwan-o-new-town/index.html Tseung Kwan O New Town] - Civil Engineering and Development Department\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211213606/http://tkoweb.info/ The Website of Tseung Kwan O (Informal) \u2013 Chinese Version Only]\n{{Sai Kung District}}\n{{HK new towns}}\n{{coord|22.3043|114.2494|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:New towns in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Tseung Kwan O| ]]\n[[Category:Sai Kung District]]\n[[Category:New towns started in the 1980s]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{redirect|Tseung Kwan O|the water body|Junk Bay}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name = Tseung Kwan O \n| native_name = \u5c07\u8ecd\u6fb3\n| image_skyline = Tseung Kwan O Overview 201406.jpg\n| image_alt = \n| image_caption = Tseung Kwan O New Town\n| coordinates = \n| subdivision_type = [[Special administrative region|SAR]]\n| subdivision_name = [[Hong Kong]]\n| subdivision_type1 = [[Districts of Hong Kong|District]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Sai Kung District|Sai Kung]]\n| established_title = Development began\n| established_date = Late 1980s\n| unit_pref = Metric\n| area_total_km2 = 10.05\n| population_total = 396,000\n| population_as_of = 2016\n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| website = [http://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/sk/tc www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/sk/tc]\n}}\n{{Chinese\n|t=\u5c07\u8ecd\u6fb3\u65b0\u5e02\u93ae\n|s=\u5c06\u519b\u6fb3\u65b0\u5e02\u9547\n|j=Zoeng1 gwan1 ou3 san1 si5 zan3\n|y=J\u0113ung gw\u0101n ou s\u0101n s\u00edh jan\n|p=Ji\u0101ng J\u016bn \u00c0o X\u012bnsh\u00eczh\u00e8n\n}}\n\n'''Tseung Kwan O New Town''' ({{zh|t=\u5c07\u8ecd\u6fb3\u65b0\u5e02\u93ae}}) is one of the nine [[New towns of Hong Kong|new town]]s in Hong Kong, built mainly on [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaimed land]] in the northern half of [[Tseung Kwan O|Junk Bay]] (also known as Tseung Kwan O) in southeastern [[New Territories]], after which it is named.\n\nDevelopment of the new town was approved in 1982, with the initial population intake occurring in 1988.

The project was postponed for a long time owing to the extensive scale of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclamation]] in the bay, which is rather deep. The project finally took off under the name of Tseung Kwan O in 1983, when the development of the new town's Phase I was endorsed by the [[Governor-in-Council]].<ref name=pland>{{cite web |url=https://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/press/publication/nt_pamphlet02/tko_html/hist.html |title=Tseung Kwan O: Historical Background |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=[[Planning Department (Hong Kong)|Planning Department]] |access-date=2018-10-12 |quote=}}</ref> This was followed by the decision to proceed with Phase II, which entailed further reclamation and the clearance of the Kuomintang refugee village at [[Tiu Keng Leng|Rennie's Mill]] (later renamed [[Tiu Keng Leng]]), with a view to increase the planned population from 175,000 to 325,000.<ref name=pland/> The first families moved in to the new town in 1988 when public housing at the Head of the Bay ([[Po Lam Estate]]) was completed.<ref name=pland/>\n\nThe New Town was developed in three phases. The first phase encompasses Northern Tseung Kwan O, which includes [[Po Lam Station|Po Lam MTR Station]] and [[Hang Hau Station]], while the second and third phase comprise Southern Tseung Kwan O, which includes [[Tseung Kwan O Station]] (Town Centre) and [[Tiu Keng Leng Station]].\n* Phase I \u2013 [[Hang Hau]], [[Po Lam]], Siu Chik Sha, Tsui Lam\n* Phase II \u2013 Town Centre North, [[Tiu Keng Leng]]\n* Phase III \u2013 Town Centre South, [[Pak Shing Kok]], Tai Chik Sha\n\nThe design of the new town was highly [[Transit-oriented development|transit-oriented]]. Developments centred along the [[MTR]]-corridor, with more than 80% of the population living within five minutes of an MTR station, with huge residential complexes surrounding the MTR stations. As most of the residential complexes surrounds the MTR station, [[urban open space]] are usually planned at the periphery of each neighbourhood in Tseung Kwan O. Neighbourhoods are therefore separated by parks.\n\n==Geography==\nTseung Kwan O is located near the southeastern tip of the [[New Territories]] mainland, {{convert|9|to|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-southeast from the [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] of Hong Kong.\n\nThe town is bounded on the south by the namesake [[Junk Bay]], known as Tseung Kwan O (\u5c07\u8ecd\u6fb3) in Chinese. Most of the residential developments in the new town stand on land reclaimed from the bay. The mountains of [[Devil's Peak, Hong Kong|Devil's Peak]], Chiu Keng Wan Shan, Black Hill and Tai Sheung Tok form the new town's western boundary, where it borders [[Kwun Tong District]] of [[Kowloon]]. Lying to the north and southeast of the town are [[Razor Hill]] and [[High Junk Peak]], which separate the new town from the rural parts of [[Sai Kung District]].\n\nThe whole of Tseung Kwan O belongs to [[Sai Kung District]], part of the New Territories. The town is, however, situated far away from other major population centres of the New Territories, and is instead in close proximity with [[Kwun Tong]] in Kowloon. While the town is entirely within the [[New Territories East (constituency)|New Territories East geographical constituency]], a number of governmental bodies and large corporations would, for the sake of administrative convenience, classify Tseung Kwan O as part of Kowloon East, adding to the confusion of the town's residents. For example, the [[Hospital Authority]] places Tseung Kwan O under its [[Kowloon East Cluster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ha.org.hk/visitor/ha_visitor_text_index.asp?Content_ID=10178&Lang=ENG|title=Introduction of Clusters: Kowloon East Cluster|website=[[Hospital Authority]]|publisher=[[Hospital Authority]]|accessdate=2018-12-24}}</ref> From 1992 to 2017 Tseung Kwan O had been [[Hong Kong Police Force|policed]] under the Tseung Kwan O Division of the Kwun Tong Police District, and the upgraded Tseung Kwan O Police District still belongs to the Kowloon East Police Region.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201707/21/P2017072100570.htm|title=Establishment of Tseung Kwan O Police District|publisher=The Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|date=2017-07-21}}</ref> It is under such a situation that the new town is often incorrectly, or intentionally, referred to as part of Kowloon. This is illustrated by the fact that the two hotels in Tseung Kwan O are named [[Crowne Plaza]] Hong Kong Kowloon East and Holiday Inn Express Hong Kong Kowloon East.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:Tsang Kwan O The Wings View1 201305.jpg|thumb|Two hotels complex in Tseung Kwan O Town Centre]]\nThe development of Tseung Kwan O New Town commenced from the head of the original inlet, on reclaimed land in front of the original indigenous villages of Tseung Kwan O and Yau Yue Wan. The [[Po Lam]] neighbourhood is where the earliest developments in the new town could be found. Notably, [[Po Lam Estate]] (1988) was the first residential development in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.housingauthority.gov.hk/en/global-elements/estate-locator/detail.html?propertyType=1&id=2772|title=Housing Authority Property Location and Profile|publisher=[[Hong Kong Housing Authority]]|accessdate=2019-11-04}}</ref> [[Metro City (Hong Kong)|Metro City Plaza]], with its three phases surrounding the [[Po Lam Station|MTR terminus]], remains the largest shopping mall in the new town.\n\nTo the southeast of Po Lam lies the residential neighbourhood of [[Hang Hau]]. It was once a small market town that served the whole of [[Clear Water Bay Peninsula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pland.gov.hk/pland_en/press/publication/nt_pamphlet02/tko_html/hist.html|title=Pamphlets on Planning for New Territories > Tseung Kwan O > Historical Background|publisher=[[Planning Department (Hong Kong)|Planning Department]]|accessdate=2019-11-04}}</ref> and was also a hub for [[ship breaking]] industries. When the new town was developed, residents of Hang Hau Town were resited into the Hang Hau Town Resite Area at the neighbourhood's northern edge, known presently as Hang Hau Village. The reclaimed part of Hang Hau is now home to a number of residential developments as well as community facilities such as the [[Tseung Kwan O Hospital|District Hospital]] and [[Sai Kung District Council]] facilities.\n\nTseung Kwan O Town Centre refers to the area to the south of Po Lam, southwest of Hang Hau and east of Tiu Keng Leng. Centered on MTR [[Tseung Kwan O Station]], this is the major growth area in the new town where new residential developments are being built. The development of the town centre commenced with the construction of [[Sheung Tak Estate]] in 1998. It has since been extended southwards to the shoreline of Junk Bay. Early private residential developments in the area include [[Sun Hung Kai Properties]]' [[Park Central (Hong Kong)|Park Central]] (2002)<ref>http://www.park-central.com.hk/chi/home.html</ref> and The Wings (2012),<ref>http://www.shkp.com/en-US/Pages/hkproperties-residential</ref><ref>http://www.thewingsii.com.hk/</ref><ref>http://ps.hket.com/project/239</ref> and [[Nan Fung Group]]'s Tseung Kwan O Plaza (2004).<ref>[http://www.tkoplazahk.com/ Official website of Tseung Kwan O Plaza] Retrieved 2011-09-18</ref>\n\n[[Tiu Keng Leng]] (formerly Rennie's Mill) was once a cottage area housing [[refugee]]s who settled in Hong Kong after [[Kuomintang]]'s defeat in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The refugee village was cleared before the [[Handover of Hong Kong|handover]]. It has since been redeveloped into a mid-size high-rise residential neighbourhood.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe 2016 Population By-census records the population of Tseung Kwan O New Town at 398,479, a 7.12% increase from 2011.<ref name=2016bycensus>{{cite web|url=https://www.bycensus2016.gov.hk/en/bc-dp-new-town.html|title=District Profiles|website=2016 Population By-census|publisher=[[Census and Statistics Department (Hong Kong)|Census and Statistics Department]]|accessdate=2018-10-12}}</ref> This is equivalent to 86% of [[Sai Kung District]]'s total population. \n\nAmong the residents of Tseung Kwan O, 42% live in private housing, 34% in some form of subsidized home ownership housing (e.g. [[Home Ownership Scheme|HOS]] courts) and 23% in [[Public housing in Hong Kong|public rental housing]].<ref name=2016bycensus/> Each of 4 more well-developed neighbourhoods in the new town, namely [[Po Lam]], [[Hang Hau]], Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and [[Tiu Keng Leng]], is a combination of the above 3 types of housing clustering around a metro station. Private housing estates usually come in the form of podium-tower structures, where the podium levels are [[shopping mall]]s. Most [[public housing estates in Tseung Kwan O]] are equipped with their own shopping malls as well, although mostly smaller in size than their private counterparts.\n\nThe [[LOHAS Park]] residential project in the southern part of the new town will become the largest single residential enclave in Hong Kong, with 50 high-rises skyscrapers from 46 to 76 floors high after its full completion in 2025.\n\nA handful of pre-existing indigenous villages are also retained in the new town design.\n\n==Economy==\nTseung Kwan O displays the characteristics of a [[commuter town]] as only less than 10% of the workforce living there works within the same district, according to the 2016 Population By-census.<ref name=2016bycensus/>\n\n===Industries===\n[[File:Tseung_Kwan_O_Industrial_Area_201705.jpg|thumb|A bird's-eye view of [[Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate]]]]\n[[Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate]] is located in the southeastern part of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hkstp.org/en/our-stories/our-footprint/tseung-kwan-o-industrial-estate/|title=Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate|publisher=[[Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation]]|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> Apart from various manufacturing industries that could not be housed in conventional multi-storey industrial buildings, the estate is also where a number of mass media outlets locate their headquarters at, including [[TVB City]], the headquarters of Hong Kong's largest television broadcaster, and news agencies like ''[[Apple Daily]]'' and ''[[Sing Tao Daily]]''. The industrial estate hosts a high concentration of [[data centre]]s due to the fact that three out of the eight [[submarine communications cable]]s connecting to Hong Kong make their [[cable landing point|landfall]] at the marine frontage of the estate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ofca.gov.hk/en/industry_focus/telecommunications/facility_based/infrastructures/submarine_cables/index.html|title=Landing of Submarine Cables in Hong Kong|publisher=[[Office of the Communications Authority]]|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgthkdc2.com/prime-location/|title=Prime Location|publisher=TGT Hong Kong Data Centre 2|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\nBus routes 797M ([[New World First Bus|NWFB]]) and 298E ([[Kowloon Motor Bus|KMB]]) connect the industrial estate to southern Tseung Kwan O. A spur line of the MTR's [[Tseung Kwan O Line]] to the [[LOHAS Park]] station was completed in July 2009 and provides easy access to the industrial estate from [[Kowloon]] and [[Hong Kong Island]].\n\n===Shopping complexes===\n[[File:Tseung Kwan O Plaza Mall.jpg|thumb|Shopping mall of Tseung Kwan O Plaza]]\nTseung Kwan O has several major shopping complexes, all sitting atop of or in close proximity to MTR stations. The largest shopping centre in the new town now is [[Metro City (Hong Kong)|Metro City Plaza]], which boasts three phases surrounding [[Po Lam station|Po Lam MTR Station]].\n\n[[Hang Hau Station|Hang Hau MTR Station]] is surrounded by an extensive network of mid-sized shopping arcades linked by footbridges. The mainstay of this multifarious complex is [[East Point City]].\n\nTseung Kwan O Town Centre ([[Tseung Kwan O Station|Tseung Kwan O MTR Station]]) is home to [[Park Central (Hong Kong)|Park Central]], PopCorn, and [[Tseung Kwan O Plaza]].\n\nThere will be an iconic 480,000-square-foot MTR shopping mall The LOHAS, with the largest indoor ice rink in Hong Kong and the largest cinema in Tseung Kwan O. There will be supermarkets and alfresco dining areas in the mall too. The mall is atop the MTR LOHAS Park Station.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n====Rail====\n[[File:Hang Hau Station Exterior View 201405.jpg|thumb|[[Hang Hau Station]] on the lower levels of the Residence Oasis development]]\nTseung Kwan O is linked to urban [[Hong Kong Island]] by the namesake [[Tseung Kwan O Line]] of the [[MTR]] metro system. The commutes from Po Lam and Tiu Keng Leng to [[Central District, Hong Kong|Central District]] take 31 and 24 minutes, respectively. Currently the line calls at five stations in the new town: [[Tiu Keng Leng Station|Tiu Keng Leng]], [[Tseung Kwan O Station|Tseung Kwan O]], [[Hang Hau Station|Hang Hau]], [[Po Lam Station|Po Lam]], and [[LOHAS Park Station|LOHAS Park]]. [[Tiu Keng Leng Station]] is also the terminus of MTR's [[Kwun Tong Line]] which connects the town with [[Kowloon East]]. All MTR stations within the new town are either connected to or in the proximity of shopping centres and large private housing developments.\n\n====Bus services====\n[[File:Hang Hau (North) Public Transport Interchange.JPG|thumb|Hang Hau (North) Bus Terminus]]\nThe new town is also well-covered by the local public [[Buses in Hong Kong|bus]] and [[Public light bus|minibus]] network. As of November 2019, a total of 50 bus routes ply between Tseung Kwan O and other districts of Hong Kong. Another 3 operate entirely within the new town. These are complemented by 37 [[green minibus]] routes. On the other hand, [[red minibus]]es are banned from entering Tseung Kwan O.\n\nHong Kong's three major bus operators all have [[List of bus routes in Hong Kong|routes]] serving Tseung Kwan O. [[Kowloon Motor Bus]], the major bus operator in the New Territories, serves mainly [[Po Lam]] and [[Hang Hau]] areas. Having successfully tendered for a package of bus routes serving southern Tseung Kwan O, [[New World First Bus]] now operates an extensive network serving [[Tiu Keng Leng]], Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and most of the town's southern part. The new town is linked to the [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] at Chek Lap Kok by a handful of [[Citybus (Hong Kong)|Citybus]] routes. \n\nBus termini could be found at [[Metro City (Hong Kong)|Metro City Plaza]] in Po Lam; [[Tsui Lam Estate]] and [[Hong Sing Garden]] in Tsui Lam; Hang Hau Station and Hang Hau (North) in Hang Hau; Tseung Kwan O Station and [[Sheung Tak Estate]] in Tseung Kwan O Town Centre; Tiu Keng Leng Station and [[Kin Ming Estate]] in Tiu Keng Leng; as well as at [[Oscar by the Sea]], [[LOHAS Park]] and the Industrial Estate in the town's southeastern part.\n\n====Road network====\nPart of [[Route 7 (Hong Kong)|Route 7]], the [[Tseung Kwan O Tunnel]] acts as the major road link between Tseung Kwan O and urban [[Kowloon]]. Other main roads leading to Tseung Kwan O include:\n* [[Po Lam Road]], connected to Kwun Tong.\n* Hang Hau Road and Ying Yip Road, connected to [[Sai Kung Town|Sai Kung]] and [[Clear Water Bay]].\n* Wan Po Road, connected to Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate.\n\nThe [[Tseung Kwan O \u2013 Lam Tin Tunnel]] currently under construction is set to alleviate the heavy pressure on Tseung Kwan O Tunnel. Together with the [[Cross Bay Link]] road bridge to be built across Junk Bay, the linkage between southeastern Tseung Kwan O and Kowloon will be strengthened.<ref name=cbl>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbltko.hk/en/needs.php|title=We need Cross Bay Link|website=Cross Bay Link, Tseung Kwan O|publisher=[[Civil Engineering and Development Department]]|accessdate=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n===Healthcare===\n[[File:TKO_Hospital.jpg|thumb|[[Tseung Kwan O Hospital]]]]\n[[Tseung Kwan O Hospital]] in Hang Hau North is the only [[Health care#Secondary care|secondary care]] hospital within the new town boasting a 24-hour [[emergency department]]. \n\nSituated on the western slopes of Tseung Kwan O is [[Haven of Hope Hospital]], where subacute medical care, comprehensive rehabilitation and long-term care is provided.\n\nThe two hospitals are supplemented by public healthcare facilities like the Tseung Kwan O Jockey Club General Out-patient Clinic and Po Ning Road Health Centre, as well as the numerous private physician practices scattered among the various residential areas in the new town.\n\n===Waste management===\n{{more|Waste management in Hong Kong}}\nEast of the [[Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate]] is the 10-hectare South East New Territories Landfill (SENT), one of the three remaining landfills in Hong Kong.\n\n==Culture and recreation==\n[[File:Hong_Kong_Velodrome_View1_201405.jpg|thumb|[[Hong Kong Velodrome]]]]\n[[File:TKO_football_training_grounds_filling_underway.jpg|thumb|[[Tseung Kwan O Football Training Centre]] under construction]]\nTseung Kwan O's largest cultural and recreational complex is situated by the road interchange at the end of Tseung Kwan O Tunnel Road. It comprises a swimming Pool, an [[Leisure centre|indoor games hall]] and a public library. Additional sports centres are available in Po Lam Estate, Hang Hau and Tiu Keng Leng, albeit smaller in size. Tseung Kwan O still lacks a performing arts centre, however.\n\nLocated between Tseung Kwan O Town Centre and Hang Hau, [[Tseung Kwan O Sports Ground]] was built for the [[2009 East Asian Games]]. It was completed in early 2009 and started to host [[Hong Kong Premier League|top-division football]] matches afterwards. The adjacent [[Hong Kong Velodrome]] has also hosted world-class cycling events like the [[2017 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]], since its completion in 2013.\n\n[[Tseung Kwan O Football Training Centre]] is being developed to deliver six state of the art pitches; three artificial and three natural. It is being funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, spearheaded by [[Hong Kong Football Association]], and constructed by Projexasia.\n\nThere are two [[public library|public libraries]] in Tseung Kwan O. The amphitheatre-shaped Tseung Kwan O Public Library, which opened in 2001, is part of the new town's largest recreational complex mentioned above.<ref>[https://www.fso-createhk.gov.hk/en/locations_search_details.php?File_No=00726&search_type=1& Film Services Office Location Library - Tseung Kwan O Public Library]</ref> It was the only library in the new town until 2015, when the Tiu Keng Leng Public Library was established. Both libraries belong to the [[Hong Kong Public Libraries]] system managed by the [[Leisure and Cultural Services Department]].\n\n==Education==\n[[File:HKDI_201001.JPG|thumb|The purpose-built campus of the [[Hong Kong Design Institute]] in Tiu Keng Leng]]\nTseung Kwan O has an array of 24 primary schools and 24 secondary schools teaching the local curriculum, scattering across its major residential areas. There are also more than 40 kindergartens in the new town. In 2018, the [[French International School of Hong Kong]] and Shrewsbury International School Hong Kong opened their campuses in the new town.\n\n[[Tiu Keng Leng]] is home to the [[Hong Kong Design Institute]] and Lee Wai Lee Campus of the [[Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education]] (IVE), two [[vocational education]] establishments operated by the [[Vocational Training Council]]. [[Caritas Institute of Higher Education]] is also located in the same neighbourhood. Although not located within the new town's boundaries, [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology|The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] is only a 10-minute ride from [[Hang Hau]] in the new town.\n\nThe [[Fire and Ambulance Services Academy]], where all new recruits of the [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department]] are trained, is located in [[Pak Shing Kok]] of Tseung Kwan O South.\n\n==Photo gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Dusk view of Tseung Kwan O Swimming Pool and Sports Centre.JPG|Tseung Kwan O Library at Dusk\nImage:Tseung Kwan O Swimming Pool and Sports Centre.JPG|Tseung Kwan O Swimming Pool and Sports Centre.\nImage:Tseung Kwan O Village 2004.jpg|Tseung Kwan O Village\nImage:Tsui Lam Estate.jpg|Tsui Lam Estate\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of buildings, sites and areas in Hong Kong]]\n* [[Public Housing Estates in Tseung Kwan O]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070211120930/http://www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/about/achievements/regional/regi_tko.htm Civil Engineering and Development Department: Tseung Kwan O New Town]\n* [http://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hong_kong_statistics/statistical_tables/index.jsp Census and Statistics Department: Statistical Tables]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.districtcouncils.gov.hk/sk/english/welcome/welcome.html Sai Kung District Council]\n* [http://www.info.gov.hk/eac/pdf/distco/maps/dc2003q1.pdf Electoral Boundary Map 1]\n* [http://www.info.gov.hk/eac/pdf/distco/maps/dc2003q2.pdf Electoral Boundary Map 2]\n* [https://www.cedd.gov.hk/eng/about-us/achievements/land/regional-development/e1-tseung-kwan-o-new-town/index.html Tseung Kwan O New Town] - Civil Engineering and Development Department\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211213606/http://tkoweb.info/ The Website of Tseung Kwan O (Informal) \u2013 Chinese Version Only]\n{{Sai Kung District}}\n{{HK new towns}}\n{{coord|22.3043|114.2494|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:New towns in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Tseung Kwan O| ]]\n[[Category:Sai Kung District]]\n[[Category:New towns started in the 1980s]]\n", "name_user": "119.237.153.66", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseung_Kwan_O_New_Town"}

With France, Thuram was a key player for the team that won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], his side also won [[UEFA Euro 2000]], and was in the runner-up squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. A quick, powerful and versatile player, he was capable of playing both as a [[centre-back]] or as a [[Right back (association football)|right-back]], and was competent both offensively and defensively.

He then transferred to [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] (1996\u20132001) and then to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (2001\u20132006) for \u00a325&nbsp;million, and eventually to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2006.\n\n===Monaco===\nThuram started his professional career with [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in 1991. He only made one appearance that season, but was officially promoted to the first team the following season, when he would go on to make 19 appearances. He was inserted into the starting XI by the end of 1992 and would go on to make 155 league appearances for the [[Ligue 1]] outfit, before transferring to [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] in the summer of 1996. He made his national team debut in 1994, while at Monaco. With Monaco, he most notably won the [[1990\u201391 Coupe de France|Coupe de France in 1991]], also reaching the final of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup Winners' Cup]].\n\n===Parma===\nIn July 1996, Thuram made a high-profile transfer to Italy to join [[Serie A]] club Parma. In his first season, he made over 40 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring one goal, as Parma finished second in the [[1996\u201397 Serie A]] to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. He maintained a starting position in defence throughout his time with Parma, making 163 Serie A appearances and scoring one league goal. In all, he made over 200 appearances for the club, really making a name for himself, also earning caps for France. Following another overly impressive season in 2000\u201301, where Parma reached the [[2000\u201301 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia final]], and finishing the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|Serie A]] season in fourth place, Thuram,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/1394566.stm|title=Juve snatch Thuram|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 June 2001|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> along with teammate [[Gianluigi Buffon]], transferred to Juventus.

Thuram formed defensive partnerships with the likes of [[Ciro Ferrara]], [[Paolo Montero]], [[Gianluca Pessotto]], [[Mark Iuliano]], [[Alessandro Birindelli]], [[Igor Tudor]], [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Nicola Legrottaglie]], [[Fabio Cannavaro]], [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Federico Balzaretti]] and [[Jonathan Zebina]] during his five-year tenure with the club. In his first season with the club, as a right back under [[Marcello Lippi]], Thuram won the [[2001\u201302 Serie A]] title, also reaching the final of the [[2001\u201302 Coppa Italia]]. Juventus started the following season by winning the [[2002 Supercoppa Italiana]], and defended their [[2002\u201303 Serie A|Serie A title]], also reaching the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League final]], where they were defeated by rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] on penalties.\n\nJuventus won the [[2003 Supercoppa Italiana]] the following season, reaching another [[2003\u201304 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia final]], but finished in a disappointing 3rd place in [[2003\u201304 Serie A|Serie A]], and failed to progress past the second round in the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. During the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] and [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2005\u201306]] seasons under coach [[Fabio Capello]], Thuram, along with Fabio Cannavaro in the centre of defence, with [[Gianluigi Buffon]] in goal, {{fact span|date=December 2012|text=[[Gianluca Zambrotta]] at left back,}}, and {{fact span|date=December 2012|text=[[Jonathan Zebina]] at right back}} formed one of the most expensive, but also most feared, defences in Europe and Italy. During these next two seasons with the club, Thuram won the ''[[Scudetto]]'' two more times with Juventus, although these consecutive league titles were later revoked due to Juventus' involvement in the [[2006 Italian football scandal]] (''calciopoli''). After five years with Juve, Thuram transferred to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the Spanish [[La Liga]], in the wake of the ''calciopoli'' scandal. He managed over 200 total appearances for the club, with two goals.\n\n===Barcelona===\n\n[[Image:Lilian Thuram - 001.jpg|thumb|145px|<center>Thuram with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2008</center>]]\n\nOn 24 July 2006, Thuram signed with Barcelona for \u20ac5&nbsp;million after Juventus were relegated to [[Serie B]] due to the ''calciopoli'' scandal.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120803221330/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/historic_noticies/futbol/06/Juliol/n06072408.html \"Thuram Signs Contract\"].

Thuram's [[centre back]] partnership with [[William Gallas]] was to be the foundation for France's progression to the final. Thuram earned his 116th cap for France in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group G|group stage match]] against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]] in [[Leipzig]] on 18 June 2006. In that game he equalled Desailly's record number of caps, which he broke in the final group stage match, a 2\u20130 win over [[Togo national football team|Togo]] in [[Cologne]] on 23 June 2006, winning his 117th cap. He was named the [[man of the match]] in France's semi-final 1\u20130 victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], coincidentally the same distinction he had earned eight years earlier at the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup.\n\n===Euro 2008===\nOn 9 June 2008, Thuram took the field against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in a group match, and became the first player to make 15 [[UEFA European Championship]] finals appearances.

Calcio 1913|Parma]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. With France, Thuram was a key player for the team that won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], his side also won [[UEFA Euro 2000]], and was in the runner-up squad for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. A quick, powerful and versatile player, he was capable of playing both as a [[centre-back]] or as a [[Right back (association football)|right-back]], and was competent both offensively and defensively. Despite his physical and aggressive playing style, Thuram has been described as a \"studious\" figure off the pitch;<ref name=\"Euro 2000 Profile: Lilian Thuram\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/france/squad/744708.stm|title=Euro 2000 Profile: Lilian Thuram|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref> in 2010, he became a [[UNICEF]] ambassador, and has stood out for his initiatives to fight against racism.<ref name=\"Thuram a Treviso contro il razzismo\">{{cite web|url=http://treviso24.tv/news/il-campione-lilian-thuram-treviso-contro-il-razzismo.html|title=Il campione Lilian Thuram a Treviso contro il razzismo|publisher=Treviso 24|language=Italian|accessdate=15 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915231101/http://treviso24.tv/news/il-campione-lilian-thuram-treviso-contro-il-razzismo.html|archivedate=15 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nThuram was born in [[Guadeloupe]] in the [[French West Indies]].

He then transferred to [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] (1996\u20132001) and then to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] (2001\u20132006) for \u00a325&nbsp;million, and eventually to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2006.\n\n===Monaco===\nThuram started his professional career with [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in 1991. He only made one appearance that season, but was officially promoted to the first team the following season, when he would go on to make 19 appearances. He was inserted into the starting XI by the end of 1992 and would go on to make 155 league appearances for the [[Ligue 1]] outfit, before transferring to [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] in the summer of 1996. He made his national team debut in 1994, while at Monaco. With Monaco, he most notably won the [[1990\u201391 Coupe de France|Coupe de France in 1991]], also reaching the final of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup Winners' Cup]].\n\n===Parma===\nIn July 1996, Thuram made a high-profile transfer to Italy to join [[Serie A]] club Parma. In his first season, he made over 40 appearances for the club in all competitions, scoring one goal, as Parma finished second in the [[1996\u201397 Serie A]] to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. He maintained a starting position in defence throughout his time with Parma, making 163 Serie A appearances and scoring one league goal. In all, he made over 200 appearances for the club, really making a name for himself, also earning caps for France. Following another overly impressive season in 2000\u201301, where Parma reached the [[2000\u201301 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia final]], and finishing the [[2000\u201301 Serie A|Serie A]] season in fourth place, Thuram,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/1394566.stm|title=Juve snatch Thuram|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 June 2001|accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> along with teammate [[Gianluigi Buffon]], transferred to Juventus.

Thuram formed defensive partnerships with the likes of [[Ciro Ferrara]], [[Paolo Montero]], [[Gianluca Pessotto]], [[Mark Iuliano]], [[Alessandro Birindelli]], [[Igor Tudor]], [[Gianluca Zambrotta]], [[Nicola Legrottaglie]], [[Fabio Cannavaro]], [[Giorgio Chiellini]], [[Federico Balzaretti]] and [[Jonathan Zebina]] during his five-year tenure with the club. In his first season with the club, as a right back under [[Marcello Lippi]], Thuram won the [[2001\u201302 Serie A]] title, also reaching the final of the [[2001\u201302 Coppa Italia]]. Juventus started the following season by winning the [[2002 Supercoppa Italiana]], and defended their [[2002\u201303 Serie A|Serie A title]], also reaching the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League final]], where they were defeated by rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] on penalties.\n\nJuventus won the [[2003 Supercoppa Italiana]] the following season, reaching another [[2003\u201304 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia final]], but finished in a disappointing 3rd place in [[2003\u201304 Serie A|Serie A]], and failed to progress past the second round in the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. During the [[2004\u201305 Serie A|2004\u201305]] and [[2005\u201306 Serie A|2005\u201306]] seasons under coach [[Fabio Capello]], Thuram, along with Fabio Cannavaro in the centre of defence, with [[Gianluigi Buffon]] in goal, {{fact span|date=December 2012|text=[[Gianluca Zambrotta]] at left back,}}, and {{fact span|date=December 2012|text=[[Jonathan Zebina]] at right back}} formed one of the most expensive, but also most feared, defences in Europe and Italy. During these next two seasons with the club, Thuram won the ''[[Scudetto]]'' two more times with Juventus, although these consecutive league titles were later revoked due to Juventus' involvement in the [[2006 Italian football scandal]] (''calciopoli''). After five years with Juve, Thuram transferred to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the Spanish [[La Liga]], in the wake of the ''calciopoli'' scandal. He managed over 200 total appearances for the club, with two goals.\n\n===Barcelona===\n\n[[Image:Lilian Thuram - 001.jpg|thumb|145px|<center>Thuram with [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 2008</center>]]\n\nOn 24 July 2006, Thuram signed with Barcelona for \u20ac5&nbsp;million after Juventus were relegated to [[Serie B]] due to the ''calciopoli'' scandal.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120803221330/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/historic_noticies/futbol/06/Juliol/n06072408.html \"Thuram Signs Contract\"].

Thuram's [[centre back]] partnership with [[William Gallas]] was to be the foundation for France's progression to the final. Thuram earned his 116th cap for France in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group G|group stage match]] against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]] in [[Leipzig]] on 18 June 2006. In that game he equalled Desailly's record number of caps, which he broke in the final group stage match, a 2\u20130 win over [[Togo national football team|Togo]] in [[Cologne]] on 23 June 2006, winning his 117th cap. He was named the [[man of the match]] in France's semi-final 1\u20130 victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], coincidentally the same distinction he had earned eight years earlier at the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup.\n\n===Euro 2008===\nOn 9 June 2008, Thuram took the field against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in a group match, and became the first player to make 15 [[UEFA European Championship]] finals appearances. The former record of 14 appearances was held by Zinedine Zidane, [[Lu\u00eds Figo]] and [[Karel Poborsk\u00fd]].<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=709189.html \"Thuram sets EURO appearance record\"].

In the serial, the [[First Doctor]] ([[William Hartnell]]), his granddaughter [[Susan Foreman]] ([[Carole Ann Ford]]), and teachers [[Ian Chesterton]] ([[William Russell (English actor)|William Russell]]) and [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]] ([[Jacqueline Hill]]) work with a human resistance group to travel to a Bedfordshire mine to stop the Daleks from mining out the Earth's core as part of their plan to pilot the Earth through space.\n\nThis serial marks the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford as [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] Susan.\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=June 2018}}\nAfter the [[TARDIS]] materialises, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] surmises from the surroundings that they have landed in London, only to find it in ruins.

Then, due to the decay of the surrounding buildings and grounds, a bridge collapse causes girders to fall across the TARDIS, rendering it inaccessible. Barbara stays with Susan while the Doctor and Ian explore, and the women are taken by a couple of refugees to a nearby shelter in an abandoned [[London Underground|Underground]] station. There they meet resistance members Dortmun (the leader), Carl Tyler, David Campbell, Jenny, Thomson, Baker, and Larry Madison. Dortmun, a paraplegic scientist, has been working on a special type of bomb to destroy the Daleks' outer casings, and he and the others are preparing for an assault on the local Dalek headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Ian stumble across a body wearing a strange metal helmet and soon find an army of them as a [[Dalek]] rises from the [[River Thames]]. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian, along with captured resistance members, including Jack Craddock, onboard their saucer, where they convert attempted escapees into [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Robomen|Robomen]]. Ian does not understand why the Daleks still exist since the travellers saw them defeated on Skaro (in ''[[The Daleks]]''), but the Doctor reminds him that was far in the future. David and Craddock explain that the Daleks invaded Earth in the aftermath of a meteorite bombardment and a \"new kind of plague\" ten years prior, where humanity became divided and Asia, Africa and South America were wiped out. Sensing that the Doctor is highly intelligent, the Daleks leave a device in the cell with the prisoners which the Doctor solves, enabling them to escape. However, the Daleks are laying in wait and recapture them, drugging the Doctor and sending him to be converted into a Roboman. But the Doctor's transfer operation breaks down while Susan, Barbara and the resistance team attack the Dalek force using the explosives created by Dortmun. But the bombs are ineffective against the Daleks, and several resistance members are injured or killed.  David and Susan rescue the Doctor while Barbara gets separated from them and is able to return to the Underground with Jenny to report back to Dortmun. Ian is unable to escape; he and Larry hide beneath a floor grating as the saucer leaves for the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire.\n\nBefore leaving London, the Daleks give orders to the Robomen to set firebombs to destroy the city. Hiding from the Robomen, David, Susan and the Doctor see them set up a bomb and leave. The Doctor, still too weak from being drugged, collapses, and David uses some quick thinking to disarm the bomb. He and Susan try to find an escape route through the sewers while the Doctor rests, and they are found by Tyler. After collecting the Doctor, who is starting to feel better, they escape the city and head for the mining operation. David and Susan start falling in love, but keep it a secret from the others. Meanwhile, Dortmun, Jenny and Barbara make their way to an abandoned museum also used by the resistance as a hideout. Dortmun, after leaving his notebook for Barbara to find, confronts the Daleks, sacrificing himself so that the women have a chance to escape. They get an old truck working and crash their way through the Daleks, heading for the mining operations as Barbara is convinced that that is where the Doctor would go. They make it most of the way there before the truck is destroyed by a Dalek saucer.\n\nAt the mine, Ian and Larry escape the saucer and meet workers named Wells and Ashton; the latter is killed by an aggressive creature called a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Slyther|Slyther]], a pet of the [[Dalek variants#Mark II Daleks|Black Dalek]]. The predator then falls from a suspended mine cart that Ian and Larry use to try to get away from it, and down a mineshaft to its death. The Daleks send the mine cart down the shaft before Ian and Larry can climb out, and they are plummeted down in the cart to the mine operations far underground.  The Doctor and his party arrive at the cliffs overlooking the mine, and he sends David and Susan on a mission to the far side of the cliffs to interfere with the radio signals the Daleks use to communicate with each other and the Robomen. The Doctor and Tyler begin climbing down into the mine. Barbara and Jenny find a hovel and, seeking shelter, meet two ragged women who are allowed to live on their own because they make clothing for the human slaves at the mine. These women pretend to befriend Barbara and Jenny before reporting them to the Daleks in return for food. The Daleks collect Barbara and Jenny and send them to work in the mine.\n\nAfter Larry is killed by his brother, who has been turned into a Roboman, Ian hides in the mine, eventually finding Wells again, and also seeing Barbara from a distance. Before he can get to her, however, he ends up hiding and being trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. Barbara uses Dortmun's notebook to bluff the Daleks into believing she has information about an imminent uprising and demands to speak with the Black Dalek. When she and Jenny are brought before it, they discover that the Daleks are drilling through the [[Earth]]'s crust so that they can blow out its core with a penetrative explosive capsule and then use a guidance system to pilot the planet around space. As the Daleks set the capsule in position and start the countdown, Ian scrambles the wiring inside the capsule, disarming it. When the shaft opens beneath the capsule, he escapes, but a Dalek cuts the rope he uses and he tumbles halfway down the shaft, stopping at a small access node. Leaving by the node, he jams a cord of wood across the shaft opening, preventing a re-armed explosive capsule from moving further down the shaft. While Barbara creates a diversion spinning a wild story about an uprising involving \"the Boston Tea Party\", \"General Lee's forces\" and \"Hannibal attacking from the Alps\", Jenny tries to corrupt the machine which controls the Robomen and send them new orders. The Daleks catch them and, after rearming the capsule and launching it, trap the two in the control room to be killed in the explosion. The Doctor and Tyler, hiding outside the control room, enter when the Daleks leave and free Barbara and Jenny. Using the Daleks' scanners, they find David and Susan, who destroy the radio beacon, leaving the Robomen adrift and causing a temporary overload within the Daleks, who short circuit. Barbara and the Doctor give new orders to the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and with the help of the Robomen, Wells and Tyler lead the human slaves in rebellion, destroying the inert Daleks and escaping the mine. Ian reunites with his friends and, before the capsule explodes, they all escape back up the cliffs to rejoin Susan and David. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes an entirely new phenomenon \u2013 a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] in England.\n\nBack in London, Wells and Tyler help shift the girders away from the TARDIS. Susan has worn a hole in her shoe and the Doctor talks of mending it for her, but seems preoccupied and sad. Susan is also awkward, and after the Doctor goes back into the ship, she and David walk a short distance away. Declaring his love for her, David begs Susan to stay and marry him, saying he will give her a place to belong and a rooted identity, which earlier she told him she wanted to have someday. Susan agonises and protests that David is making her choose between him and her grandfather. Tearfully she says she must leave, but admits that she loves him. Suddenly, the TARDIS doors slam shut, and the Doctor, with Ian and Barbara at his side, bids Susan an emotional farewell, telling her that although they have always taken care of each other up until now, she is a grown woman and deserves a normal life with David. He promises to return one day, and sets the TARDIS in motion. The blue box disappears, and Susan, stunned, steps where it had been. David says that the Doctor must have known she would not leave him, and so chose to leave her. Taking David's hand, Susan walks away with him, intentionally leaving her TARDIS key behind.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Caroleanneford86.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' is the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford's character, Susan.]]\nThis was the very first serial of Doctor Who that made extensive use of location filming, with London being chosen as the primary backdrop. The decision to use London also helped to keep the show within its production budget given that the BBC's Lime Grove studios where Doctor Who was produced were located at nearby [[Shepherd's Bush]]. Location filming took place in various parts of the city including extensive sequences at [[Whitehall]], [[Trafalgar Square]], [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Albert Embankment]] and The [[Royal Albert Hall]], moving on to [[Kensington]] and the Albert Memorial with scenes involving the Dalek roadblock being filmed at [[Wembley]]. These scenes were shot in the early hours of Sunday mornings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/jacqueline-hill/|title=Jacqueline Hill|website=Doctor Who Interview Archive}}</ref>  Other location scenes were filmed at the abandoned [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station]] in West London and river sequences both shot besides the [[River Thames]] at [[St Katharine Docks]] in Wapping and at [[Kew Railway Bridge]]. The mine scenes were the first ''Doctor Who'' scenes to be filmed in a quarry, using the disused John's Hole Quarry at [[Stone, Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1964/11/doctor-who-the-dalek-invasion-of-earth-1964/|title=Kent Film Office The Dalek Invasion of Earth Article}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/stories/dalekinvasionofearth|publisher=Chuck Foster / News in Time and Space Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=[[Gary Russell]]|year       =2003|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Dalek Invasion of Earth|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|time=6:38 in \"Now and Then\" feature on Disc 2|asin=B00009PBAN|asin-tld=co.uk|quote=This was the first ever quarry to be used in the making of Doctor Who.}}</ref>\n\nThe music was composed and conducted by [[Francis Chagrin]].<ref name=\"DrWho\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_k.htm|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|work=Dr Who guide|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative titles===\nWorking titles for this story included ''The Daleks'', ''The Return of the Daleks'' and ''The Invaders''.

According to commentary on the DVD release, the man carrying Hartnell down the saucer's ramp dropped him and he hit his head on a metal camera pedestal. Warwick went on to appear as the First Doctor's robotic double in the later Dalek serial, ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/8434/doctor-who-the-space-museumthe-chase-dvd-review|title=Doctor Who: The Space Museum/The Chase DVD review|website=Den of Geek}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas_Smith_(actor)|Nicholas Smith]] appears in his first speaking role in television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12039125/Nicholas-Smith-actor-obituary.html|title=Nicholas Smith, actor - obituary|date=8 December 2015|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> He was originally only to have appeared in episode three, but according to Smith on a documentary accompanying the serial's DVD release, he talked the director into letting him lead the miners' revolution in episodes five and six.

Then, due to the decay of the surrounding buildings and grounds, a quake tremor causes girders to fall across the TARDIS, blocking the travellers from entering again. Barbara stays with Susan while the Doctor and Ian explore, and the women are taken by a couple of refugees to a nearby shelter in an abandoned [[London Underground|Underground]] station. There they meet resistance members Dortmun (the leader), Carl Tyler, David Campbell, Jenny, Thomson, Baker, and Larry Madison. Dortmun, a paraplegic scientist, has been working on a special type of bomb to destroy the Daleks' outer casings, and he and the others are preparing for an assault on the local Dalek headquarters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Doctor and Ian stumble across a body wearing a strange metal helmet and soon find an army of them as a [[Dalek]] rises from the [[River Thames]]. The Daleks take the Doctor and Ian, along with captured resistance members, including Jack Craddock, onboard their saucer, where they convert attempted escapees into [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Robomen|Robomen]]. Ian does not understand why the Daleks still exist since the travellers saw them be defeated on Skaro (in ''[[The Daleks]]''), but the Doctor reminds him that was far in the future. David and Craddock explain that the Daleks invaded Earth in the aftermath of a meteorite bombardment and a \"new kind of plague\" ten years prior, where humanity became divided and Asia, Africa and South America were wiped out. Sensing that the Doctor is highly intelligent, the Daleks leave a device in the cell with the prisoners which the Doctor solves, enabling them to escape. However, the Daleks are laying in wait and recapture them, drugging the Doctor and sending him to be converted into a Roboman. But the Doctor's transfer operation breaks down while Susan, Barbara and the resistance team attack the Dalek force using the explosives created by Dortmun. But the bombs are ineffective against the Daleks, and several resistance members are injured or killed.  David and Susan rescue the Doctor while Barbara gets separated from them and is able to return to the Underground with Jenny to report back to Dortmun. Ian is unable to escape; he and Larry hide beneath a floor grating as the saucer leaves for the Dalek mining operations in Bedfordshire.\n\nBefore leaving London, the Daleks give orders to the Robomen to set firebombs to destroy the city. Hiding from the Robomen, David, Susan and the Doctor see them set up a bomb and leave. The Doctor, still too weak from being drugged, collapses, and David uses some quick thinking to disarm the bomb. He and Susan try to find an escape route through the sewers while the Doctor rests, and they are found by Tyler. After collecting the Doctor, who is starting to feel better, they escape the city and head for the mining operation. David and Susan start falling in love, but keep it a secret from the others. Meanwhile, Dortmun, Jenny and Barbara make their way to an abandoned museum also used by the resistance as a hideout. Dortmun, after leaving his notebook for Barbara to find, confronts the Daleks, sacrificing himself so that the women have a chance to escape. They get an old truck working and crash their way through the Daleks, heading for the mining operations as Barbara is convinced that that is where the Doctor would go. They make it most of the way there before the truck is destroyed by a Dalek saucer.\n\nAt the mine, Ian and Larry escape the saucer and meet workers named Wells and Ashton; the latter is killed by an aggressive creature called a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens#Slyther|Slyther]], a pet of the [[Dalek variants#Mark II Daleks|Black Dalek]]. The predator then falls from a suspended mine cart that Ian and Larry use to try to get away from it, and down a mineshaft to its death. The Daleks send the mine cart down the shaft before Ian and Larry can climb out, and they are plummeted down in the cart to the mine operations far underground.  The Doctor and his party arrive at the cliffs overlooking the mine, and he sends David and Susan on a mission to the far side of the cliffs to interfere with the radio signals the Daleks use to communicate with each other and the Robomen. The Doctor and Tyler begin climbing down into the mine. Barbara and Jenny find a hovel and, seeking shelter, meet two ragged women who are allowed to live on their own because they make clothing for the human slaves at the mine. These women pretend to befriend Barbara and Jenny before reporting them to the Daleks in return for food. The Daleks collect Barbara and Jenny and send them to work in the mine.\n\nAfter Larry is killed by his brother, who has been turned into a Roboman, Ian hides in the mine, eventually finding Wells again, and also seeing Barbara from a distance. Before he can get to her, however, he ends up hiding and being trapped in a capsule filled with explosives. Barbara uses Dortmun's notebook to bluff the Daleks into believing she has information about an imminent uprising and demands to speak with the Black Dalek. When she and Jenny are brought before it, they discover that the Daleks are drilling through the [[Earth]]'s crust so that they can blow out its core with a penetrative explosive capsule and then use a guidance system to pilot the planet around space. As the Daleks set the capsule in position and start the countdown, Ian scrambles the wiring inside the capsule, disarming it. When the shaft opens beneath the capsule, he escapes, but a Dalek cuts the rope he uses and he tumbles halfway down the shaft, stopping at a small access node. Leaving by the node, he jams a cord of wood across the shaft opening, preventing a re-armed explosive capsule from moving further down the shaft. While Barbara creates a diversion spinning a wild story about an uprising involving \"the Boston Tea Party\", \"General Lee's forces\" and \"Hannibal attacking from the Alps\", Jenny tries to corrupt the machine which controls the Robomen and send them new orders. The Daleks catch them and, after rearming the capsule and launching it, trap the two in the control room to be killed in the explosion. The Doctor and Tyler, hiding outside the control room, enter when the Daleks leave and free Barbara and Jenny. Using the Daleks' scanners, they find David and Susan, who destroy the radio beacon, leaving the Robomen adrift and causing a temporary overload within the Daleks, who short circuit. Barbara and the Doctor give new orders to the Robomen to destroy the Daleks, and with the help of the Robomen, Wells and Tyler lead the human slaves in rebellion, destroying the inert Daleks and escaping the mine. Ian reunites with his friends and, before the capsule explodes, they all escape back up the cliffs to rejoin Susan and David. The bomb destroys the Dalek fleet and causes an entirely new phenomenon \u2013 a [[volcano|volcanic eruption]] in England.\n\nBack in London, Wells and Tyler help shift the girders away from the TARDIS. Susan has worn a hole in her shoe and the Doctor talks of mending it for her, but seems preoccupied and sad. Susan is also awkward, and after the Doctor goes back into the ship, she and David walk a short distance away. Declaring his love for her, David begs Susan to stay and marry him, saying he will give her a place to belong and a rooted identity, which earlier she told him she wanted to have someday. Susan agonises and protests that David is making her choose between him and her grandfather. Tearfully she says she must leave, but admits that she loves him. Suddenly, the TARDIS doors slam shut, and the Doctor, with Ian and Barbara at his side, bids Susan an emotional farewell, telling her that although they have always taken care of each other up until now, she is a grown woman and deserves a normal life with David. He promises to return one day, and sets the TARDIS in motion. The blue box disappears, and Susan, stunned, steps where it had been. David says that the Doctor must have known she would not leave him, and so chose to leave her. Taking David's hand, Susan walks away with him, intentionally leaving her TARDIS key behind.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Caroleanneford86.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''The Dalek Invasion of Earth'' is the final regular appearance of Carole Ann Ford's character, Susan.]]\nThis was the very first serial of Doctor Who that made extensive use of location filming, with London being chosen as the primary backdrop. The decision to use London also helped to keep the show within its production budget given that the BBC's Lime Grove studios where Doctor Who was produced were located at nearby [[Shepherd's Bush]]. Location filming took place in various parts of the city including extensive sequences at [[Whitehall]], [[Trafalgar Square]], [[Westminster Bridge]], [[Albert Embankment]] and The [[Royal Albert Hall]], moving on to [[Kensington]] and the Albert Memorial with scenes involving the Dalek roadblock being filmed at [[Wembley]]. These scenes were shot in the early hours of Sunday mornings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drwhointerviews.wordpress.com/category/jacqueline-hill/|title=Jacqueline Hill|website=Doctor Who Interview Archive}}</ref>  Other location scenes were filmed at the abandoned [[Wood Lane (Central line) tube station]] in West London and river sequences both shot besides the [[River Thames]] at [[St Katharine Docks]] in Wapping and at [[Kew Railway Bridge]]. The mine scenes were the first ''Doctor Who'' scenes to be filmed in a quarry, using the disused John's Hole Quarry at [[Stone, Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/1964/11/doctor-who-the-dalek-invasion-of-earth-1964/|title=Kent Film Office The Dalek Invasion of Earth Article}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/stories/dalekinvasionofearth|publisher=Chuck Foster / News in Time and Space Ltd|accessdate=22 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|people=[[Gary Russell]]|year       =2003|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Dalek Invasion of Earth|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|time=6:38 in \"Now and Then\" feature on Disc 2|asin=B00009PBAN|asin-tld=co.uk|quote=This was the first ever quarry to be used in the making of Doctor Who.}}</ref>\n\nThe music was composed and conducted by [[Francis Chagrin]].<ref name=\"DrWho\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drwhoguide.com/who_k.htm|title=The Dalek Invasion of Earth|work=Dr Who guide|accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative titles===\nWorking titles for this story included ''The Daleks'', ''The Return of the Daleks'' and ''The Invaders''.

Hartnell was injured while filming the battle at the Dalek saucer in episode three, and most of his lines went to David Campbell. According to commentary on the DVD release, the man carrying Hartnell down the saucer's ramp dropped him and he hit his head on a metal camera pedestal. Warwick went on to appear as the First Doctor's robotic double in the later Dalek serial, ''[[The Chase (Doctor Who)|The Chase]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/8434/doctor-who-the-space-museumthe-chase-dvd-review|title=Doctor Who: The Space Museum/The Chase DVD review|website=Den of Geek}}</ref>\n\n[[Nicholas_Smith_(actor)|Nicholas Smith]] appears in his first speaking role in television.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12039125/Nicholas-Smith-actor-obituary.html|title=Nicholas Smith, actor - obituary|date=8 December 2015|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> He was originally only to have appeared in episode three, but according to Smith on a documentary accompanying the serial's DVD release, he talked the director into letting him lead the miners' revolution in episodes five and six.

In 1999, the government declined, and the case moved forward.<ref name=HH2003/> The defendants sought to have the complaint dismissed, arguing that the causal link between any representations made by Parke-Davis sales representatives and reimbursements for off-label Neurontin prescriptions was too remote.<ref>''Franklin'' at *4</ref> Furthermore, Warner-Lambert argued that Franklin could only prove the pharmaceutical company's liability by showing that Parke-Davis sales liaisons made fraudulent misrepresentations about the drug, as opposed to merely engaging in truthful off-label promotion.<ref>''Franklin'' at *1</ref>\n\nIn an opinion handed down on August 22, 2003, District Judge [[Patti B. Saris]] agreed with David Franklin, denying Warner Lambert's [[summary judgment]] motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Judge Saris found that, if it could be proven that the off-label marketing of Neurontin caused doctors to prescribe the drug and submit prescriptions to Medicaid, then the company would indeed be liable under the False Claims Act. In addition, Judge Saris found that the submission of false Medicaid claims was a foreseeable result of Warner-Lambert's marketing scheme.<ref>''Franklin'' at *4-*5</ref> The case established for the first time that drug companies could be held liable under the False Claims Act for off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products.\n\n==Settlement==\n\nOn May 13, 2004, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] announced that it had reached an agreement with Warner-Lambert and Pfizer.

In 1999, the government declined, and the case moved forward.<ref name=HH2003/> The defendants sought to have the complaint dismissed, arguing that the causal link between any representations made by Parke-Davis sales representatives and reimbursements for off-label Neurontin prescriptions was too remote.<ref>''Franklin'' at *4</ref> Furthermore, Warner-Lambert argued that Franklin could only prove the pharmaceutical company's liability by showing that Parke-Davis sales liaisons made fraudulent misrepresentations about the drug, as opposed to merely engaging in truthful off-label promotion.<ref>''Franklin'' at *1</ref>\n\nIn an opinion handed down on August 22, 2003, District Judge [[Patti B. Saris]] agreed with David Franklin, denying Warner Lambert's [[summary judgment]] motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Judge Saris found that, if it could be proven that the off-label marketing of Neurontin caused doctors to prescribe the drug and submit prescriptions to Medicaid, then the company would indeed be liable under the False Claims Act. In addition, Judge Saris found that the submission of false Medicaid claims was a foreseeable result of Warner-Lambert's marketing scheme.<ref>''Franklin'' at *4-*5</ref> The case established for the first time that drug companies could be held liable under the False Claims Act for off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products.\n\n==Settlement==\n\nOn May 13, 2004, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] announced that it had reached an agreement with Warner-Lambert and Pfizer. Warner-Lambert agreed to pay $430 million to resolve criminal and civil liability related to the off-label promotion of [[Gabapentin|Neurontin]], and also agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of misbranding drugs under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]], resulting in a $240 million criminal fine.<ref name=\"justice\" /> Civil damages under the False Claims Act were paid out to the federal government in the amount of $83.6 million, and damages paid out to the states totaled $106.4 million.
