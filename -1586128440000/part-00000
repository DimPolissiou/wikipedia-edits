It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}} The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=547}}</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546}}  Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=556}}</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=548}}</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=549}}</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p= 549-550}} \n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>{{harvnb|Fenby|2004|p=356}}</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=552}}</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=551}}</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>\n{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=550}} </ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.<ref name=FJp357>{{harvnb|Fenby|2004|p=357}}</ref> Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the \"New Order in Asia\" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.<ref name=FJp357/>\n\nThe chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=553}}</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese; had powers to arrest without warrant, torture and to kill extrajudicially; kidnapped businessmen for ransom; and were deeply involved in organized crime, charging a \"fee\" to all of the opium dens, brothels and casinos of Shanghai to allow them to operate.<ref name=FJp357/> In September 1939, Wang Tianmu, the chief ''Juntong'' agent in Shanghai was kidnapped on the Nanjing road by No. 76 agents, was taken to 76 Jessfield Road where he was held for three weeks before being released.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=554}}</ref> Suspecting Wang, who had not been tortured had been \"turned\", Dai ordered him assassinated and a ''Juntong'' agent shot him in the shoulder during a failed attempt to kill him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554/>\n\nThe No. 76 organization blew up the headquarters of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai while the ''Juntong'' assassins killed a dozen of No. 76 organization leaders in the fall of 1939.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=555}}</ref> Wang's defection to the No. 76 organization proved a most serious blow as he betrayed all of the agents under his command, and the ''Kempeitai'' arrested dozens of ''Juntong agents'' in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin due to the information provided by Wang.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 15 November 1939, Zhao Gangyi, the ''Juntong'' chief in Qingdao, fearing it was only a matter of time before the ''Kempeitai'' arrested him owing to the information provided by Wang, decided to save himself and defected over to the Wang regime,  betraying all of the agents under his command to the ''Kempeitai''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 24 November 1939, thanks to information provided by Zhao, the ''Kempeitai'' raided the ''Juntong'''s headquarters in Beijing.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nOn 21 December 1939, Ding was almost killed when his mistress, the teenage schoolgirl Zheng Pingru, led him into a ''Juntong'' assassination attempt.<ref name=WFp194>Wakeman, Frederic ''The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002 page 194.</ref> When Ding ordered his men to execute Zheng, a girl born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, she asked them not to shoot her in the face, so she would still be beautiful at her funeral, a request that No. 76 execution squad honored.<ref name=WFp194/> This incident is generally believed to have been the inspiration for the 1979 novella [[Lust, Caution (novella)|''Lust, Caution'']] by [[Eileen Chang]], which in turn inspired the 2007 film ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeital'' who tortured and executed him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nVarious \"guerrilla command\" and \"traffic police\" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.</ref> Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.</ref> The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.</ref> China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment.

China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] before 1946. It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}} The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=547}}</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546}}  Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=556}}</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=548}}</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=549}}</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p= 549-550}} \n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>{{harvnb|Fenby|2004|p=356}}</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=552}}</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=551}}</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>\n{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=550}} </ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they restored to lashing out by executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paying respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators! Long Live Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Fu Xiaoan, the banker and shipping tycoon who had long been an enemy of the Kuomintang and had thrown in his lot with the Japanese, becoming the collaborating mayor of Shanghai, was hacked to death with a meat chopper in his bed by his cook who was secretly a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In 1939, a banquet to celebrate the friendship between Japan and the [[Wang Jingwei]] regime attended by senior Japanese officers and Chinese collaborators in Shanghai were ruined when the cooks, many of whom were working for the ''Juntong'' poisoned the food, and only prompt medical attention that required pumping the stomachs of the guests prevented hundreds of deaths.<ref name=FJp357>{{harvnb|Fenby|2004|p=357}}</ref> Later in 1939, a train that carrying various Japanese officers and officials of the Wang Jingwei regime from Shanghai to Nanking for a ceremony marking a new treaty that was meant to cement Wang's regime in its place in the \"New Order in Asia\" was blown up by ''Juntong'' agents, killing 74 and wounding hundreds more.<ref name=FJp357/>\n\nThe chief enemy of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai were not the Japanese, most of whom did not speak Mandarin and even those who did speak Mandarin did so with a Japanese accent that betrayed where they were from, but rather the secret service loyal to the Wang regime that was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected over to the ''Juntong'' before going over to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=553}}</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese;

On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeital'' who tortured and executed him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nVarious \"guerrilla command\" and \"traffic police\" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3, 000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 111.</ref> Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".<ref>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 pages 111-112.</ref> The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>Pomar, Norman & Allen, Thomas ''The Spy Book'', New York: Random House, 1997 page 112.</ref> China which regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China, greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment.

(Seal himself did partnership with Fergusson Brothers, they did not ask him to convert to [[Christianity]] to do business. Education was not provided for converting to Christianity, many of the people educated outside India at the time were Christians, including [[Mahatma Gandhi]].) To counter this, there was an anti-missionary movement led by the rich and influential [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta for a free national school of their own. \n\nOne afternoon they all assembled in a meeting presided over by [[Radhakanta Deb|Raja Radha Kanta Deb]] at the [[Oriental Seminary]]. Many speeches were made and resolutions adopted, but donations recorded in the subscription book were scant. When the book passed to the hand of Seal, he immediately put down his name for one [[Lakh]] of rupees. Others who had estimated contributing a few hundred or a few thousand rupees panicked and the meeting ended.\n\nPledged to his subscription, Seal carried out the promise of a national institution with his own independent efforts. On Wednesday, 1 March 1842, a gathering of respectable people took place at his house for the formal opening of the Mutty Lall Seal's Free College. Among those present were Sir Lawrence Peel, the Chief Justice, Sir [[John Peter Grant]], Mr. Lyall, the Advocate-General, Mr. Leith, and the other principal members of the Calcutta Bar, Captain Birch, Superintendent of the Police, Mr. George Thompson, Right Reverend Dr. Carew, Baboo [[Dwarkanath Tagore]], Baboo [[Ramkamal Sen]], Baboo Russomoy Dutt and Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]]. The Catholic Bishop and all the clergy of the Catholic Cathedral, as well as all the Professors of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. Xavier's College]], were likewise present. Nearly the whole of the dissenting ministers and missionaries of Calcutta and its neighbourhood also attended.<ref>''The Catholic Cabinet, And Chronicle of Religious Intelligence, Containing Original And Selected Articles, A Monthly Periodical'', Volume I, 1843, p 187</ref> There were eloquent speeches in testimony to his noble generosity and liberal mindset with Mr. George Thompson complimenting him as \"a Hindu gentleman, who had nobly resolved to consecrate a large portion of the substances he had acquired by honorable exertion, to the intellectual improvement of the youth of his own nation to transmute his money into mind\"''.<ref>Mullick, Promatha Nath, ''History of Vaisyas of Bengal'', p 136-139</ref>''\n\nMutty Lall Seal's Free College (later renamed Mutty Lall Seal's Free School and College) was to provide for the education of Hindus to enable them to occupy posts of trust and emolument in their own country. This education included [[English Literature|english literature]], history, [[geography]], [[elocution]], writing, [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], philosophical sciences, [[Further Mathematics|higher mathematics]] and the practical application of mathematics. The institution was opened free of cost, but only one rupee was charged per month to cover expenses such as books, stationery, and the surplus being expended towards furnishing the school with mathematical instruments. The number of students receiving education at one time was to be limited to 500. The institute was initially under the management of the Directors of the parent college of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. F. Xavier]], Chowringhee, Calcutta, who furnished teachers to further the cause of [[secular education]].<ref>''Goethals News'', Vol. IV, No. 3 Bulletin, July \u2013 September 2001</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] had the responsibility of imparting education, the conductors had pledged themselves to withhold all Christian instruction from the pupils.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. II, October\u2013December 1844, p 73</ref> However, later Seal dissolved the connection between his college and the Jesuits over a dispute that in violation of their pledge, so viands were distributed among the Hindu boys contrary to their religious sentiments. The institute was then placed under Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]].<ref>''The Indian Mail, A Monthly Register For British & Foreign India, China, & Australasia'', Vol. I, May\u2013December 1843, p 614-615</ref> A sum of Rs. 12,000 was spent yearly for the upkeep of the college from his trust. The college stood in high estimation of the public and competed successfully with the Government and Missionary Colleges in the university examinations ([[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] and [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami Prabhupada]] were some students of the college). The college initially started functioning at Seal's house and was later shifted to the present building on [[Chittaranjan Avenue]] where it still exists.\n\nThe other charities which have made his name known to the public are contained in a deed of trust; by which he donated a considerable portion of his property (amounting to several [[Lakh]] of rupees) for the good of the public. A net yearly income of Rs. 36,000 derived from those properties were spent for various charitable purposes. Apart from running and maintaining the college, about Rs. 4,000 was spent on helping poor widows and orphans every year and for running and maintaining two alms houses for the poor and underprivileged.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. CXI, Calcutta, 1900, p 86-88</ref> He extended financial support and co-operation for the establishment of the Hindu Charitable Institution and Hindu Metropolitan College.

One was the reformist section led by [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Rammohun Roy]] and the other was the conservative section led by [[Radhakanta Deb|Radha Kanta Deb]]. Most of the rich people of Kolkata were in the latter group. Deb strongly opposed both the move to ban [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and efforts for remarriage of widows, many of whom were child-widows. Although Seal was a conservative, he was in favor of Roy's efforts of banning sati, supported the cause of women's education as well as remarriage of widows. He made a public offer for a dowry of 1000 rupees to the person who should have the courage to break through the ancient prejudices of caste and marry a widow.<ref>Ripley, George, Dana, Charles A.,''The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary Of General Knowledge'', Vol. II, 1859, p 443</ref> When Seal died on 20 May 1854, his obituary in the ''Hindu Intelligence'' described him as the \"richest and most virtuous [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta.\"<ref>Sengupta, Nitish, ''History Of The Bengali Speaking People'', p 259-260</ref> One of the busy streets in Kolkata's business district is named after him as Moti Sil Street.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1 = Chaudhuri \n | given1 = Sukanta (Ed)\n | year = 1995\n | title = Calcutta: The Living City\n | edition = \n | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]\n | ISBN = 0-19-563698-8\n}}\n* Sastri, Sivanath, ''Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj'' in Bengali (1903/2001), p 48, New Age Publishers Pvt.

Among those present were Sir Lawrence Peel, the Chief Justice, Sir [[John Peter Grant]], Mr. Lyall, the Advocate-General, Mr. Leith, and the other principal members of the Calcutta Bar, Captain Birch, Superintendent of the Police, Mr. George Thompson, Right Reverend Dr. Carew, Baboo [[Dwarkanath Tagore]], Baboo [[Ramkamal Sen]], Baboo Russomoy Dutt and Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]]. The Catholic Bishop and all the clergy of the Catholic Cathedral, as well as all the Professors of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. Xavier's College]], were likewise present. Nearly the whole of the dissenting ministers and missionaries of Calcutta and its neighbourhood also attended.<ref>''The Catholic Cabinet, And Chronicle of Religious Intelligence, Containing Original And Selected Articles, A Monthly Periodical'', Volume I, 1843, p 187</ref> There were eloquent speeches in testimony to his noble generosity and liberal mindset with Mr. George Thompson complimenting him as \"a Hindu gentleman, who had nobly resolved to consecrate a large portion of the substances he had acquired by honorable exertion, to the intellectual improvement of the youth of his own nation to transmute his money into mind\"''.<ref>Mullick, Promatha Nath, ''History of Vaisyas of Bengal'', p 136-139</ref>''\n\nMutty Lall Seal's Free College (later renamed Mutty Lall Seal's Free School and College) was to provide for the education of Hindus to enable them to occupy posts of trust and emolument in their own country. This education included [[English Literature|english literature]], history, [[geography]], [[elocution]], writing, [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], philosophical sciences, [[Further Mathematics|higher mathematics]] and the practical application of mathematics. The institution was opened free of cost, but only one rupee was charged per month to cover expenses such as books, stationery, and the surplus being expended towards furnishing the school with mathematical instruments. The number of students receiving education at one time was to be limited to 500. The institute was initially under the management of the Directors of the parent college of [[St. Xavier's College, Calcutta|St. F. Xavier]], Chowringhee, Calcutta, who furnished teachers to further the cause of [[secular education]].<ref>''Goethals News'', Vol. IV, No. 3 Bulletin, July \u2013 September 2001</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] had the responsibility of imparting education, the conductors had pledged themselves to withhold all Christian instruction from the pupils.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. II, October\u2013December 1844, p 73</ref> However, later Seal dissolved the connection between his college and the Jesuits over a dispute that in violation of their pledge, so viands were distributed among the Hindu boys contrary to their religious sentiments. The institute was then placed under Revd. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]].<ref>''The Indian Mail, A Monthly Register For British & Foreign India, China, & Australasia'', Vol. I, May\u2013December 1843, p 614-615</ref> A sum of Rs. 12,000 was spent yearly for the upkeep of the college from his trust. The college stood in high estimation of the public and competed successfully with the Government and Missionary Colleges in the university examinations ([[Suniti Kumar Chatterji]] and [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada|Swami Prabhupada]] were some students of the college). The college initially started functioning at Seal's house and was later shifted to the present building on [[Chittaranjan Avenue]] where it still exists.\n\nThe other charities which have made his name known to the public are contained in a deed of trust; by which he donated a considerable portion of his property (amounting to several [[Lakh]] of rupees) for the good of the public. A net yearly income of Rs. 36,000 derived from those properties were spent for various charitable purposes. Apart from running and maintaining the college, about Rs. 4,000 was spent on helping poor widows and orphans every year and for running and maintaining two alms houses for the poor and underprivileged.<ref>''The Calcutta Review'', Vol. CXI, Calcutta, 1900, p 86-88</ref> He extended financial support and co-operation for the establishment of the Hindu Charitable Institution and Hindu Metropolitan College. Seal's Free School, Hindu Metropolitan College and some of the other institutions of the time were calculated to offset the 'ill effects' of the liberal education offered at the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Hindu College]].<ref>Majumdar, Swapan, ''Literature and Literary Life in Old Calcutta'', in ''Calcutta, the Living City'', Vol I, p 110.</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's devalaya at Belghoria.jpg|Devalaya at Mutty Lall Seal's Belghoria alms house\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's guest house at Behala.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's guest house at Behala\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's bathing ghat.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's bathing ghat on the bank of river Hooghly\nImage:Mutty Lal Seal's Free School.jpg|Mutty Lall Seal's Free School & College - Estd. 1842\n</gallery>\n\n==Later life==\nWhen he was alive, the native society of Kolkata was divided into two parts. One was the reformist section led by [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Rammohun Roy]] and the other was the conservative section led by [[Radhakanta Deb|Radha Kanta Deb]]. Most of the rich people of Kolkata were in the latter group. Deb strongly opposed both the move to ban [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and efforts for remarriage of widows, many of whom were child-widows. Although Seal was a conservative, he was in favor of Roy's efforts of banning sati, supported the cause of women's education as well as remarriage of widows. He made a public offer for a dowry of 1000 rupees to the person who should have the courage to break through the ancient prejudices of caste and marry a widow.<ref>Ripley, George, Dana, Charles A.,''The New American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary Of General Knowledge'', Vol. II, 1859, p 443</ref> When Seal died on 20 May 1854, his obituary in the ''Hindu Intelligence'' described him as the \"richest and most virtuous [[Babu (title)|Babu]] of Calcutta.\"<ref>Sengupta, Nitish, ''History Of The Bengali Speaking People'', p 259-260</ref> One of the busy streets in Kolkata's business district is named after him as Moti Sil Street.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation\n | surname1 = Chaudhuri \n | given1 = Sukanta (Ed)\n | year = 1995\n | title = Calcutta: The Living City\n | edition = \n | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]\n | ISBN = 0-19-563698-8\n}}\n* Sastri, Sivanath, ''Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj'' in Bengali (1903/2001), p 48, New Age Publishers Pvt.

Soft shoulder epaulettes with five {{convert|7/16|inch|mm}} stars in silver thread and gold-threaded United States Coat of Arms on green cloth were worn with shirts and sweaters.\n\nThe rank of \"General of the Army\" has had two incarnations. The rank was introduced in 1866, the year after the [[American Civil War]]. It was reserved for the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], was a four-star rank, and was held by three different individuals from 1866 to 1888. The rank was revived as the modern five-star rank during [[World War II]], and may be awarded to more than one serving officer at a time. It was held by five different individuals from 1944 to 1981.

His pay was \"four hundred dollars per month, and his allowance for fuel and quarters\", except \"when his headquarters are in Washington, shall be at the rate of three hundred dollars per month.\"<ref>Ulysses S.

When appointed General of the Army, Grant wore the rank insignia of four stars and coat buttons arranged in three groups of four.\n\nUnlike the [[World War II]] rank with a similar title, the 1866 rank of General of the Army was a four-star rank. This rank held all the authority and power of a 1799 proposal for a rank of \"[[General of the Armies]]\", even though Grant was never called by this title.\n\nIn contrast to the modern four-star rank of [[General (United States)|general]], only one officer at a time could hold the 1866\u20131888 rank of General of the Army. For a few months in 1885, as he was dying, Grant was accorded a special honor and his rank was restored by Congressional legislation.\n\nAfter Grant became U.S. president, he was succeeded as General of the Army by [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]], effective 4 March 1869. In 1872, Sherman ordered the insignia changed to two stars, with the [[Great Seal of the United States|coat of arms of the United States]] in between.<ref name=Amil />\n\nBy an Act of Congress on 1 June 1888, the grade was conferred upon [[Philip Sheridan]], who by then was in failing health.

In 1919, [[John J. Pershing]] was promoted to General of the Armies for his services in [[World War I]]. In 1976,<!----don't change this to 1796, the 1976 date is correct----> [[George Washington]] was posthumously promoted to this rank for his service as the first commanding general of the United States Army.<ref name=Amil /><ref name=Pub94-479 /> In 1903, retroactive to 1899, [[George Dewey]] was promoted to [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Admiral of the Navy]], a rank equivalent to General of the Armies.\n\nWhen the five-star rank of General of the Army was introduced, it was decided that General Pershing, who was still living, would be superior in rank to all the newly appointed Generals of the Army. Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] was asked whether Pershing was therefore a five-star general (at that time the highest rank was a four-star general). Stimson stated:\n\n{{Bquote|It appears the intent of the Army was to make the General of the Armies senior in grade to the General of the Army. I have advised Congress that the War Department concurs in such proposed action.|[[Henry L. Stimson]]}}\n\nSection 7 of Public Law [[s:Public Law 78-482|78-482]] read: \"Nothing in this Act shall affect the provisions of the Act of September 3, 1919 (41 Stat. 283: 10 U.S.C. 671a), or any other law relating to the office of General of the Armies of the United States.\"<ref name=PL78-482>{{cite web|title=Public Law 78-482|url=http://legisworks.org/congress/78/publaw-482.pdf|website=legisworks.org|publisher=Legis Works|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[George Washington]] was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies on 15 March 1978 by Secretary of the Army Clifford Alexander. In relation to America's bicentennial celebration, Congress passed legislation on 19 January 1976 urging Washington's promotion and President Gerald Ford approved it in October 1976, but historians found that Congressional and Presidential actions were not enough, that the Army had to issue orders to make the promotion official. According to [[S:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]], ''General of the Armies of the United States'' is established as having \"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\", clearly making it superior in grade to ''General of the Army''.<ref name=Pub94-479>{{cite web |title=Public Law 94-479 |url = http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg2078.pdf |website=gpo.gov |publisher=United States Government Printing Office|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> Thus, Washington will always be the most senior general of the United States.

When appointed General of the Army, Grant wore the rank insignia of four stars and coat buttons arranged in three groups of four.\n\nUnlike the [[World War II]] rank with a similar title, the 1866 rank of General of the Army was a four-star rank. This rank held all the authority and power of a 1799 proposal for a rank of \"[[General of the Armies]]\", even though Grant was never called by this title.\n\nIn contrast to the modern four-star rank of [[General (United States)|general]], only one officer at a time could hold the 1866\u20131888 rank of General of the Army. For a few months in 1885, as he was dying, Grant was accorded a special honor and his rank was restored by Congressional legislation.\n\nAfter Grant became U.S. president, he was succeeded as General of the Army by [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T.

In 1976,<!----don't change this to 1796, the 1976 date is correct----> [[George Washington]] was posthumously promoted to this rank for his service as the first commanding general of the United States Army.<ref name=Amil /><ref name=Pub94-479 /> In 1903, retroactive to 1899, [[George Dewey]] was promoted to [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|Admiral of the Navy]], a rank equivalent to General of the Armies.\n\nWhen the five-star rank of General of the Army was introduced, it was decided that General Pershing, who was still living, would be superior in rank to all the newly appointed Generals of the Army. Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] was asked whether Pershing was therefore a five-star general (at that time the highest rank was a four-star general). Stimson stated:\n\n{{Bquote|It appears the intent of the Army was to make the General of the Armies senior in grade to the General of the Army. I have advised Congress that the War Department concurs in such proposed action.|[[Henry L. Stimson]]}}\n\nSection 7 of Public Law [[s:Public Law 78-482|78-482]] read: \"Nothing in this Act shall affect the provisions of the Act of September 3, 1919 (41 Stat. 283: 10 U.S.C. 671a), or any other law relating to the office of General of the Armies of the United States.\"<ref name=PL78-482>{{cite web|title=Public Law 78-482|url=http://legisworks.org/congress/78/publaw-482.pdf|website=legisworks.org|publisher=Legis Works|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[George Washington]] was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies on 15 March 1978 by Secretary of the Army Clifford Alexander. In relation to America's bicentennial celebration, Congress passed legislation on 19 January 1976 urging Washington's promotion and President Gerald Ford approved it in October 1976, but historians found that Congressional and Presidential actions were not enough, that the Army had to issue orders to make the promotion official.
