Spotnitz is also the Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Big Light Productions, a London- and Paris-based production company, which specialises in international television series, including drama, comedy and documentaries. Spotnitz\u2019s 25+ career includes creating, writing and producing series with networks, cable, streaming and other broadcast platforms around the world.\n\nUnder the Big Light banner, Spotnitz has produced: Amazon\u2019s Emmy-winning ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]''; ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: Masters of Florence'' and two seasons of ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' (RAI, Netflix, SFR Play); ''[[The Indian Detective]]'' (Netflix, CTV); ''[[Ransom (TV series)|Ransom]]'' (CBS, Global, TF1, RTL); ''[[Crossing Lines]]'' season three with Tandem/StudioCanal; and ''[[Transporter: The Series|Transporter: The Serie]]''<span lang=\"EN-GB\">Frank Charles Spotnitz\u00a0</span>''[[Transporter: The Series|s]]'' season two (TNT, M6, HBO Canada). Most recently, Spotnitz co-created and executive produced ''Leonardo'', which is currently in production in Italy. \n==Early life and education==\nBorn in Camp Zama, Japan, in 1960, Spotnitz\u2019s father was a doctor in the US Army. Much of his childhood was peripatetic before the family settled in Phoenix, Arizona. \u00a0As a child, Spotnitz consumed television shows and films as much as he could, sometimes watching the same film two or three times in a row. \n\nSpotnitz\u2019s education at Camelback High School inspired him to pursue a career in Hollywood.\n\nSpotnitz graduated from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) with a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1982, where he was a reporter for the [[Daily Bruin]]. He later received a [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in screenwriting from the [[AFI Conservatory]] in 1989.\n\n==Career==\n'''<big>Journalism</big>'''  \n\nUpon graduation, Spotnitz was employed as a wire-service reporter for the [[United Press International]] in Indianapolis and New York. He also briefly worked for the [[Associated Press]] in Paris. Spotnitz freelanced for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and''[[Rolling Stone]]'' before returning to his passion and studying screenwriting at [[American Film Institute|AFI]].  \n\n'''<big>Television</big>'''  \n\nSpotnitz created, executive produced and wrote several episodes of ''[[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)|The Man in the High Castle]]'', based on the classic alternative history novel by Philip K. Dick, which upon its release became Amazon\u2019s most viewed series ever. Starring Alexa Davalos, Rufus Sewell and Joel de la Fuente, the series explores life in a 1962 America where the Allies lost the war and the country is divided between the fascist Japanese in the West and the Nazis in the East. The series won two Emmy Awards, was nominated for two others, and named Best Drama Series at the Roma Fiction Festival. It was also nominated for an ASC Award for Outstanding Cinematography, the USC Scripter Award and Best Drama at Monte Carlo Television Festival\u2019s Golden Nymph Awards.   \n\nSpotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote ''Leonardo'', currently in production. The eight-part limited series shows the terrible personal sacrifice that led ''Leonardo'' to create masterpieces that changed the way we see the world forever. Starring [[Aidan Turner]] and [[Freddie Highmore]], the series is the first produced by The Alliance (RAI, France T\u00e9l\u00e9vision, ZDF).\n\nSpotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: Masters of Florence'', starring Richard Madden, Dustin Hoffman and Annabel Scholey. Chronicling the rise of the Medici family during the Italian Renaissance, it shows how the family\u2019s ascent from simple merchants to power brokers sparked an economic and cultural revolution, creating powerful enemies in the process. The Netflix Original Series was produced with Lux Vide Productions for RAI, Italy\u2019s largest broadcaster, and SFR in France. The RAI premiere attracted a record-breaking seven million viewers in Italy, becoming the country\u2019s most-watched new series. \n\nSet 20 years later, ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' starred Daniel Sharman, Bradley James and Sean Bean, and was also co-created, executive produced and co-written by Spotnitz. After an attempt on Piero de Medici\u2019s life, his son Lorenzo is forced to assume leadership of the family-run bank. Once in power, young Lorenzo resolves to abandon the cynical politics of the past to usher in a new era of creative and political revolution, bringing him into open conflict with rival banker Jacopo Pazzi, who will stop at nothing to defeat him. Their clash gives rise to one of the most thrilling true-life political intrigues of all time, the infamous Pazzi conspiracy. The second season of ''[[Medici (TV series)|Medici]]: The Magnificent'' was broadcast on RAI in December 2019 and premieres as a Netflix Original Series in May.\n\nIn 2017, Spotnitz co-created, executive produced and co-wrote the comedy-drama series ''[[The Indian Detective]]'' for Canadian broadcaster CTV and Netflix. It starred international comedy sensation Russell Peters, whom Forbes magazine ranked three times in its Top 10 highest-grossing comics list. Peters portrays Doug D\u2019Mello, a charming, smart Toronto cop, who unexpectedly finds himself investigating murder in his parents\u2019 Indian homeland, where, despite his heritage, he remains an outsider. Canada\u2019s biggest series debut in two years was the second-most watched programme on the day of its CTV premiere, with 1.6 million viewers. It was bestowed the Golden Screen Award by the Canadian Screen Academy.\n\n''[[Ransom (TV series)|Ransom]]'', produced for CBS in the US, France\u2019s TF1, Canada\u2019s Corus/Global and RTL in Germany, was a suspense drama set against an international backdrop. It starred [[Luke Roberts (actor)|Luke Roberts]] and was co-created, executive produced and co-written by Spotnitz. The thriller follows crisis and hostage negotiator Eric Beaumont, whose team is brought in to save lives when no one else can. Beaumont understands criminals better than they understand themselves and uses his insight into human behaviour to resolve the most difficult kidnap and ransom cases. Despite the stakes, Beaumont refuses to resort to violence, even when confronted by some of the world\u2019s most dangerous criminals. ''Ransom'' was VOX Germany\u2019s highest rated drama premiere for over 15 months and France\u2019s TF1 premiere reached over 4 million viewers for a market share of 25%. The show ran for three seasons.\n\nIn 2012, Spotnitz created, wrote and executive produced the international spy drama series ''[[Hunted (2012 TV series)|Hunted]]'' for BBC1 and HBO/Cinemax, starring [[Melissa George]], [[Adam Rayner]], [[Stephen Dillane]] and [[Patrick Malahide]]. \u00a0The series follows Sam Hunter, an operative for a private spy agency, Byzantium. After she is betrayed and nearly killed by one of her colleagues, Sam returns to London in an attempt to root out the traitor, while working undercover in the home of a wealthy and dangerous London gangster on an assignment that could cost her life. The series was BAFTA nominated for cinematography and won the ASC Award. It was also nominated for Best Editing by the Royal Television Society.\n\nSpotnitz served on ''[[The X-Files]]'' for eight of its nine seasons after joining the show in 1994. He called it \u201ca life-changing experience\u201d, graduating from staff writer to executive producer after three seasons. He directed two episodes and wrote or co-wrote more than 40 instalments of the series, including the Emmy-nominated \u201cMemento Mori\u201d with [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]],[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[John Shiban]] in 1997. He served for four years as executive producer and three years as president of Carter\u2019s Ten Thirteen Productions. He was a producer and co-writer of both ''[[The X-Files]]'' feature files, ''[[The X-Files (film)|Fight the Future]]''(1998) and ''[[The X-Files: I Want to Believe|I Want to Believe]]'' (2008).

Males numbered 36,523 (52.9%) and females 32,407 (47.1%). The literacy rate was 77.52%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy was 81.2% and female literacy 73.35%. 11.8% of the population was under 6 years of age.\n\nThe majority population follows christian religion with a significant number of [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and hi\u00f1dus, and small jews and Sikh communities. Marathi is the most widely spoken language with [[Varli language|Warli]], [[Vadvali language|Vadvali]] and Vanjari dialects. Small communities of Gujaratis and Muslims speak Gujarati and Urdu respectively.\n\nPalghar has an urban population of 1,435,210, thus about 48% of the total population lives in the urbanized area.\n\n== Transport ==\nPalghar is well connected via road and rail transport. Palghar acts as a divisional head of [[Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation]], which provides direct connectivity to several towns across Maharashtra and Gujarat, including [[Surat]], [[Vapi]], [[Valsad]], [[Vadodara]], [[Bharuch]], [[Ankleshwar]], [[Anand, Gujarat|Anand]], [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]], Miraj, [[Pune]], Vaduj, [[Thane]], Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Ahmednagar]], Kalyan, Alibag, [[Nandurbar]], Bhusaval, [[Shirdi]], and [[Nashik]].\n\nPalghar is an important railway station on the [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]]. Along with Shuttle/Memu/EMU (local trains) services, many long-distance trains also stop here.\n\n== History ==\nOn 1 August 2014, Palghar became the 36th district of Maharashtra. Its history is alternate with its old district Thane. [[Jawhar]], Vasai and Palghar tehsils have a historical legacy. [[Vasai]] (then known as [[Fort Bassein|Bassein]]) was under the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Empire]]. [[Chimaji Appa]], the Maratha military commander later captured [[Fort Bassein|Vasai fort]] from the Portuguese and embedded the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] flag on Vasai. Palghar was one of the important points in 1942 of the Chalejav campaign.\n\nOn 14 August 1942, there was an uprising against the [[British Raj|British]] in Palghar, in which Kashinath Hari Pagdhare, Govind Ganesh Thakur, Ramprasad Bhimashankar Tiwari, Ramchandra Mahadev Churi, and Govind Sukur More were killed. The main circle of Palghar is known as \"Paachbatti\" (which means 'five lights' in [[Marathi language|Marathi]]) in honour of these martyrs. 14 August has been declared \"Martyrs Day\" in Palghar, when people gather at Paachbatti Circle to honour the five who sacrificed their lives for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]].\n\n== Culture ==\n[[Bhandari]], [[Warli]] ([[Adivasi]]), Katkari, Malhar Koli, [[Vanjari (caste)|Vanjari]], Vadval, Mali(Sorathi) are the predominant castes in Palghar.\n\nThe [[Vanjari (caste)|Vanjaris]] are a [[Nomads of India|nomadic tribe]] that have their roots in Chittodgad, [[Rajasthan]]. Their language is distinct from standard Marathi as it has a high influence of Rajasthani and Gujarati.\n\nVadval is the most numerous community present in Palghar. They are said to be the descendants of [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava]] dynasty of Devagiri who  established themselves here. They form one of the very few Marathi-speaking communities which belong to Kshatriya varna but not the traditional 96-clan ([[Maratha clan system|96 - Kuli]]) [[Maratha]] caste.\n\n[[Warli Painting]] and famous Tarapa dance features contribution towards art by the Warli community. Warli painting and art stretch back to a millennium. Warli art is also appreciated in foreign countries.

The [[Staats Model School]] was duly refurbished.

Initial enrolment was 32 pupils, both boys and girls, which increased to 132 by August of that year.

The name of the school was also changed to ''Pretoria College''. Mr Atkinson left at the end of 1905 and was succeeded by J F Acheson who stayed with the school until it moved from Skinner Street to its current site in 1909. Formal devolution between primary and high school pupils only occurred in 1905.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== The new buildings and bilingualism (1910-1920) ===\n\nMilner's intention was to create a stable educational infrastructure in the new colony's capital and duly set aside {{convert|200|ha}} of ground to the south-east of central Pretoria for the construction of new academic institutions. The southern most {{convert|60|ha}}, which included the ''[[Waterkloof]] Kop'' (English: Waterkloof Hill), was chosen as the new site for Pretoria Boys High School. The architect, [[Patrick Eagle]], met the challenge by designing an edifice rivalling its larger contemporary, Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s [[Union Buildings]]. Eagle chose to site the main buildings on the ridge of the hill giving the school its well-known dramatic setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\nOne year later, the four colonies of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], [[Orange Free State]], [[Natal Province|Natal]] and the [[Cape Colony|Cape]]  formed the [[Union of South Africa]]. Keen to forge unity between English and Dutch (Afrikaner) South Africans, Smuts' influence was evident when, on 6 April 1910, the school absorbed 100 boys and staff from the Dutch-medium Eendracht High School to form a dual-medium high school. The combined school was now named ''Pretoria High School for Boys - Pretoria Hogere school voor Jongens''. Smuts would later send his own sons to the school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Devolution and re-establishment (1920) ===\n\nThe dual-medium institution would last ten years. By 1920, the divide between English and Afrikaans speakers had become apparent nationwide; this was reflected in the need for a separate Afrikaans high school in Pretoria. Consequently, the [[Afrikaanse Ho\u00ebr Seunskool]] was formed immediately south of its parent, becoming the first Afrikaans-medium high school in the country, several years before [[Afrikaans]] attained official recognition as a language (and not a semi-[[Creole language|Creole]] of Dutch). The two schools enjoy close ties to this day, especially in an enthusiastic but friendly rivalry in sporting events. PBHS would now be left in its present form, known as Pretoria Boys High School, an English-medium public school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Headmasters since 1909 ===\n\n* William Hofmeyr (1909-1935)\n* Daniel Matheson (1936-1949)\n* Noel Pollock (1950-1955)\n* Desmond Abernethy (1956-1973)\n* Malcolm Armstrong (1974-1989)\n* William E.

The shield component of the badge is divided into four quadrants, with the book representing learning, the tools the wealth of the Transvaal through gold mining, the tree growth and the ox wagon the Transvaal. The background colours of the four quadrants were the colours of the first four houses when given permanent names, i.e. Town red, Solomon gold, Sunnyside black and Rissik green.\n\n=== The school songs ===\n\nThe official school song, ''Tis Here We Learn To Live'', was written in the 1930s by two ''Old Boys''. The composer of the music, Dr George Findlay, was a prominent Pretoria [[dermatologist]]. However, the school later adopted [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]], originally the school song of [[Harrow School]] in [[London]]. It is this song that is sung at all school [[valedictions]]. The official school song was relegated to obscurity until it was revived as the school's rugby anthem.\n\n\n\"tis here we learn to live(Rugby anthem/School song)\n\nWe are ent'ring life together\n\nFree of sorrow and of care\n\nWith a youthful fire and vigour\n\nNought can e'er our hopes impair;\n\nThough we know indeed but little\n\nOf the life we have to dare,\n\n'Tis here we learn to live\n\n== Culture and activities ==\n\n=== Cultural activities ===\n\nCultural activities include a well-established musical tradition, with a formal [[symphony]] [[orchestra]], [[choir]], [[pipe band]], [[jazz]] ensemble and [[Folk music|folk]] group. Other activities include Photography, Fantasy and Historical war games, Aeronautical Society, Film, Wildlife, Drama, Debating, Chess, and many others.\n\n=== Athletics and leisure ===\n\nSporting facilities include soccer, [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standard athletics grounds, [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[basketball]] courts, a [[gym]]nasium, [[field hockey|hockey]] fields, two swimming pools including one for [[waterpolo]], an [[AstroTurf]] and a rock-climbing wall. There is also a man-made [[pine|pine forest]], an old [[shooting range]] which has been converted for the purpose of archery, an [[amphitheatre]] and an artificial lake, ''Loch Armstrong''. The grounds form a protected bird sanctuary and are home to several different species of birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.\n\n== School buildings ==\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\n=== Houses ===\n\nPretoria Boys High School is made up of ten constituent houses, each with its own unique culture and identity. House assemblies are held weekly, and house prefects are appointed annually. Annual inter-house sports meetings take place in which every pupil is strongly encouraged to participate. The inter-house swim meet (gala) is the most popular and well-attended of sport meetings.\n\n=== Boarding houses ===\n\n* Solomon\n* Rissik\n* School\n\n=== Day-boy houses ===\n\n* Abernethy\n* Arcadia\n* Armstrong\n* Hofmeyr\n* Matheson\n* Sunnyside\n* Town\n\n== The Old Boys Association ==\n\nPretoria Boys High School has a network of ''Old Boys'', forming one of the largest alumni organisations in South Africa. ''Pretoria Boys High School Old Boys Association'' publishes an annual journal and review, ''The Phobian'', which is distributed to ''Old Boys'' across the globe. Members of the association meet annually at the school for the annual dinner, and regular reunions of each matriculating group are organised 10, 20, 30 and 40 years on, echoing the refrain of the school song, [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n[[File:Max Theiler nobel.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Professor]] [[Max Theiler]] (1899\u20131972), 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] laureate, for developing a [[vaccine]] against [[yellow fever]]]]\n[[File:Nobel Prize 17 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Professor [[Michael Levitt]] (1947-), 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] laureate]]\n[[File:Edwin Cameron in robes.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Honourable]] [[Edwin Cameron]] (1953-), [[judge]] of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]]]]\n[[File:Elon Musk 2015.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elon Musk]] (1971-), [[business magnate]] and founder of [[SpaceX]] and a co-founder of [[Zip2]], [[PayPal]], and [[Tesla Motors]]]]\nThe school has produced two [[List of South African Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureates]], eighteen [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholars]], eight [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] [[judge]]s, an [[archbishop]],{{clarify|date=June 2016}} two [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football players, seven national [[cricket]]ers and four [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] rugby players{{sfn|Illsley|2001}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Eddie Barlow]], South African cricketer\n* [[James Botten|Jackie Botten]], South African cricketer\n* [[Edwin Cameron]], Constitutional Court [[judge]] and AIDS activist\n* [[Billy Downer]], Advocate of the Supreme Court, National Prosecutor and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]]\n* [[David B.

It was renamed ''Pretoria High School'' and became the first of the so-called ''Milner schools'' in the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], opening on 3 June 1901 with Charles Hope - who also founded [[Potchefstroom Boys High]] as [[headmaster]].  Initial enrolment was 32 pupils, both boys and girls, which increased to 132 by August of that year. Mr Hope left 15 months later, along with the girls, who were finally accommodated into the old building of the former [[Transvaal Republic]]'s ''Staatsmeischjeskool'' (State Girls' School), which was renamed [[Pretoria High School for Girls]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Pretoria College (1903-1909) ===\n\nUnder the new headmaster, Harold Atkinson, enrolment increased to 100 boys by 1903. The name of the school was also changed to ''Pretoria College''. Mr Atkinson left at the end of 1905 and was succeeded by J F Acheson who stayed with the school until it moved from Skinner Street to its current site in 1909. Formal devolution between primary and high school pupils only occurred in 1905.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== The new buildings and bilingualism (1910-1920) ===\n\nMilner's intention was to create a stable educational infrastructure in the new colony's capital and duly set aside {{convert|200|ha}} of ground to the south-east of central Pretoria for the construction of new academic institutions. The southern most {{convert|60|ha}}, which included the ''[[Waterkloof]] Kop'' (English: Waterkloof Hill), was chosen as the new site for Pretoria Boys High School. The architect, [[Patrick Eagle]], met the challenge by designing an edifice rivalling its larger contemporary, Sir [[Herbert Baker]]'s [[Union Buildings]]. Eagle chose to site the main buildings on the ridge of the hill giving the school its well-known dramatic setting.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\nOne year later, the four colonies of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], [[Orange Free State]], [[Natal Province|Natal]] and the [[Cape Colony|Cape]]  formed the [[Union of South Africa]]. Keen to forge unity between English and Dutch (Afrikaner) South Africans, Smuts' influence was evident when, on 6 April 1910, the school absorbed 100 boys and staff from the Dutch-medium Eendracht High School to form a dual-medium high school. The combined school was now named ''Pretoria High School for Boys - Pretoria Hogere school voor Jongens''. Smuts would later send his own sons to the school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Devolution and re-establishment (1920) ===\n\nThe dual-medium institution would last ten years. By 1920, the divide between English and Afrikaans speakers had become apparent nationwide; this was reflected in the need for a separate Afrikaans high school in Pretoria. Consequently, the [[Afrikaanse Ho\u00ebr Seunskool]] was formed immediately south of its parent, becoming the first Afrikaans-medium high school in the country, several years before [[Afrikaans]] attained official recognition as a language (and not a semi-[[Creole language|Creole]] of Dutch). The two schools enjoy close ties to this day, especially in an enthusiastic but friendly rivalry in sporting events. PBHS would now be left in its present form, known as Pretoria Boys High School, an English-medium public school.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Headmasters since 1909 ===\n\n* William Hofmeyr (1909-1935)\n* Daniel Matheson (1936-1949)\n* Noel Pollock (1950-1955)\n* Desmond Abernethy (1956-1973)\n* Malcolm Armstrong (1974-1989)\n* William E.

The shield component of the badge is divided into four quadrants, with the book representing learning, the tools the wealth of the Transvaal through gold mining, the tree growth and the ox wagon the Transvaal. The background colours of the four quadrants were the colours of the first four houses when given permanent names, i.e. Town red, Solomon gold, Sunnyside black and Rissik green.\n\n=== The school songs ===\n\nThe official school song, ''Tis Here We Learn To Live'', was written in the 1930s by two ''Old Boys''. The composer of the music, Dr George Findlay, was a prominent Pretoria [[dermatologist]]. However, the school later adopted [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]], originally the school song of [[Harrow School]] in [[London]]. It is this song that is sung at all school [[valedictions]]. The official school song was relegated to obscurity until it was revived as the school's rugby anthem.\n\n== Culture and activities ==\n\n=== Cultural activities ===\n\nCultural activities include a well-established musical tradition, with a formal [[symphony]] [[orchestra]], [[choir]], [[pipe band]], [[jazz]] ensemble and [[Folk music|folk]] group. Other activities include Photography, Fantasy and Historical war games, Aeronautical Society, Film, Wildlife, Drama, Debating, Chess, and many others.\n\n=== Athletics and leisure ===\n\nSporting facilities include soccer, [[rugby union]], [[cricket]], [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standard athletics grounds, [[tennis]], [[squash (sport)|squash]] and [[basketball]] courts, a [[gym]]nasium, [[field hockey|hockey]] fields, two swimming pools including one for [[waterpolo]], an [[AstroTurf]] and a rock-climbing wall. There is also a man-made [[pine|pine forest]], an old [[shooting range]] which has been converted for the purpose of archery, an [[amphitheatre]] and an artificial lake, ''Loch Armstrong''. The grounds form a protected bird sanctuary and are home to several different species of birds, fish, amphibians and reptiles.\n\n== School buildings ==\n\nThe new school buildings were officially opened in 1909 by [[Jan Smuts|General Smuts]], then colonial secretary of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]]. The main building of the school, sited on Waterkloof Hill, is at present close to [[University of Pretoria]], sitting opposite to the distant [[Union Buildings]] on [[Meintjieskop]].\n\n=== Houses ===\n\nPretoria Boys High School is made up of ten constituent houses, each with its own unique culture and identity. House assemblies are held weekly, and house prefects are appointed annually. Annual inter-house sports meetings take place in which every pupil is strongly encouraged to participate. The inter-house swim meet (gala) is the most popular and well-attended of sport meetings.\n\n=== Boarding houses ===\n\n* Solomon\n* Rissik\n* School\n\n=== Day-boy houses ===\n\n* Abernethy\n* Arcadia\n* Armstrong\n* Hofmeyr\n* Matheson\n* Sunnyside\n* Town\n\n== The Old Boys Association ==\n\nPretoria Boys High School has a network of ''Old Boys'', forming one of the largest alumni organisations in South Africa. ''Pretoria Boys High School Old Boys Association'' publishes an annual journal and review, ''The Phobian'', which is distributed to ''Old Boys'' across the globe. Members of the association meet annually at the school for the annual dinner, and regular reunions of each matriculating group are organised 10, 20, 30 and 40 years on, echoing the refrain of the school song, [[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]].\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n\n[[File:Max Theiler nobel.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Professor]] [[Max Theiler]] (1899\u20131972), 1951 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] laureate, for developing a [[vaccine]] against [[yellow fever]]]]\n[[File:Nobel Prize 17 2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Professor [[Michael Levitt]] (1947-), 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] laureate]]\n[[File:Edwin Cameron in robes.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Honourable]] [[Edwin Cameron]] (1953-), [[judge]] of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]]]]\n[[File:Elon Musk 2015.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elon Musk]] (1971-), [[business magnate]] and founder of [[SpaceX]] and a co-founder of [[Zip2]], [[PayPal]], and [[Tesla Motors]]]]\nThe school has produced two [[List of South African Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureates]], eighteen [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholars]], eight [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court]] [[judge]]s, an [[archbishop]],{{clarify|date=June 2016}} two [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football players, seven national [[cricket]]ers and four [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] rugby players{{sfn|Illsley|2001}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Eddie Barlow]], South African cricketer\n* [[James Botten|Jackie Botten]], South African cricketer\n* [[Edwin Cameron]], Constitutional Court [[judge]] and AIDS activist\n* [[Billy Downer]], Advocate of the Supreme Court, National Prosecutor and [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]]\n* [[David B.

The Imperial Japanese court quickly adopted Chinese styles of dress and clothing,<ref>{{Citation|url =  https://academic.oup.com/jdh/article/30/3/300/3010188 |title = Elizabeth LaCouture, Journal of Design History, Vol. 30, Issue 3, 1 September 2017, Pages 300\u2013314}}.</ref> with evidence of the oldest samples of ''[[shibori]]'' fabric stored at the Shosoin Temple being Chinese in origin, due to the technical capacities of Japan's ability to produce the fabrics stored there at the time.\n\nDuring Japan's Heian period (794-1192 CE) some centuries later, this style of dress became [[junihitoe|increasingly stylised]], with some elements - such as the round-necked and tube-like sleeves of the ''chun ju'' jacket worn by both female and male courtiers in early seventh century Japan{{r|Dalby Fashioning Culture|p=27}} - being abandoned, and others, most importantly the lapped-front robes worn by both men and women, being kept. Some elements, such as the ''mo'' skirt worn by women, were kept in a vestigial sense, worn only to formal occasions as more of a train than a skirt proper.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> \n\nDuring the later Heian period, various clothing edicts reduced the number of layers a woman could wear, leading to the ''kosode'' - lit., \"small sleeve\" - garment, previously considered underwear, becoming outerwear within the Muromachi period (1336-1573 CE). Originally worn with [[hakama]] trousers over the top (another item of clothing previously underwear-only), the ''kosode'' began to be held closed with a small belt known as an obi.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> The ''kosode'' at this time mostly had the same proportions as modern kimono, though the sleeves were sewn shut at the back, and were smaller in width in comparison to the much wider body of the ''kosode.''\n\nDuring the [[Edo period]] (1603-1867 CE), the sleeves of the ''kosode'' began to grow in length, especially amongst unmarried women, and the obi became much longer and wider, with various styles of knots coming into fashion, alongside stiffer weaves of material supporting them.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> During the later Edo period, dress edicts intended to clamp down on the wealthy [[ch\u014dnin|merchant classes]] drove the previously elaborate fashions of the era underground, where aesthetic ideals such as ''[[iki (aesthetics)|iki]]'' flourished, continuing to affect kimono aesthetics even in the present day. From this point onwards, the basic shape of both men's and women's kimono has remained largely unchanged.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Meiji era]], the opening of Japan to Western trade after the enclosure of the Edo period led to a drive towards Western dress as a sign of \"modernity\". After an edict by [[Emperor Meiji]],{{citation needed|reason=previously given reference of edict 399 in the year 1871 does not support the abolition of kimono in certain job roles|date=February 2020}} for instance, policemen, railroad workers and teachers moved to wearing Western clothing within their job roles, with the adoption of Western clothing by men in Japan happening at a much greater pace than by women.

The ''hitoe'' worn in the Kamakura period were pulled up to be ankle-length, bloused over the hip with no belt on top, and had small, rounded sleeves that were sewn to the body of the ''hitoe''.\n\nIn the following centuries, the ''hitoe'' mostly retained its small, narrow and round-sleeved nature, with the length of women's sleeves increasing gradually over time and becoming occasionally detached from the body. The collar retained its relatively long and wide (in modern comparison) measurements, with the ''okumi'' front panel having a longer and shallower angle towards the hem.\n\nDuring the Edo period, the ''kosode'' - lit., \"small sleeve\", as it had come to be known - developed further into proportions similar to modern kimono today. \n\nChanges in women's fashion led to longer and more dramatic sleeves gaining popularity, with the sleeves themselves definitively becoming unattached from the body  to emphasise this and permit the increasingly wider and stiffer obi - with men's sleeves staying, for the most part, sewn shut to the body along much of their length.\n\nThe sleeves grew in proportion to be roughly the same width as the panels used on the body, and the collar on both men's and women's kimono narrowed in width and length.\n\nIn the present day, both men's and women's kimono retain some key differences held over from these previous proportions. Men's kimono should fall to the ankle, as they have roughly always done, where as a woman's kimono - historically worn trailing along the floor, then hiked up for convenience - should be as tall as the person wearing it, owing to the hip fold known as the ''ohashori'' worn underneath the obi. Though the collars on both men's and women's kimono are narrower, on formal women's kimono, the collar retains its historically wider width, being folded inwards before wear. This style of collar is known as ''hiro-eri'', \"wide collar\", whereas a regular-sized collar is known as ''bachi-eri''. On either type of kimono, the sleeves should fall to the wrist, though the constrictions of the fabric used may prevent this.\n\nHistorically, kimono were often taken apart to wash in separate panels, as the cutting layout for a kimono is little more than a series of rectangles - two long panels for the body (one for children) and two smaller panels for the sleeves, with smaller strips forming the narrow front panels and the collar. The kimono, once cleaned, would then be resewn by hand, with the standardised method of its construction allowing for it to be easily retailored to fit a changing body, or indeed another person.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> Though kimono are often machine-sewn in the present-day - with the exception of silk kimono - even a machine-made kimono will require hand-stitching to some degree.\n\n===Fabrics===\nBoth kimono and obi are made from a wide variety of fibre types, including hemp, linen, silk, crepe (known as ''chirimen''), and figured satin weaves such as ''rinzu''. Fibres such as rayon became widespread during WW2, and modern kimono are widely available in fabrics considered easier to care for, such as polyester. However, formal kimono are always made entirely from silk.\n\nKimono textiles can to be classified into two categories: ''gofuku''(\u5449\u670d), which indicates silk textiles in general, and cotton/hemp ''futomono''(\u592a\u7269) for everyday wear.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} ''Gofuku'' was named after \u5449 (W\u00fa) in ancient China, where the technology of silk fabrics originated from. Cotton clothing is called ''momenfuku''(\u6728\u7dbf\u670d) whereas hemp clothing is called ''asafuku''(\u9ebb\u670d) in Japanese. Cotton/hemp fabrics are generally called as futomono (\u592a\u7269, Thick materials) as the fiber of these materials are thicker compared to that of silk.  Till the end of the Edo period, tailoring of these fabrics were handled respectively at gofuku stores (Gofuku Dana) and futomono stores (Futomono Dana), however, after the Meiji period, kimono was not worn as daily wear very often and futomono stores eventually went out of business.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File:Girls in kimonos.jpg|thumb|right|Girls in kimono]]\n\nKimono are traditionally made from a single bolt of fabric known as a ''tanmono'', which are roughly 11.5m long and 36cm wide for women,<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> and 12.5m long and 42cm wide for men. The entire bolt is used to make one kimono, and some men's ''tanmono'' are woven to be long enough to create a matching ''haori'' jacket and ''juban'' as well. Some custom bolts of fabric are produced for especially tall or heavy people, such as sumo wrestlers, who must have kimono custom-made by either joining multiple bolts, weaving custom-width fabric, or using non-standard size fabric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kimono-taizen.com/|title=\u7537\u306e\u304d\u3082\u306e\u5927\u5168 |publisher=Kimono-taizen.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>\n\nKimono fabrics are frequently hand-made and -decorated. Techniques such as ''y\u016bzen'' dye resist are used for applying decoration and patterns to the base cloth. Repeating patterns that cover a large area of a kimono are traditionally done with the ''y\u016bzen'' resist technique and a stencil. Over time there have been many variations in color, fabric, and style, as well as accessories such as the obi. Customarily, woven patterns and dyed repeat patterns are considered informal. Formal kimono have free-style designs dyed over the whole surface or along the hem.<ref name=\"Dalby Geisha\">{{cite book |last1=Dalby |first1=Liza |title=Geisha |date=2000 |publisher=Vintage Random House |location=London |isbn=978-0099286387 |edition=3rd |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/geisha00dalb }}</ref>\n\nThe pattern of the kimono can determine in which season it should be worn. For example, a pattern with [[butterflies]] or [[cherry blossoms]] would be worn in spring. Watery designs are common during the summer. A popular autumn motif is the russet [[Japanese Maple|leaf of the Japanese maple]]; for winter, designs may include [[bamboo]], [[pine tree]]s and [[plum blossoms]] ([[Three Friends of Winter|three friends of winter]]).\n\nA popular form of textile art in Japan is [[shibori]] (intricate tie dye), found on some of the more expensive kimono and [[haori]] kimono jackets. Patterns are created by minutely binding the fabric and masking off areas, then dying it, usually by hand. When the bindings are removed, an undyed pattern is revealed. ''Shibori'' work can be further enhanced with ''yuzen'' (hand applied) drawing or painting with textile dyes or with embroidery; it is then known as ''[[tsujigahana]]''. Shibori textiles are very time-consuming to produce and require great skill, so the textiles and garments created from them are very expensive and highly prized.\n\nOld kimono have historically been recycled in various ways, depending on the type of kimono and its original use. Kimono were shortened, with the okumi taken off and the collar re-sewn, to make haori, or would simply be cut at the waist to create a side-tying jacket. After marriage or a certain age, young women would shorten the sleeves of their kimono, and extra material taken from kimono could be used to lengthen it at the waist, create an obi, or was used to patch similar kimono.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nKimono were also used to create ''[[dounuki]]'', underkimono worn on top of the ''juban'', and the material would show at the sleeve, hem and collar. Kimono were also used to create ''juban'' themselves, and after wearing layered kimono fell out of fashion, create a false underlayer \u2013 a ''[[hiyoku]]'' \u2013 was another use for old kimono. They could also be resewn into kimono for children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nHistorically, skilled craftsmen would laboriously cut old silk kimono into strips roughly 1&nbsp;cm wide to weave into obi, called ''saki-ori'' obi. The technique was a kind of rag-weaving, creating a mostly one-sided obi that was relatively narrow and informal. ''Saki-ori'' obi are prized for their craftsmanship and rustic quality today, as they would have taken many hours to create, and ''saki-ori'' obi often feature patterns of stripes, checks and arrows. The technique is kept alive to this day by craftspeople interested in rustic arts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Parts===\n[[Image:Kimono parts.png|thumb|550px|Diagram of the kimono parts]]\n\nThese terms refer to parts of a kimono:\n* {{Nihongo||\u80f4\u88cf|D\u014dura}}: upper lining on a woman's kimono.\n* {{Nihongo||\u887f|Eri}}: collar.\n* {{Nihongo||\u8898|Fuki}}: hem guard.\n* {{Nihongo||\u632f\u308a|Furi}}: sleeve below the armhole.\n* {{Nihongo||\u5e2f|Obi}}: a belt used to tuck excess cloth away from the seeing public.\n* {{Nihongo||\u524d\u8eab\u9803|Maemigoro}}: front main panel, excluding sleeves.

These techniques, such as hand-plied ''bashofu'' fabrics and hand-tied ''kanoko shibori'' dotwork dyeing, may take over a year to finish. Kimono artisans may be made [[National Living Treasure|National Living Treasures]] in recognition of their work, with the pieces they produce being considered culturally important.\n\nEven kimono that have not been hand-crafted will constitute a relatively high expense when bought new, as even for one outfit, a number of accessories of the right formality and appearance must be bought. Not all brand-new kimono originate from artisans, and mass-production of kimono - mainly of casual or semi-formal kimono - does exist, with mass-produced pieces being mostly cheaper than those purchased through a ''gofukuya'' (kimono shop, see below).\n\nThough artisan-made kimono are some of the most accomplished works of textile art on the market, many pieces are not bought solely for appreciation of the craft. Unwritten social obligations to wear kimono to certain events - weddings, funerals - often leads consumers to purchase artisan pieces for reasons other than personal choice, fashion sense or love of kimono:\n\n<blockquote>[Third-generation ''yuzen'' dyer Jotaro Saito] believes we are in a strange age where people who know nothing about kimono are the ones who spend a lot of money on a genuine handcrafted kimono for a wedding that is worn once by someone who suffers wearing it, and then is never used again.<ref name=\"Cliffe\">{{cite book |last1=Cliffe |first1=Sheila |title=The Social Life of Kimono |date=23 March 2017 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4725-8553-0 |page=134 |edition=1st}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe high cost of most brand-new kimono reflects in part the pricing techniques within the industry. \n\nMost brand-new kimono are purchased through ''gofukuya'', where kimono are sold as fabric rolls only - known as ''tanmono'' - the price of which is often left to the shop's discretion. The shop will charge a fee separate to the cost of the fabric for it to be sewn to the customer's measurements, and fees for washing the fabric or weatherproofing it may be added as another separate cost.\n\nIf the customer is unfamiliar with wearing kimono, they may hire a service to help dress them; the end cost of a new kimono, therefore, remains uncertain until the kimono itself has been finished and worn.<ref name=\"Valk\">{{cite web |last1=Valk |first1=Julie |title=Survival or Success?

And even if you don\u2019t buy a kimono today, you have to buy\nsomething, no matter how small it is.\u2019<ref name=\"Valk\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, kimono bought by hobbyists are likely to be less expensive, purchased from second-hand stores with no such sales practices or obligation to buy. Hobbyists may also buy cheaper synthetic kimono (marketed as 'washable') brand-new. Some enthusiasts also make their own kimono; this may be due to difficulty finding kimono of the right size, or simply for personal choice and fashion.\n\nSecond-hand items are seen as highly affordable; costs can be as little as \u00a5100 (about US$0.90){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} at thrift stores within Japan, and certain historic kimono production areas around the country - such as the Nishijin district of Kyoto - are well-known for their second-hand kimono markets. Kimono themselves do not go out of fashion, making even vintage or antique pieces viable for wear, depending on condition.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tsuruoka |first1=Hiroyuki |title=The unspoiled market found by the lost office workers |url=http://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/40138 |website=Japan Business Press |accessdate=14 May 2019 |language=Japanese}}</ref> \n\nHowever, even second-hand women's obi are likely to remain somewhat pricey; a used, well-kept and high-quality second-hand obi can cost upwards of US$300,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} as they are often intricately woven, or decorated with embroidery, goldwork and may be hand-painted. Men's obi, in contrast, retail much cheaper, as they are narrower, shorter, and have either very little or no decoration.\n\n==Types of kimono==\nKimono range in variation from extremely formal to very casual. The formality of a woman's kimono is determined mostly by pattern placement, decoration style, fabric choice and colour. The formality of men's kimono differs, in that it is determined more by fabric choice and coordination elements (''hakama'', haori, etc.) than decoration, as men's kimono tend to be one colour with motifs only visible when looked at closely.\n\nIn both cases, formality is also determined by the number and type of [[mon (badge)|''kamon'']] (crests). Five mon (''itsutsu mon'') are the most formal, three mon (''mitsu mon'') are mid-formality, and one mon (''hitotsu mon'') is the least formal, used for occasions such as tea ceremony. The type of mon adds formality as well, with a \"full sun\" (''hinata'') mon being the most formal, a \"mid-shadow\" (''nakakage'') mon being mid-formality, and a \"shadow\" (''kage'') mon being the least formal. Embroidered mon, called ''nui mon'', are also seen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mon and Kamon |url=https://wafuku.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/mon-kamon-%E2%80%93-japanese-emblem-crests-%E2%80%93-vintage-antique-japanese-kimonos/ |website=wafuku.co.uk |publisher=Wafuku.co.uk |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nFormality can also be determined by the type and colour of accessories, such as weave of ''obijime'' and the style of ''obiage''.\n\n===Women's kimono===\nThe typical woman's kimono outfit may consist of up to twelve or more separate pieces; some outfits, such as formal wedding kimono, may require the assistance of licensed kimono dressers, though usually this is due to the wearer's inexperience with kimono and the difficult-to-tie nature of formal ''obi musubi''. Most professional kimono dressers are found in Japan, where they work out of hair salons, as specialist businesses, or freelance.\n\nChoosing an appropriate type of kimono requires knowledge of the wearer's age, occasionally marital status (though less so in modern times), the formality of the occasion at hand, and the season. Choice of fabric is also dependent on these factors, though some fabrics - such as crepe and ''rinz\u016b'' - are never seen in certain varieties of kimono, and some fabrics such as ''shusu'' (satin) silk are barely ever seen in kimono altogether, instead being worn on the obi.\n\nThough length of kimono, collar style and the way the sleeves are sewn on varies for ''susohiki'' kimono, in all other types of women's kimono, the construction generally does not change; the collar is set back slightly into the nape of the neck, the sleeves are only attached at the shoulder, not all the way down the sleeve length, and the kimono's length from shoulder to hem should generally equal the entire height of the woman wearing it, to allow for the ''ohashori'' hip fold.\n\nSleeve length increases for ''furisode'' - young women's formal dress - but young women are not limited to wearing only ''furisode'', as outside of formal occasions that warrant it, can wear all other types of women's kimono such as ''irotomesode'' and ''komon''.\n\n====''Yukata''====\n''[[Yukata]]'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u6d74\u8863|\u6d74\u8863]]}}) are casual cotton summer kimono. ''Yukata'' were originally very simple indigo and white cotton kimono, little more than a bathrobe never worn outside the house. However, from roughly the mid-1980s onwards, they began to be produced in a wide variety of bright colours, large motifs and loud patterns, responding to a demand for a more casual modern kimono that could be worn to a summer festival.\n\nIn the present day, ''yukata'' are worn with ''hanhaba'' (half-width) or ''heko'' obi, and for women, often accessorised with colour hair accessories. ''Yukata'' are always unlined, and it is possible to dress up a high-end, more subdued ''yukata'' with a relatively casual ''nagoya'' obi - one with a simple dyed design in an informal fabric such as ''ro'' or ''tsumugi''.\n\n====''Furisode''====\n[[File:Kimono2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A young woman stood up in a dark blue long-sleeved kimono with a white designs across the lap and the middle of the sleeves. The sash she wears is orange with a thin green belt in the centre |A young woman wearing a ''furisode'']]\n''[[Furisode]]'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u632f\u8896|\u632f\u8896]]}}) (lit., \"swinging sleeve\") kimono are the most formal kimono for a young, often unmarried, woman. They are decorated with colourful patterns across the entirety of the garment, and usually worn to ''[[seijin shiki]]'' (Coming of Age Day) or weddings, either by the bride herself or an unmarried younger female relative.\n\nThe sleeves of the furisode average at between 100\u2013110&nbsp;cm in length. ''Chu-furisode'' (mid-size ''furisode'') have shorter sleeves at roughly 80&nbsp;cm in length; most ''chu-furisode'' are vintage kimono, as in the modern day ''furisode'' are not worn often enough to warrant buying a more casual form of the dress.\n\n====''H\u014dmongi''====\n''H\u014dmongi'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u8a2a\u554f\u7740|\u8a2a\u554f\u7740]]}}) literally translates as ''visiting wear''. ''H\u014dmongi'' are distinguished in their motif placement - the motifs flow across the back right shoulder and back right sleeve, the front left shoulder and front left sleeve, and across the hem, higher at the left than the right. They are always made of silk, and are more formal than ''tsukesage''.\n\n''H\u014dmongi'' are first roughly sewn up, the design sketched onto the fabric, before it is taken apart to be dyed again. The ''h\u014dmongi'''s close relative, the ''tsukesage'', has its patterns dyed on the bolt before sewing up. This method of production can usually distinguish the two, as the motifs on a ''h\u014dmongi'' are likely to cross fluidly over seams in a way a ''tsukesage'' generally will not.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coline |first1=Youandi |title=Formality Series: Tsukesage |url=https://chayatsujikimono.wordpress.com/2019/08/02/formality-series-tsukesage/ |website=chayatsujikimono.wordpress.com |publisher=Chayatsuji Kimono |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n''H\u014dmongi'' may be worn by both married and unmarried women; often friends of the bride will wear ''h\u014dmongi'' at weddings (except relatives) and receptions. They may also be worn to formal parties.\n\n====''Iromuji''====\n''Iromuji'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u8272\u7121\u5730|\u8272\u7121\u5730]]}}) (lit. \"solid colour\") are monochromatic, undecorated kimono mainly worn to tea ceremonies. The dyed silk may have a flat woven pattern - ''iromuji'' suitable for autumn are often made of ''rinzu'' silk. Some ''edo komon'' with incredibly fine patterns may be suitable for tea ceremony, as from a distance they are visually similar to ''iromuji''. ''Iromuji'' may occasionally have one ''kamon'', though likely no more than this, and are always made of silk. ''Shibori'' accessories such as ''obiage'' are never worn with ''iromuji'' if the purpose of wear is a tea ceremony; instead, flat and untextured silks are chosen for accessories.\n\n====''Edo komon''====\n''Edo komon'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u6c5f\u6238\u5c0f\u7d0b|\u6c5f\u6238\u5c0f\u7d0b]]}}) is a type of ''komon'' characterised by an extremely small repeating pattern, usually done in white on a coloured background. The ''edo komon'' dyeing technique originated within the [[samurai]] classes during the [[Edo period]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} ''Edo komon'' are of a similar formality to ''iromuji'', and ''edo komon'' with one ''kamon'' can be worn as low-formality visiting wear; because of this, they are always made of silk, unlike regular ''komon''.\n\n====''Mofuku''====\n{{main|Mourning#Japan}}\n''Mofuku '' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u55aa\u670d|\u55aa\u670d]]}}) describes general formal mourning dress, and both men and women wear ''mofuku''. ''Mofuku'' kimono are plain black silk with five ''kamon'', worn with white undergarments and white ''tabi''. Men wear a kimono of the same kind, with a subdued ''obi'' and a black-and-white or black-and-grey striped ''hakama'', worn with black or white z\u014dri.\n\nA completely black mourning ensemble for women - a plain black ''obi'', black ''obijime'' and black ''obiage'' - is usually reserved for those closest to the deceased. Those further away will wear kimono in dark and subdued colours, rather than a plain black kimono with a reduced number of crests. In time periods when kimono were worn more often, those closest to the deceased would slowly begin dressing in coloured kimono over a period of weeks after the death, with the ''obijime'' being the last thing to be changed over to colour.\n\n====''Kurotomesode''====\n''Kurotomesode'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u9ed2\u7559\u8896|\u9ed2\u7559\u8896]]}}) (black short-sleeve kimono) are formal kimono with a black background and a design along the hem only, worn to formal events such as weddings and wedding parties. The design is seen along the hem only; the further up the body this design reaches, the younger the wearer is considered to be, though for a very young woman an ''irotomesode'' may be chosen instead, ''kurotomesode'' being considered somewhat more mature. The design is either symmetrically placed on the ''fuki'' and ''okumi'' portions of the kimono, or asymmetrically placed along the entirety of the hem, with the design being larger and higher-placed at the left side than the right. Vintage kimono are more likely to have the former pattern placement than the latter, though is not a hard rule.\n\n''Kurotomesode'' are always made of silk, and may have a ''hiyoku'' - a false lining layer - attached, occasionally with a slightly padded hem. A ''kurotomesode'' usually has between 3 and 5 crests; a ''kurotomesode'' of any number of crests outranks an ''irotomesode'' with less than five. ''Kurotomesode'', though formalwear, are not allowed at the royal court, as black is the colour of mourning, despite the colour designs decorating the kimono itself; outside of the royal court, this distinction for ''kurotomesode'' does not exist. ''Kurotomesode'' are never made of flashy silks like ''rinz\u016b'', but are instead likely to be a matte fabric with little texture.\n\n====''Irotomesode''====\n''Irotomesode'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u8272\u7559\u8896|\u8272\u7559\u8896]]}}) (colour short-sleeve kimono) are slightly lower-ranking formal kimono with roughly the same pattern placement as ''kurotomesode'' on a coloured background. ''Irotomesode'', though worn to formal events, may be chosen when a ''kurotomesode'' would make the wearer appear to be overdressed for the situation. The pattern placement for ''irotomesode'' is roughly identical to ''kurotomesode'', though patterns seen along the ''fuki'' and ''okumi'' may drift slightly into the back hem itself. ''Irotomesode'' with five ''kamon'' are of the same formality as any ''kurotomesode''. ''Irotomesode'' may be made of figured silk such as ''rinz\u016b''.\n\n====''Tsukesage''====\n''Tsukesage'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u4ed8\u3051\u4e0b\u3052|\u4ed8\u3051\u4e0b\u3052]]}}) are lower-ranking formalwear, a step below ''h\u014dmongi'', wherein the motifs generally do not cross over the seams of each kimono panel, but have the same placement as a ''h\u014dmongi''. Similarities between the two often lead to confusion, and indeed, sometimes the two are so visually similar that the distinction is difficult to make. ''Tsukesage'' can have between one and three ''kamon'', and can be worn to parties, but not ceremonies or highly formal events.\n\n====''Uchikake''====\n[[File:Khalili Collection Kimono 01.jpg|thumb|An ''Uchikake'' (wedding) kimono depicting [[Red-crowned crane|cranes]], from the [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\n''Uchikake'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u6253\u3061\u639b\u3051|\u6253\u3061\u639b\u3051]]}}) are highly formal kimono worn only in bridalwear or on stage. The name ''uchikake'' comes from the verb ''uchikake-ru'', \"to drape upon\", originating in roughly the 16th century from a fashion of the ruling classes of the time to wear kimono (then called ''kosode'', \"small sleeve\") unbelted over the shoulders of one's other garments.{{R|Dalby Fashioning Culture|p=34}}\n\n''Uchikake'' are worn in the same manner in the present day, though unlike their 16th-century counterparts, could never be worn as an everyday kimono as well; they are heavily-decorated, highly-formal garments with thickly-padded hems, designed to trail along the floor as a sort of coat. Bridal ''uchikake'' are either red or white, and often decorated heavily with auspicious motifs. Because they are not designed to be worn with an ''obi'', the designs cover the entirety of the back.\n\n====''Shiromuku''====\n''Shiromuku'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u767d\u7121\u57a2|\u767d\u7121\u57a2]], lit. \"white pure-innocence\"}}) are the pure-white wedding kimono worn by the bride for a traditional [[Marriage in Japan|Japanese]] [[Shinto]] [[Wedding ceremony#Eastern culture|wedding ceremony]]. Comparable to a ''[[#uchikake|uchikake]]'' and sometimes described as just a white ''uchikake'', a ''shiromuku'' is worn for the part of the wedding ceremony, symbolising the purity of the bride coming into the marriage. The bride may later change into a red ''uchikake'' after the ceremony to symbolise good luck.\n\nA ''shiromuku'' will form part of a bridal ensemble with matching or coordinating accessories, such as a bridal [[Shimada (hairstyle)|''katsura'']], a set of matching [[kanzashi]] (usually mock-tortoiseshell), and a ''sensu'' fan tucked into the kimono. Due to the expensive nature of traditional bridal clothing, few are likely to buy brand-new ''shiromuku''; it is not unusual to rent kimono for special occasions, and Shinto shrines are known to keep and rent out ''shiromuku'' for traditional weddings. Those who do possess ''shiromuku'' already are likely to have inherited them from close family members.\n\n====''Susohiki / Hikizuri''====\n''Susohiki'' (lit. \"trailing skirt\") kimono are extremely long kimono worn by geisha, actors in kabuki and people performing [[Buy\u014d|traditional Japanese dance]]. A ''susohiki'' can be up to 230&nbsp;cm long, and are generally no shorter than 200&nbsp;cm from shoulder to hem; this is to allow the kimono to literally trail along the floor.\n\n''Susohiki'', apart from their extreme length, are also sewn slightly differently to normal kimono, due to the way they are worn.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coline |first1=Youandi |title=Are kimono and hikizuri the same? |url=https://chayatsujikimono.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/are-kimono-and-hikizuri-the-same/ |website=Chayatsuji Kimono |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref> The collar on a ''susohiki'' is sewn further and deeper back into the nape of the neck, so that it can be pulled down much lower without causing the front of the kimono to ride up. The sleeves are set unevenly onto the body, shorter at the back than at the front, so that the underarm does not show when the collar is set this low.\n\n''Susohiki'' are also tied differently when they are put on - whereas regular kimono are tied with a visible ''ohashori'', and the side seams kept straight, ''susohiki'' are pulled up somewhat diagonally, to emphasise the hips and ensure the kimono trails nicely on the floor. A small ''ohashori'' is tied, larger at the back than the front, but it wrapped against the body with a red ''momi'' wrap, which is then covered by the ''obi'', rendering it not visible.{{refn|group=note|name=first|Video reference showing Atami geisha Kyouma being dressed in hikizuri \u2013 the second video shows the difference between ohashori length at the front and back, and how it is tied into the obi so as to be not visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BrPk7R-Apeh/ |title=[Video from Atami Geigi Kenban on Instagram] |date=11 December 2018 |access-date=14 May 2019 |language=Japanese}}</ref>}}\n\n====''J\u016bnihitoe''====\n[[File:Junihitoe.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A young woman with her hair down wearing several layered pink and green Heian-period kimono |A woman modelling a ''j\u016bnihitoe'']]\n{{main|J\u016bnihitoe}}\n''J\u016bnihitoe'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u5341\u4e8c\u5358|\u5341\u4e8c\u5358]]}}) (lit. \"twelve layers\") describes the layered garments worn by [[Lady-in-waiting#Japan|court ladies]] during the [[Heian period]]. The ''j\u016bnihitoe'' consisted of up to twelve layered garments, with the innermost garment being the ''kosode'' - the small-sleeved kimono prototype which would eventually go on to become the outermost garment worn.\n\nThe total weight of the ''j\u016bnihitoe'' could be up to 20&nbsp;kg. The garments were decorated in relatively large motifs, with a more important aspect being the numerous recorded colour combinations an outfit could have.\n\nAn important accessory of this outfit was an elaborate [[Hand fan#Japanese hand fan|hand fan]], which could be tied together by tassels tied onto the end fan bones. These fans were made of cypress wood entirely, with the design painted onto the wide, flat bones themselves, and were known as ''hi\u014dugi''.\n\nNo garments from the Heian period survive, and today the ''j\u016bnihitoe'' can only be seen as a reproduction in museums, movies, festivals and demonstrations. The [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Household]] still officially uses them at some important functions, such as the coronation of the new Empress.\n\n===Men's kimono===\n[[Image:Shinto married couple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Couple being married in traditional dress]]\n\nIn contrast to women's kimono, men's kimono outfits are far simpler, typically consisting of five pieces, not including footwear.\n\nMen's kimono sleeves are attached to the body of the kimono with no more than a few inches unattached at the bottom, unlike the women's style of very deep sleeves mostly unattached from the body of the kimono. Men's sleeves are less deep than women's kimono sleeves to accommodate the obi around the waist beneath them, whereas on a woman's kimono, the long, unattached bottom of the sleeve can hang over the obi without getting in the way.\n[[Image:Armored Samurai with Jin-Haori.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jinbaori \u2013 Kimono tabards for armoured Samurai]]\nIn the modern era, the principal distinctions between men's kimono are in the fabric. The typical men's kimono is a subdued, dark color; black, dark blues, greens, and browns are common. Fabrics are usually matte. Some have a subtle pattern, and textured fabrics are common in more casual kimono. More casual kimono may be made in slightly brighter colors, such as lighter purples, greens and blues. Sumo wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colors such as fuchsia.\n\nThe most formal style of kimono is plain black silk with five ''kamon'' on the chest, shoulders and back. Slightly less formal is the three-''kamon'' kimono.\n\n==Accessories and related garments==\n{{Very long|section|small=left|date=October 2019}}\nThough the kimono is the national dress of Japan, it has never been the sole item of clothing worn throughout Japan; even before the Meiji Period and the introduction of Western dress to Japan, many variations of or cousins to the kimono existed as a separate style of dress, often as rural or (in the case of the [[Ainu people]]) cultural dress. \n\nSome variations on the kimono were the contemporary clothing of previous decades and centuries, and have survived on in an official or ceremonial capacity, worn only by certain people for certain occasions. There are also a number of accessories that can be worn with the kimono, and these vary by occasion and use.\n\n===Related garments===\n====Religious garments====\nSome related garments are specific to certain religious roles. The {{nihongo|''[[chihaya (clothing)|chihaya]]''|\u3061\u306f\u3084/\u8945}} is worn only by ''[[Kannushi]]'' and ''[[Miko]]'' in some [[Shinto shrine]] ceremonies, and the {{nihongo|''[[samue]]''|\u4f5c\u52d9\u8863}} is the everyday clothing for a male [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] lay-monk, and the favoured garment for ''[[Komus\u014d]]'' monks playing the ''[[shakuhachi]]''.\n\n====Ceremonial and professional garments====\n{{nihongo|''[[Jittoku]]''|\u5341\u5fb3}} are a style of haori worn only by some high-ranking male practitioners of tea ceremony. ''Jittoku'' are made of unlined silk gauze, fall to the hip, and have sewn ''himo'' ties at the front made of the same fabric as the main garment. The ''jittoku'' has a wrist opening that is entirely open along the sleeve's vertical length. The garment originated in the Kamakura Period (1185-1333 CE), and are worn without hakama.\n\nBoth [[Geisha#Appearance|geisha]] and [[Maiko#Appearance|maiko]] wear various types of kimono, and variations on common accessories, that are not found in everyday dress. As an extension of this, many practitioners of [[Japanese traditional dance]] wear similar kimono and accessories to geisha and maiko.\n\nFor certain traditional holidays and occasions, kimono are more likely to be worn, and on some occasions specific types of kimono, and accessories, are worn. For instance, ''[[okobo]]'', also known as ''pokkuri'', are worn by girls for ''[[shichi-go-san]]'', alongside brightly-coloured ''furisode''. ''Okobo'' are also worn by young women on ''[[seijin no hi]]''.\n\nFor formal ceremonies, members of Japanese nobility will wear certain types of antiquated kimono such as the {{nihongo|''[[suikan]]''|\u6c34\u5e72}} and the {{nihongo|''[[Kimono#J\u016bnihitoe|j\u016bnihitoe]]''|\u5341\u4e8c\u5358}}. Outside of nobility, ''j\u016bnihitoe'' are only found in dress-up (''henshin'') studios, or in museums as recreations; no examples of [[Heian period]] clothing exist, and only small and fragile samples of the fabrics used in those times survive.\n\n====Bridalwear====\nBrides in Japan who opt for a traditional ceremony will wear specific accessories and types of kimono, which may be changed and switched out for certain parts of the ceremony; for instance, the ''wata b\u014dshi'' hood is removed during the ceremony, and ''uchikake'' are worn over the top of ''shiromuku'' bridal kimono once the ceremony has been completed, usually at the reception. Many bridalwear traditions, such as the addition of a small (fake) dagger, are amalgams and facsimiles of samurai dress from previous eras. \n\n[[File:Bride at meiji shrine.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese bride in her tsunokakushi|125 px]]\n;{{nihongo|''[[Tsunokakushi]]''|[[Wiktionary:\u89d2\u96a0\u3057#Japanese|\u89d2\u96a0\u3057]], lit. \"horn-hiding\"}}: ''Tsunokakashi'' is a style of headwear worn by brides in traditional Shinto wedding ceremonies. ''Tsunokashi'' may be made of white silk and worn with the bride's white ''shiromuku'' wedding kimono, or they may be made of colored materials to match or coordinate when the bride opts for a non-''shiromuku'' style. ''Tsunokakashi'', unlike ''wata b\u014dshi'', do not cover the high topknot formed by the bride's ''takashimada''-style wig.\n\n:According to folk etymology, the headwear is worn to hide the bride's horns of jealousy and selfishness; however, this headdress was originally a simpler cap worn to keep the dirt and dust off a woman's hairstyle when travelling.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kimino |first1=Rinko |last2=Somegoro |first2=Ichikawa |title=Photographic Kabuki Kaleidoscope |date=2016 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |isbn=978-4-09-310843-0 |page=34 |edition=1st}}</ref> The custom spread from married women in samurai families in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods to younger women of lower classes during the Edo period.\n\n;{{nihongo|''Wata b\u014dshi''|[[Wiktionary:\u7dbf\u5e3d\u5b50#Japanese|\u7dbf\u5e3d\u5b50]], lit \"cotton hat\"}}: ''Wata b\u014dshi'' is a style of full-coverage hood also worn by the bride in traditional Shinto weddings.

They are made of many materials, including cloth, leather, vinyl and woven grass, and can be highly decorated or very simple.\n\n===Layering===\nPre-WW2, kimono were commonly worn layered, with three being the standard number of layers worn over the top of undergarments. The layered kimono underneath were known as ''d\u014dnuki'', and were often a patchwork of older or unwearable kimono taken apart for their fabric.\n\nIn modern-day Japan, layered kimono are only seen on the stage, whether for classical dances or in kabuki. A false second layer called a {{nihongo|''hiyoku''|\"second wing\"|\u6bd4\u7ffc}} may be attached instead of an entirely separate kimono to achieve this look; it is a type of floating lining, sewn to the kimono only along the centre back and underneath the collar.\n\nThis effect allows it to show at the collar and the hem, and in some kabuki performances such as ''[[Fuji Musume]]'', the kimono will be worn with the ''okumi'' flipped back slightly underneath the obi to expose the design on the ''hiyoku''. The ''hiyoku'' can also be seen on some bridal kimono.\n\n==Care==\n[[Image:Kimonofold.jpg|thumb|right|200px|How to fold a kimono]]\nIn the past, a kimono would often be entirely taken apart for washing, and then re-sewn for wearing.<ref name=\"Dalby Geisha\"/> This traditional washing method is called ''arai hari''. Because the stitches must be taken out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand sewn. ''Arai hari'' is very expensive and difficult and is one of the causes of the declining popularity of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially for high-end garments.\n\nNew, custom-made kimono are generally delivered to a customer with long, loose [[Tack (sewing)|basting]] stitches placed around the outside edges. These stitches are called ''shitsuke ito''. They are sometimes replaced for storage. They help to prevent bunching, folding and wrinkling, and keep the kimono's layers in alignment.\n\nLike many other traditional Japanese garments, there are specific ways to fold kimono. These methods help to preserve the garment and to keep it from creasing when stored. Kimono are often stored wrapped in paper called ''tat\u014dshi''.\n\nKimono need to be aired out at least seasonally and before and after each time they are worn. Many people prefer to have their kimono [[dry cleaning|dry cleaned]]. Although this can be extremely expensive, it is generally less expensive than ''arai hari'' but may be impossible for certain fabrics or dyes.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|kimono.ogg|2009-02-19}}\n{{Commons category|Kimono|lcfirst=yes}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Kimono buying guide}}\n* [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cultur/kimonos/kimoneng.shtml]&nbsp;- The Canadian Museum of Civilization - Archive of the exhibition \"The Landscape Kimonos of Itchiku Kubota\"\n* [http://www.iz2.or.jp/english/]&nbsp;- The Kyoto Costume Museum - Costume History in Japan\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120324224115/http://immortalgeisha.com/ig_bb/]&nbsp;- Archived link to the Immortal Geisha Forums; comprehensive resource on kimono knowledge and culture\n* [http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/k/kimono/]&nbsp;- Articles on kimono from the V&A Collection\n\n{{Japanese clothing}}\n{{Folk costume}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Portal bar|Japan|Fashion}}\n\n[[Category:Dresses]]\n[[Category:Japanese clothing]]\n[[Category:Robes and cloaks]]\n[[Category:Folk costumes]]\n[[Category:History of Asian clothing]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{short description|Japanese traditional garment}}\n{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2019}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=October 2019}}\n{{Tone|article|date=October 2019}}\n}}\n[[Image:Wedding kimono.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A traditional wedding kimono with ''tsunokakushi'' (wedding headpiece)]]\n{{infobox Chinese \n|title=''Kimono''\n|pic=Kimono (Chinese characters).svg\n|piccap=\"Kimono\" in ''[[kanji]]''\n|picupright=0.375\n|kanji=\u7740\u7269\n|romaji=kimono\n}}\n[[File:Khalili Collection Kimono 02.jpg|thumb|right| Kimono for a Young Woman, depicting a boat on swirling water, with pine tree, plum blossoms and maples.

The Imperial Japanese court quickly adopted Chinese styles of dress and clothing,<ref>{{Citation|url =  https://academic.oup.com/jdh/article/30/3/300/3010188 |title = Elizabeth LaCouture, Journal of Design History, Vol. 30, Issue 3, 1 September 2017, Pages 300\u2013314}}.</ref> with evidence of the oldest samples of ''[[shibori]]'' fabric stored at the Shosoin Temple being Chinese in origin, due to the technical capacities of Japan's ability to produce the fabrics stored there at the time.\n\nDuring Japan's Heian period (794-1192 CE) some centuries later, this style of dress became [[junihitoe|increasingly stylised]], with some elements - such as the round-necked and tube-like sleeves of the ''chun ju'' jacket worn by both female and male courtiers in early seventh century Japan{{r|Dalby Fashioning Culture|p=27}} - being abandoned, and others, most importantly the lapped-front robes worn by both men and women, being kept. Some elements, such as the ''mo'' skirt worn by women, were kept in a vestigial sense, worn only to formal occasions as more of a train than a skirt proper.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> \n\nDuring the later Heian period, various clothing edicts reduced the number of layers a woman could wear, leading to the ''kosode'' - lit., \"small sleeve\" - garment, previously considered underwear, becoming outerwear within the Muromachi period (1336-1573 CE). Originally worn with [[hakama]] trousers over the top (another item of clothing previously underwear-only), the ''kosode'' began to be held closed with a small belt known as an obi.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> The ''kosode'' at this time mostly had the same proportions as modern kimono, though the sleeves were sewn shut at the back, and were smaller in width in comparison to the much wider body of the ''kosode.''\n\nDuring the [[Edo period]] (1603-1867 CE), the sleeves of the ''kosode'' began to grow in length, especially amongst unmarried women, and the obi became much longer and wider, with various styles of knots coming into fashion, alongside stiffer weaves of material supporting them.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> During the later Edo period, dress edicts intended to clamp down on the wealthy [[ch\u014dnin|merchant classes]] drove the previously elaborate fashions of the era underground, where aesthetic ideals such as ''[[iki (aesthetics)|iki]]'' flourished, continuing to affect kimono aesthetics even in the present day. From this point onwards, the basic shape of both men's and women's kimono has remained largely unchanged.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Meiji era]], the opening of Japan to Western trade after the enclosure of the Edo period led to a drive towards Western dress as a sign of \"modernity\". After an edict by [[Emperor Meiji]],{{citation needed|reason=previously given reference of edict 399 in the year 1871 does not support the abolition of kimono in certain job roles|date=February 2020}} for instance, policemen, railroad workers and teachers moved to wearing Western clothing within their job roles, with the adoption of Western clothing by men in Japan happening at a much greater pace than by women.

The ''hitoe'' worn in the Kamakura period were pulled up to be ankle-length, bloused over the hip with no belt on top, and had small, rounded sleeves that were sewn to the body of the ''hitoe''.\n\nIn the following centuries, the ''hitoe'' mostly retained its small, narrow and round-sleeved nature, with the length of women's sleeves increasing gradually over time and becoming occasionally detached from the body. The collar retained its relatively long and wide (in modern comparison) measurements, with the ''okumi'' front panel having a longer and shallower angle towards the hem.\n\nDuring the Edo period, the ''kosode'' - lit., \"small sleeve\", as it had come to be known - developed further into proportions similar to modern kimono today. \n\nChanges in women's fashion led to longer and more dramatic sleeves gaining popularity, with the sleeves themselves definitively becoming unattached from the body  to emphasise this and permit the increasingly wider and stiffer obi - with men's sleeves staying, for the most part, sewn shut to the body along much of their length.\n\nThe sleeves grew in proportion to be roughly the same width as the panels used on the body, and the collar on both men's and women's kimono narrowed in width and length.\n\nIn the present day, both men's and women's kimono retain some key differences held over from these previous proportions. Men's kimono should fall to the ankle, as they have roughly always done, where as a woman's kimono - historically worn trailing along the floor, then hiked up for convenience - should be as tall as the person wearing it, owing to the hip fold known as the ''ohashori'' worn underneath the obi. Though the collars on both men's and women's kimono are narrower, on formal women's kimono, the collar retains its historically wider width, being folded inwards before wear. This style of collar is known as ''hiro-eri'', \"wide collar\", whereas a regular-sized collar is known as ''bachi-eri''. On either type of kimono, the sleeves should fall to the wrist, though the constrictions of the fabric used may prevent this.\n\nHistorically, kimono were often taken apart to wash in separate panels, as the cutting layout for a kimono is little more than a series of rectangles - two long panels for the body (one for children) and two smaller panels for the sleeves, with smaller strips forming the narrow front panels and the collar. The kimono, once cleaned, would then be resewn by hand, with the standardised method of its construction allowing for it to be easily retailored to fit a changing body, or indeed another person.<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> Though kimono are often machine-sewn in the present-day - with the exception of silk kimono - even a machine-made kimono will require hand-stitching to some degree.\n\n===Fabrics===\nBoth kimono and obi are made from a wide variety of fibre types, including hemp, linen, silk, crepe (known as ''chirimen''), and figured satin weaves such as ''rinzu''. Fibres such as rayon became widespread during WW2, and modern kimono are widely available in fabrics considered easier to care for, such as polyester. However, formal kimono are always made entirely from silk.\n\nKimono textiles can to be classified into two categories: ''gofuku''(\u5449\u670d), which indicates silk textiles in general, and cotton/hemp ''futomono''(\u592a\u7269) for everyday wear.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} ''Gofuku'' was named after \u5449 (W\u00fa) in ancient China, where the technology of silk fabrics originated from. Cotton clothing is called ''momenfuku''(\u6728\u7dbf\u670d) whereas hemp clothing is called ''asafuku''(\u9ebb\u670d) in Japanese. Cotton/hemp fabrics are generally called as futomono (\u592a\u7269, Thick materials) as the fiber of these materials are thicker compared to that of silk.  Till the end of the Edo period, tailoring of these fabrics were handled respectively at gofuku stores (Gofuku Dana) and futomono stores (Futomono Dana), however, after the Meiji period, kimono was not worn as daily wear very often and futomono stores eventually went out of business.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[File:Girls in kimonos.jpg|thumb|right|Girls in kimono]]\n\nKimono are traditionally made from a single bolt of fabric known as a ''tanmono'', which are roughly 11.5m long and 36cm wide for women,<ref name=\"Dalby Fashioning Culture\"/> and 12.5m long and 42cm wide for men. The entire bolt is used to make one kimono, and some men's ''tanmono'' are woven to be long enough to create a matching ''haori'' jacket and ''juban'' as well. Some custom bolts of fabric are produced for especially tall or heavy people, such as sumo wrestlers, who must have kimono custom-made by either joining multiple bolts, weaving custom-width fabric, or using non-standard size fabric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kimono-taizen.com/|title=\u7537\u306e\u304d\u3082\u306e\u5927\u5168 |publisher=Kimono-taizen.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>\n\nKimono fabrics are frequently hand-made and -decorated. Techniques such as ''y\u016bzen'' dye resist are used for applying decoration and patterns to the base cloth. Repeating patterns that cover a large area of a kimono are traditionally done with the ''y\u016bzen'' resist technique and a stencil. Over time there have been many variations in color, fabric, and style, as well as accessories such as the obi. Customarily, woven patterns and dyed repeat patterns are considered informal. Formal kimono have free-style designs dyed over the whole surface or along the hem.<ref name=\"Dalby Geisha\">{{cite book |last1=Dalby |first1=Liza |title=Geisha |date=2000 |publisher=Vintage Random House |location=London |isbn=978-0099286387 |edition=3rd |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/geisha00dalb }}</ref>\n\nThe pattern of the kimono can determine in which season it should be worn. For example, a pattern with [[butterflies]] or [[cherry blossoms]] would be worn in spring. Watery designs are common during the summer. A popular autumn motif is the russet [[Japanese Maple|leaf of the Japanese maple]]; for winter, designs may include [[bamboo]], [[pine tree]]s and [[plum blossoms]] ([[Three Friends of Winter|three friends of winter]]).\n\nA popular form of textile art in Japan is [[shibori]] (intricate tie dye), found on some of the more expensive kimono and [[haori]] kimono jackets. Patterns are created by minutely binding the fabric and masking off areas, then dying it, usually by hand. When the bindings are removed, an undyed pattern is revealed. ''Shibori'' work can be further enhanced with ''yuzen'' (hand applied) drawing or painting with textile dyes or with embroidery; it is then known as ''[[tsujigahana]]''. Shibori textiles are very time-consuming to produce and require great skill, so the textiles and garments created from them are very expensive and highly prized.\n\nOld kimono have historically been recycled in various ways, depending on the type of kimono and its original use. Kimono were shortened, with the okumi taken off and the collar re-sewn, to make haori, or would simply be cut at the waist to create a side-tying jacket. After marriage or a certain age, young women would shorten the sleeves of their kimono, and extra material taken from kimono could be used to lengthen it at the waist, create an obi, or was used to patch similar kimono.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nKimono were also used to create ''[[dounuki]]'', underkimono worn on top of the ''juban'', and the material would show at the sleeve, hem and collar. Kimono were also used to create ''juban'' themselves, and after wearing layered kimono fell out of fashion, create a false underlayer \u2013 a ''[[hiyoku]]'' \u2013 was another use for old kimono. They could also be resewn into kimono for children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nHistorically, skilled craftsmen would laboriously cut old silk kimono into strips roughly 1&nbsp;cm wide to weave into obi, called ''saki-ori'' obi. The technique was a kind of rag-weaving, creating a mostly one-sided obi that was relatively narrow and informal. ''Saki-ori'' obi are prized for their craftsmanship and rustic quality today, as they would have taken many hours to create, and ''saki-ori'' obi often feature patterns of stripes, checks and arrows. The technique is kept alive to this day by craftspeople interested in rustic arts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Parts===\n[[Image:Kimono parts.png|thumb|550px|Diagram of the kimono parts]]\n\nThese terms refer to parts of a kimono:\n* {{Nihongo||\u80f4\u88cf|D\u014dura}}: upper lining on a woman's kimono.\n* {{Nihongo||\u887f|Eri}}: collar.\n* {{Nihongo||\u8898|Fuki}}: hem guard.\n* {{Nihongo||\u632f\u308a|Furi}}: sleeve below the armhole.\n* {{Nihongo||\u5e2f|Obi}}: a belt used to tuck excess cloth away from the seeing public.\n* {{Nihongo||\u524d\u8eab\u9803|Maemigoro}}: front main panel, excluding sleeves.

These techniques, such as hand-plied ''bashofu'' fabrics and hand-tied ''kanoko shibori'' dotwork dyeing, may take over a year to finish. Kimono artisans may be made [[National Living Treasure|National Living Treasures]] in recognition of their work, with the pieces they produce being considered culturally important.\n\nEven kimono that have not been hand-crafted will constitute a relatively high expense when bought new, as even for one outfit, a number of accessories of the right formality and appearance must be bought. Not all brand-new kimono originate from artisans, and mass-production of kimono - mainly of casual or semi-formal kimono - does exist, with mass-produced pieces being mostly cheaper than those purchased through a ''gofukuya'' (kimono shop, see below).\n\nThough artisan-made kimono are some of the most accomplished works of textile art on the market, many pieces are not bought solely for appreciation of the craft. Unwritten social obligations to wear kimono to certain events - weddings, funerals - often leads consumers to purchase artisan pieces for reasons other than personal choice, fashion sense or love of kimono:\n\n<blockquote>[Third-generation ''yuzen'' dyer Jotaro Saito] believes we are in a strange age where people who know nothing about kimono are the ones who spend a lot of money on a genuine handcrafted kimono for a wedding that is worn once by someone who suffers wearing it, and then is never used again.<ref name=\"Cliffe\">{{cite book |last1=Cliffe |first1=Sheila |title=The Social Life of Kimono |date=23 March 2017 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4725-8553-0 |page=134 |edition=1st}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe high cost of most brand-new kimono reflects in part the pricing techniques within the industry. \n\nMost brand-new kimono are purchased through ''gofukuya'', where kimono are sold as fabric rolls only - known as ''tanmono'' - the price of which is often left to the shop's discretion. The shop will charge a fee separate to the cost of the fabric for it to be sewn to the customer's measurements, and fees for washing the fabric or weatherproofing it may be added as another separate cost.\n\nIf the customer is unfamiliar with wearing kimono, they may hire a service to help dress them; the end cost of a new kimono, therefore, remains uncertain until the kimono itself has been finished and worn.<ref name=\"Valk\">{{cite web |last1=Valk |first1=Julie |title=Survival or Success?

And even if you don\u2019t buy a kimono today, you have to buy\nsomething, no matter how small it is.\u2019<ref name=\"Valk\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn contrast, kimono bought by hobbyists are likely to be less expensive, purchased from second-hand stores with no such sales practices or obligation to buy. Hobbyists may also buy cheaper synthetic kimono (marketed as 'washable') brand-new. Some enthusiasts also make their own kimono; this may be due to difficulty finding kimono of the right size, or simply for personal choice and fashion.\n\nSecond-hand items are seen as highly affordable; costs can be as little as \u00a5100 (about US$0.90){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} at thrift stores within Japan, and certain historic kimono production areas around the country - such as the Nishijin district of Kyoto - are well-known for their second-hand kimono markets. Kimono themselves do not go out of fashion, making even vintage or antique pieces viable for wear, depending on condition.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tsuruoka |first1=Hiroyuki |title=The unspoiled market found by the lost office workers |url=http://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/40138 |website=Japan Business Press |accessdate=14 May 2019 |language=Japanese}}</ref> \n\nHowever, even second-hand women's obi are likely to remain somewhat pricey; a used, well-kept and high-quality second-hand obi can cost upwards of US$300,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} as they are often intricately woven, or decorated with embroidery, goldwork and may be hand-painted. Men's obi, in contrast, retail much cheaper, as they are narrower, shorter, and have either very little or no decoration.\n\n==Types of kimono==\nKimono range in variation from extremely formal to very casual. The formality of a woman's kimono is determined mostly by pattern placement, decoration style, fabric choice and colour. The formality of men's kimono differs, in that it is determined more by fabric choice and coordination elements (''hakama'', haori, etc.) than decoration, as men's kimono tend to be one colour with motifs only visible when looked at closely.\n\nIn both cases, formality is also determined by the number and type of [[mon (badge)|''kamon'']] (crests). Five mon (''itsutsu mon'') are the most formal, three mon (''mitsu mon'') are mid-formality, and one mon (''hitotsu mon'') is the least formal, used for occasions such as tea ceremony. The type of mon adds formality as well, with a \"full sun\" (''hinata'') mon being the most formal, a \"mid-shadow\" (''nakakage'') mon being mid-formality, and a \"shadow\" (''kage'') mon being the least formal. Embroidered mon, called ''nui mon'', are also seen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mon and Kamon |url=https://wafuku.wordpress.com/2009/03/04/mon-kamon-%E2%80%93-japanese-emblem-crests-%E2%80%93-vintage-antique-japanese-kimonos/ |website=wafuku.co.uk |publisher=Wafuku.co.uk |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nFormality can also be determined by the type and colour of accessories, such as weave of ''obijime'' and the style of ''obiage''.\n\n===Women's kimono===\nThe typical woman's kimono outfit may consist of up to twelve or more separate pieces; some outfits, such as formal wedding kimono, may require the assistance of licensed kimono dressers, though usually this is due to the wearer's inexperience with kimono and the difficult-to-tie nature of formal ''obi musubi''. Most professional kimono dressers are found in Japan, where they work out of hair salons, as specialist businesses, or freelance.\n\nChoosing an appropriate type of kimono requires knowledge of the wearer's age, occasionally marital status (though less so in modern times), the formality of the occasion at hand, and the season. Choice of fabric is also dependent on these factors, though some fabrics - such as crepe and ''rinz\u016b'' - are never seen in certain varieties of kimono, and some fabrics such as ''shusu'' (satin) silk are barely ever seen in kimono altogether, instead being worn on the obi.\n\nThough length of kimono, collar style and the way the sleeves are sewn on varies for ''susohiki'' kimono, in all other types of women's kimono, the construction generally does not change; the collar is set back slightly into the nape of the neck, the sleeves are only attached at the shoulder, not all the way down the sleeve length, and the kimono's length from shoulder to hem should generally equal the entire height of the woman wearing it, to allow for the ''ohashori'' hip fold.\n\nSleeve length increases for ''furisode'' - young women's formal dress - but young women are not limited to wearing only ''furisode'', as outside of formal occasions that warrant it, can wear all other types of women's kimono such as ''irotomesode'' and ''komon''.\n\n====''Yukata''====\n''[[Yukata]]'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u6d74\u8863|\u6d74\u8863]]}}) are casual cotton summer kimono. ''Yukata'' were originally very simple indigo and white cotton kimono, little more than a bathrobe never worn outside the house. However, from roughly the mid-1980s onwards, they began to be produced in a wide variety of bright colours, large motifs and loud patterns, responding to a demand for a more casual modern kimono that could be worn to a summer festival.\n\nIn the present day, ''yukata'' are worn with ''hanhaba'' (half-width) or ''heko'' obi, and for women, often accessorised with colour hair accessories. ''Yukata'' are always unlined, and it is possible to dress up a high-end, more subdued ''yukata'' with a relatively casual ''nagoya'' obi - one with a simple dyed design in an informal fabric such as ''ro'' or ''tsumugi''.\n\n====''Furisode''====\n[[File:Kimono2.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A young woman stood up in a dark blue long-sleeved kimono with a white designs across the lap and the middle of the sleeves. The sash she wears is orange with a thin green belt in the centre |A young woman wearing a ''furisode'']]\n''[[Furisode]]'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u632f\u8896|\u632f\u8896]]}}) (lit., \"swinging sleeve\") kimono are the most formal kimono for a young, often unmarried, woman. They are decorated with colourful patterns across the entirety of the garment, and usually worn to ''[[seijin shiki]]'' (Coming of Age Day) or weddings, either by the bride herself or an unmarried younger female relative.\n\nThe sleeves of the furisode average at between 100\u2013110&nbsp;cm in length. ''Chu-furisode'' (mid-size ''furisode'') have shorter sleeves at roughly 80&nbsp;cm in length; most ''chu-furisode'' are vintage kimono, as in the modern day ''furisode'' are not worn often enough to warrant buying a more casual form of the dress.\n\n====''H\u014dmongi''====\n''H\u014dmongi'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u8a2a\u554f\u7740|\u8a2a\u554f\u7740]]}}) literally translates as ''visiting wear''. ''H\u014dmongi'' are distinguished in their motif placement - the motifs flow across the back right shoulder and back right sleeve, the front left shoulder and front left sleeve, and across the hem, higher at the left than the right. They are always made of silk, and are more formal than ''tsukesage''.\n\n''H\u014dmongi'' are first roughly sewn up, the design sketched onto the fabric, before it is taken apart to be dyed again. The ''h\u014dmongi'''s close relative, the ''tsukesage'', has its patterns dyed on the bolt before sewing up. This method of production can usually distinguish the two, as the motifs on a ''h\u014dmongi'' are likely to cross fluidly over seams in a way a ''tsukesage'' generally will not.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coline |first1=Youandi |title=Formality Series: Tsukesage |url=https://chayatsujikimono.wordpress.com/2019/08/02/formality-series-tsukesage/ |website=chayatsujikimono.wordpress.com |publisher=Chayatsuji Kimono |accessdate=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n''H\u014dmongi'' may be worn by both married and unmarried women; often friends of the bride will wear ''h\u014dmongi'' at weddings (except relatives) and receptions. They may also be worn to formal parties.\n\n====''Iromuji''====\n''Iromuji'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u8272\u7121\u5730|\u8272\u7121\u5730]]}}) (lit. \"solid colour\") are monochromatic, undecorated kimono mainly worn to tea ceremonies. The dyed silk may have a flat woven pattern - ''iromuji'' suitable for autumn are often made of ''rinzu'' silk. Some ''edo komon'' with incredibly fine patterns may be suitable for tea ceremony, as from a distance they are visually similar to ''iromuji''. ''Iromuji'' may occasionally have one ''kamon'', though likely no more than this, and are always made of silk. ''Shibori'' accessories such as ''obiage'' are never worn with ''iromuji'' if the purpose of wear is a tea ceremony; instead, flat and untextured silks are chosen for accessories.\n\n====''Edo komon''====\n''Edo komon'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u6c5f\u6238\u5c0f\u7d0b|\u6c5f\u6238\u5c0f\u7d0b]]}}) is a type of ''komon'' characterised by an extremely small repeating pattern, usually done in white on a coloured background. The ''edo komon'' dyeing technique originated within the [[samurai]] classes during the [[Edo period]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} ''Edo komon'' are of a similar formality to ''iromuji'', and ''edo komon'' with one ''kamon'' can be worn as low-formality visiting wear; because of this, they are always made of silk, unlike regular ''komon''.\n\n====''Mofuku''====\n{{main|Mourning#Japan}}\n''Mofuku '' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u55aa\u670d|\u55aa\u670d]]}}) describes general formal mourning dress, and both men and women wear ''mofuku''. ''Mofuku'' kimono are plain black silk with five ''kamon'', worn with white undergarments and white ''tabi''. Men wear a kimono of the same kind, with a subdued ''obi'' and a black-and-white or black-and-grey striped ''hakama'', worn with black or white z\u014dri.\n\nA completely black mourning ensemble for women - a plain black ''obi'', black ''obijime'' and black ''obiage'' - is usually reserved for those closest to the deceased. Those further away will wear kimono in dark and subdued colours, rather than a plain black kimono with a reduced number of crests. In time periods when kimono were worn more often, those closest to the deceased would slowly begin dressing in coloured kimono over a period of weeks after the death, with the ''obijime'' being the last thing to be changed over to colour.\n\n====''Kurotomesode''====\n''Kurotomesode'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u9ed2\u7559\u8896|\u9ed2\u7559\u8896]]}}) (black short-sleeve kimono) are formal kimono with a black background and a design along the hem only, worn to formal events such as weddings and wedding parties. The design is seen along the hem only; the further up the body this design reaches, the younger the wearer is considered to be, though for a very young woman an ''irotomesode'' may be chosen instead, ''kurotomesode'' being considered somewhat more mature. The design is either symmetrically placed on the ''fuki'' and ''okumi'' portions of the kimono, or asymmetrically placed along the entirety of the hem, with the design being larger and higher-placed at the left side than the right. Vintage kimono are more likely to have the former pattern placement than the latter, though is not a hard rule.\n\n''Kurotomesode'' are always made of silk, and may have a ''hiyoku'' - a false lining layer - attached, occasionally with a slightly padded hem. A ''kurotomesode'' usually has between 3 and 5 crests; a ''kurotomesode'' of any number of crests outranks an ''irotomesode'' with less than five. ''Kurotomesode'', though formalwear, are not allowed at the royal court, as black is the colour of mourning, despite the colour designs decorating the kimono itself; outside of the royal court, this distinction for ''kurotomesode'' does not exist. ''Kurotomesode'' are never made of flashy silks like ''rinz\u016b'', but are instead likely to be a matte fabric with little texture.\n\n====''Irotomesode''====\n''Irotomesode'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u8272\u7559\u8896|\u8272\u7559\u8896]]}}) (colour short-sleeve kimono) are slightly lower-ranking formal kimono with roughly the same pattern placement as ''kurotomesode'' on a coloured background. ''Irotomesode'', though worn to formal events, may be chosen when a ''kurotomesode'' would make the wearer appear to be overdressed for the situation. The pattern placement for ''irotomesode'' is roughly identical to ''kurotomesode'', though patterns seen along the ''fuki'' and ''okumi'' may drift slightly into the back hem itself. ''Irotomesode'' with five ''kamon'' are of the same formality as any ''kurotomesode''. ''Irotomesode'' may be made of figured silk such as ''rinz\u016b''.\n\n====''Tsukesage''====\n''Tsukesage'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u4ed8\u3051\u4e0b\u3052|\u4ed8\u3051\u4e0b\u3052]]}}) are lower-ranking formalwear, a step below ''h\u014dmongi'', wherein the motifs generally do not cross over the seams of each kimono panel, but have the same placement as a ''h\u014dmongi''. Similarities between the two often lead to confusion, and indeed, sometimes the two are so visually similar that the distinction is difficult to make. ''Tsukesage'' can have between one and three ''kamon'', and can be worn to parties, but not ceremonies or highly formal events.\n\n====''Uchikake''====\n[[File:Khalili Collection Kimono 01.jpg|thumb|An ''Uchikake'' (wedding) kimono depicting [[Red-crowned crane|cranes]], from the [[Khalili Collection of Kimono]]]]\n''Uchikake'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u6253\u3061\u639b\u3051|\u6253\u3061\u639b\u3051]]}}) are highly formal kimono worn only in bridalwear or on stage. The name ''uchikake'' comes from the verb ''uchikake-ru'', \"to drape upon\", originating in roughly the 16th century from a fashion of the ruling classes of the time to wear kimono (then called ''kosode'', \"small sleeve\") unbelted over the shoulders of one's other garments.{{R|Dalby Fashioning Culture|p=34}}\n\n''Uchikake'' are worn in the same manner in the present day, though unlike their 16th-century counterparts, could never be worn as an everyday kimono as well; they are heavily-decorated, highly-formal garments with thickly-padded hems, designed to trail along the floor as a sort of coat. Bridal ''uchikake'' are either red or white, and often decorated heavily with auspicious motifs. Because they are not designed to be worn with an ''obi'', the designs cover the entirety of the back.\n\n====''Shiromuku''====\n''Shiromuku'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u767d\u7121\u57a2|\u767d\u7121\u57a2]], lit. \"white pure-innocence\"}}) are the pure-white wedding kimono worn by the bride for a traditional [[Marriage in Japan|Japanese]] [[Shinto]] [[Wedding ceremony#Eastern culture|wedding ceremony]]. Comparable to a ''[[#uchikake|uchikake]]'' and sometimes described as just a white ''uchikake'', a ''shiromuku'' is worn for the part of the wedding ceremony, symbolising the purity of the bride coming into the marriage. The bride may later change into a red ''uchikake'' after the ceremony to symbolise good luck.\n\nA ''shiromuku'' will form part of a bridal ensemble with matching or coordinating accessories, such as a bridal [[Shimada (hairstyle)|''katsura'']], a set of matching [[kanzashi]] (usually mock-tortoiseshell), and a ''sensu'' fan tucked into the kimono. Due to the expensive nature of traditional bridal clothing, few are likely to buy brand-new ''shiromuku''; it is not unusual to rent kimono for special occasions, and Shinto shrines are known to keep and rent out ''shiromuku'' for traditional weddings. Those who do possess ''shiromuku'' already are likely to have inherited them from close family members.\n\n====''Susohiki / Hikizuri''====\n''Susohiki'' (lit. \"trailing skirt\") kimono are extremely long kimono worn by geisha, actors in kabuki and people performing [[Buy\u014d|traditional Japanese dance]]. A ''susohiki'' can be up to 230&nbsp;cm long, and are generally no shorter than 200&nbsp;cm from shoulder to hem; this is to allow the kimono to literally trail along the floor.\n\n''Susohiki'', apart from their extreme length, are also sewn slightly differently to normal kimono, due to the way they are worn.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Coline |first1=Youandi |title=Are kimono and hikizuri the same? |url=https://chayatsujikimono.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/are-kimono-and-hikizuri-the-same/ |website=Chayatsuji Kimono |accessdate=14 May 2019}}</ref> The collar on a ''susohiki'' is sewn further and deeper back into the nape of the neck, so that it can be pulled down much lower without causing the front of the kimono to ride up. The sleeves are set unevenly onto the body, shorter at the back than at the front, so that the underarm does not show when the collar is set this low.\n\n''Susohiki'' are also tied differently when they are put on - whereas regular kimono are tied with a visible ''ohashori'', and the side seams kept straight, ''susohiki'' are pulled up somewhat diagonally, to emphasise the hips and ensure the kimono trails nicely on the floor. A small ''ohashori'' is tied, larger at the back than the front, but it wrapped against the body with a red ''momi'' wrap, which is then covered by the ''obi'', rendering it not visible.{{refn|group=note|name=first|Video reference showing Atami geisha Kyouma being dressed in hikizuri \u2013 the second video shows the difference between ohashori length at the front and back, and how it is tied into the obi so as to be not visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BrPk7R-Apeh/ |title=[Video from Atami Geigi Kenban on Instagram] |date=11 December 2018 |access-date=14 May 2019 |language=Japanese}}</ref>}}\n\n====''J\u016bnihitoe''====\n[[File:Junihitoe.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A young woman with her hair down wearing several layered pink and green Heian-period kimono |A woman modelling a ''j\u016bnihitoe'']]\n{{main|J\u016bnihitoe}}\n''J\u016bnihitoe'' ({{lang|ja|[[Wiktionary:\u5341\u4e8c\u5358|\u5341\u4e8c\u5358]]}}) (lit. \"twelve layers\") describes the layered garments worn by [[Lady-in-waiting#Japan|court ladies]] during the [[Heian period]]. The ''j\u016bnihitoe'' consisted of up to twelve layered garments, with the innermost garment being the ''kosode'' - the small-sleeved kimono prototype which would eventually go on to become the outermost garment worn.\n\nThe total weight of the ''j\u016bnihitoe'' could be up to 20&nbsp;kg. The garments were decorated in relatively large motifs, with a more important aspect being the numerous recorded colour combinations an outfit could have.\n\nAn important accessory of this outfit was an elaborate [[Hand fan#Japanese hand fan|hand fan]], which could be tied together by tassels tied onto the end fan bones. These fans were made of cypress wood entirely, with the design painted onto the wide, flat bones themselves, and were known as ''hi\u014dugi''.\n\nNo garments from the Heian period survive, and today the ''j\u016bnihitoe'' can only be seen as a reproduction in museums, movies, festivals and demonstrations. The [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Household]] still officially uses them at some important functions, such as the coronation of the new Empress.\n\n===Men's kimono===\n[[Image:Shinto married couple.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Couple being married in traditional dress]]\n\nIn contrast to women's kimono, men's kimono outfits are far simpler, typically consisting of five pieces, not including footwear.\n\nMen's kimono sleeves are attached to the body of the kimono with no more than a few inches unattached at the bottom, unlike the women's style of very deep sleeves mostly unattached from the body of the kimono. Men's sleeves are less deep than women's kimono sleeves to accommodate the obi around the waist beneath them, whereas on a woman's kimono, the long, unattached bottom of the sleeve can hang over the obi without getting in the way.\n[[Image:Armored Samurai with Jin-Haori.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jinbaori \u2013 Kimono tabards for armoured Samurai]]\nIn the modern era, the principal distinctions between men's kimono are in the fabric. The typical men's kimono is a subdued, dark color; black, dark blues, greens, and browns are common. Fabrics are usually matte. Some have a subtle pattern, and textured fabrics are common in more casual kimono. More casual kimono may be made in slightly brighter colors, such as lighter purples, greens and blues. Sumo wrestlers have occasionally been known to wear quite bright colors such as fuchsia.\n\nThe most formal style of kimono is plain black silk with five ''kamon'' on the chest, shoulders and back. Slightly less formal is the three-''kamon'' kimono.\n\n==Accessories and related garments==\n{{Very long|section|small=left|date=October 2019}}\nThough the kimono is the national dress of Japan, it has never been the sole item of clothing worn throughout Japan; even before the Meiji Period and the introduction of Western dress to Japan, many variations of or cousins to the kimono existed as a separate style of dress, often as rural or (in the case of the [[Ainu people]]) cultural dress. \n\nSome variations on the kimono were the contemporary clothing of previous decades and centuries, and have survived on in an official or ceremonial capacity, worn only by certain people for certain occasions. There are also a number of accessories that can be worn with the kimono, and these vary by occasion and use.\n\n===Related garments===\n====Religious garments====\nSome related garments are specific to certain religious roles. The {{nihongo|''[[chihaya (clothing)|chihaya]]''|\u3061\u306f\u3084/\u8945}} is worn only by ''[[Kannushi]]'' and ''[[Miko]]'' in some [[Shinto shrine]] ceremonies, and the {{nihongo|''[[samue]]''|\u4f5c\u52d9\u8863}} is the everyday clothing for a male [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] lay-monk, and the favoured garment for ''[[Komus\u014d]]'' monks playing the ''[[shakuhachi]]''.\n\n====Ceremonial and professional garments====\n{{nihongo|''[[Jittoku]]''|\u5341\u5fb3}} are a style of haori worn only by some high-ranking male practitioners of tea ceremony. ''Jittoku'' are made of unlined silk gauze, fall to the hip, and have sewn ''himo'' ties at the front made of the same fabric as the main garment. The ''jittoku'' has a wrist opening that is entirely open along the sleeve's vertical length. The garment originated in the Kamakura Period (1185-1333 CE), and are worn without hakama.\n\nBoth [[Geisha#Appearance|geisha]] and [[Maiko#Appearance|maiko]] wear various types of kimono, and variations on common accessories, that are not found in everyday dress. As an extension of this, many practitioners of [[Japanese traditional dance]] wear similar kimono and accessories to geisha and maiko.\n\nFor certain traditional holidays and occasions, kimono are more likely to be worn, and on some occasions specific types of kimono, and accessories, are worn. For instance, ''[[okobo]]'', also known as ''pokkuri'', are worn by girls for ''[[shichi-go-san]]'', alongside brightly-coloured ''furisode''. ''Okobo'' are also worn by young women on ''[[seijin no hi]]''.\n\nFor formal ceremonies, members of Japanese nobility will wear certain types of antiquated kimono such as the {{nihongo|''[[suikan]]''|\u6c34\u5e72}} and the {{nihongo|''[[Kimono#J\u016bnihitoe|j\u016bnihitoe]]''|\u5341\u4e8c\u5358}}. Outside of nobility, ''j\u016bnihitoe'' are only found in dress-up (''henshin'') studios, or in museums as recreations; no examples of [[Heian period]] clothing exist, and only small and fragile samples of the fabrics used in those times survive.\n\n====Bridalwear====\nBrides in Japan who opt for a traditional ceremony will wear specific accessories and types of kimono, which may be changed and switched out for certain parts of the ceremony; for instance, the ''wata b\u014dshi'' hood is removed during the ceremony, and ''uchikake'' are worn over the top of ''shiromuku'' bridal kimono once the ceremony has been completed, usually at the reception. Many bridalwear traditions, such as the addition of a small (fake) dagger, are amalgams and facsimiles of samurai dress from previous eras. \n\n[[File:Bride at meiji shrine.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese bride in her tsunokakushi|125 px]]\n;{{nihongo|''[[Tsunokakushi]]''|[[Wiktionary:\u89d2\u96a0\u3057#Japanese|\u89d2\u96a0\u3057]], lit. \"horn-hiding\"}}: ''Tsunokakashi'' is a style of headwear worn by brides in traditional Shinto wedding ceremonies. ''Tsunokashi'' may be made of white silk and worn with the bride's white ''shiromuku'' wedding kimono, or they may be made of colored materials to match or coordinate when the bride opts for a non-''shiromuku'' style. ''Tsunokakashi'', unlike ''wata b\u014dshi'', do not cover the high topknot formed by the bride's ''takashimada''-style wig.\n\n:According to folk etymology, the headwear is worn to hide the bride's horns of jealousy and selfishness; however, this headdress was originally a simpler cap worn to keep the dirt and dust off a woman's hairstyle when travelling.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kimino |first1=Rinko |last2=Somegoro |first2=Ichikawa |title=Photographic Kabuki Kaleidoscope |date=2016 |publisher=Shogakukan |location=Tokyo |isbn=978-4-09-310843-0 |page=34 |edition=1st}}</ref> The custom spread from married women in samurai families in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods to younger women of lower classes during the Edo period.\n\n;{{nihongo|''Wata b\u014dshi''|[[Wiktionary:\u7dbf\u5e3d\u5b50#Japanese|\u7dbf\u5e3d\u5b50]], lit \"cotton hat\"}}: ''Wata b\u014dshi'' is a style of full-coverage hood also worn by the bride in traditional Shinto weddings.

The layered kimono underneath were known as ''d\u014dnuki'', and were often a patchwork of older or unwearable kimono taken apart for their fabric.\n\nIn modern-day Japan, layered kimono are only seen on the stage, whether for classical dances or in kabuki. A false second layer called a {{nihongo|''hiyoku''|\"second wing\"|\u6bd4\u7ffc}} may be attached instead of an entirely separate kimono to achieve this look; it is a type of floating lining, sewn to the kimono only along the centre back and underneath the collar.\n\nThis effect allows it to show at the collar and the hem, and in some kabuki performances such as ''[[Fuji Musume]]'', the kimono will be worn with the ''okumi'' flipped back slightly underneath the obi to expose the design on the ''hiyoku''. The ''hiyoku'' can also be seen on some bridal kimono.\n\n==Care==\n[[Image:Kimonofold.jpg|thumb|right|200px|How to fold a kimono]]\nIn the past, a kimono would often be entirely taken apart for washing, and then re-sewn for wearing.<ref name=\"Dalby Geisha\"/> This traditional washing method is called ''arai hari''. Because the stitches must be taken out for washing, traditional kimono need to be hand sewn. ''Arai hari'' is very expensive and difficult and is one of the causes of the declining popularity of kimono. Modern fabrics and cleaning methods have been developed that eliminate this need, although the traditional washing of kimono is still practiced, especially for high-end garments.\n\nNew, custom-made kimono are generally delivered to a customer with long, loose [[Tack (sewing)|basting]] stitches placed around the outside edges. These stitches are called ''shitsuke ito''. They are sometimes replaced for storage. They help to prevent bunching, folding and wrinkling, and keep the kimono's layers in alignment.\n\nLike many other traditional Japanese garments, there are specific ways to fold kimono. These methods help to preserve the garment and to keep it from creasing when stored. Kimono are often stored wrapped in paper called ''tat\u014dshi''.\n\nKimono need to be aired out at least seasonally and before and after each time they are worn. Many people prefer to have their kimono [[dry cleaning|dry cleaned]]. Although this can be extremely expensive, it is generally less expensive than ''arai hari'' but may be impossible for certain fabrics or dyes.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|kimono.ogg|2009-02-19}}\n{{Commons category|Kimono|lcfirst=yes}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Kimono buying guide}}\n* [http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/cultur/kimonos/kimoneng.shtml]&nbsp;- The Canadian Museum of Civilization - Archive of the exhibition \"The Landscape Kimonos of Itchiku Kubota\"\n* [http://www.iz2.or.jp/english/]&nbsp;- The Kyoto Costume Museum - Costume History in Japan\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120324224115/http://immortalgeisha.com/ig_bb/]&nbsp;- Archived link to the Immortal Geisha Forums; comprehensive resource on kimono knowledge and culture\n* [http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/k/kimono/]&nbsp;- Articles on kimono from the V&A Collection\n\n{{Japanese clothing}}\n{{Folk costume}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Portal bar|Japan|Fashion}}\n\n[[Category:Dresses]]\n[[Category:Japanese clothing]]\n[[Category:Robes and cloaks]]\n[[Category:Folk costumes]]\n[[Category:History of Asian clothing]]\n", "name_user": "86.147.143.128", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimono"}
