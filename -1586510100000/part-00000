look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |APOE gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in AD.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/>   [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.<ref name=LBDACareMeds>{{cite web |url=

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.<ref name=Boot2013/><ref name=LBDAEarlyCare>{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |APOE gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in AD.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/>   [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most common form of neurodegnerative dementia after AD as of 2020.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Walker2015/> DLB itself is one of the three most common types of dementia,

Therapies under study as of 2019 aim to reduce brain levels of alpha-synuclein (pharmaceuticals [[ambroxol]], [[NPT200-11]], and [[E2027]]) or to use immunotherapy to reduce widespread neuroinflammation resulting from alpha-synuclein deposits.<ref name= Hershey2019/><ref name=Velayudhan2017/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | veditors = [[Kenji Kosaka (psychiatrist)|Kosaka K]] | title = Dementia with Lewy bodies: clinical and biological aspects | edition= 1st | year = 2017  | publisher = Springer | location = Japan  | doi = 10.1007/978-4-431-55948-1 | isbn = 978-4-431-55948-1 }}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=32em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite journal | vauthors= Adams BD |title= Lewy Body Dementia in the Emergency Department |date= January 16, 2013 |journal= Postgraduate Medical Journal | url= http://pmj.bmj.com/content/lewy-body-dementia-emergency-department |accessdate= April 18, 2018 }}\n* {{cite video |url= https://www.alzforum.org/webinars/updated-diagnostic-criteria-and-management-lewy-body-dementia |title= Updated diagnostic criteria and management of Lewy body dementia |publisher= ALZForum co-hosted with [[Lewy Body Dementia Association]] |author= McKeith I|date= October 10, 2017 |accessdate= April 8, 2018 |type=Video}}\n*{{cite web | url= https://www.lbda.org/sites/default/files/emergency_room_treatment_of_psychosis.pdf |title= Emergency room treatment of psychosis | publisher =Lewy Body Dementia Association | accessdate= 27 April 2018}}\n\n{{Medical resources\n | DiseasesDB     = 3800\n | ICD10          = {{ICD10|G|31|8|g|30}}\n | ICD9           = {{ICD9|331.82}}\n | ICDO           =\n | OMIM           = 127750\n | MedlinePlus    =\n | eMedicineSubj  = neuro\n | eMedicineTopic = 91\n | MeshID         = D020961\n}}\n\n{{CNS diseases of the nervous system|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dementia with Lewy bodies}}\n[[Category:Aging-associated diseases]]\n[[Category:Ailments of unknown cause]]\n[[Category:Corticobasal syndrome]]\n[[Category:Geriatrics]]\n[[Category:Lewy body dementia]]\n[[Category:Psychiatric diagnosis]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:RTTNEURO]]\n", "name_user": "SandyGeorgia", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eClinical history and testing:comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia_with_Lewy_bodies"}

The guitar was originally owned by Dykes' uncle Doyle \"Smitty\" Smith, a professional guitarist in Washington, D.C., and came into Dykes' possession on his uncle's death; in 1988 Dykes gifted the instrument to country artist [[Roy Clark]], and on the latter's death in 2018, his widow returned the instrument to Dykes.

According to the article, at one point in the 1950s this instrument had to be returned to the Martin factory for a replacement top, and was fitted with a \"plain\", D-28 style top lacking the distinctive D-45 abalone trim. The guitar was originally owned by Dykes' uncle Doyle \"Smitty\" Smith, a professional guitarist in Washington, D.C., and came into Dykes' possession on his uncle's death; in 1988 Dykes gifted the instrument to country artist [[Roy Clark]], and on the latter's death in 2018, his widow returned the instrument to Dykes. A photograph of this instrument in the hands of its original owner, before its top replacement, is included in the magazine article, and shows it to have originally been fitted with an unusual, large and asymmetrical double pickguard.<ref name=\"vintageguitar_May_2020\" />\n\nA 1941 D-45 (serial number not stated, no other information given) is illustrated here.<ref name=\"offsetguitars\">{{cite web|url=http://www.offsetguitars.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=21077|title=OffsetGuitars.com &bull; View topic - Zhivago's Vintage Hotties - 1941 Martin D-45|publisher=offsetguitars.com|accessdate=2015-09-06}}</ref>\n\nA 1941 D-45 (serial number not stated), refinished with \"multiple professionally repaired top cracks\" and other issues was being offered for sale by Gruhn Guitars in 2007, inventory no.

In some counties the winner of the event became the National Champion even if the winning team came from a different country, like the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] or the [[United States]]. In other countries like [[Germany]], [[Austria]] or [[Italy]] the Champion is the first team from the organizing country even if they do not win the event. Since the Soling has always been an \"open\" class in that spirit we list in this overview the winners of the event. The first boat of the organizing country can be found in the references.\n\nThe [[Soling Australian Championship|Australian Soling Championship]] is recognized as an Continental Championship like the [[Soling European Championship|Europeans]] and the [[Soling North American Championship|North]] and [[Soling South American Championship| South Americans]]. Therefor the Championships of [[New South Wales]] and [[Western Australia]] are listed.
