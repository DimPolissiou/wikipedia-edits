It is also known as Newcastle Government House and Domain, Newcastle Military Barracks & Hospital, Girls' Industrial School, Reformatory for Girls, Lunatic Asylum for Imbeciles, James Fletcher Hospital and Fletcher Park. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 22 March 2011.<ref name=nswshr-1841>{{cite NSW SHR|5060998|Newcastle Government House and Domain|hr=01841|accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Newcastle Government House and Domain has significant associations with [[Convicts in Australia|convictism in Australia]] as a site central to the management of [[convict labour]], early coal mining technology and the development and growth of the Australian economy. \n\n=== Penal settlement ===\nThe earliest European use of the site was the Commandant's Residence (also known as Government House) where the Commandant, Lieutenant [[Charles Menzies (Royal Marines officer)|Charles Menzies]] controlled the penal settlement. The site has remained in [[Government of New South Wales|Government]] management since European occupation from 1804 to the present day. A sketch by [[Ferdinand Bauer]] (1804) shows the flagstaff and the only small house on the area. The same location is also shown in artworks by [[Joseph Lycett]], Walter Preston and Edward Close and these are particularly significant because they show Newcastle's Government House and gardens. Bauer's sketch also shows tents on the hillside of the site. The site is also figures significantly on the Macquarie Chest being depicted on one of its panels.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Convicts ===\nThe first attempt at settlement in Newcastle failed in 1802<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-1\">Turner 1973</ref>and the settlement, also known as \"Kings Town\" and \"Coal River\" was re-established in 1804, providing hard labour for re-offending convicts following the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion|Irish rebellion at Vinegar Hill]]. The second settlement (1804) was prompted because of the prospect of coal as a vital resource for the Colony.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-2\">O'Donnell 1969</ref> After Newcastle was established as a penal settlement, it remained under Colonial administration until 1823. After this time free settlers were introduced into the settlement. Convicts sent to Newcastle endured harsh living standards, intense manual labour in the coal mines and were under constant surveillance.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-1\" /><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nAfter 1823, most of the convicts were transferred to [[Port Macquarie]], however many prisoners remained in Newcastle until 1855 to carry out public works projects such as the construction of [[Macquarie Pier]] and other works. Convict labour was used to build the pier, beginning in 1818 and this work was not completed until 1846. The military were stationed at the military barracks site to manage and supervise the work of the convicts. Furthermore, the association between the former military barracks buildings and the port initiative (the pier) is of significance to capital works programs of the Colonial Government, convictism and early technology in Australia. The employment of convicts to construct Macquarie Pier was in the economic interest of the Colony and this site was significant in supporting this progress. Having started in 1814 with a small population of  approximately 100 convicts and guards, but it would become the major penal settlement of the Australian colonies, accommodating up to one thousand convicts.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-3>Rosen. Review of Items of Potential State Significance in the Newcastle City Area, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Convict labour and coal ===\nNewcastle is the birthplace of [[Coal Mining in Australia|Australia's coal mining industry]] and the first modern coal mining undertaken in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-4\">Hunter 2001</ref> Coal mining in Newcastle provided the first profit ever made in the fledgling [[Colony of New South Wales]] of - 2 pounds, 5 shillings - in 1801.  Convict labour was used to work mines located at Colliers Point (these were horizontal drifts) and on the hillside near Government House, the first working vertical shaft sunk for the production of coal in Australia (on the current [[James Fletcher (Australian politician)|James Fletcher]] Hospital site). One of the coal shafts is named the Wallis shaft, after the Commandant of Newcastle at the time. The site is also associated with Benjamin Grainger who was sent to Newcastle in 1812 to assist in coal mining in the area, later becoming Superintendent of the coal mines, in 1820. The military was present in the settlement to manage the convict population and to supervise work in the mines and the construction of the Macquarie Pier.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nMining on the site was primitive and labour-intensive with loads of coal initially brought to the surface in baskets. A small rail system for haulage was used to take coal to the port directly downhill from the mine site to be loaded onto ships for export. Much of the export went around the world, and was often traded for rum. The transport of coal to the port forged a thoroughfare which then became the main street of the township, George Street (now known as Watt Street). The Commandant had his residence in a prominent place at the top of this street where he was able to view what was happening in the settlement, including work at Collier's Point and Nobbys Island.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\nThe Commandant's residence was both a place of authority and a convict work place. Convicts worked on the site until the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] took over mining in Newcastle. There is evidence of intensive early mining practises on the cliff opposite the site's entrance. The two convict coal mines on the James Fletcher Hospital site were later referred to as the \"Asylum Shafts\". The Wallis shaft is thought to have been excavated between 1814 and 1817.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-5>Eklund 2004</ref> Twenty seven men were described as employed in the working of the mine and the mouth of the shaft immediately adjoined the offices of the Commandant's House.<ref>Bigge, 1822 p.114-118</ref> After these mines became disused there was very little reference made to them during the 1800s. It was not until the 1900s that a mine subsidence report provided more detail about the existence of the convict mines,.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-6>Report of the Royal Commission on Earth subsidence at Newcastle 1908</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\nIn the 1940s Jonathon Dixon carried out research on the site and attempted to locate the position of the first convict coal shaft by surveying an early map.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-7>Draft of the town of Newcastle 1822</ref> Dr B W Champion (1949) also supports Dixon's location of the convict coal mine, adding that it was sunk approximately 20 yards inside the Mental Hospital gates.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-8>Newcastle & Hunter District Historical Society, 1949</ref> Further subsidence within the hospital grounds in 1943 revealed a convict mine shaft. This shaft is thought to be the Wallis Shaft  and was described as being \"inside the gates of the hospital\".<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-9>Newcastle Morning Herald & Miners Advocate July 21, 1943</ref> Dixon argues that the subsidence revealed both the position of the old convict mine shaft and the position of the Commandant's House or Government House.<ref>Dixon, 1949, p.35</ref> Evidence of the shaft was later covered up and is not obvious today, although it is reported to be under the roadway of the main road leading into the hospital. The position of the former Wallis Shaft inside the asylum entrance is shown on a plan by the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]] [[James Barnet]] in 1880.<ref>\"Plan of Hospital for the Insane\" labelled 'pit'</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Governor Lachlan Macquarie ===\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] on his tour to the northern settlements in 1821 stated in his journal that he stayed at Government House in Newcastle, finding it very comfortable.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-10\">Macquarie's Journal, 1973,   217</ref> Macquarie made several visits to the Newcastle and in 1812 he stated \"...immediately on my landing respecting the inspection of the settlement, I went with Mrs. M. & c. to view the coal mines...\".<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-11\">Macquarie's Journal, 1973,   217 ?? ibid. p.86</ref> The future of the coal mining industry was important to Governor Macquarie as is shown in his laying of the foundation stone to build the Macquarie Pier in 1818. This was a major colonial public works project, undertaken to join the mainland with [[Nobbys Head|Nobbys Island]] and establish a safe port entrance to facilitate the coal export trade. Newcastle's commercial coal mines were integral to Governor Macquarie's plan to promote the Colony as self-supporting.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interactions ===\nDuring Governor Macquarie's visit to Newcastle in 1818 he recorded that he was entertained by Jack Burigon, King of the Newcastle tribe along with about forty men, women and children who performed a \"Carauberie\" ([[corroboree]]) in the area at the rear of the Newcastle Government House. There are numerous colonial artworks showing Aboriginal occupation in and around the Government House site and as well as Corroborees.<ref>See works by Edwards Close and Joseph Lycett</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Parsonage ===\nThe Newcastle Government House and Domain contains the original site of the [[Church of England]] [[parsonage]] erected in 1819 and home to Reverend George Augustus Middleton, Newcastle's first chaplain.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-12\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004</ref> Governor Macquarie noted that the parsonage was a \"neat brick-built, stuccoed, one-storied parsonage house with a verandah and all necessary out-offices, and also a kitchen garden and grazing paddock attached thereto, both enclosed with a paling\".<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-13\">Turner, History of the James Fletcher Hopsital.p.1</ref> Part of the original parsonage remains and this adds to the significance of the site.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nIn the 1830s part of the land granted to the Church of England as a [[glebe]] was returned to the Government for building a new military barracks.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-14>Hunter 2001, 34-38</ref> Reception House and Kirkwood House have recently been demolished in June 2008 to make way for the construction of a new 20-bed mental Health facility. Reception House was a direct and tangible link to the convict-built parsonage and nearby [[Christ Church Cathedral, Newcastle|Christ Church Cathedral]] buildings and a significant purpose-designed mental health facility which marked an innovation in mental health care. Kirkwood House was designed by the prominent local architect James Henderson. It was a two-storey annexe to the parsonage. Architect Frederick Menkens supervised a later skillion addition. Government Architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]] kept some of the original fabric of the old parsonage in the structure of the new additions to Kirkwood House.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Military barracks & convict labour ===\nFrom the 1830s there was an increase of military protection of Newcastle in order to protect its coal resources and hence the colony's economy. <ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-3\" /> The [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] visited Newcastle to lay foundation stone for the new barracks on the hill near the parsonage house in 1836.<ref>[[Sydney Gazette]], 1836</ref> Lieutenant Colonel [[George Barney]], recently arrived from England was appointed Colonial Engineer in 1836. One of Barney's first tasks was to report on steps that needed to be taken in order to protect the colony from attacks by foreign vessels and he recommended that batteries and blockhouses be constructed in [[Sydney]], Newcastle, [[Wollongong]], Port Macquarie and [[Port Phillip]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Barney, George (1792\u20131862)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/barney-george-1744|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> The first projects undertaken by Barney were for the construction of new barracks at [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] in Sydney ([[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks]]) and Newcastle.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-3\" /><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe Newcastle Military Barracks were completed earlier than the Victoria Barracks. A convict chain gang in Newcastle was employed to build the foundations for the officers quarters and soldiers barracks in 1838, as well as to create the military parade ground.<ref>[[Hunter River Gazette]], 15 January 1842</ref> Excavation of the hillside by convict iron gang took place in 1842 so that outbuildings could be constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-16>Hunter River Gazette- 15 January 1842</ref> [[George Gipps|Governor Gipps]] proposed reducing troop numbers at the barracks as convict transportation to the colony was coming to an end.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-17>Department of Commerce, 2004, p. 16</ref> Further reducing the need for a strong military presence in Newcastle was the relocation of the remaining prisoners in 1848. Only 1000 troops were to remain in New South Wales to protect the colony. In June 1848 and the 99th regiment left Newcastle.<ref>[[Maitland Mercury]], 24 June 1848</ref> However later in 1848 some convicts returned to Newcastle to build public works accompanied by a military guard which was accommodated in the new barracks.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-18>Department of Commerce, 2004, p. 16 ?? ibid, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Lunatic Asylum ===\nThe barracks remained in use for civil service accommodation until 1867 when it became the Girls' Industrial School and later the Reformatory for Girls. On 13 September 1817,  the New South Wales government established its first  \"Lunatic Asylum for Imbeciles and Idiots\" at this site.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-19\">NSW Department of Health, p.39</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-20\">NSW Department of Health, p.39 ?? ibid, 2008</ref> \n\nNewcastle was the fourth main government-run asylum to be opened in New South Wales, the others located at [[Tarban Creek]], [[Parramatta]], the first being at [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], which later become a gaol.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-22>Stephen Garton, Medicine and Madness, p. 38</ref>  A common theme throughout the life of the asylum was community dissatisfaction with having such an institution located in the centre of the city. When an asylum was first suggested, the residents of Newcastle were so opposed to the plan that they held a public meeting which consisted of 400 Newcastle residents at the [[Newcastle Court House]].<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-25\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p. 1</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" /> On 4 December 1866 the Colonial Secretary's Office notified the Bench of Magistrates in Newcastle that the proposed plan would not go ahead.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-26\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.19 20</ref> When it was suggested for a second time, a Newcastle newspaper, the Chronicle stated that it was dangerous to have insane people living in such close proximity to residents. It claimed that the use of the former barracks for this purpose was wasting valuable real estate.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-27\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.22 23</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n[[Frederick Norton Manning|Frederick Manning]] was the Inspector General of the Insane and oversaw all lunatic asylums in New South Wales; he is credited with implementing many improvements to the site and with the introduction of [[moral therapy]], believing that young imbeciles and idiots should be kept apart from the older insane people.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-21\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.24</ref> Manning's decision to separate the imbelices and idiots required extra space, at a time when overall patient numbers were increasing, due in part to the effects of the [[Australian banking crisis of 1893|1890s depression]]. Manning had intended to have the younger patients housed on a separate site, but the government's funding was limited during the depressin so additional wards were constructed. The first of these additional wards was constructed  in 1892 and accommodated 24 girls at the northern end of the asylum grounds, behind the court house.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-23\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.30</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-24\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.30 ?? ibid, 2008</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nIn 1916, the facility was renamed the Newcastle Mental Hospital. A visit from the Deputy Inspector General of Mental Hospitals in 1918 found the newer wards of a high standard but determined that the older buildings were in poor condition. Such problems were addressed during the mid to late 1920s, and included improvements in bathroom facilities, the removal of single rooms in the women's section to create a spacious dining and day room and the creation of a larger space in the men's division by removing two of the single rooms.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nIn 1962, the hospital was renamed Newcastle Psychiatric Centre. In 1965, the Shortland Clinic was built to serve outpatients, a model copied at other hospitals such as  [[Royal North Shore Hospital]]. In 1983 the name of the hospital changed to Hunter Hospital and in 1989 the name was again changed to be named the James Fletcher Hospital after [[James Fletcher (Australian politician)|James Fletcher]], an important figure in Newcastle during the late 19th Century. Fletcher was responsible for improving the conditions of miners. An example of this was his establishment of the Australian Agricultural Company's sick and accident fund.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gollan|first=Robin|title=Fletcher, James (1834\u20131891)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/fletcher-james-3538|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-28\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.22 23 ?? ibid, 2008</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Fletcher Park ===\nFletcher Park was formally known as Lower Reserve and Ordinance Park. Its use as a public park was promoted in 1878 after Frederick Cane the Superintendant of the Asylum for Imbeciles had undertaken to make the park more attractive by planting ornamental shrubs and trees.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-29\">Newcastle & Miners' Advocate, 15 Jan 1878</ref> The park was originally the site of Government House and its flagstaff and is identifiable in many colonial artworks. There were numerous outbuildings to Government House and an artwork completed in1820 (artist unknown) shows these as well as a path to the left of the building leading uphill. There are numerous other works showing the early area.<ref>http://www.newcastle.edu.au/service/archives/coalriver/pdf/hardy2006.pdf</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n== Description ==\nNewcastle Government House & Domain cultural landscape includes the area currently occupied by the James Fletcher Hospital located east of the Newcastle central business district and is bounded by Ordinance Street to the south, Newcomen Street to the west and Church Street to the north. The east boundary of the hospital is Watt street and also includes Fletcher Park situated opposite the hospital entrance and the convict coal mines from 1814-17.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Historic Convict Coal Mines & Adit (1814) ===\nTwo convict coal mines exist on the current hospital grounds, one is approximately 20-25 metres inside the main Watt Street entrance, named Asylum Coal Shaft No. 1. This shaft has been filled and sealed. Asylum Coal Shaft No.2 is in the [[courtyard]] behind the former military hospital, south west corner of the site; it is capped but not filled.<ref>Archeological Management Plan</ref> Both of these shafts are connected to horizontal workings at the coal seam below and to drainage [[adit]]s running to the nearby seaside cliffs. They are well hidden and have been covered over, but not built on. One adit is visible in the cliff at Newcastle South beach (hand-hewn); it is a horizontal shaft and has been cut into the rock face of the cliff, in an [[ovoid]] shape. The adit is located about 5 metres above the ground and approximately 1.5m tall x 0.5 m wide at the top and 0.75 m wide at the bottom. The cliff where the adit is located is cracked, and fenced off. It is unknown where the adit leads; however it does go west towards the nominated site and possibly is linked with the known vertical shafts (asylum shafts). The adit drains water from the mine by gravity, it would appear from the outside that the adit has minimal obstructions and often has water draining from it.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe site has archaeological potential for finding information relating to colonial mining techniques..<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== The parsonage (1819) ===\nThe front of the original building was demolished in the mid 1800s for the realignment of Church Street; however a significant portion of the parsonage was retained when additions were made to Reception House by Architect Walter Vernon. The parsonage (recently Kirkwood House/Reception House) was demolished in 2008 and an archeological excavation took place in March 2009. Remains of the old parsonage (1819) were found, including sections of wall, a cellar and other relics as evidence of the convict period. The size of the remains ([[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]]) is approximately 12x10 metres. The convict brickwork (floor/foundations) was in excellent condition (for its age), and represents building methods and techniques used in the convict era.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Compound Wall (1842) ===\nThe hospital is a walled site within an excavated quarry. The wall has enclosed the buildings on the site since the military buildings were first constructed in 1842. With exception of the northern boundary, the south, east and west sides all have walls. Originally built as a [[retaining wall]] for the excavated site, then it was later retained for privacy for patients of the mental institution.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe integrity of the compound wall is better in some sections than others. Sections of the compound wall were damaged in the June 2007 floods. The foundation of the inside wall appears to be built from [[sandstone]]. The wall runs from north to south and is relatively intact. However much of the upper sections of the wall built from brick have collapsed and are in need of repair.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe walls were constructed from brickwork dated at different periods, and the significant sections of the stone wall in the lower sections of the compound wall may relate to the 1830s when the site was quarried using convict labour. There is high archaeological potential, given that the site was \"prepared\" for construction of the barracks using convict labour.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Landscape ===\nThe landscape of the current hospital grounds shows an exposed quarried landform on the south side, approximately 20 metres high. The exposed rock has eroded somewhat due to environmental conditions; however this landscape remains a noticeable and strong feature of the site, the quarried section that formed a wall runs the full length of the southern boundary. A large expanse of the grounds was levelled to build the military barracks and parade ground. The topography was originally a gentle slope from the ocean cliffs towards what is known today as \"The Hill\". The area is relatively underdeveloped compared with the surrounding area of the city of Newcastle.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nAs there has been minimal disturbance, there is high potential that archaeological relics may be found.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Former Military Parade Ground ===\nThe parade ground remains an open parkland and grassy area that has not been hindered or interrupted with significant development (except in the case of the Shortland Clinic, which although is not built directly on the oval, does detract visually from the openness of the former military establishment). Significant vistas remain across all areas of the site because the recreation ground is in the centre of the collection of buildings.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Fletcher Park ===\nThis park is situated directly across the road (Watt Street) from the current James Fletcher Hospital, on the east side of the precinct. The park is bounded by a fence on the seaside and there is a steep cliff drop off. In 2005 it was landscaped by [[Newcastle City Council]] and has a path running through the middle of the park. There is also a statue of MJames Fletcher that stands predominantly on the uphill slope, facing down to the city.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe park is reasonably well-maintained by Newcastle City Council; much of the open space has remained undisturbed, with the exception of the garden beds on the west side (Watt Street), which were replaced in 2005. This work may have disturbed archaeological remains of the former Newcastle Government House (also known as Commandant's Residence) that existed on the site. Archaeological potential is high in this area.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Further information ===\n\nThe Thwaites building, Tara Lodge and the former Shortland Clinic building do not contribute to the heritage of the site. However Gate House ({{circa|1842}}) is a significant heritage building related to the military phase of the hospital and contributes greatly to other building on the site, but is not part of the heritage listing. However the former military barracks, military hospital and James Fletcher statue are included in the heritage listing.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 21 September 2010, the Newcastle Government House and Domain site forms a complex, multi-layered cultural landscape, physically transformed by convict labour and providing evidence of the early colonial settlement of Newcastle as well as of the subsequent technical, economic and social development of the city and the state. The site has been identified as being of National significance to Australia and New South Wales.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-33\">NSW Department of Commerce, CMP, 2004, 7.13</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nNewcastle Government House was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 22 March 2011 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt meets this criterion of State significance because it demonstrates patterns of economic and social development of the early colonial period from government-controlled and convict-worked industry, to the arrival of free labour and the beginnings of private enterprise. The place expresses tangibly the way its landscape has changed over time to meet changed uses (military and welfare). It represents a convict penal settlement directly related to the beginning of Australian industry. The place is an exceptional example of the forced migration of convicts (Vinegar Hill rebels) and the development associated with punishment and reform, particularly convict labour and the associated coal mines. The place exemplifies convict labour (quarrying out of landscape, laying of foundations & filling of military parade ground). The place was a site of early contact between Aboriginal and European people during the Macquarie period. It exemplifies Australia's early position at the forefront of applied coal mining technology in the early 1800s. The place is culturally significant because of its representation in historical records and visual sources from the early 1800s, showing the changes in the landscape. Its former military buildings are closely associated with the military history of the Colony during the 1830s and 1840s. It demonstrates an important aspect of law and order through its history as a military barracks and as the source of supervision required for the prisoners who remained in Newcastle to complete the Macquarie Pier. This association with Newcastle's defence history is indirectly related to aiding the growing economy and coal export of the Colony. Convicts were an important part of this accomplishment (1830-40). The James Fletcher Hospital site is unique as a coastal urban Lunatic Asylum (1871- present) and is representative of Australian Colonial asylum culture.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe site exemplifies Governor Macquarie's determination to promote a self supporting Colony. The place exemplifies the beginning of Australia'  coal mining industry  (its first vertical shafts) completed during the Macquarie period. The place is closely associated with re-offending convicts following the 1804 Irish rebellion at Vinegar Hill. The place is closely associated with Governor Macquarie who implemented Colonial public works projects like coal mining that later sustained the economic growth of the Colony. The place has a strong association with the Commandants of Newcastle from 1804-23, including Lieutenant Charles Menzies, [[Charles Throsby]], Commandant Wallis and Major Morisset. The site is also significant for its association with Captain George Barney, one of Australia's most important Colonial Engineers during the mid 19th Century, (whose works include the Victoria Barracks in Paddington and the design of [[Circular Quay]]) and with Dr Frederick Manning Norton, who made a considerable contribution to the welfare of the insane and the improvement of mental health care in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has a high degree of aesthetic significance for its position toward the top of the eastern side of the Hill area and has remained virtually intact since first dedicated. Many individuals have found creative inspiration from its landscape since 1804 and their artistic works have documented the transformation of this unique place shaped by human intervention (e.g. Ferdinand Bauer and Joseph Lycett)The place is an early example of a Colonial public works project (Military Barracks) as well as the natural landscape transformed by convict labour. The James Fletcher Hospital site has a rare amalgamation of 1840s Military Barracks buildings, including the Parade Ground surviving in an excavated and walled site. The Parade Ground, with its open space, textures, plantings and other features, adds aesthetic value to the military buildings. The following buildings on the James Fletcher Hospital site show technical innovation in construction methods: the Military Barracks (surviving original timber roof structure, lining boards and original masonry elements, verandah and columns), the surviving original fabric of the former Officer?s Quarters, the surviving original fabric of the former Guard House, the surviving original fabric of the former military outbuildings and underground brick water tanks, the former Military Hospital (surviving timber shingle roof and other masonry elements, original and early timber joinery).<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\nThe place shows technical achievement and innovation in introducing the first coal mining (vertical shaft) in the Southern Hemisphere and marks the use of the transfer of the \"bord and pillar\" coal mining techniques from across the world to Australia. The site contains the first vertical mine shafts used for commercial mining of coal in Australia, a valuable insight into the mining techniques and knowledge used in the Colony. The place offers research opportunities in the area of colonial mining. The place shows innovative and technical achievement related to masonry and quarrying techniques to build the military establishment, as well as skillfulness of design in the reshaping of the landscape to construct these buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAn important site of early interaction between Aboriginal and European people, the place may have potential to contribute new knowledge about the relationship between these two cultures in the colonial period. Features of this cultural landscape, including the early convict coal mines, have the potential to provide new information about colonial and convict life in NSW. The place has potential contribute to a better understanding of the nature of construction techniques used in the convict-era, of early Australian industrial convict sites, of convicts as a cultural group and of the contribution made by their forced labour.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe place is rare in NSW because its landscape was physically shaped by convict labour, a landscape that remains visible today. The place is nationally rare because it possesses Australia's oldest surviving mining heritage (vertical shaft). The place is nationally rare because if possesses an intact military barracks and military hospital and parade ground, both constructed using convict labour.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site is typical of a Military Barracks site with a preserved Parade Ground and Military Barracks. It can be compared with Victoria Barracks in Sydney, as it was constructed around the same time. The place is also representative of colonial lunatic asylums in NSW and was the first regional lunatic asylum in the Colony. The place reflects work of the various Government/Colonial architects.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|New South Wales}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=|date=1943|title=Old Convict Mine Shaft Revealed: Subsidence at Mental Hospital.}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bigge|first=J.

It is also known as Newcastle Government House and Domain, Newcastle Military Barracks & Hospital, Girls' Industrial School, Reformatory for Girls, Lunatic Asylum for Imbeciles, James Fletcher Hospital and Fletcher Park. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 22 March 2011.<ref name=nswshr-1841>{{cite NSW SHR|5060998|Newcastle Government House and Domain|hr=01841|accessdate=21 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Newcastle Government House and Domain has significant associations with [[Convicts in Australia|convictism in Australia]] as a site central to the management of [[convict labour]], early coal mining technology and the development and growth of the Australian economy. \n\n=== Penal settlement ===\nThe earliest European use of the site was the Commandant's Residence (also known as Government House) where the Commandant, Lieutenant [[Charles Menzies (Royal Marines officer)|Charles Menzies]] controlled the penal settlement. The site has remained in [[Government of New South Wales|Government]] management since European occupation from 1804 to the present day. A sketch by [[Ferdinand Bauer]] (1804) shows the flagstaff and the only small house on the area. The same location is also shown in artworks by [[Joseph Lycett]], Walter Preston and Edward Close and these are particularly significant because they show Newcastle's Government House and gardens. Bauer's sketch also shows tents on the hillside of the site. The site is also figures significantly on the Macquarie Chest being depicted on one of its panels.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Convicts ===\nThe first attempt at settlement in Newcastle failed in 1802<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-1\">Turner 1973</ref>and the settlement, also known as \"Kings Town\" and \"Coal River\" was re-established in 1804, providing hard labour for re-offending convicts following the [[Castle Hill convict rebellion|Irish rebellion at Vinegar Hill]]. The second settlement (1804) was prompted because of the prospect of coal as a vital resource for the Colony.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-2\">O'Donnell 1969</ref> After Newcastle was established as a penal settlement, it remained under Colonial administration until 1823. After this time free settlers were introduced into the settlement. Convicts sent to Newcastle endured harsh living standards, intense manual labour in the coal mines and were under constant surveillance.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-1\" /><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nAfter 1823, most of the convicts were transferred to [[Port Macquarie]], however many prisoners remained in Newcastle until 1855 to carry out public works projects such as the construction of [[Macquarie Pier]] and other works. Convict labour was used to build the pier, beginning in 1818 and this work was not completed until 1846. The military were stationed at the military barracks site to manage and supervise the work of the convicts. Furthermore, the association between the former military barracks buildings and the port initiative (the pier) is of significance to capital works programs of the Colonial Government, convictism and early technology in Australia. The employment of convicts to construct Macquarie Pier was in the economic interest of the Colony and this site was significant in supporting this progress. Having started in 1814 with a small population of  approximately 100 convicts and guards, but it would become the major penal settlement of the Australian colonies, accommodating up to one thousand convicts.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-3>Rosen. Review of Items of Potential State Significance in the Newcastle City Area, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Convict labour and coal ===\nNewcastle is the birthplace of [[Coal Mining in Australia|Australia's coal mining industry]] and the first modern coal mining undertaken in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-4\">Hunter 2001</ref> Coal mining in Newcastle provided the first profit ever made in the fledgling [[Colony of New South Wales]] of - 2 pounds, 5 shillings - in 1801.  Convict labour was used to work mines located at Colliers Point (these were horizontal drifts) and on the hillside near Government House, the first working vertical shaft sunk for the production of coal in Australia (on the current [[James Fletcher (Australian politician)|James Fletcher]] Hospital site). One of the coal shafts is named the Wallis shaft, after the Commandant of Newcastle at the time. The site is also associated with Benjamin Grainger who was sent to Newcastle in 1812 to assist in coal mining in the area, later becoming Superintendent of the coal mines, in 1820. The military was present in the settlement to manage the convict population and to supervise work in the mines and the construction of the Macquarie Pier.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nMining on the site was primitive and labour-intensive with loads of coal initially brought to the surface in baskets. A small rail system for haulage was used to take coal to the port directly downhill from the mine site to be loaded onto ships for export. Much of the export went around the world, and was often traded for rum. The transport of coal to the port forged a thoroughfare which then became the main street of the township, George Street (now known as Watt Street). The Commandant had his residence in a prominent place at the top of this street where he was able to view what was happening in the settlement, including work at Collier's Point and Nobbys Island.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\nThe Commandant's residence was both a place of authority and a convict work place. Convicts worked on the site until the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] took over mining in Newcastle. There is evidence of intensive early mining practises on the cliff opposite the site's entrance. The two convict coal mines on the James Fletcher Hospital site were later referred to as the \"Asylum Shafts\". The Wallis shaft is thought to have been excavated between 1814 and 1817.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-5>Eklund 2004</ref> Twenty seven men were described as employed in the working of the mine and the mouth of the shaft immediately adjoined the offices of the Commandant's House.<ref>Bigge, 1822 p.114-118</ref> After these mines became disused there was very little reference made to them during the 1800s. It was not until the 1900s that a mine subsidence report provided more detail about the existence of the convict mines,.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-6>Report of the Royal Commission on Earth subsidence at Newcastle 1908</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\nIn the 1940s Jonathon Dixon carried out research on the site and attempted to locate the position of the first convict coal shaft by surveying an early map.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-7>Draft of the town of Newcastle 1822</ref> Dr B W Champion (1949) also supports Dixon's location of the convict coal mine, adding that it was sunk approximately 20 yards inside the Mental Hospital gates.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-8>Newcastle & Hunter District Historical Society, 1949</ref> Further subsidence within the hospital grounds in 1943 revealed a convict mine shaft. This shaft is thought to be the Wallis Shaft  and was described as being \"inside the gates of the hospital\".<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-9>Newcastle Morning Herald & Miners Advocate July 21, 1943</ref> Dixon argues that the subsidence revealed both the position of the old convict mine shaft and the position of the Commandant's House or Government House.<ref>Dixon, 1949, p.35</ref> Evidence of the shaft was later covered up and is not obvious today, although it is reported to be under the roadway of the main road leading into the hospital. The position of the former Wallis Shaft inside the asylum entrance is shown on a plan by the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]] [[James Barnet]] in 1880.<ref>\"Plan of Hospital for the Insane\" labelled 'pit'</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Governor Lachlan Macquarie ===\n[[Lachlan Macquarie]] on his tour to the northern settlements in 1821 stated in his journal that he stayed at Government House in Newcastle, finding it very comfortable.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-10\">Macquarie's Journal, 1973,   217</ref> Macquarie made several visits to the Newcastle and in 1812 he stated \"...immediately on my landing respecting the inspection of the settlement, I went with Mrs. M. & c. to view the coal mines...\".<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-11\">Macquarie's Journal, 1973,   217 ?? ibid. p.86</ref> The future of the coal mining industry was important to Governor Macquarie as is shown in his laying of the foundation stone to build the Macquarie Pier in 1818. This was a major colonial public works project, undertaken to join the mainland with [[Nobbys Head|Nobbys Island]] and establish a safe port entrance to facilitate the coal export trade. Newcastle's commercial coal mines were integral to Governor Macquarie's plan to promote the Colony as self-supporting.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal interactions ===\nDuring Governor Macquarie's visit to Newcastle in 1818 he recorded that he was entertained by Jack Burigon, King of the Newcastle tribe along with about forty men, women and children who performed a \"Carauberie\" ([[corroboree]]) in the area at the rear of the Newcastle Government House. There are numerous colonial artworks showing Aboriginal occupation in and around the Government House site and as well as Corroborees.<ref>See works by Edwards Close and Joseph Lycett</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Parsonage ===\nThe Newcastle Government House and Domain contains the original site of the [[Church of England]] [[parsonage]] erected in 1819 and home to Reverend George Augustus Middleton, Newcastle's first chaplain.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-12\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004</ref> Governor Macquarie noted that the parsonage was a \"neat brick-built, stuccoed, one-storied parsonage house with a verandah and all necessary out-offices, and also a kitchen garden and grazing paddock attached thereto, both enclosed with a paling\".<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-13\">Turner, History of the James Fletcher Hopsital.p.1</ref> Part of the original parsonage remains and this adds to the significance of the site.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nIn the 1830s part of the land granted to the Church of England as a [[glebe]] was returned to the Government for building a new military barracks.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-14>Hunter 2001, 34-38</ref> Reception House and Kirkwood House have recently been demolished in June 2008 to make way for the construction of a new 20-bed mental Health facility. Reception House was a direct and tangible link to the convict-built parsonage and nearby [[Christ Church Cathedral, Newcastle|Christ Church Cathedral]] buildings and a significant purpose-designed mental health facility which marked an innovation in mental health care. Kirkwood House was designed by the prominent local architect James Henderson. It was a two-storey annexe to the parsonage. Architect Frederick Menkens supervised a later skillion addition. Government Architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]] kept some of the original fabric of the old parsonage in the structure of the new additions to Kirkwood House.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Military barracks & convict labour ===\nFrom the 1830s there was an increase of military protection of Newcastle in order to protect its coal resources and hence the colony's economy. <ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-3\" /> The [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] visited Newcastle to lay foundation stone for the new barracks on the hill near the parsonage house in 1836.<ref>[[Sydney Gazette]], 1836</ref> Lieutenant Colonel [[George Barney]], recently arrived from England was appointed Colonial Engineer in 1836. One of Barney's first tasks was to report on steps that needed to be taken in order to protect the colony from attacks by foreign vessels and he recommended that batteries and blockhouses be constructed in [[Sydney]], Newcastle, [[Wollongong]], Port Macquarie and [[Port Phillip]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Barney, George (1792\u20131862)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/barney-george-1744|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> The first projects undertaken by Barney were for the construction of new barracks at [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]] in Sydney ([[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks]]) and Newcastle.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-3\" /><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe Newcastle Military Barracks were completed earlier than the Victoria Barracks. A convict chain gang in Newcastle was employed to build the foundations for the officers quarters and soldiers barracks in 1838, as well as to create the military parade ground.<ref>[[Hunter River Gazette]], 15 January 1842</ref> Excavation of the hillside by convict iron gang took place in 1842 so that outbuildings could be constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-16>Hunter River Gazette- 15 January 1842</ref> [[George Gipps|Governor Gipps]] proposed reducing troop numbers at the barracks as convict transportation to the colony was coming to an end.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-17>Department of Commerce, 2004, p. 16</ref> Further reducing the need for a strong military presence in Newcastle was the relocation of the remaining prisoners in 1848. Only 1000 troops were to remain in New South Wales to protect the colony. In June 1848 and the 99th regiment left Newcastle.<ref>[[Maitland Mercury]], 24 June 1848</ref> However later in 1848 some convicts returned to Newcastle to build public works accompanied by a military guard which was accommodated in the new barracks.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-18>Department of Commerce, 2004, p. 16 ?? ibid, 2008</ref><ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Lunatic Asylum ===\nThe barracks remained in use for civil service accommodation until 1867 when it became the Girls' Industrial School and later the Reformatory for Girls. On 13 September 1817,  the New South Wales government established its first  \"Lunatic Asylum for Imbeciles and Idiots\" at this site.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-19\">NSW Department of Health, p.39</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-20\">NSW Department of Health, p.39 ?? ibid, 2008</ref> \n\nNewcastle was the fourth main government-run asylum to be opened in New South Wales, the others located at [[Tarban Creek]], [[Parramatta]], the first being at [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], which later become a gaol.<ref name=nswshr-1841-1841-22>Stephen Garton, Medicine and Madness, p. 38</ref>  A common theme throughout the life of the asylum was community dissatisfaction with having such an institution located in the centre of the city. When an asylum was first suggested, the residents of Newcastle were so opposed to the plan that they held a public meeting which consisted of 400 Newcastle residents at the [[Newcastle Court House]].<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-25\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p. 1</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" /> On 4 December 1866 the Colonial Secretary's Office notified the Bench of Magistrates in Newcastle that the proposed plan would not go ahead.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-26\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.19 20</ref> When it was suggested for a second time, a Newcastle newspaper, the Chronicle stated that it was dangerous to have insane people living in such close proximity to residents. It claimed that the use of the former barracks for this purpose was wasting valuable real estate.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-27\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.22 23</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n[[Frederick Norton Manning|Frederick Manning]] was the Inspector General of the Insane and oversaw all lunatic asylums in New South Wales; he is credited with implementing many improvements to the site and with the introduction of [[moral therapy]], believing that young imbeciles and idiots should be kept apart from the older insane people.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-21\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.24</ref> Manning's decision to separate the imbelices and idiots required extra space, at a time when overall patient numbers were increasing, due in part to the effects of the [[Australian banking crisis of 1893|1890s depression]]. Manning had intended to have the younger patients housed on a separate site, but the government's funding was limited during the depressin so additional wards were constructed. The first of these additional wards was constructed  in 1892 and accommodated 24 girls at the northern end of the asylum grounds, behind the court house.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-23\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.30</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-24\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.30 ?? ibid, 2008</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nIn 1916, the facility was renamed the Newcastle Mental Hospital. A visit from the Deputy Inspector General of Mental Hospitals in 1918 found the newer wards of a high standard but determined that the older buildings were in poor condition. Such problems were addressed during the mid to late 1920s, and included improvements in bathroom facilities, the removal of single rooms in the women's section to create a spacious dining and day room and the creation of a larger space in the men's division by removing two of the single rooms.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nIn 1962, the hospital was renamed Newcastle Psychiatric Centre. In 1965, the Shortland Clinic was built to serve outpatients, a model copied at other hospitals such as  [[Royal North Shore Hospital]]. In 1983 the name of the hospital changed to Hunter Hospital and in 1989 the name was again changed to be named the James Fletcher Hospital after [[James Fletcher (Australian politician)|James Fletcher]], an important figure in Newcastle during the late 19th Century. Fletcher was responsible for improving the conditions of miners. An example of this was his establishment of the Australian Agricultural Company's sick and accident fund.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gollan|first=Robin|title=Fletcher, James (1834\u20131891)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/fletcher-james-3538|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-28\">NSW Department of Commerce, 2004, p.22 23 ?? ibid, 2008</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Fletcher Park ===\nFletcher Park was formally known as Lower Reserve and Ordinance Park. Its use as a public park was promoted in 1878 after Frederick Cane the Superintendant of the Asylum for Imbeciles had undertaken to make the park more attractive by planting ornamental shrubs and trees.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-29\">Newcastle & Miners' Advocate, 15 Jan 1878</ref> The park was originally the site of Government House and its flagstaff and is identifiable in many colonial artworks. There were numerous outbuildings to Government House and an artwork completed in1820 (artist unknown) shows these as well as a path to the left of the building leading uphill. There are numerous other works showing the early area.<ref>http://www.newcastle.edu.au/service/archives/coalriver/pdf/hardy2006.pdf</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n== Description ==\nNewcastle Government House & Domain cultural landscape includes the area currently occupied by the James Fletcher Hospital located east of the Newcastle central business district and is bounded by Ordinance Street to the south, Newcomen Street to the west and Church Street to the north. The east boundary of the hospital is Watt street and also includes Fletcher Park situated opposite the hospital entrance and the convict coal mines from 1814-17.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n=== Historic Convict Coal Mines & Adit (1814) ===\nTwo convict coal mines exist on the current hospital grounds, one is approximately 20-25 metres inside the main Watt Street entrance, named Asylum Coal Shaft No. 1. This shaft has been filled and sealed. Asylum Coal Shaft No.2 is in the [[courtyard]] behind the former military hospital, south west corner of the site; it is capped but not filled.<ref>Archeological Management Plan</ref> Both of these shafts are connected to horizontal workings at the coal seam below and to drainage [[adit]]s running to the nearby seaside cliffs. They are well hidden and have been covered over, but not built on. One adit is visible in the cliff at Newcastle South beach (hand-hewn); it is a horizontal shaft and has been cut into the rock face of the cliff, in an [[ovoid]] shape. The adit is located about 5 metres above the ground and approximately 1.5m tall x 0.5 m wide at the top and 0.75 m wide at the bottom. The cliff where the adit is located is cracked, and fenced off. It is unknown where the adit leads; however it does go west towards the nominated site and possibly is linked with the known vertical shafts (asylum shafts). The adit drains water from the mine by gravity, it would appear from the outside that the adit has minimal obstructions and often has water draining from it.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe site has archaeological potential for finding information relating to colonial mining techniques..<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== The parsonage (1819) ===\nThe front of the original building was demolished in the mid 1800s for the realignment of Church Street; however a significant portion of the parsonage was retained when additions were made to Reception House by Architect Walter Vernon. The parsonage (recently Kirkwood House/Reception House) was demolished in 2008 and an archeological excavation took place in March 2009. Remains of the old parsonage (1819) were found, including sections of wall, a cellar and other relics as evidence of the convict period. The size of the remains ([[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]]) is approximately 12x10 metres. The convict brickwork (floor/foundations) was in excellent condition (for its age), and represents building methods and techniques used in the convict era.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Compound Wall (1842) ===\nThe hospital is a walled site within an excavated quarry. The wall has enclosed the buildings on the site since the military buildings were first constructed in 1842. With exception of the northern boundary, the south, east and west sides all have walls. Originally built as a [[retaining wall]] for the excavated site, then it was later retained for privacy for patients of the mental institution.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe integrity of the compound wall is better in some sections than others. Sections of the compound wall were damaged in the June 2007 floods. The foundation of the inside wall appears to be built from [[sandstone]]. The wall runs from north to south and is relatively intact. However much of the upper sections of the wall built from brick have collapsed and are in need of repair.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe walls were constructed from brickwork dated at different periods, and the significant sections of the stone wall in the lower sections of the compound wall may relate to the 1830s when the site was quarried using convict labour. There is high archaeological potential, given that the site was \"prepared\" for construction of the barracks using convict labour.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Landscape ===\nThe landscape of the current hospital grounds shows an exposed quarried landform on the south side, approximately 20 metres high. The exposed rock has eroded somewhat due to environmental conditions; however this landscape remains a noticeable and strong feature of the site, the quarried section that formed a wall runs the full length of the southern boundary. A large expanse of the grounds was levelled to build the military barracks and parade ground. The topography was originally a gentle slope from the ocean cliffs towards what is known today as the \"The Hill\". The area is relatively underdeveloped compared with the surrounding area of the city of Newcastle.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nAs there has been minimal disturbance, there is high potential that archaeological relics may be found.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Former Military Parade Ground ===\nThe parade ground remains an open parkland and grassy area that has not been hindered or interrupted with significant development (except in the case of the Shortland Clinic, which although is not built directly on the oval, does detract visually from the openness of the former military establishment). Significant vistas remain across all areas of the site because the recreation ground is in the centre of the collection of buildings.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Fletcher Park ===\nThis park is situated directly across the road (Watt Street) from the current James Fletcher Hospital, on the east side of the precinct. The park is bounded by a fence on the seaside and there is a steep cliff drop off. In 2005 it was landscaped by [[Newcastle City Council]] and has a path running through the middle of the park. There is also a statue of MJames Fletcher that stands predominantly on the uphill slope, facing down to the city.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nThe park is reasonably well-maintained by Newcastle City Council; much of the open space has remained undisturbed, with the exception of the garden beds on the west side (Watt Street), which were replaced in 2005. This work may have disturbed archaeological remains of the former Newcastle Government House (also known as Commandant's Residence) that existed on the site. Archaeological potential is high in this area.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\n=== Further information ===\n\nThe Thwaites building, Tara Lodge and the former Shortland Clinic building do not contribute to the heritage of the site. However Gate House ({{circa|1842}}) is a significant heritage building related to the military phase of the hospital and contributes greatly to other building on the site, but is not part of the heritage listing. However the former military barracks, military hospital and James Fletcher statue are included in the heritage listing.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 21 September 2010, the Newcastle Government House and Domain site forms a complex, multi-layered cultural landscape, physically transformed by convict labour and providing evidence of the early colonial settlement of Newcastle as well as of the subsequent technical, economic and social development of the city and the state. The site has been identified as being of National significance to Australia and New South Wales.<ref name=\"nswshr-1841-1841-33\">NSW Department of Commerce, CMP, 2004, 7.13</ref><ref name=\"nswshr-1841\" />\n\nNewcastle Government House was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 22 March 2011 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nIt meets this criterion of State significance because it demonstrates patterns of economic and social development of the early colonial period from government-controlled and convict-worked industry, to the arrival of free labour and the beginnings of private enterprise. The place expresses tangibly the way its landscape has changed over time to meet changed uses (military and welfare). It represents a convict penal settlement directly related to the beginning of Australian industry. The place is an exceptional example of the forced migration of convicts (Vinegar Hill rebels) and the development associated with punishment and reform, particularly convict labour and the associated coal mines. The place exemplifies convict labour (quarrying out of landscape, laying of foundations & filling of military parade ground). The place was a site of early contact between Aboriginal and European people during the Macquarie period. It exemplifies Australia's early position at the forefront of applied coal mining technology in the early 1800s. The place is culturally significant because of its representation in historical records and visual sources from the early 1800s, showing the changes in the landscape. Its former military buildings are closely associated with the military history of the Colony during the 1830s and 1840s. It demonstrates an important aspect of law and order through its history as a military barracks and as the source of supervision required for the prisoners who remained in Newcastle to complete the Macquarie Pier. This association with Newcastle's defence history is indirectly related to aiding the growing economy and coal export of the Colony. Convicts were an important part of this accomplishment (1830-40). The James Fletcher Hospital site is unique as a coastal urban Lunatic Asylum (1871- present) and is representative of Australian Colonial asylum culture.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe site exemplifies Governor Macquarie's determination to promote a self supporting Colony. The place exemplifies the beginning of Australia'  coal mining industry  (its first vertical shafts) completed during the Macquarie period. The place is closely associated with re-offending convicts following the 1804 Irish rebellion at Vinegar Hill. The place is closely associated with Governor Macquarie who implemented Colonial public works projects like coal mining that later sustained the economic growth of the Colony. The place has a strong association with the Commandants of Newcastle from 1804-23, including Lieutenant Charles Menzies, [[Charles Throsby]], Commandant Wallis and Major Morisset. The site is also significant for its association with Captain George Barney, one of Australia's most important Colonial Engineers during the mid 19th Century, (whose works include the Victoria Barracks in Paddington and the design of [[Circular Quay]]) and with Dr Frederick Manning Norton, who made a considerable contribution to the welfare of the insane and the improvement of mental health care in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site has a high degree of aesthetic significance for its position toward the top of the eastern side of the Hill area and has remained virtually intact since first dedicated. Many individuals have found creative inspiration from its landscape since 1804 and their artistic works have documented the transformation of this unique place shaped by human intervention (e.g. Ferdinand Bauer and Joseph Lycett)The place is an early example of a Colonial public works project (Military Barracks) as well as the natural landscape transformed by convict labour. The James Fletcher Hospital site has a rare amalgamation of 1840s Military Barracks buildings, including the Parade Ground surviving in an excavated and walled site. The Parade Ground, with its open space, textures, plantings and other features, adds aesthetic value to the military buildings. The following buildings on the James Fletcher Hospital site show technical innovation in construction methods: the Military Barracks (surviving original timber roof structure, lining boards and original masonry elements, verandah and columns), the surviving original fabric of the former Officer?s Quarters, the surviving original fabric of the former Guard House, the surviving original fabric of the former military outbuildings and underground brick water tanks, the former Military Hospital (surviving timber shingle roof and other masonry elements, original and early timber joinery).<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\nThe place shows technical achievement and innovation in introducing the first coal mining (vertical shaft) in the Southern Hemisphere and marks the use of the transfer of the \"bord and pillar\" coal mining techniques from across the world to Australia. The site contains the first vertical mine shafts used for commercial mining of coal in Australia, a valuable insight into the mining techniques and knowledge used in the Colony. The place offers research opportunities in the area of colonial mining. The place shows innovative and technical achievement related to masonry and quarrying techniques to build the military establishment, as well as skillfulness of design in the reshaping of the landscape to construct these buildings.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nAn important site of early interaction between Aboriginal and European people, the place may have potential to contribute new knowledge about the relationship between these two cultures in the colonial period. Features of this cultural landscape, including the early convict coal mines, have the potential to provide new information about colonial and convict life in NSW. The place has potential contribute to a better understanding of the nature of construction techniques used in the convict-era, of early Australian industrial convict sites, of convicts as a cultural group and of the contribution made by their forced labour.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe place is rare in NSW because its landscape was physically shaped by convict labour, a landscape that remains visible today. The place is nationally rare because it possesses Australia's oldest surviving mining heritage (vertical shaft). The place is nationally rare because if possesses an intact military barracks and military hospital and parade ground, both constructed using convict labour.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe site is typical of a Military Barracks site with a preserved Parade Ground and Military Barracks. It can be compared with Victoria Barracks in Sydney, as it was constructed around the same time. The place is also representative of colonial lunatic asylums in NSW and was the first regional lunatic asylum in the Colony. The place reflects work of the various Government/Colonial architects.<ref name=nswshr-1841/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|New South Wales}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book|author=|date=1943|title=Old Convict Mine Shaft Revealed: Subsidence at Mental Hospital.}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bigge|first=J.

The programme, ''Tonight With Trevor McDonald \u2013 Major Fraud'', was broadcast on ITV on 21 April 2003 (a month after the trial began), and credited with over 17 million viewers. On 9 May 2003 (the day after ''Major Fraud'' aired in the US as a special episode of ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|Primetime]]''), the same channel broadcast another programme on the same topic, entitled ''The Final Answer'', which was credited with over 5 million viewers.\n\n=== Trial ===\nFollowing [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|a trial]] at [[Southwark]] [[Crown Court]] lasting four weeks (including jury deliberation for three-and-a-half days), Ingram, his wife and Whittock were convicted by a majority verdict of \"[[Deception (criminal law)|procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception]]\" on 7 April 2003. Both the Ingrams and Whittock were each given prison sentences [[suspended sentence|suspended]] for two years (the Ingrams were sentenced to eighteen months and Whittock was sentenced to twelve months), each fined \u00a315,000, and each ordered to pay \u00a310,000 towards prosecution costs. Within two months of the verdict and sentence, the trial judge ordered the Ingrams to pay additional defence costs: Charles Ingram \u00a340,000 and Diana Ingram \u00a325,000. Altogether with legal fees, the Ingrams had to pay \u00a3115,000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Charles Ingram transcript |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/charles-ingram-transcript-6967487.html |accessdate=13 January 2019 |work=Evening Standard |date=21 January 2004}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 August 2003, the [[Army Board]] ordered Ingram to resign his commission as a major after 17 years of service, but stated that this would not affect his [[pension]] entitlements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3092357.stm|title=BBC NEWS - UK - Millionaire cheat sacked by Army|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2004, the [[Court of Appeal]] denied Ingram leave to appeal against his conviction and upheld his sentence, but agreed to quash his wife's fine and prosecution costs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/3728929.stm |title=TV quiz cheat loses his appeal |accessdate=13 May 2008 |date=19 May 2004 |work=BBC News}}</ref> On 5 October, the [[House of Lords]] denied Ingram leave to appeal against his fine and prosecution costs, and he appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\". A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". However, Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Recorded evidence====\nIn court, Ingram claimed the videotape of his appearance on ''Millionaire'' was \"unrepresentative of what I heard\", and he continues to assert that it was \"unfairly manipulated\".

The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken.

They were designed by the museum's architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and painted by the artist Charles James Lea. The ceiling of the Central Hall consists of 162 panels, 108 of which depict plants considered significant to the history of the museum, to the [[British Empire]] or the museum's visitors and the remainder are highly stylised decorative botanical paintings. The ceiling of the smaller North Hall consists of 36 panels, 18 of which depict plants growing in the [[British Isles]]. Painted directly onto the plaster of the ceilings, they also make use of [[gilding]] for visual effect.\n\nThe natural history collections had originally shared a building with their parent institution the [[British Museum]], but with the expansion of the British Empire there was a significant increase in both public and commercial interest in natural history, and in the number of specimens added to the museum's natural history collections. In 1860 it was agreed that a separate museum of natural history would be created in a large building, capable of displaying the largest specimens, such as whales. The superintendent of the natural history departments, [[Richard Owen]], envisaged that visitors would enter a large central hall containing what he termed an \"index collection\" of representative exhibits, from which other galleries would radiate, and a smaller hall to the north would display the natural history of the British Isles. Waterhouse's [[Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom|Romanesque]] design for the museum included decorative painted ceilings. [[Acton Smee Ayrton]], the [[First Commissioner of Works]], refused to permit the decoration of the ceilings on grounds of cost, but Waterhouse convinced him that provided the painting took place while the scaffolding from the museum's construction was still in place it would incur no extra cost; he further managed to convince Ayrton that the ceiling would be more appealing if elements of the paintings were gilded.\n\nThe ceiling of the Central Hall consists of six rows of painted panels, three on each side of the roof's apex. Above the landing at the southern end of the building, the ceiling is divided into nine-panel blocks. The uppermost three panels in each block consist of what Waterhouse termed \"archaic\" panels, depicting stylised plants on a green background. Each of the lower six panels in each block depicts a plant considered of particular significance to the British Empire, against a pale background. Above the remainder of the Central Hall the archaic panels remain in the same style, but each set of six lower panels depicts a single plant, spreading across the six panels and against the same pale background; these represent plants considered of particular significance either to visitors, or to the history of the museum. The ceiling of the smaller North Hall comprises just four rows of panels. The two uppermost rows are of a simple design of heraldic symbols of the then constituent countries of the United Kingdom; each panel in the lower two rows depicts a different plant found in Britain or Ireland, in keeping with the room's intended purpose as a display of British natural history.\n\nAs the ceilings were built cheaply, they are extremely fragile and require regular repair. They underwent significant conservation work in 1924, 1975 and 2016. The restoration in 2016 coincided with the removal of \"[[Dippy (London)|Dippy]]\", a cast of a ''[[Diplodocus]]'' skeleton which had previously stood in the Central Hall, and the installation of the skeleton of a [[blue whale]] suspended from the ceiling.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Hans Sloane by Stephen Slaughter, 1736, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|right|upright|thumb|alt=Hans Sloane|Hans Sloane]]\nIrish physician [[Hans Sloane]] was born in 1660, and since childhood had a fascination with natural history.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=11}} In 1687 Sloane was appointed personal doctor to [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle|Christopher Monck]], the newly appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]],{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=11}} and lived on that island until Monck died in October 1688.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=13}} During his free time in Jamaica Sloane indulged his passion for biology and botany, and on his return to London brought with him a collection of plants, animal and mineral specimens and numerous drawings and notes regarding the local wildlife, which eventually became the basis for his major ''A Voyage to the Islands {{not a typo|Madera}}, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica'' (1707\u20131725).{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=13}} He became one of England's leading doctors, credited with the invention of [[chocolate milk]] and with the popularisation of [[quinine]] as a medicine,{{efn-ua|Sloane's chocolate milk was intended for medicinal use, in particular as a believed cure for [[tuberculosis]] and [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting fits]].{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=43}}{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=14}}}} and in 1727 [[George II of Great Britain|King George&nbsp;II]] appointed him [[in ordinary|Physician in Ordinary]] (doctor to the Royal Household).{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=14}}\n\nBuilding on the collection he had brought from Jamaica, Sloane continued to collect throughout his life, using his new-found wealth to buy items from other collectors and to buy out the collections of existing museums.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=15}}{{efn-ua|Sloane's motivation for collecting is unknown. Towards his death he claimed that by studying as much of the world as possible he hoped to have a closer understanding of the will of God, but there is little evidence that he was particularly pious during most of the period in which he assembled his collections.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=17}}}} During Sloane's life there were few public museums in England, and by 1710 Sloane's collection filled 11 large rooms, which he allowed the public to visit.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=18}} Following his death on 11 January 1753, Sloane stipulated that his collection\u2014by this time filling two large houses{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=11}}\u2014was to be kept together for the public benefit if at all possible.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=18}} The collection was initially offered to King George II, who was reluctant to meet the \u00a320,000 (about \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1753|r=-5}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}) purchase cost stipulated in Sloane's will.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=20}}{{efn-ua|Hans Sloane's will was specific as to how the collection was to be disposed of. He named a committee of 63 trustees, a mixture of scientists, politicians, religious figures, other collectors, business leaders and Sloane family members. The trustees were instructed to offer the collection for \u00a320,000 to the King; if the King declined to purchase it they were to offer it to the [[Royal Society]], [[Oxford University]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], and if they declined it was to be offered to an assortment of foreign academic bodies. Only if none of the named institutions were willing to purchase the collection were the trustees to allow it to be broken up.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=18}}}} Parliament ultimately agreed to establish a national lottery to fund the purchase of Sloane's collection and the [[Harleian Library]] which was also currently for sale, and to unite them with the [[Cotton library]], which had been bequeathed to the nation in 1702, to create a national collection.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|pp=20\u201321}} On 7 June 1753 the [[British Museum Act 1753]] was passed, authorising the unification of the three collections as the [[British Museum]] and establishing the national lottery to fund the purchase of the collections and to provide funds for their maintenance.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Montagu House, drawing by Sutton Nichols (published 1754).JPG|right|thumb|alt=Montagu House|Montagu House at the time of its transfer to the newly-created British Museum]]\nThe trustees settled on [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] in [[Bloomsbury]] as a home for the new British Museum, opening it to the public for the first time on 15 January 1759.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|pp=25\u201326}}{{efn-ua|Although the collections were open to the public, the early British Museum was not easy to visit.

In 1808\u201309, in an effort to save space, the newly appointed keeper of the natural history department [[George Shaw]] felt obliged to destroy large numbers of the museum's specimens in a series of bonfires in the museum's gardens.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=31}} The 1821 bequest of the library of 60,000 books assembled by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] forced the trustees to address the issue, as the bequest was on condition that the collection be displayed in a single room, and Montagu House had no such room available.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=41}} In 1823 [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] was hired to design a replacement building, the first parts of which opened in 1827 and which was completed in the 1840s.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=42}}\n\n===Plans for a Natural History building===\n[[image:Richard-owen2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Richard Owen|Richard Owen, 1878]]\nWith more space for displays and able to accommodate large numbers of visitors, the new British Museum proved a success with the public, and the natural history department proved particularly popular.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=52}} Although the museum's management had traditionally been dominated by classicists and antiquarians,{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=49}} in 1856 the natural history department was split into separate departments of botany, zoology, mineralogy and geology, each with their own keeper and with botanist and palaeontologist [[Richard Owen]] as superintendent of the four departments.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=54}} By this time the expansion of the [[British Empire]] had led to an increased appreciation of the importance of natural history on the part of the authorities, as territorial expansion had given British companies access to unfamiliar species, the commercial possibilities of which needed to be investigated.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=65}}{{efn-ua|A similar approach to natural history had already been undertaken by Spain during its colonial expansion in the Americas; from 1712 onwards Spanish government and religious officials were obliged to record and report on any plants, animals or minerals they encountered with potential commercial uses.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=65}}}}\n\nBy the time of Owen's appointment, the collections of the natural history departments had increased tenfold in size in the preceding 20 years, and the museum was again suffering from a chronic lack of space.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=59}} There had also long been criticism that because of the varied nature of its displays the museum was confusing and lacked coherence; as early as 1824 [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the [[Home Secretary]], had commented that \"what with marbles, statues, butterflies, manuscripts, books and pictures, I think the museum is a farrago that distracts attention\".{{sfn|Girouard|1981|p=8}} Owen proposed that the museum be split into separate buildings, with one building to house the works of Man<!-- \"works of Man is Owen's phrasing --> (art, antiquities, books and manuscripts) and one to house the works of God (the natural history departments);{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=60}} he argued that the expansion of the British Empire had led to an increased ability to procure specimens, and that increased space to store and display these specimens would both aid scholarship, and enhance Britain's prestige.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=63}}\n{{quote|text=The great instrument of zoological science, as Lord Bacon points out, is a Museum of Natural History. Every civilized state in Europe possesses such a Museum. That of England has been progressively developed to the extent which the restrictive circumstances under which it originated have allowed. The public is now fully aware, by the reports that have been published by Parliament, by representations to Government, and by articles in Reviews and other Periodicals, of the present condition of the National Museum of Natural History and of its most pressing requirements. Of them the most pressing, and the one essential to rendering the collections worthy of this great empire, is 'space'. Our colonies include parts of the earth where the forms of plants and animals are the most strange. No empire in the world had ever so wide a range for the collection of the various forms of animal life as Great Britain. Never was there so much energy and intelligence displayed in the capture and transmission of exotic animals by the enterprising traveller in unknown lands and by the hardy settler in remote colonies, as by those who start from their native shores of Britain. Foreign Naturalists consequently visit England anticipating to find in her capital and in her National Museum the richest and most varied materials for their comparisons and deductions. And they ought to be in a state pre-eminently \nconducive to the advancement of a philosophical zoology, and on a scale commensurate with the greatness of the nation and the peculiar national facilities for such perfection. But, in order to receive and to display zoological specimens, space must be had, and not merely space for display, but for orderly display: the galleries should bear relation in size and form with the nature of the classes respectively occupying them.

Those parts of the building east of the Central Hall were intended by Owen and Waterhouse to be used for geological specimens, and are decorated with sculptures of extinct species known only from fossils; those parts to the west were to be used for the display of extant species, and are decorated with sculptures of living plants and animals.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=71}} The division is not absolute; bats are depicted on the east wing among extinct species, while [[ammonite]]s are depicted among the living species on the west wing.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=71}}}} A statue of [[Adam]] originally stood between the two wings over the main entrance, celebrating humanity as the peak of creation, but was dislodged during the Second World War and not replaced.{{sfn|Girouard|1981|p=58}}{{efn-ua|In Waterhouse's initial design the main entrance was topped with statues of both Adam and Eve, but after his original plan for a level [[parapet]] was replaced by a [[gable]], mounting two statues became impractical and only Adam was included.{{sfn|Girouard|1981|p=57}}}} Much was written at the time of the museum's opening about the terracotta decorations of the museum, but very little was written about how the ceiling was received.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=27}} Knapp & Press (2005) speculate that the apparent lack of public interest in the design of the ceiling could be owing to the prevalence of [[William Morris]]'s ornate floral wallpaper and fabric designs rendering the decorations of the ceiling less unusual to Victorian audiences than might be expected.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=28}}\n\n===Deterioration, restoration and conservation===\nDuring the construction of the building Waterhouse had been under intense pressure from the trustees to cut costs, and consequently was forced to abandon his proposed wooden ceiling.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=69}} Instead, beneath a [[slate roof]], the ceilings were constructed of [[lath]] and plaster. The ribs that frame the panels were reinforced with animal hair, but the panels themselves were not reinforced.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=117}} As a consequence, the ceiling panels are unusually susceptible to vibration and to expansion and contraction caused by temperature variations.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe elaborate nature of the building's design means that its roof slopes at multiple angles, with numerous gutters and gullies, all of which are easily blocked by leaves and wind-blown detritus.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=118}} As such, during periods of heavy rainfall water often penetrates the slate roof and reaches the fragile plaster ceiling.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=118}} In 1924 and 1975, the museum has been obliged to repair and restore the ceilings owing to water damage.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=118}} The height of the Central Hall ceiling made this a complicated and expensive process, requiring floor-to-ceiling scaffolding across the length and width of the Central Hall.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=118}} The need to avoid damage to the fragile mosaic flooring and the terracotta tiling on the walls caused further difficulty in erecting the scaffolding.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=120}} The exact nature and the cost of the repairs conducted in 1924 and 1975 is unknown, as is the identity of the restorers, as the relevant records have been lost, although it is known that cracks in the ceiling were filled with plaster and the paintwork and gilding retouched;{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|pp=120\u2013121}} it is possible that some of the panels were replaced entirely.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=121}}\n\nDuring the Second World War, South Kensington was heavily bombed. The north, east, south and west of the building sustained direct bomb hits; the east wing in particular suffered severe damage and its upper floor was left a burned-out shell.

They were designed by the museum's architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] and painted by the artist Charles James Lea. The ceiling of the Central Hall consists of 162 panels, 108 of which depict plants considered significant to the history of the museum, to the [[British Empire]] or the museum's visitors and the remainder are highly stylised decorative botanical paintings. The ceiling of the smaller North Hall consists of 36 panels, 18 of which depict plants growing in the [[British Isles]]. Painted directly onto the plaster of the ceilings, they also make use of [[gilding]] for visual effect.\n\nThe natural history collections had originally shared a building with their parent institution the [[British Museum]], but with the expansion of the British Empire there was a significant increase in both public and commercial interest in natural history, and in the number of specimens added to the museum's natural history collections. In 1860 it was agreed that a separate museum of natural history would be created in a large building, capable of displaying the largest specimens, such as whales. The superintendent of the natural history departments, [[Richard Owen]], envisaged that visitors would enter a large central hall containing what he termed an \"index collection\" of representative exhibits, from which other galleries would radiate, and a smaller hall to the north would display the natural history of the British Isles. Waterhouse's [[Romanesque Revival architecture in the United Kingdom|Romanesque]] design for the museum included decorative painted ceilings. [[Acton Smee Ayrton]], the [[First Commissioner of Works]], refused to permit the decoration of the ceilings on grounds of cost, but Waterhouse convinced him that provided the painting took place while the scaffolding from the museum's construction was still in place it would incur no extra cost; he further managed to convince Ayrton that the ceiling would be more appealing if elements of the paintings were gilded.\n\nThe ceiling of the Central Hall consists of six rows of painted panels, three on each side of the roof's apex. Above the landing at the southern end of the building, the ceiling is divided into nine-panel blocks. The uppermost three panels in each block consist of what Waterhouse termed \"archaic\" panels, depicting stylised plants on a green background. Each of the lower six panels in each block depicts a plant considered of particular significance to the British Empire, against a pale background. Above the remainder of the Central Hall the archaic panels remain in the same style, but each set of six lower panels depicts a single plant, spreading across the six panels and against the same pale background; these represent plants considered of particular significance either to visitors, or to the history of the museum. The ceiling of the smaller North Hall comprises just four rows of panels. The two uppermost rows are of a simple design of heraldic symbols of the then constituent countries of the United Kingdom; each panel in the lower two rows depicts a different plant found in Britain or Ireland, in keeping with the room's intended purpose as a display of British natural history.\n\nAs the ceilings were built cheaply, they are extremely fragile and require regular repair. They underwent significant conservation work in 1924, 1975 and 2016. The restoration in 2016 coincided with the removal of \"[[Dippy (London)|Dippy]]\", a cast of a ''[[Diplodocus]]'' skeleton which had previously stood in the Central Hall, and the installation of the skeleton of a [[blue whale]] suspended from the ceiling.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Hans Sloane by Stephen Slaughter, 1736, National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|right|upright|thumb|alt=Hans Sloane|Hans Sloane]]\nIrish physician [[Hans Sloane]] was born in 1660, and since childhood had a fascination with natural history.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=11}} In 1687 Sloane was appointed personal doctor to [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle|Christopher Monck]], the newly appointed [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]],{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=11}} and lived on that island until Monck died in October 1688.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=13}} During his free time in Jamaica Sloane indulged his passion for biology and botany, and on his return to London brought with him a collection of plants, animal and mineral specimens and numerous drawings and notes regarding the local wildlife, which eventually became the basis for his major ''A Voyage to the Islands {{not a typo|Madera}}, Barbados, Nieves, S.

He named a committee of 63 trustees, a mixture of scientists, politicians, religious figures, other collectors, business leaders and Sloane family members. The trustees were instructed to offer the collection for \u00a320,000 to the King; if the King declined to purchase it they were to offer it to the [[Royal Society]], [[Oxford University]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]], and if they declined it was to be offered to an assortment of foreign academic bodies. Only if none of the named institutions were willing to purchase the collection were the trustees to allow it to be broken up.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=18}}}} Parliament ultimately agreed to establish a national lottery to fund the purchase of Sloane's collection and the [[Harleian Library]] which was also currently for sale, and to unite them with the [[Cotton library]], which had been bequeathed to the nation in 1702, to create a national collection.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|pp=20\u201321}} On 7 June 1753 the [[British Museum Act 1753]] was passed, authorising the unification of the three collections as the [[British Museum]] and establishing the national lottery to fund the purchase of the collections and to provide funds for their maintenance.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Montagu House, drawing by Sutton Nichols (published 1754).JPG|right|thumb|alt=Montagu House|Montagu House at the time of its transfer to the newly-created British Museum]]\nThe trustees settled on [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] in [[Bloomsbury]] as a home for the new British Museum, opening it to the public for the first time on 15 January 1759.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|pp=25\u201326}}{{efn-ua|Although the collections were open to the public, the early British Museum was not easy to visit.

In 1808\u201309, in an effort to save space, the newly appointed keeper of the natural history department [[George Shaw]] felt obliged to destroy large numbers of the museum's specimens in a series of bonfires in the museum's gardens.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=31}} The 1821 bequest of the library of 60,000 books assembled by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] forced the trustees to address the issue, as the bequest was on condition that the collection be displayed in a single room, and Montagu House had no such room available.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=41}} In 1823 [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]] was hired to design a replacement building, the first parts of which opened in 1827 and which was completed in the 1840s.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=42}}\n\n===Plans for a Natural History building===\n[[image:Richard-owen2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Richard Owen|Richard Owen, 1878]]\nWith more space for displays and able to accommodate large numbers of visitors, the new British Museum proved a success with the public, and the natural history department proved particularly popular.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=52}} Although the museum's management had traditionally been dominated by classicists and antiquarians,{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=49}} in 1856 the natural history department was split into separate departments of botany, zoology, mineralogy and geology, each with their own keeper and with botanist and palaeontologist [[Richard Owen]] as superintendent of the four departments.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=54}} By this time the expansion of the [[British Empire]] had led to an increased appreciation of the importance of natural history on the part of the authorities, as territorial expansion had given British companies access to unfamiliar species, the commercial possibilities of which needed to be investigated.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=65}}{{efn-ua|A similar approach to natural history had already been undertaken by Spain during its colonial expansion in the Americas; from 1712 onwards Spanish government and religious officials were obliged to record and report on any plants, animals or minerals they encountered with potential commercial uses.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=65}}}}\n\nBy the time of Owen's appointment, the collections of the natural history departments had increased tenfold in size in the preceding 20 years, and the museum was again suffering from a chronic lack of space.{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=59}} There had also long been criticism that because of the varied nature of its displays the museum was confusing and lacked coherence; as early as 1824 [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]], the [[Home Secretary]], had commented that \"what with marbles, statues, butterflies, manuscripts, books and pictures, I think the museum is a farrago that distracts attention\".{{sfn|Girouard|1981|p=8}} Owen proposed that the museum be split into separate buildings, with one building to house the works of Man<!-- \"works of Man is Owen's phrasing --> (art, antiquities, books and manuscripts) and one to house the works of God (the natural history departments);{{sfn|Thackray|Press|2001|p=60}} he argued that the expansion of the British Empire had led to an increased ability to procure specimens, and that increased space to store and display these specimens would both aid scholarship, and enhance Britain's prestige.{{sfn|Knapp|Press|2005|p=63}}\n{{quote|text=The great instrument of zoological science, as Lord Bacon points out, is a Museum of Natural History. Every civilized state in Europe possesses such a Museum. That of England has been progressively developed to the extent which the restrictive circumstances under which it originated have allowed. The public is now fully aware, by the reports that have been published by Parliament, by representations to Government, and by articles in Reviews and other Periodicals, of the present condition of the National Museum of Natural History and of its most pressing requirements. Of them the most pressing, and the one essential to rendering the collections worthy of this great empire, is 'space'. Our colonies include parts of the earth where the forms of plants and animals are the most strange. No empire in the world had ever so wide a range for the collection of the various forms of animal life as Great Britain. Never was there so much energy and intelligence displayed in the capture and transmission of exotic animals by the enterprising traveller in unknown lands and by the hardy settler in remote colonies, as by those who start from their native shores of Britain. Foreign Naturalists consequently visit England anticipating to find in her capital and in her National Museum the richest and most varied materials for their comparisons and deductions. And they ought to be in a state pre-eminently \nconducive to the advancement of a philosophical zoology, and on a scale commensurate with the greatness of the nation and the peculiar national facilities for such perfection. But, in order to receive and to display zoological specimens, space must be had, and not merely space for display, but for orderly display: the galleries should bear relation in size and form with the nature of the classes respectively occupying them.

These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.\n\n[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]<ref>Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.</ref> or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].<ref>See Barth, John: \u201c[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].\u201d ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.</ref> However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.<ref>Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.</ref> Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,<ref>See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.</ref> a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a \"[[grand narrative]]\" of  Western culture,<ref>See Lyotard, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984</ref> a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)<ref>See Baudrillard, Jean: \u201c[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.\u201d In: ''Jean Baudrillard.

London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.</ref> However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.\n\nHowever, post-postmodernism in literature began with the publication of [[Bangladeshi]] poet [[Md. Ziaul Haque]]'s book of 'poetenry' (poems of ten lines) titled, ''Give Me a Sky to Fly'' in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kabir Chowdhury | first = Fahmida | authorlink = Fahmida Kabir Chowdhury | title = Md.

However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.\n\n===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===\nIn 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995).</ref> Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of \"anything goes\" and suggests that \u201cthe built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.\u201d<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995), p. 9.</ref> In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to \"embrace post-Postmodernism \u2013 and pray for a better name.\"<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]</ref>\n\n===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===\nIn his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  \"is ... part of a much larger historical formation,\" which he calls \"[[postmodernity]]\".<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.</ref> Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix \"[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]\":\n{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following \"postmodernism,\" one finds that the prefix \"trans\" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of \"post,\" which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as \"truth\" and \"objectivity,\" \"soul\" and \"subjectivity,\" \"utopia\" and \"ideality,\" \"primary origin\" and \"originality,\" \"sincerity\" and \"sentimentality.\" All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of \"trans-subjectivity,\" \"trans-idealism,\" \"trans-utopianism,\" \"trans-originality,\" \"trans-lyricism,\" \"trans-sentimentality\" etc.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}</ref>}} As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka.

Gans associates postmodernism closely with \"victimary thinking,\" which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to \"non-victimary dialogue\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> that will \"diminish ... the amount of resentment in the world.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''<ref>{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.<ref>For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''.

Another similar recent term is [[metamodernism]].\n\n==Periodization==\nMost scholars would agree that [[modernism]] began around 1900 and continued on as the dominant cultural force in the intellectual circles of Western culture well into the mid-twentieth century.<ref>Compare, for example:<br />{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}: \"[modernism] is [...] primarily located in the years 1890-1930 [...]\"<br />{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=Tim|title=Modernism: A Cultural History|publisher=[[Polity Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7456-2983-4|url=https://archive.org/details/modernismcultura0000arms|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/modernismcultura0000arms/page/24 24]|quote=[modernism] can be defined as a series of international artistic movements in the period 1900-40 [...].}}</ref> Like all eras, modernism encompasses many competing individual directions and is impossible to define as a discrete unity or totality. However, its chief general characteristics are often thought to include an emphasis on \"radical aesthetics, technical experimentation, spatial or rhythmic, rather than chronological form, [and] self-conscious reflexiveness\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Peter|title=Modernism|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=New York|year=2008|isbn=978-0-415-41544-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-v8SXB4l7kcC|page=18}}</ref> as well as the search for authenticity in human relations, abstraction in art, and utopian striving. These characteristics are normally lacking in postmodernism or are treated as objects of irony.\n\n[[Postmodernism]] arose after World War II as a reaction to the perceived failings of modernism, whose radical artistic projects had come to be associated with [[totalitarianism]]<ref>Cf. Groys, Boris: ''The Total Art of Stalinism'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992.</ref> or had been assimilated into mainstream culture. The basic features of what we now call postmodernism can be found as early as the 1940s, most notably in the work of [[Jorge Luis Borges]].<ref>See Barth, John: \u201c[[The Literature of Exhaustion]].\u201d ''The Atlantic Monthly'', August 1967, pp. 29-34.</ref> However, most scholars today would agree that postmodernism began to compete with modernism in the late 1950s and gained ascendancy over it in the 1960s.<ref>Cf., for example, Huyssen, Andreas: ''After the Great Divide. Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986, p. 188.</ref> Since then, postmodernism has been a dominant, though not undisputed, force in art, literature, film, music, drama, architecture, history, and continental philosophy. Salient features of postmodernism are normally thought to include the ironic play with styles, citations and narrative levels,<ref>See Hutcheon, Linda: ''A Poetics of Postmodernism. History, Theory, Fiction''. New York: Routledge, 1988, pp. 3-21; McHale, Brian: ''Postmodern Fiction'', London: Methuen, 1987.</ref> a metaphysical skepticism or [[nihilism]] towards a \"[[grand narrative]]\" of  Western culture,<ref>See Lyotard, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, ''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge'', Minneapolis: University of Minneapolis Press 1984</ref> a preference for the virtual at the expense of the real (or more accurately, a fundamental questioning of what 'the real' constitutes)<ref>See Baudrillard, Jean: \u201c[[Simulacra and Simulation]]s.\u201d In: ''Jean Baudrillard.

Durham: Duke University Press 1991, pp. 26-27.</ref>\n\nSince the late 1990s there has been a small but growing feeling both in popular culture and in academia that postmodernism \"has gone out of fashion.\"<ref>Potter, Garry and Lopez, Jose (eds.): ''After Postmodernism: An Introduction to Critical Realism''. London: The Athlone Press 2001, p. 4.</ref> However, there have been few formal attempts to define and name the era succeeding postmodernism, and none of the proposed designations has yet become part of mainstream usage.\n\nHowever, post-postmodernism in literature began with the publication of [[Bangladeshi]] poet [[Md. Ziaul Haque]]'s book of 'poetenry' (poems of ten lines) titled, ''Give Me a Sky to Fly'' in 2014.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kabir Chowdhury | first = Fahmida | authorlink = Fahmida Kabir Chowdhury | title = Md.

However, a common theme of current attempts to define post-postmodernism is emerging as one where faith, trust, dialogue, performance, and sincerity can work to transcend postmodern [[irony]]. The following definitions, which vary widely in depth, focus, and scope, are listed in the chronological order of their appearance.\n\n===Turner's ''post-postmodernism''===\nIn 1995, the landscape architect and urban planner [[Tom Turner]] issued a book-length call for a post-postmodern turn in urban planning.<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995).</ref> Turner criticizes the postmodern credo of \"anything goes\" and suggests that \u201cthe built environment professions are witnessing the gradual dawn of a post-Postmodernism that seeks to temper reason with faith.\u201d<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995), p. 9.</ref> In particular, Turner argues for the use of timeless organic and geometrical patterns in urban planning. As sources of such patterns he cites, among others, the Taoist-influenced work of the American architect [[Christopher Alexander]], [[gestalt psychology]]  and the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Carl Jung]]'s concept of [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]. Regarding terminology, Turner urges us to \"embrace post-Postmodernism \u2013 and pray for a better name.\"<ref>''City as Landscape: A Post Post-modern View of Design and Planning'', (Taylor & Francis: London 1995), p. 10; see also a summary of the book at [http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/library_online_ebooks/architecture_city_as_landscape]</ref>\n\n===Epstein's ''trans-postmodernism''===\nIn his 1999 book on [[Russian postmodernism]] the Russian-American Slavist [[Mikhail Epstein]] suggested that postmodernism  \"is ... part of a much larger historical formation,\" which he calls \"[[postmodernity]]\".<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, p. 467.</ref> Epstein believes that postmodernist aesthetics will eventually become entirely conventional and provide the foundation for a new, non-ironic kind of poetry, which he describes using the prefix \"[[:wikt:trans-|trans-]]\":\n{{quote|In considering the names that might possibly be used to designate the new era following \"postmodernism,\" one finds that the prefix \"trans\" stands out in a special way. The last third of the 20th century developed under the sign of \"post,\" which signalled the demise of such concepts of modernity as \"truth\" and \"objectivity,\" \"soul\" and \"subjectivity,\" \"utopia\" and \"ideality,\" \"primary origin\" and \"originality,\" \"sincerity\" and \"sentimentality.\" All of these concepts are now being reborn in the form of \"trans-subjectivity,\" \"trans-idealism,\" \"trans-utopianism,\" \"trans-originality,\" \"trans-lyricism,\" \"trans-sentimentality\" etc.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.focusing.org/apm_papers/epstein.html | title=Epstein (specific) - the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity}}</ref>}} As an example Epstein cites the work of the contemporary Russian poet [[Timur Kibirov]].<ref>Epstein, Mikhail; Genis, Alexander; Vladiv-Glover, Slobodanka. ''Russian Postmodernism. New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture''. Berghahn Books: New York, 1999, pp. 457-460</ref>\n\n===Gans' ''post-millennialism''===\nThe term ''post-millennialism'' was introduced in 2000 by the American cultural theorist [[Eric Gans]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = The Post-Millennial Age | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 209 | date = June 3, 2000 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw209/ | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> to describe the era after postmodernism in ethical and socio-political terms. Gans associates postmodernism closely with \"victimary thinking,\" which he defines as being based on a non-negotiable ethical opposition between perpetrators and victims arising out of the experience of [[Auschwitz]] and [[Hiroshima]]. In Gans's view, the ethics of postmodernism is derived from identifying with the peripheral victim and disdaining the utopian center occupied by the perpetrator. Postmodernism in this sense is marked by a victimary politics that is productive in its opposition to modernist utopianism and totalitarianism but unproductive in its resentment of capitalism and liberal democracy, which he sees as the long-term agents of global reconciliation. In contrast to postmodernism, post-millennialism is distinguished by the rejection of victimary thinking and a turn to \"non-victimary dialogue\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Victimary Thinking Forever? | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 230 | date = March 31, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw230.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> that will \"diminish ... the amount of resentment in the world.\"<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Moral Heroism | journal = Anthropoetics | volume = 237 | date = June 9, 2001 | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/vw237.htm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}}}}</ref> Gans has developed the notion of post-millennialism further in many of his internet ''Chronicles of Love and Resentment''<ref>{{Cite web | last = Gans | first = Eric | authorlink = Eric Gans | title = Chronicles of Love and Resentment | work = Anthropoetics | publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date =  | url = http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/views/Chronicles_home.cfm | accessdate = {{date|2011-06-17|mdy}} }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the term is allied closely with his theory of [[generative anthropology]] and his scenic concept of history.<ref>For more on both see Gans, Eric: ''Originary Thinking: Elements of Generative Anthropology''.
