However, Lennox claimed that placing more Scottish people in the king's household had become difficult. He wrote to Sir William Livingstone of Kilsyth who had asked for a place for a Napier of  [[Merchiston Castle]];<blockquote>\"although the King has this long time promised Merchiston ever the next vacant place, yet many has been placed over him and in this has found great impediments; for believe that a stranger shall find great difficulty to obtain any such place so long as there is any English man that does aim at it; for it is thought by them all that there is already too many Scots here in such places.\"<ref>''HMC Laing Maunscripts at the University of Edinburgh'', vol. 1 (London, 1914), p. 106-7, modernised here.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn July 1606 he was sent to [[Gravesend]] to welcome [[Christian IV of Denmark]], the younger brother of the queen [[Anne of Denmark]], to England.

The Pynnar Survey of 1618 records Lennox as the chief undertaker for 2,000 acres in the Portlough area and as represented locally by his agent Sir [[Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple|Aulant Aula]]. Newtownstewart in County Tyrone, now in Northern Ireland, may have been named after him. In the Muster Rolls of 1631 his nephew and eventual heir [[James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond|James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox]] is described as being an undertaker of 4,000 acres. [[Mongavlin Castle]] was built by his son Sir John Stewart, who was also Governor of [[Dumbarton Castle]].\n\nLudovic was involved in the colonization of [[Maine]] in [[New England]].  [[Cape Elizabeth, Maine|Richmond Island and Cape Richmond]], as well as [[Richmond, Maine]] (formerly Fort Richmond), are named after him.\n\nIn March 1614 thieves broke into his lodgings at [[Whitehall Palace]] and stole a gold collar set with pearls and diamonds worth \u00a3300, a silver warming pan, a silver inkstand, and some linen.<ref>John Cordy Jeaffreson, ''Middlesex County Records'', vol. 2 (London, 1882), p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Frances, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox.jpg|thumb|[[Frances Howard, Duchess of Richmond|Frances Howard]], Lennox's third wife]]\nKing [[James VI of Scotland]] had discussed with [[Thomas Fowler (courtier)|Thomas Fowler]] the possibility of the Duke marrying [[Arbella Stuart]],<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 17.</ref> but the scheme was not proceeded with.

{"title_page": "John Gordon (bishop)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2012}}\n'''John Gordon''' (1 September 1544 \u2013 3 September 1619) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] prelate.\n\n==Life==\nJohn Gordon was the natural son of [[Alexander Gordon (d. 1575)|Alexander Gordon]] (c. 1516-1575), [[Bishop of Galloway]] and former [[Archbishop of Glasgow]], and Barbara Logie; his parents married, perhaps clandestinely, only in 1546, before Alexander obtained ecclesiastical preferment (for this, see his new [[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]] entry).\n\nGordon first studied at [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St Leonard's College]], [[St. Andrews]]. In June 1565 he was sent to pursue his education in France, having a yearly pension granted him by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], payable out of her French dowry.  He spent two years at the [[University of Paris|universities of Paris]] and Orleans.  On 4 January 1568 he was confirmed by royal charter in the bishopric of Galloway and [[Abbot of Tongland|abbacy]] of [[Tongland Abbey|Tongland]], vacated in his favour by his father; the charter specifies his skill in classical and oriental tongues.  At this time he was in France, in the service of the Protestant leader, Prince [[Louis I Conde|Louis of Conde]], but he soon came to England, entered the service of [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk|Thomas, Duke of Norfolk]], and attended him at the conferences of York (October 1568) and Westminster (November 1568), held for the purpose of considering Mary's guilt.\n\nWhen Norfolk was sent to the [[Tower of London|Tower]] (October 1569), Gordon transferred his services to Mary herself, and seems to have remained with her till January 1572, when she was deprived of her household.  Mary commended him to the French king, and he enjoyed the post of gentleman ordinary of the privy chamber to [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], with a yearly pension of four hundred crowns.  He saved the lives of several countrymen at the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], but never renounced Protestantism.  In 1574 he exhibited his [[Hebrew]] learning in a public disputation at [[Avignon]] with the chief rabbi Benetrius.  By his marriage in  1576 with Antoinette, widowed daughter of [[Rene de Marolles]], he acquired an estate which gave him the style of \"Sieur of Longorme\".  With the [[see of Galloway]] his connection was never more than nominal, the revenues going to his father or to his brother George.\n\nGordon is mentioned in 1588 as Bishop of Galloway; but he resigned his rights before 8 July 1586.  His first wife died in 1591.  He married in 1594 a strong Protestant, [[Genevieve Petau de Maulette|Genevieve]], daughter of Fran\u00e7ois Petau, sieur of [[Maulette]]. On 18 July 1594 in Paris, he signs the marriage contract between Suzanne Hotman and her first husband John Menteith, calling himself \"Gentleman of the Bedchamber of the King [and] Seigneur of Boullay-Thierry\".  In 1601 he was selected by the Duchess of [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], sister of Henry IV, to take part with [[Daniel Tilenus]] and [[Pierre Du Moulin]] in a public disputation against [[Du Perron]] (afterwards cardinal), who had been charged with the task of converting her to the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nOn the accession of [[James I of England|James I]] to the English throne (1603), Gordon published in French and English a strongly Protestant [[panegyric]] of congratulation and, in the same year, a piece in Latin [[elegiac]]s addressed to Prince Henry. James called him to England and nominated him in October to the deanery of Salisbury, whereupon he was ordained in his 59th year.  He was present at the [[Hampton Court conference]] in January 1604 as \"deane of Sarum\",' though he was not confirmed until 24 February. In the second day's conference, James singled him out \"with a speciall [[encomium|encomion]], that he was a man well trauailled in the auncients.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  He approved of the ring in marriage, but doubted the cross in baptism.\n\nGordon preached often at court and, among the \"pulpit-occurrents\" of 28 April 1605, it is mentioned that \"Deane Gordon, preaching before the kinge, is come so farre about in matter of ceremonies, the out of Ezechiell and other places of the prophets, and by certain hebrue characters, and other cabalisticall collections, he hath founde out and approved the vse of the crosse cap surplis et ct.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  During James' visit to [[Oxford]] in 1605 he was created a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) on 13 August \"because he was to dispute before the king his kinsman.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} He is described as of [[Balliol College]].  His second wife Genevieve Petau de Maulette taught French to [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] (1596\u20131662), afterwards queen of [[Bohemia]].  In 1611 the barony of [[Glenluce]], which had belonged to his brother Lawrence, was bestowed on him by royal charter.\n\nDuring the ten years 1603-13 Gordon produced a number of [[quarto]]s notable for obscure learning, Protestant fervour, controversial elegiacs, and prophetic anticipations drawn from the wildest etymologies.  He was assiduous in his ecclesiastical duties, which included a quasi-episcopal supervision of some eighty [[Parish church|parishes]].  He procured an act of the chapter devoting one-fifth of the revenue of every prebend for seven years to [[cathedral]] repairs.  While on a [[triennial]] visitation he died at [[Lewston House]], [[Dorset]], in his seventy-fifth year.  He was buried on 6 September in the morning chapel of his cathedral, where an inscribed stone marks his grave.\n\n==Legacy==\nOn the north wall of the choir there was a brass (which no longer exists) \"bearing the figure of a bishop, raised from his tomb by two angels\", with a long biographical epitaph in Latin (given in the 1723 history of the cathedral). The dean assigned the barony of [[Glenluce]] with all his French property to [[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon]], whom he made his literary executor.  He left books to the cathedral library, and a legacy for rebuilding the cloisters.\n\n==Works==\n*''Panegyrique de Congratulation... par Jean de Gordon Escossois, sieur de Long-orme, Gentil-homme ordinaire de la chambre du Roy Tres-Chrestien,'' &c., La Rochelle, 1603, 8vo; also in English, by E.G.
