Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a [[novel]], but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the [[novel]] or [[novella]] (a shorter novel), authors generally draw from a common pool of [[literary technique]]s.\n\nShort story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.\n\nShort stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years. The short form is, conceivably, more natural to us than longer forms{{cn|date=March 2020}}. We are drawn to short stories as the well-told story{{cn|date=March 2020}}, and as [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]], the award-winning British author and short story writer has said:\n<blockquote>[short stories] seem to answer something very deep in our nature as if, for the duration of its telling, something special has been created, some essence of our experience extrapolated, some temporary sense has been made of our common, turbulent journey towards the grave and oblivion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/william-boyd-short-history-of-the-short-story|title=A short history of the short story|last=Boyd|first=William|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn terms of length, [[word count]] is typically anywhere from 1,000 to 4,000 for short stories, however some have 20,000 words and are still classed as short stories. Stories of fewer than 1,000 words are sometimes referred to as \"short short stories\", or \"[[flash fiction]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thephoenix.com/Portland/Arts/63088-Who-reads-short-shorts/|title=Who reads short shorts?|author=Deirdre Fulton|date=2008-06-11|publisher=thePhoneix.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821224948/http://thephoenix.com/Portland/Arts/63088-Who-reads-short-shorts|archivedate=2009-08-21|url-status=dead|accessdate=2013-06-06|quote=\"each of their (less-than-1000-word) stories\"|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Today ==\n[[:Category:21st-century short story writers|21st-century short story writers]] run into the thousands.\n\nSales of short-story fiction are strong.

A popular example of this is \"[[The Hitch-Hiker (radio play)|The Hitch-Hiker]]\", read by [[Orson Welles]].\n* [[Short film]]s, often rewritten by other people, and even as feature-length films; such is the case of \"[[Children of the Corn]]\", \"[[The Shawshank Redemption]]\", \"[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]\", \"[[Brokeback Mountain]]\", \"[[Who Goes There?]]\", \"[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]\", \"[[A Sound of Thunder]]\", \"[[The Body (2001 film)|The Body]]\", \"[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]\", \"[[The Lawnmower Man]]\", \"[[Hearts in Atlantis]]\", and \"[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]\".\n* [[Television special]]s, such as \"[[12:01 PM]]\" (1993 television movie), \"[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]\" (October 11, 1963, on ''The Twilight Zone''), \"[[The Lottery]]\", and \"[[Button, Button (The Twilight Zone)|Button, Button]]\" (on ''The Twilight Zone'').\n\n==Length==\n\nDetermining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A&nbsp;classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[essay]] \"[[The Philosophy of Composition]]\" (1846).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.eldritchpress.org/nh/nhpoe1.html|title=Edgar Allan Poe: Essays and Reviews|last=Poe|first=Edgar Allan|publisher=Library of America|year=1984|pages=569\u201377}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting this standard nowadays is problematic, because the expected length of \"one sitting\" may now be briefer than it was in Poe's era.\n\nShort stories have no set length. In terms of word count there is no official demarcation between an [[anecdote]], a short story, and a novel. Rather, the form's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered, so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres, countries, eras, and commentators.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|url=https://archive.org/details/penguindictionar00cudd|url-access=registration|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|edition=3rd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/penguindictionar00cudd/page/864 864]}}</ref> Like the novel, the short story's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication, and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses.<ref name=\"Abrams1999\">{{cite book|title=Glossary of Literary Terms|last=Abrams|first=M.H.|publisher=Harcourt Brace|year=1999|isbn=0-15-505452-X|edition=7th|location=Orlando, FL|pages=286\u201387}}</ref>\n\nAs a point of reference for the genre writer, the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] define short story length in the [[Nebula Award]]s for [[science fiction]] submission guidelines as having a word count of fewer than 7,500 words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nebulas.sfwa.org/about-the-nebulas/nebula-rules|title=Complete Nebula Awards Rules Including the Ray Bradbury and Andre Norton Awards (Revised & Updated)|publisher=sfwa.org|accessdate=2017-06-27}}</ref>\n\nLonger stories that cannot be called novels are sometimes considered \"[[novellas]]\" or novelettes and, like short stories, may be collected into the more marketable form of \"collections\", often containing previously unpublished stories. Sometimes, authors who do not have the time or money to write a novella or novel decide to write short stories instead, working out a deal with a [[E-book|popular website]] or [[magazine]] to publish them for profit.\n\n==History==\n\nThe precursors of short story were [[legend|legends]], [[Myth|mythic tales]], [[Folklore genre|folk tales]], [[Fairy tale|fairy tales]], [[Fable|fables]] and [[Anecdote|anecdotes]] which were present in various ancient communities across the world. These short pieces existed mostly in oral form and they were transmitted from one generation to another in oral form. A large number of such tales are found in ancient literature, from the [[India|Indian]] epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] to the [[Homer|Homeric]] epics the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]]. The [[One Thousand and One Nights|1001 Arabian Nights]], compiled for the first time probably in the eighth century, is also a storehouse of Middle Eastern folk tales and fairy tales. Emerging in the 17th century from oral [[storytelling]] traditions and above-mentioned written works of the ancient times (which themselves are based on oral traditions), the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization.\n\nWith the rise of the [[realism (arts)|realistic]] novel, the short story evolved in a parallel tradition, with some of its first distinctive examples in the tales of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]. The character of the form developed particularly with authors known for their short fiction, either by choice (they wrote nothing else) or by critical regard, which acknowledged the focus and craft required in the short form. An example is [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who won American fame with \"[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]\", published in the August 1948 ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''. Another example is [[O. Henry]] (author of \"[[The Gift of the Magi (O. Henry story)|Gift of the Magi]]\"), for whom the [[O. Henry Award]] is named. Other of his most popular, inventive and most often reprinted stories (among over 600) include: \"The Ransom of Red Chief\",  \"The Cop and the Anthem\", \"The Skylight Room\", \"After Twenty Years\", ''A Municipal Report'', ''An Unfinished Story'', ''A Lickpenny Lover'', ''Mammon and the Archer'' and ''The Last Leaf''. American examples include: [[Jack London]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[John Cheever]], and [[Raymond Carver]]. [[Science fiction]] short story with a special poetic touch was a genre developed with great popular success by [[Ray Bradbury]].\nThe genre of the short story was often neglected until the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe evolution of printing technologies and periodical editions were among the factors contributing to the increasing importance of short story publications. Pioneering role in founding the rules of the genre in the [[Western canon]] include, among others, [[Rudyard Kipling]] (United Kingdom), [[Anton Chekhov]] (Russia), [[Guy de Maupassant]] (France), [[Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez N\u00e1jera]] (Mexico) and [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] (Nicaragua).\n\nAn important theoretical example for storytelling analysis is provided by Walter Benjamin in his essay ''The Storyteller'' where he argues about the decline of storytelling art and the incommunicability of experiences in the modern world.<ref>{{cite web|website = Modernism Lab|url= https://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Storyteller |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130214064257/https://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Storyteller |archivedate = 14 February 2013 |title=\"The Storyteller\" Commentary |first= Leo|last= Hall|publisher=Yale}}</ref> Oscar Wilde's essay ''The Decay of Lying'' and Henry James's ''The Art of Fiction'' are also partly related to this subject.\n\n=== Predecessors ===\nShort stories date back to oral storytelling traditions which originally produced epics such as the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]], [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. Oral narratives were often told in the form of rhyming or [[rhythm]]ic [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], often including recurring sections or, in the case of Homer, ''[[Homeric epithet]]s''. Such stylistic devices often acted as [[mnemonic]]s for easier recall, rendition and adaptation of the story. Short sections of verse might focus on individual narratives that could be told at one sitting. The overall arc of the [[Narrative|tale]] would emerge only through the telling of multiple such sections.\n\nThe other ancient form of short story, the [[anecdote]], was popular under the [[Roman Empire]]. Anecdotes functioned as a sort of [[parable]], a brief realistic narrative that embodies a point. Many surviving Roman anecdotes were collected in the 13th or 14th century as the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''. Anecdotes remained popular in Europe well into the 18th century, when the fictional anecdotal letters of Sir [[Roger de Coverley]] were published.\n\nIn India, there is a rich heritage of ancient folktales as well as compiled body of short fiction which shaped the sensibility of modern Indian short story. Some of the famous [[Sanskrit]] collection of legends, folktales, fairy tales and fables are [[Panchatantra]], [[Hitopadesha]] and [[Kathasaritsagara]]. [[Jataka tales]], originally written in [[Pali]], is a compilation of tales concerning the previous births of Lord [[Gautama Buddha]]. The [[Frame story]] or frame narrative or [[story within a story]] is a narrative technique which probably originated in ancient Indian works such as [[Panchatantra]]. \n\nIn Europe, the oral story-telling tradition began to develop into written stories in the early 14th century, most notably with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Both of these books are composed of individual short stories (which range from farce or humorous anecdotes to well-crafted literary fictions) set within a larger narrative story (a [[frame story]]), although the frame-tale device was not adopted by all writers.  At the end of the 16th century, some of the most popular short stories in Europe were the darkly tragic \"[[novella]]\" of [[Matteo Bandello]] (especially in their French translation).\n\nThe mid 17th century in France saw the development of a refined short novel, the \"nouvelle\", by such authors as [[Madame de Lafayette]]. In the 1690s, traditional [[fairy tale]]s began to be published (one of the most famous collections was by [[Charles Perrault]]). The appearance of [[Antoine Galland]]'s first modern translation of the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' (or ''Arabian Nights'') (from 1704; another translation appeared in 1710\u201312) would have an enormous influence on the 18th-century European short stories of [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]] and others.\n\n=== 1790\u20131850 ===\nThere are early examples of short stories published separately between 1790 and 1810, but the first true collections of short stories appeared between 1810 and 1830 in several countries around the same period.<ref>''Short Story'' in Jacob E. Safra e.a., ''The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 15th edition, Micropaedia volume 10, Chicago, 1998.</ref>\n\nThe first short stories in the United Kingdom were [[gothic fiction|gothic tales]] like [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]]'s \"remarkable narrative\" \"The Poisoner of Montremos\" (1791).<ref>Internet Book List: Book Information: Oxford Book of Gothic Tales.</ref> Great novelists like Sir [[Walter Scott]] and [[Charles Dickens]] also wrote some short stories.\n\nOne of the earliest short stories in the United States was [[Charles Brockden Brown]]'s \"Somnambulism\" from 1805. [[Washington Irving]] wrote mysterious tales including \"[[Rip van Winkle]]\" (1819) and \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\" (1820). [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] published the first part of his ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'' in 1837. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote his tales of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and imagination between 1832 and 1849. Poe is often given the credit (by scholars such as [[M. H. Abrams]]) of establishing short story as a genre of literature. Poe's classic stories are \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\", \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\", \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\", \"[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]\", \"[[The Gold Bug]], and the first [[detective fiction|detective stories]], \"[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]\" and \"[[The Purloined Letter]]\". In \"[[The Philosophy of Composition]]\" (1846) Poe argued that a literary work (short story) should be short enough for a reader to finish in one sitting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides7/philcomp.html |title=Poe's The Philosophy of Composition: a Study Guide |publisher=Cummingsstudyguides.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Germany, the first collection of short stories was by [[Heinrich von Kleist]] in 1810 and 1811. The [[Brothers Grimm]] published their [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|first volume of collected fairy tales]] in 1812. [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] followed with his own original [[fantasy]] tales, of which \"[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]\" (1816) and \"[[The Sandman]]\" are the most famous.\n\nIn France, [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] wrote ''Mateo Falcone'' in 1829.\n\n=== 1850\u20131900 ===\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the growth of print magazines and journals created a strong demand for short fiction of between 3,000 and 15,000 words.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Thomas Hardy]] wrote dozens of short stories, including \"[[The Three Strangers]]\" (1883), \"[[A Mere Interlude]]\" (1885) and \"[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]\" (1890). Rudyard Kipling published [[short story collection]]s for grown-ups, e.g. ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'' (1888), as well as for children, e.g. ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894). In 1892 [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] brought the [[detective fiction|detective story]] to a new height with ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote his first [[science fiction]] stories in the 1880s. One of his best known is \"[[The Country of the Blind]]\" (1904).\n\nIn the United States, [[Herman Melville]] published his story collection ''[[The Piazza Tales]]'' in 1856.  \"[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]\" was the title story of [[Mark Twain]]'s first book one year later. In 1884, [[Brander Matthews]], the first American professor of dramatic literature, published ''The Philosophy of the Short-Story''. At that same year, Matthews was the first one to name the emerging genre \"short story\". Another theorist of [[narrative]] [[fiction]] was [[Henry James]]. James wrote a lot of short stories himself, including \"[[The Real Thing (story)|The Real Thing]]\" (1892), \"Maud-Evelyn\" and ''[[The Beast in the Jungle]]'' (1903). In the 1890s [[Kate Chopin]] published short stories in several magazines.\n\nThe most prolific French author of short stories was Guy de Maupassant. Stories like \"''[[Boule de Suif]]''\" (\"Ball of Fat\", 1880) and \"''L'Inutile Beaut\u00e9''\" (\"The Useless Beauty\", 1890) are good examples of French [[Literary realism|realism]].\n\nIn Russia, [[Ivan Turgenev]] gained recognition with his story collection ''[[A Sportsman's Sketches]]''. [[Nikolai Leskov]] created his first short stories in the 1860s. Late in his life [[Fyodor Dostoyevski]] wrote \"[[A Gentle Creature|The Meek One]]\" (1876) and \"[[The Dream of a Ridiculous Man]]\" (1877), two stories with great psychological and philosophical depth. [[Leo Tolstoy]] handled ethical questions in his short stories, for example in \"[[Ivan the Fool (story)|Ivan the Fool]]\" (1885), \"[[How Much Land Does a Man Need?]]\" (1886) and \"[[Alyosha the Pot]]\" (1905). The greatest specialist of the Russian short story, however, was Anton Chekhov. Classic examples of his realistic prose are \"[[The Bet (short story)|The Bet]]\" (1889), \"Ward No. 6\" (1892), and \"[[The Lady with the Dog]]\" (1899). [[Maxim Gorky]]'s best known short story is \"[[Twenty-six Men and a Girl]]\" (1899).\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in India, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] published more than 150 short stories, on the lives of the poor and oppressed such as peasants, women and villagers under colonial misrule and exploitation. Some of his famous short stories include \"The Kabuliwala\", \"The Hungry Stone\", \"The Wife's Letter\", \"The Parrot's Training\" and \"Pubishment\". Tagore's contemporary, [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was another pioneer in Bengali short stories. Chattopadhyay's stories focused on the social scenario of rural Bengal and the lives of common people, especially the oppressed classes. His most popular short stories include \"Bindu's Son\", \"Abhagi's Heaven\", \"Mahesh\", \"Ram's Good Lesson\", \"Lalu\" (3 parts) and \"The Husband\". \n\nThe prolific Indian author of short stories [[Munshi Premchand]], pioneered the genre in the [[Hindustani language]], writing a substantial body of short stories and novels in a style characterized by realism and an unsentimental and authentic introspection into the complexities of Indian society. [[Premchand]]'s works include over 200 short stories (such as \"The Shroud\", \"The Cost of Milk\" and \"Lottery\").\n\nIn Poland, [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]] was the most important author of short stories. In 1888 he wrote \"[[A Legend of Old Egypt]]\".\n\nThe Brazilian novelist [[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]] was the most important short story writer from his country at the time, under influences (among others) of [[Xavier de Maistre]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], [[Guy de Maupassant]]. In the end of the 19th century the writer [[Jo\u00e3o do Rio]] became popular by short stories about the [[bohemianism]]. Writing about the former slaves, and very ironical about [[nationalism]], [[Lima Barreto]] died almost forgotten, but became very popular in the 20th century.\n\nIn Portuguese literature, the major names of the time are [[Almeida Garrett]] and the [[historian]] and novelist [[Alexandre Herculano]]. Still influential, [[E\u00e7a de Queiroz]] produced some short stories with a style influenced by [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[Balzac]] and [[Dickens]].\n\n=== 1900\u20131945 ===\nIn the United Kingdom, periodicals like ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' and ''[[Story-Teller]]'' contributed to the popularity of the short story. Hector Hugh Munro (1870\u20131916), also known by his pen name of [[Saki]], wrote [[satire|satirical]] short stories about [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. [[W. Somerset Maugham]], who wrote over a hundred short stories, was one of the most popular authors of his time. [[P.G. Wodehouse]] published his first collection of comical stories about valet [[Jeeves]] in 1917. Many [[detective fiction|detective stories]] were written by [[G.K. Chesterton]], [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]. Short stories by [[Virginia Woolf]] are \"[[Kew Gardens (short story)|Kew Gardens]]\" (1919) and \"Solid Objects,\" about a politician with mental problems. [[Graham Greene]] wrote his [[Twenty-One Stories]] between 1929 and 1954. A specialist of the short story was [[V.S. Pritchett]], whose first collection appeared in 1932. [[Arthur C. Clarke]] published his first [[science fiction]] story, \"[[Travel by Wire!]]\" in 1937. [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Muriel Spark]] and [[L.P. Hartley]] were other popular British storytellers whose career started in this period.\n\nIn Ireland, [[James Joyce]] published his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' in 1914. These stories, written in a more accessible style than his later novels, are based on careful observation of the inhabitants of his birth city.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, a number of high-profile American magazines such as ''The [[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' published short stories in each issue. The demand for quality short stories was so great and the money paid for such so well that F. Scott Fitzgerald repeatedly turned to short-story (as Matthews preferred to write it) writing to pay his numerous debts. His first collection ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]'' appeared in book form in 1920. William Faulkner wrote over one hundred short stories. ''[[Go Down, Moses (book)|Go Down, Moses]]'', a collection of seven stories, appeared in 1941. Ernest Hemingway's concise writing style was perfectly fit for shorter fiction. Stories like \"[[A Clean, Well-Lighted Place]]\" (1926), \"[[Hills Like White Elephants]]\" (1927) and \"[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]\" (1936) are only a few pages long, but carefully crafted. [[Dorothy Parker]]'s bittersweet story \"Big Blonde\" debuted in 1929. A popular [[science fiction]] story is \"[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]\" by [[Isaac Asimov]].\n\n[[Katherine Mansfield]] from New Zealand wrote many short stories between 1912 and her death in 1923. \"[[The Doll's House (short story)|The Doll's House]]\" (1922) treats the topic of social inequity.\n\nIn [[Uruguay]], [[Horacio Quiroga]] became one of the most influentials short story writers in the spanish language, with a clear influence from [[Edgar Allan Poe]], he had a great skill using the [[supernatural]] and the bizarre to show the struggle of man and animal to survive. He also excelled in portraying [[mental illness]] and [[Hallucination|hallucinatory]] states.\n\nTwo important authors of short stories in the [[German language]] were [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Franz Kafka]]. In 1922 the latter wrote \"[[A Hunger Artist]]\", about a man who [[Fasting|fasts]] for several days.\n\nIn India, the master of the short story in the Urdu language, [[Saadat Hasan Manto]] is revered for his exceptional depth, irony and sardonic humour. The author of some 250 short stories, radio plays, essays, reminiscences and a novel, Manto is widely admired for his analyses of violence, bigotry, prejudice and the relationships between reason and unreason. Combining realism with surrealism and irony, Manto's works such as the celebrated short story [[Toba Tek Singh]] are aesthetic masterpieces which continue to give profound insight into the nature of human loss, violence and devastation. Another famous Urdu writer is [[Ismat Chughtai]] whose short story \"Lihaaf\" (The Quilt) on a lesbian relationship between an upper-class Muslim woman and her maid servant created great controversy following its publication in 1942. \n\n[[Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa]] (1892\u20131927) is called the Father of the Japanese short story.\n\nIn Brazil, the most famous modern short story writer is [[M\u00e1rio de Andrade]]. At the time, [[S\u00e3o Paulo|Paulistan]] writer [[Ant\u00f3nio de Alcant\u00e2ra Machado]] became very popular from his collection of short stories titled, ''Br\u00e1s, Bexiga e Barra Funda'' (1928), about several Italian neighborhoods, but now he is mostly read in just S\u00e3o Paulo. Also, novelist [[Graciliano Ramos]] and poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] have significant short story works.\n\nPortuguese writers like [[M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro]], [[Florbela Espanca]] and [[Fernando Pessoa]] wrote well-known short stories, although their major genre was poetry.\n\n=== 1945 to modern day ===\nThe period following [[World War II]] saw a great flowering of literary short fiction in the United States. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' continued to publish the works of the form's leading mid-century practitioners, including [[Shirley Jackson]], whose story, \"[[The Lottery]]\", published in 1948, elicited the strongest response in the magazine's history to that time. Other frequent contributors during the last 1940s included [[John Cheever]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Jean Stafford]], and [[Eudora Welty]]. Cheever is best known for \"[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]\" (1964) which beautifully blends realism and surrealism. [[J.D. Salinger]]'s  ''Nine Stories'' (1953) experimented with point of view and voice, while [[Flannery O'Connor]]'s well-known story \"[[A Good Man is Hard to Find]]\" (1955) reinvigorated the [[Southern Gothic]] style. Cultural and social identity played a considerable role in much of the short fiction of the 1960s. [[Philip Roth]] and [[Grace Paley]] cultivated distinctive Jewish-American voices. [[Tillie Olsen]]'s \"[[I Stand Here Ironing]]\" (1961) adopted a consciously feminist perspective. [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]'s collection ''[[Going to Meet the Man]]'' (1965) told stories of African-American life. [[Frank O'Connor]]'s ''[[The Lonely Voice]]'', an exploration of the short story, appeared in 1963. [[Wallace Stegner]]'s short stories are primarily set in the American West. [[Stephen King]] published many short stories in men's magazines in the 1960s and after. King's interest is found in the supernatural and macabre. The 1970s saw the rise of the postmodern short story in the works of [[Donald Barthelme]] and [[John Barth]]. Traditionalists including [[John Updike]] and [[Joyce Carol Oates]] maintained significant influence on the form. [[Minimalism]] gained widespread influence in the 1980s, most notably in the work of [[Raymond Carver]] and [[Ann Beattie]].\n\nCanadian short story writers include [[Alice Munro]], [[Mavis Gallant]], and Lynn Coady. In the year 2013 Alice Munro became the first writer of only short stories to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Her award-winning short story collections include ''[[Dance of the Happy Shades]], [[Lives of Girls and Women]], [[Who Do You Think You Are? (book)|Who Do You Think You Are?]], [[The Progress of Love]], [[The Love of a Good Woman]]'' and ''[[Runaway (book)|Runaway]]''. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Daphne du Maurier]] wrote [[suspense]] stories like \"[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]\" (1952) and \"[[Don't Look Now]]\" (1971). [[Roald Dahl]] was the master of the twist-in-the-tale. Short story collections like ''Lamb to the Slaughter'' (1953) and ''[[Kiss Kiss (book)|Kiss Kiss]]'' (1960) illustrate his dark humour.\n\nSome of the [[Bengal]]i short story writers of the post-Tagore and post-Sarat Chandra generation are [[Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]], [[Manik Bandyopadhyay]], [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Mahasweta Devi]], [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]], [[Suchitra Bhattacharya]], [[Ramapada Chowdhury]] and [[Humayun Ahmed]]. The role of the bi-monthly magazine [[Desh (magazine)|Desh]] (first published in 1933) is imperative in the development of Bengali short story. Two of the most popular detective story writers of Bengali literature are [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]] (the creator of [[Byomkesh Bakshi]]) and [[Satyajit Ray]] (the creator of [[Feluda]]). The canon of [[Hindi]] short story was enriched by the contributions of Jaishankar Prasad, Amrita Pritam, Dharamvir Bharti, Bhisham Sahni, Krishna Sobti, Nirmal Verma, Kamleshwar, Mannu Bhandari, Harishankar Parsai and others. \n\nIn Italy, [[Italo Calvino]] published the short story collection ''[[Marcovaldo]]'', about a poor man in a city, in 1963.\n\nIn Brazil, the short story became popular among female writers like [[Clarice Lispector]], [[Lygia Fagundes Telles]], [[Ad\u00e9lia Prado]], who wrote about their society from a feminine viewpoint, although the genre has great male writers like [[Dalton Trevisan]], [[Autran Dourado]] [[Moacyr Scliar]] and [[Carlos Heitor Cony]] too. Also, writing about poverty and the [[favela]]s, [[Jo\u00e3o Antonio]] became a well known writer. Other post-modern short fiction authors include writers [[Hilda Hilst]] and [[Caio Fernando Abreu]]. Detective literature was led by [[Rubem Fonseca]]. It is also necessary to mention [[Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa]], wrote short stories in the book ''Sagarana'' using a complex, experimental language based on tales of oral traditional.\n\nPortuguese writers like [[Verg\u00edlio Ferreira]], [[Fernando Goncalves Namora]] and [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]] are among the most influential short story writers from 20th-century Portuguese language literature. [[Manuel da Silva Ramos]] is one of the most well-known names of [[postmodernism]] in the country. [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]] published few short stories, but became popular from his novels.\n\nThe [[Angloa|Angolan]] writer [[Jos\u00e9 Luandino Vieira]] is one of the most well-known writers from his country and has several short stories. [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa]] is also increasingly read in Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\n[[Republic of Mozambique|Mozambican]] [[Mia Couto]] is a widely known writer of post modern prose, and he is read even in non-Portuguese speaking countries. Other Mozambican writers such as [[Suleiman Cassamo]], [[Paulina Chiziane]] and [[Eduardo White]] are gaining popularity with Portuguese-speakers too.\n\nThe [[Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in the [[Spanish language]]. \"[[The Library of Babel]]\" (1941) and \"[[The Aleph (short story)|The Aleph]]\" (1945) handle difficult subjects like [[infinity]]. Two of the most representative writers of the [[Magical realism]] genre are also widely known Argentinian short story writers: [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] and [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]].\n\nThe [[Uruguay]]an writer [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] is known as one of the most important magical realist writer from Latin America.\n\nIn [[Colombia]], the [[Nobel prize]] laureate author [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] is the main novelist and short story writer, known by his magical realist stories and his defense of the [[Colombian Communist Party|Communist Party]] in his country.\n\nThe [[Peruvian]] writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], also a [[Nobel prize]] winner, has significant short story works.\n\nThe [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Naguib Mahfouz]] is the most well-known author from his country, but has only a few short stories.\n\nJapanese world-known short story writers include [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] ([[Nobel prize]] winner of 1994), [[Yukio Mishima]] and [[Haruki Murakami]].\n\nMulti-awarded [[Philippine]] writer [[Peter Solis Nery]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in [[Hiligaynon language]]. His stories \"Lirio\" (1998), \"Candido\" (2007), \"Donato Bugtot\" (2011), and \"Si Padre Olan kag ang Dios\" (2013) are all gold prize winners at the [[Palanca Awards]] of [[Philippine Literature]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nAs a concentrated, concise form of [[Narrative structure|narrative]] and descriptive prose fiction, the short story has been theorized through the traditional elements of [[dramatic structure]]: '''exposition''' (the introduction of setting, situation and main characters), '''complication''' (the event that introduces the conflict), [[rising action]], '''crisis''' (the decisive moment for the protagonist and his commitment to a course of action), '''climax''' (the point of highest interest in terms of the conflict and the point with the most action) and '''resolution''' (the point when the conflict is resolved). Because of their length, short stories may or may not follow this pattern. For example, modern short stories only occasionally have an exposition, more typically beginning in the middle of the action (''[[in medias res]]''). As with longer stories, plots of short stories also have a climax, crisis, or turning point. However, the endings of many short stories are abrupt and open and may or may not have a moral or practical lesson. As with any art form, the exact characteristics of a short story will vary by creator.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anthology]]\n* [[Conte cruel]]\n* [[Drabble]]\n* [[Essay]]\n* [[Flash fiction]] (also called microfiction)\n* [[Irish short story]]\n* [[Literary journal]]\n* [[Minisaga|Mini saga]]\n* [[Novella]]\n* [[Sketch story]]\n* [[Tall tale]]\n* [[Vignette (literature)|Vignette]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |editor=Browns, Julie |title=Ethnicity and the American Short Story |publisher=New York: Garland |year=1997 }}\n* {{cite book | author =Goyet, Florence |title=The Classic Short Story, 1870\u20131925: Theory of a Genre |publisher=Cambridge: Open Book Publishers|year=2014 |url=http://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/199}}\n* {{cite book |editor=Gelfant, Blanche |editor2=Lawrence Graver |title=The Columbia Companion to the Twentieth-Century American Short Story |url=https://archive.org/details/columbiacompanio00blan |url-access=registration |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2000}}\n* {{cite book |editor=Hart, James |editor2=Phillip Leininger |title=Oxford Companion to American Literature |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompanionthart |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995}}\n* {{cite book |editor=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Jos\u00e9 R |editor2=Jos\u00e9 Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez |editor3=Carmen M.

Short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components as in a [[novel]], but typically to a lesser degree. While the short story is largely distinct from the [[novel]] or [[novella]] (a shorter novel), authors generally draw from a common pool of [[literary technique]]s.\n\nShort story writers may define their works as part of the artistic and personal expression of the form. They may also attempt to resist categorization by genre and fixed formation.\n\nShort stories have deep roots and the power of short fiction has been recognised in modern society for hundreds of years.

A popular example of this is \"[[The Hitch-Hiker (radio play)|The Hitch-Hiker]]\", read by [[Orson Welles]].\n* [[Short film]]s, often rewritten by other people, and even as feature-length films; such is the case of \"[[Children of the Corn]]\", \"[[The Shawshank Redemption]]\", \"[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]\", \"[[Brokeback Mountain]]\", \"[[Who Goes There?]]\", \"[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]\", \"[[A Sound of Thunder]]\", \"[[The Body (2001 film)|The Body]]\", \"[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]\", \"[[The Lawnmower Man]]\", \"[[Hearts in Atlantis]]\", and \"[[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty]]\".\n* [[Television special]]s, such as \"[[12:01 PM]]\" (1993 television movie), \"[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]\" (October 11, 1963, on ''The Twilight Zone''), \"[[The Lottery]]\", and \"[[Button, Button (The Twilight Zone)|Button, Button]]\" (on ''The Twilight Zone'').\n\n==Length==\n\nDetermining what exactly separates a short story from longer fictional formats is problematic. A&nbsp;classic definition of a short story is that one should be able to read it in one sitting, a point most notably made in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[essay]] \"[[The Philosophy of Composition]]\" (1846).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.eldritchpress.org/nh/nhpoe1.html|title=Edgar Allan Poe: Essays and Reviews|last=Poe|first=Edgar Allan|publisher=Library of America|year=1984|pages=569\u201377}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting this standard nowadays is problematic, because the expected length of \"one sitting\" may now be briefer than it was in Poe's era.\n\nShort stories have no set length. In terms of word count there is no official demarcation between an [[anecdote]], a short story, and a novel. Rather, the form's parameters are given by the rhetorical and practical context in which a given story is produced and considered, so that what constitutes a short story may differ between genres, countries, eras, and commentators.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory|url=https://archive.org/details/penguindictionar00cudd|url-access=registration|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|publisher=Penguin|year=1999|edition=3rd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/penguindictionar00cudd/page/864 864]}}</ref> Like the novel, the short story's predominant shape reflects the demands of the available markets for publication, and the evolution of the form seems closely tied to the evolution of the publishing industry and the submission guidelines of its constituent houses.<ref name=\"Abrams1999\">{{cite book|title=Glossary of Literary Terms|last=Abrams|first=M.H.|publisher=Harcourt Brace|year=1999|isbn=0-15-505452-X|edition=7th|location=Orlando, FL|pages=286\u201387}}</ref>\n\nAs a point of reference for the genre writer, the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] define short story length in the [[Nebula Award]]s for [[science fiction]] submission guidelines as having a word count of fewer than 7,500 words.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nebulas.sfwa.org/about-the-nebulas/nebula-rules|title=Complete Nebula Awards Rules Including the Ray Bradbury and Andre Norton Awards (Revised & Updated)|publisher=sfwa.org|accessdate=2017-06-27}}</ref>\n\nLonger stories that cannot be called novels are sometimes considered \"[[novellas]]\" or novelettes and, like short stories, may be collected into the more marketable form of \"collections\", often containing previously unpublished stories. Sometimes, authors who do not have the time or money to write a novella or novel decide to write short stories instead, working out a deal with a [[E-book|popular website]] or [[magazine]] to publish them for profit.\n\n==History==\n\nThe precursors of short story were [[legend|legends]], [[Myth|mythic tales]], [[Folklore genre|folk tales]], [[Fairy tale|fairy tales]], [[Fable|fables]] and [[Anecdote|anecdotes]] which were present in various ancient communities across the world. These short pieces existed mostly in oral form and they were transmitted from one generation to another in oral form. A large number of such tales are found in ancient literature, from the [[India|Indian]] epics the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]] to the [[Homer|Homeric]] epics the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]]. The [[One Thousand and One Nights|1001 Arabian Nights]], compiled for the first time probably in the eighth century, is also a storehouse of Middle Eastern folk tales and fairy tales. Emerging in the 17th century from oral [[storytelling]] traditions and above-mentioned written works of the ancient times (which themselves are based on oral traditions), the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization.\n\nWith the rise of the [[realism (arts)|realistic]] novel, the short story evolved in a parallel tradition, with some of its first distinctive examples in the tales of [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]]. The character of the form developed particularly with authors known for their short fiction, either by choice (they wrote nothing else) or by critical regard, which acknowledged the focus and craft required in the short form. An example is [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who won American fame with \"[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]\", published in the August 1948 ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''. Another example is [[O. Henry]] (author of \"[[The Gift of the Magi (O. Henry story)|Gift of the Magi]]\"), for whom the [[O. Henry Award]] is named. Other of his most popular, inventive and most often reprinted stories (among over 600) include: \"The Ransom of Red Chief\",  \"The Cop and the Anthem\", \"The Skylight Room\", \"After Twenty Years\", ''A Municipal Report'', ''An Unfinished Story'', ''A Lickpenny Lover'', ''Mammon and the Archer'' and ''The Last Leaf''. American examples include: [[Jack London]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Flannery O'Connor]], [[John Cheever]], and [[Raymond Carver]]. [[Science fiction]] short story with a special poetic touch was a genre developed with great popular success by [[Ray Bradbury]].\nThe genre of the short story was often neglected until the second half of the 19th century.\n\nThe evolution of printing technologies and periodical editions were among the factors contributing to the increasing importance of short story publications. Pioneering role in founding the rules of the genre in the [[Western canon]] include, among others, [[Rudyard Kipling]] (United Kingdom), [[Anton Chekhov]] (Russia), [[Guy de Maupassant]] (France), [[Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez N\u00e1jera]] (Mexico) and [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] (Nicaragua).\n\nAn important theoretical example for storytelling analysis is provided by Walter Benjamin in his essay ''The Storyteller'' where he argues about the decline of storytelling art and the incommunicability of experiences in the modern world.<ref>{{cite web|website = Modernism Lab|url= https://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Storyteller |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130214064257/https://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Storyteller |archivedate = 14 February 2013 |title=\"The Storyteller\" Commentary |first= Leo|last= Hall|publisher=Yale}}</ref> Oscar Wilde's essay ''The Decay of Lying'' and Henry James's ''The Art of Fiction'' are also partly related to this subject.\n\n=== Predecessors ===\nShort stories date back to oral storytelling traditions which originally produced epics such as the [[Ramayana]], the [[Mahabharata]], [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]''. Oral narratives were often told in the form of rhyming or [[rhythm]]ic [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], often including recurring sections or, in the case of Homer, ''[[Homeric epithet]]s''. Such stylistic devices often acted as [[mnemonic]]s for easier recall, rendition and adaptation of the story. Short sections of verse might focus on individual narratives that could be told at one sitting. The overall arc of the [[Narrative|tale]] would emerge only through the telling of multiple such sections.\n\nThe other ancient form of short story, the [[anecdote]], was popular under the [[Roman Empire]]. Anecdotes functioned as a sort of [[parable]], a brief realistic narrative that embodies a point. Many surviving Roman anecdotes were collected in the 13th or 14th century as the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''. Anecdotes remained popular in Europe well into the 18th century, when the fictional anecdotal letters of Sir [[Roger de Coverley]] were published.\n\nIn India, there is a rich heritage of ancient folktales as well as compiled body of short fiction which shaped the sensibility of modern Indian short story. Some of the famous [[Sanskrit]] collection of legends, folktales, fairy tales and fables are [[Panchatantra]], [[Hitopadesha]] and [[Kathasaritsagara]]. [[Jataka tales]], originally written in [[Pali]], is a compilation of tales concerning the previous births of Lord [[Gautama Buddha]]. The [[Frame story]] or frame narrative or [[story within a story]] is a narrative technique which probably originated in ancient Indian works such as [[Panchatantra]]. \n\nIn Europe, the oral story-telling tradition began to develop into written stories in the early 14th century, most notably with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Both of these books are composed of individual short stories (which range from farce or humorous anecdotes to well-crafted literary fictions) set within a larger narrative story (a [[frame story]]), although the frame-tale device was not adopted by all writers.  At the end of the 16th century, some of the most popular short stories in Europe were the darkly tragic \"[[novella]]\" of [[Matteo Bandello]] (especially in their French translation).\n\nThe mid 17th century in France saw the development of a refined short novel, the \"nouvelle\", by such authors as [[Madame de Lafayette]]. In the 1690s, traditional [[fairy tale]]s began to be published (one of the most famous collections was by [[Charles Perrault]]). The appearance of [[Antoine Galland]]'s first modern translation of the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'' (or ''Arabian Nights'') (from 1704; another translation appeared in 1710\u201312) would have an enormous influence on the 18th-century European short stories of [[Voltaire]], [[Diderot]] and others.\n\n=== 1790\u20131850 ===\nThere are early examples of short stories published separately between 1790 and 1810, but the first true collections of short stories appeared between 1810 and 1830 in several countries around the same period.<ref>''Short Story'' in Jacob E. Safra e.a., ''The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 15th edition, Micropaedia volume 10, Chicago, 1998.</ref>\n\nThe first short stories in the United Kingdom were [[gothic fiction|gothic tales]] like [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]]'s \"remarkable narrative\" \"The Poisoner of Montremos\" (1791).<ref>Internet Book List: Book Information: Oxford Book of Gothic Tales.</ref> Great novelists like Sir [[Walter Scott]] and [[Charles Dickens]] also wrote some short stories.\n\nOne of the earliest short stories in the United States was [[Charles Brockden Brown]]'s \"Somnambulism\" from 1805. [[Washington Irving]] wrote mysterious tales including \"[[Rip van Winkle]]\" (1819) and \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\" (1820). [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] published the first part of his ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'' in 1837. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote his tales of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]] and imagination between 1832 and 1849. Poe is often given the credit (by scholars such as [[M. H. Abrams]]) of establishing short story as a genre of literature. Poe's classic stories are \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\", \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\", \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\", \"[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]\", \"[[The Gold Bug]], and the first [[detective fiction|detective stories]], \"[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]\" and \"[[The Purloined Letter]]\". In \"[[The Philosophy of Composition]]\" (1846) Poe argued that a literary work (short story) should be short enough for a reader to finish in one sitting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cummingsstudyguides.net/Guides7/philcomp.html |title=Poe's The Philosophy of Composition: a Study Guide |publisher=Cummingsstudyguides.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Germany, the first collection of short stories was by [[Heinrich von Kleist]] in 1810 and 1811. The [[Brothers Grimm]] published their [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|first volume of collected fairy tales]] in 1812. [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]] followed with his own original [[fantasy]] tales, of which \"[[The Nutcracker and the Mouse King]]\" (1816) and \"[[The Sandman]]\" are the most famous.\n\nIn France, [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] wrote ''Mateo Falcone'' in 1829.\n\n=== 1850\u20131900 ===\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, the growth of print magazines and journals created a strong demand for short fiction of between 3,000 and 15,000 words.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Thomas Hardy]] wrote dozens of short stories, including \"[[The Three Strangers]]\" (1883), \"[[A Mere Interlude]]\" (1885) and \"[[Barbara of the House of Grebe]]\" (1890). Rudyard Kipling published [[short story collection]]s for grown-ups, e.g. ''[[Plain Tales from the Hills]]'' (1888), as well as for children, e.g. ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894). In 1892 [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] brought the [[detective fiction|detective story]] to a new height with ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]''. [[H.G. Wells]] wrote his first [[science fiction]] stories in the 1880s. One of his best known is \"[[The Country of the Blind]]\" (1904).\n\nIn the United States, [[Herman Melville]] published his story collection ''[[The Piazza Tales]]'' in 1856.  \"[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]\" was the title story of [[Mark Twain]]'s first book one year later. In 1884, [[Brander Matthews]], the first American professor of dramatic literature, published ''The Philosophy of the Short-Story''. At that same year, Matthews was the first one to name the emerging genre \"short story\". Another theorist of [[narrative]] [[fiction]] was [[Henry James]]. James wrote a lot of short stories himself, including \"[[The Real Thing (story)|The Real Thing]]\" (1892), \"Maud-Evelyn\" and ''[[The Beast in the Jungle]]'' (1903). In the 1890s [[Kate Chopin]] published short stories in several magazines.\n\nThe most prolific French author of short stories was Guy de Maupassant. Stories like \"''[[Boule de Suif]]''\" (\"Ball of Fat\", 1880) and \"''L'Inutile Beaut\u00e9''\" (\"The Useless Beauty\", 1890) are good examples of French [[Literary realism|realism]].\n\nIn Russia, [[Ivan Turgenev]] gained recognition with his story collection ''[[A Sportsman's Sketches]]''. [[Nikolai Leskov]] created his first short stories in the 1860s. Late in his life [[Fyodor Dostoyevski]] wrote \"[[A Gentle Creature|The Meek One]]\" (1876) and \"[[The Dream of a Ridiculous Man]]\" (1877), two stories with great psychological and philosophical depth. [[Leo Tolstoy]] handled ethical questions in his short stories, for example in \"[[Ivan the Fool (story)|Ivan the Fool]]\" (1885), \"[[How Much Land Does a Man Need?]]\" (1886) and \"[[Alyosha the Pot]]\" (1905). The greatest specialist of the Russian short story, however, was Anton Chekhov. Classic examples of his realistic prose are \"[[The Bet (short story)|The Bet]]\" (1889), \"Ward No. 6\" (1892), and \"[[The Lady with the Dog]]\" (1899). [[Maxim Gorky]]'s best known short story is \"[[Twenty-six Men and a Girl]]\" (1899).\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in India, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] published more than 150 short stories, on the lives of the poor and oppressed such as peasants, women and villagers under colonial misrule and exploitation. Some of his famous short stories include \"The Kabuliwala\", \"The Hungry Stone\", \"The Wife's Letter\", \"The Parrot's Training\" and \"Pubishment\". Tagore's contemporary, [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay]] was another pioneer in Bengali short stories. Chattopadhyay's stories focused on the social scenario of rural Bengal and the lives of common people, especially the oppressed classes. His most popular short stories include \"Bindu's Son\", \"Abhagi's Heaven\", \"Mahesh\", \"Ram's Good Lesson\", \"Lalu\" (3 parts) and \"The Husband\". \n\nThe prolific Indian author of short stories [[Munshi Premchand]], pioneered the genre in the [[Hindustani language]], writing a substantial body of short stories and novels in a style characterized by realism and an unsentimental and authentic introspection into the complexities of Indian society. [[Premchand]]'s works include over 200 short stories (such as \"The Shroud\", \"The Cost of Milk\" and \"Lottery\").\n\nIn Poland, [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]] was the most important author of short stories. In 1888 he wrote \"[[A Legend of Old Egypt]]\".\n\nThe Brazilian novelist [[Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis|Machado de Assis]] was the most important short story writer from his country at the time, under influences (among others) of [[Xavier de Maistre]], [[Lawrence Sterne]], [[Guy de Maupassant]]. In the end of the 19th century the writer [[Jo\u00e3o do Rio]] became popular by short stories about the [[bohemianism]]. Writing about the former slaves, and very ironical about [[nationalism]], [[Lima Barreto]] died almost forgotten, but became very popular in the 20th century.\n\nIn Portuguese literature, the major names of the time are [[Almeida Garrett]] and the [[historian]] and novelist [[Alexandre Herculano]]. Still influential, [[E\u00e7a de Queiroz]] produced some short stories with a style influenced by [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[Balzac]] and [[Dickens]].\n\n=== 1900\u20131945 ===\nIn the United Kingdom, periodicals like ''[[The Strand Magazine]]'' and ''[[Story-Teller]]'' contributed to the popularity of the short story. Hector Hugh Munro (1870\u20131916), also known by his pen name of [[Saki]], wrote [[satire|satirical]] short stories about [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. [[W. Somerset Maugham]], who wrote over a hundred short stories, was one of the most popular authors of his time. [[P.G. Wodehouse]] published his first collection of comical stories about valet [[Jeeves]] in 1917. Many [[detective fiction|detective stories]] were written by [[G.K. Chesterton]], [[Agatha Christie]] and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]. Short stories by [[Virginia Woolf]] are \"[[Kew Gardens (short story)|Kew Gardens]]\" (1919) and \"Solid Objects,\" about a politician with mental problems. [[Graham Greene]] wrote his [[Twenty-One Stories]] between 1929 and 1954. A specialist of the short story was [[V.S. Pritchett]], whose first collection appeared in 1932. [[Arthur C. Clarke]] published his first [[science fiction]] story, \"[[Travel by Wire!]]\" in 1937. [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Muriel Spark]] and [[L.P. Hartley]] were other popular British storytellers whose career started in this period.\n\nIn Ireland, [[James Joyce]] published his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' in 1914. These stories, written in a more accessible style than his later novels, are based on careful observation of the inhabitants of his birth city.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, a number of high-profile American magazines such as ''The [[Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's]]'', ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' published short stories in each issue. The demand for quality short stories was so great and the money paid for such so well that F. Scott Fitzgerald repeatedly turned to short-story (as Matthews preferred to write it) writing to pay his numerous debts. His first collection ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]'' appeared in book form in 1920. William Faulkner wrote over one hundred short stories. ''[[Go Down, Moses (book)|Go Down, Moses]]'', a collection of seven stories, appeared in 1941. Ernest Hemingway's concise writing style was perfectly fit for shorter fiction. Stories like \"[[A Clean, Well-Lighted Place]]\" (1926), \"[[Hills Like White Elephants]]\" (1927) and \"[[The Snows of Kilimanjaro (story)|The Snows of Kilimanjaro]]\" (1936) are only a few pages long, but carefully crafted. [[Dorothy Parker]]'s bittersweet story \"Big Blonde\" debuted in 1929. A popular [[science fiction]] story is \"[[Nightfall (Asimov short story and novel)|Nightfall]]\" by [[Isaac Asimov]].\n\n[[Katherine Mansfield]] from New Zealand wrote many short stories between 1912 and her death in 1923. \"[[The Doll's House (short story)|The Doll's House]]\" (1922) treats the topic of social inequity.\n\nIn [[Uruguay]], [[Horacio Quiroga]] became one of the most influentials short story writers in the spanish language, with a clear influence from [[Edgar Allan Poe]], he had a great skill using the [[supernatural]] and the bizarre to show the struggle of man and animal to survive. He also excelled in portraying [[mental illness]] and [[Hallucination|hallucinatory]] states.\n\nTwo important authors of short stories in the [[German language]] were [[Thomas Mann]] and [[Franz Kafka]]. In 1922 the latter wrote \"[[A Hunger Artist]]\", about a man who [[Fasting|fasts]] for several days.\n\nIn India, the master of the short story in the Urdu language, [[Saadat Hasan Manto]] is revered for his exceptional depth, irony and sardonic humour. The author of some 250 short stories, radio plays, essays, reminiscences and a novel, Manto is widely admired for his analyses of violence, bigotry, prejudice and the relationships between reason and unreason. Combining realism with surrealism and irony, Manto's works such as the celebrated short story [[Toba Tek Singh]] are aesthetic masterpieces which continue to give profound insight into the nature of human loss, violence and devastation. Another famous Urdu writer is [[Ismat Chughtai]] whose short story \"Lihaaf\" (The Quilt) on a lesbian relationship between an upper-class Muslim woman and her maid servant created great controversy following its publication in 1942. \n\n[[Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa]] (1892\u20131927) is called the Father of the Japanese short story.\n\nIn Brazil, the most famous modern short story writer is [[M\u00e1rio de Andrade]]. At the time, [[S\u00e3o Paulo|Paulistan]] writer [[Ant\u00f3nio de Alcant\u00e2ra Machado]] became very popular from his collection of short stories titled, ''Br\u00e1s, Bexiga e Barra Funda'' (1928), about several Italian neighborhoods, but now he is mostly read in just S\u00e3o Paulo. Also, novelist [[Graciliano Ramos]] and poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] have significant short story works.\n\nPortuguese writers like [[M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro]], [[Florbela Espanca]] and [[Fernando Pessoa]] wrote well-known short stories, although their major genre was poetry.\n\n=== 1945 to modern day ===\nThe period following [[World War II]] saw a great flowering of literary short fiction in the United States. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' continued to publish the works of the form's leading mid-century practitioners, including [[Shirley Jackson]], whose story, \"[[The Lottery]]\", published in 1948, elicited the strongest response in the magazine's history to that time. Other frequent contributors during the last 1940s included [[John Cheever]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Jean Stafford]], and [[Eudora Welty]]. Cheever is best known for \"[[The Swimmer (short story)|The Swimmer]]\" (1964) which beautifully blends realism and surrealism. [[J.D. Salinger]]'s  ''Nine Stories'' (1953) experimented with point of view and voice, while [[Flannery O'Connor]]'s well-known story \"[[A Good Man is Hard to Find]]\" (1955) reinvigorated the [[Southern Gothic]] style. Cultural and social identity played a considerable role in much of the short fiction of the 1960s. [[Philip Roth]] and [[Grace Paley]] cultivated distinctive Jewish-American voices. [[Tillie Olsen]]'s \"[[I Stand Here Ironing]]\" (1961) adopted a consciously feminist perspective. [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]]'s collection ''[[Going to Meet the Man]]'' (1965) told stories of African-American life. [[Frank O'Connor]]'s ''[[The Lonely Voice]]'', an exploration of the short story, appeared in 1963. [[Wallace Stegner]]'s short stories are primarily set in the American West. [[Stephen King]] published many short stories in men's magazines in the 1960s and after. King's interest is found in the supernatural and macabre. The 1970s saw the rise of the postmodern short story in the works of [[Donald Barthelme]] and [[John Barth]]. Traditionalists including [[John Updike]] and [[Joyce Carol Oates]] maintained significant influence on the form. [[Minimalism]] gained widespread influence in the 1980s, most notably in the work of [[Raymond Carver]] and [[Ann Beattie]].\n\nCanadian short story writers include [[Alice Munro]], [[Mavis Gallant]], and Lynn Coady. In the year 2013 Alice Munro became the first writer of only short stories to win the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Her award-winning short story collections include ''[[Dance of the Happy Shades]], [[Lives of Girls and Women]], [[Who Do You Think You Are? (book)|Who Do You Think You Are?]], [[The Progress of Love]], [[The Love of a Good Woman]]'' and ''[[Runaway (book)|Runaway]]''. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Daphne du Maurier]] wrote [[suspense]] stories like \"[[The Birds (story)|The Birds]]\" (1952) and \"[[Don't Look Now]]\" (1971). [[Roald Dahl]] was the master of the twist-in-the-tale. Short story collections like ''Lamb to the Slaughter'' (1953) and ''[[Kiss Kiss (book)|Kiss Kiss]]'' (1960) illustrate his dark humour.\n\nSome of the [[Bengal]]i short story writers of the post-Tagore and post-Sarat Chandra generation are [[Tarasankar Bandyopadhyay]], [[Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]], [[Manik Bandyopadhyay]], [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]], [[Mahasweta Devi]], [[Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay]], [[Suchitra Bhattacharya]], [[Ramapada Chowdhury]] and [[Humayun Ahmed]]. The role of the bi-monthly magazine [[Desh (magazine)|Desh]] (first published in 1933) is imperative in the development of Bengali short story. Two of the most popular detective story writers of Bengali literature are [[Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay]] (the creator of [[Byomkesh Bakshi]]) and [[Satyajit Ray]] (the creator of [[Feluda]]). The canon of [[Hindi]] short story was enriched by the contributions of Jaishankar Prasad, Amrita Pritam, Dharamvir Bharti, Bhisham Sahni, Krishna Sobti, Nirmal Verma, Kamleshwar, Mannu Bhandari, Harishankar Parsai and others. \n\nIn Italy, [[Italo Calvino]] published the short story collection ''[[Marcovaldo]]'', about a poor man in a city, in 1963.\n\nIn Brazil, the short story became popular among female writers like [[Clarice Lispector]], [[Lygia Fagundes Telles]], [[Ad\u00e9lia Prado]], who wrote about their society from a feminine viewpoint, although the genre has great male writers like [[Dalton Trevisan]], [[Autran Dourado]] [[Moacyr Scliar]] and [[Carlos Heitor Cony]] too. Also, writing about poverty and the [[favela]]s, [[Jo\u00e3o Antonio]] became a well known writer. Other post-modern short fiction authors include writers [[Hilda Hilst]] and [[Caio Fernando Abreu]]. Detective literature was led by [[Rubem Fonseca]]. It is also necessary to mention [[Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa]], wrote short stories in the book ''Sagarana'' using a complex, experimental language based on tales of oral traditional.\n\nPortuguese writers like [[Verg\u00edlio Ferreira]], [[Fernando Goncalves Namora]] and [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]] are among the most influential short story writers from 20th-century Portuguese language literature. [[Manuel da Silva Ramos]] is one of the most well-known names of [[postmodernism]] in the country. [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]] published few short stories, but became popular from his novels.\n\nThe [[Angloa|Angolan]] writer [[Jos\u00e9 Luandino Vieira]] is one of the most well-known writers from his country and has several short stories. [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa]] is also increasingly read in Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\n[[Republic of Mozambique|Mozambican]] [[Mia Couto]] is a widely known writer of post modern prose, and he is read even in non-Portuguese speaking countries. Other Mozambican writers such as [[Suleiman Cassamo]], [[Paulina Chiziane]] and [[Eduardo White]] are gaining popularity with Portuguese-speakers too.\n\nThe [[Argentine]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in the [[Spanish language]]. \"[[The Library of Babel]]\" (1941) and \"[[The Aleph (short story)|The Aleph]]\" (1945) handle difficult subjects like [[infinity]]. Two of the most representative writers of the [[Magical realism]] genre are also widely known Argentinian short story writers: [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] and [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]].\n\nThe [[Uruguay]]an writer [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] is known as one of the most important magical realist writer from Latin America.\n\nIn [[Colombia]], the [[Nobel prize]] laureate author [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] is the main novelist and short story writer, known by his magical realist stories and his defense of the [[Colombian Communist Party|Communist Party]] in his country.\n\nThe [[Peruvian]] writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], also a [[Nobel prize]] winner, has significant short story works.\n\nThe [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Nobel Prize]]-winner [[Naguib Mahfouz]] is the most well-known author from his country, but has only a few short stories.\n\nJapanese world-known short story writers include [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] ([[Nobel prize]] winner of 1994), [[Yukio Mishima]] and [[Haruki Murakami]].\n\nMulti-awarded [[Philippine]] writer [[Peter Solis Nery]] is one of the most famous writers of short stories in [[Hiligaynon language]]. His stories \"Lirio\" (1998), \"Candido\" (2007), \"Donato Bugtot\" (2011), and \"Si Padre Olan kag ang Dios\" (2013) are all gold prize winners at the [[Palanca Awards]] of [[Philippine Literature]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\nAs a concentrated, concise form of [[Narrative structure|narrative]] and descriptive prose fiction, the short story has been theorized through the traditional elements of [[dramatic structure]]: '''exposition''' (the introduction of setting, situation and main characters), '''complication''' (the event that introduces the conflict), [[rising action]], '''crisis''' (the decisive moment for the protagonist and his commitment to a course of action), '''climax''' (the point of highest interest in terms of the conflict and the point with the most action) and '''resolution''' (the point when the conflict is resolved). Because of their length, short stories may or may not follow this pattern. For example, modern short stories only occasionally have an exposition, more typically beginning in the middle of the action (''[[in medias res]]''). As with longer stories, plots of short stories also have a climax, crisis, or turning point. However, the endings of many short stories are abrupt and open and may or may not have a moral or practical lesson. As with any art form, the exact characteristics of a short story will vary by creator.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anthology]]\n* [[Conte cruel]]\n* [[Drabble]]\n* [[Essay]]\n* [[Flash fiction]] (also called microfiction)\n* [[Irish short story]]\n* [[Literary journal]]\n* [[Minisaga|Mini saga]]\n* [[Novella]]\n* [[Sketch story]]\n* [[Tall tale]]\n* [[Vignette (literature)|Vignette]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |editor=Browns, Julie |title=Ethnicity and the American Short Story |publisher=New York: Garland |year=1997 }}\n* {{cite book | author =Goyet, Florence |title=The Classic Short Story, 1870\u20131925: Theory of a Genre |publisher=Cambridge: Open Book Publishers|year=2014 |url=http://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/199}}\n* {{cite book |editor=Gelfant, Blanche |editor2=Lawrence Graver |title=The Columbia Companion to the Twentieth-Century American Short Story |url=https://archive.org/details/columbiacompanio00blan |url-access=registration |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2000}}\n* {{cite book |editor=Hart, James |editor2=Phillip Leininger |title=Oxford Companion to American Literature |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompanionthart |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995}}\n* {{cite book |editor=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Jos\u00e9 R |editor2=Jos\u00e9 Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez |editor3=Carmen M.

The Vlaams Blok then refounded itself as Vlaams Belang, with some changes to the more controversial portions of its statute.<ref name=JanErk>http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/Jan%20Erk%20-%20From%20Vlaams%20Blok%20to%20Vlaams%20belang.pdf</ref> It has since sought to change its image from a radical to a more [[Conservativism|conservative]] party, and has distanced itself from some of its former programs.<ref name=wt/> Nonetheless, most other parties have continued the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' which was originally agreed on against the former party, effectively blocking the Vlaams Belang from taking part in government at any level. Additionally, attempts on cutting public subsidies specifically for the party were made through the Belgian [[draining law]].\n\nLike its ''Vlaams Blok'' predecessor, Vlaams Belang was initially popular with the Flemish electorate and was one of the most successful national-populist parties in Europe. However, from 2008 the party experienced a downturn in support and membership which coincided with the rise of the more moderate nationalist [[New Flemish Alliance]] party. Under the current leadership of [[Tom Van Grieken]] the VB has begun to regain popular support. Following [[2019 Belgian federal election|2019 federal elections]], there has been some media speculation that the cordon sanitaire on the party may be lifted for the first time. On the thirteenth of September 2019 a new survey made Vlaams Belang the largest party in Flanders with 24.9%.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background, Vlaams Blok ===\n{{Main|Vlaams Blok}}\nThe direct predecessor of the Vlaams Belang was the Vlaams Blok, which was formed by the nationalist right-wing of the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] which had emerged in the late 1970s. The ideology of the Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People's Union compromise on the Flemish autonomy issue, and later increasingly focused on immigration and security, exploitation of political scandals, and defense of traditional values.<ref name=dw2>De Winter, 2004, p. 2.</ref> The immigration positions of the Vlaams Blok were subject to much controversy, and the party was forced to disband in 2004 after a political trial ruled that it sanctioned discrimination.<ref name=l98/> By then, the party was the most popular Flemish party, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate,<ref name=dw6>De Winter, 2004, p. 6.</ref> and was one of the most successful parties considered to be [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] in Europe as a whole.<ref>Coff\u00e9, 2005, p. 205.</ref>\n\nIn Belgium in 2001, [[Roeland Raes]], the ideologue and vice-president of Vlaams Blok, gave an interview on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis' use of gas chambers and the authenticity of [[Anne Frank|Anne Frank's]] diary. In response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,449278,00.html Belgium's far right party in Holocaust controversy], ''The Guardian'', Friday, March 9, 2001.</ref>\n\nUpon complaints filed by the governmental [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism]] and the [[Human Rights League (Dutch-speaking Belgium)|Dutch-speaking Human Rights League in Belgium]], in 2001 three non-profit organisations that in effect constituted the core of the Vlaams Blok party were charged with violation of the Law on Racism and [[xenophobia]] by assisting \"a group or organisation that clearly and repeatedly commits discrimitation or segregation,\" here the political party. By April 2004, the [[Appellate Court]] of Ghent came to a final verdict, forbidding their and the party's continued existence for its \"repeated incitement to discrimination.\" In November that year, the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] rejected their last appeal to annul the verdict; the delay had allowed using the name Vlaams Blok for [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|election candidacy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/blok-versus-liga-geen-proces-over-bevoegdheid-beroepshof.aspx?artikel=90a621e8-2d42-4358-9edc-79b137de43fe|title=Blok versus Liga: geen proces over bevoegdheid beroepshof|work=[[Het Belang van Limburg]]|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=12 January 2011|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref name=\"CVandenWyngaert1\">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THohY9EjmPMC&pg=PA161&lpg=PA162|title=Strafrecht, strafprocesrecht en internationaal strafrecht|pages=161\u2013162|first=C.|last=Van den Wyngaert|publisher=Maklu|year=2006|isbn=978-90-466-0065-8}}</ref>\n\n===Vlaams Belang (2004\u20132008)===\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, the leadership of the VB seized the occasion to dissolve itself, and start afresh under a new name.<ref>Coff\u00e9, 2005, p. 216.</ref> On 14 November, the Vlaams Blok thus disbanded itself, and the Vlaams Belang was established.

The Vlaams Blok then refounded itself as Vlaams Belang, with some changes to the more controversial portions of its statute.<ref name=JanErk>http://media.leidenuniv.nl/legacy/Jan%20Erk%20-%20From%20Vlaams%20Blok%20to%20Vlaams%20belang.pdf</ref> It has since sought to change its image from a radical to a more [[Conservativism|conservative]] party, and has distanced itself from some of its former programs.<ref name=wt/> Nonetheless, most other parties have continued the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' which was originally agreed on against the former party, effectively blocking the Vlaams Belang from taking part in government at any level. Additionally, attempts on cutting public subsidies specifically for the party were made through the Belgian [[draining law]].\n\nLike its ''Vlaams Blok'' predecessor, Vlaams Belang was initially popular with the Flemish electorate and was one of the most successful national-populist parties in Europe. However, from 2008 the party experienced a downturn in support and membership which coincided with the rise of the more moderate nationalist [[New Flemish Alliance]] party. Under the current leadership of [[Tom Van Grieken]] the VB has begun to regain popular support. Following [[2019 Belgian federal election|2019 federal elections]], there has been some media speculation that the cordon sanitaire on the party may be lifted for the first time. On the thirteenth of September 2019 a new survey made Vlaams Belang the largest party in Flanders with 24.9%.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background, Vlaams Blok ===\n{{Main|Vlaams Blok}}\nThe direct predecessor of the Vlaams Belang was the Vlaams Blok, which was formed by the nationalist right-wing of the [[People's Union (Belgium)|People's Union]] which had emerged in the late 1970s. The ideology of the Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People's Union compromise on the Flemish autonomy issue, and later increasingly focused on immigration and security, exploitation of political scandals, and defense of traditional values.<ref name=dw2>De Winter, 2004, p. 2.</ref> The immigration positions of the Vlaams Blok were subject to much controversy, and the party was forced to disband in 2004 after a political trial ruled that it sanctioned discrimination.<ref name=l98/> By then, the party was the most popular Flemish party, supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate,<ref name=dw6>De Winter, 2004, p. 6.</ref> and was one of the most successful parties considered to be [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] in Europe as a whole.<ref>Coff\u00e9, 2005, p. 205.</ref>\n\nIn Belgium in 2001, [[Roeland Raes]], the ideologue and vice-president of Vlaams Blok, gave an interview on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis' use of gas chambers and the authenticity of [[Anne Frank|Anne Frank's]] diary. In response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,449278,00.html Belgium's far right party in Holocaust controversy], ''The Guardian'', Friday, March 9, 2001.</ref>\n\nUpon complaints filed by the governmental [[Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism]] and the [[Human Rights League (Dutch-speaking Belgium)|Dutch-speaking Human Rights League in Belgium]], in 2001 three non-profit organisations that in effect constituted the core of the Vlaams Blok party were charged with violation of the Law on Racism and [[xenophobia]] by assisting \"a group or organisation that clearly and repeatedly commits discrimitation or segregation,\" here the political party. By April 2004, the [[Appellate Court]] of Ghent came to a final verdict, forbidding their and the party's continued existence for its \"repeated incitement to discrimination.\" In November that year, the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] rejected their last appeal to annul the verdict; the delay had allowed using the name Vlaams Blok for [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|election candidacy]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hbvl.be/Archief/guid/blok-versus-liga-geen-proces-over-bevoegdheid-beroepshof.aspx?artikel=90a621e8-2d42-4358-9edc-79b137de43fe|title=Blok versus Liga: geen proces over bevoegdheid beroepshof|work=[[Het Belang van Limburg]]|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=12 January 2011|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref name=\"CVandenWyngaert1\">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THohY9EjmPMC&pg=PA161&lpg=PA162|title=Strafrecht, strafprocesrecht en internationaal strafrecht|pages=161\u2013162|first=C.|last=Van den Wyngaert|publisher=Maklu|year=2006|isbn=978-90-466-0065-8}}</ref>\n\n===Vlaams Belang (2004\u20132008)===\nAfter the Supreme Court ruling, the leadership of the VB seized the occasion to dissolve itself, and start afresh under a new name.<ref>Coff\u00e9, 2005, p. 216.</ref> On 14 November, the Vlaams Blok thus disbanded itself, and the Vlaams Belang was established.

The party seeks a peaceful secession of Flanders from Belgium, citing in its program the dissolution of the [[Union between Sweden and Norway]] (1905), [[Czechoslovakia]] (1992), and the independence of [[Montenegro]] (2006) as examples that such would be possible. The reason to seek independence is given as the \"enormous cultural and political differences between Flemings and Walloons,\" and according to the party, Belgian governments are also \"paralyzed by ongoing disputes between Flemish and Walloon politicians.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vlaamsbelang.org/57/2/|work=Vlaams Belang|title=2.

He was [[Prince of Wales]] and [[heir apparent]] to the British throne for almost 60 years. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval, his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.\n\nAs king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]] and the reorganisation of the [[British Army]] after the [[Second Boer War]]. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\", but his relationship with his nephew, the [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II]], was poor. The [[Edwardian era]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[steam turbine]] propulsion and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]]. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the unelected [[House of Lords]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Edward VII (1841_\u2013_1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]], 1846]]\nEdward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|authorlink=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}</ref> He was the eldest son and second child of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

The friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged, and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives.<ref>Middlemas, p. 86; Ridley, pp. 265\u2013268</ref> Usually, Edward's outbursts of temper were short-lived, and \"after he had let himself go&nbsp;...

Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. \"To lose our eldest son\", he wrote, \"is one of those calamities one can never really get over\". Edward told Queen Victoria, \"[I would] have given my life for him, as I put no value on mine\".<ref>Middlemas, pp. 95\u201396</ref> Albert Victor was the second of Edward's children to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born.

Edward's biographer [[Philip Magnus-Allcroft|Philip Magnus]] suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping-boy for the King's general irritation with the Liberal government. Gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him [[Governor-General of South Africa]].<ref>Magnus, p. 541</ref>\n\nEdward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>Lee, vol.

The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin\".<ref name=macdonogh/> Although Edward lived a life of luxury often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects, they expected it, and his personal charm with all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\n==Constitutional crisis==\n[[File:Francis Derwent Wood - Edouard VII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust by [[Francis Derwent Wood]]]]\n[[File:Edward VII Halfpenny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Profile of Edward VII on a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], 1902]]\nIn the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the [[House of Lords]] refused to pass the \"[[People's Budget]]\" proposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister Asquith. The crisis eventually led\u2014after Edward's death\u2014to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.\n\nThe King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by [[David Lloyd George]] at [[Limehouse]].<ref>Heffer, pp. 276\u2013277; Ridley, p. 437</ref> Cabinet minister [[Winston Churchill]] publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]] and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare\u2014although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the [[First Home Rule Bill]] in 1886\u2014that he introduced his son to [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] as \"the last King of England\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 282\u2013283</ref> After the King's horse [[Minoru (horse)|Minoru]] won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: \"Now, King. You've won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!\"<ref>Magnus, p. 526</ref>\n\nIn vain, the King urged Conservative leaders [[Arthur Balfour]] and Lord Lansdowne to pass the Budget, which [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over [[Irish disestablishment]] in 1869 and the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884.<ref>Magnus, p. 534; Ridley, pp. 440\u2013441</ref> On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.<ref>Heffer, pp. 281\u2013282</ref>\n\nThe Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909, but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge<ref>Magnus, p. 536</ref> and had forbidden Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass.<ref>Heffer, pp. 283\u2013284</ref> In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered \"outrageous\" by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.<ref>Ridley, p. 443</ref>\n\nThe [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 election]] was dominated by talk of removing the Lords' veto. During the election campaign Lloyd George talked of \"guarantees\" and Asquith of \"safeguards\" that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election.<ref name=\"dnb\" /><ref>Hattersley, p. 168</ref> Balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change.<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\">Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288</ref> During the campaign the leading Conservative [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] had asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarch's views to be known in public.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\">Magnus, p. 547</ref>\n\nThe election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party, the [[Irish nationalists]]. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\"/> Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the Budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the Budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no \"guarantees\" for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.<ref>Heffer, pp. 290\u2013293</ref> \n\nThe King's [[Speech from the Throne]] on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase \"in the opinion of my advisers\" so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation.<ref>Heffer, p. 291</ref> The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the [[1911 Parliament Act]]: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\"/>). But in that debate Asquith hinted\u2014to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs\u2014that he would ask the King to break the deadlock \"in that Parliament\" (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.<ref>Heffer, p. 293</ref>\n\nBy April the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and [[Randall Davidson]], Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal \"simply disgusting\" and that the government was \"in the hands of [[John Redmond|Redmond]] & Co\". Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government's wish to create peers should be treated as formal \"ministerial advice\" (which, by convention, the monarch must obey) although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled ''in extremis'' to dismiss the government rather than take their \"advice\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 294\u2013296</ref> Esher's view has been called \"obsolete and unhelpful\".<ref>Magnus, pp. 555\u2013556</ref>\n\n==Death==\n{{main|Funeral of King Edward VII}}\n[[File:King Edward VII on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace in 1910 Wellcome V0042567.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Edward on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace by Sir Luke Fildes, 1910]]\n[[File:4125s2.ogv|thumb|[[Funeral of King Edward VII|Funeral procession of King Edward VII]], London, 1910]]\nEdward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. In 1907, a [[rodent ulcer]], a type of cancer affecting the skin next to his nose, was cured with [[radium]].<ref>Ridley, p. 409</ref> Towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from [[bronchitis]].<ref name=\"dnb\" /> He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909.<ref>Lee, vol.

The king's continued ill health was unreported, and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high.<ref name=\"dnb\" /> On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King [[George I of Greece]], in [[Corfu]] a week later on 5 May.\n\nOn 6 May, Edward suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed, saying, \"No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end.\"<ref name=\"p151\">Bentley-Cranch, p. 151</ref> Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be King [[George V]]) told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at [[Kempton Park Racecourse|Kempton Park]] that afternoon. The king replied, \"Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad\": his [[final words]].<ref name=\"dnb\" /> At 11:30&nbsp;p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.<ref name=\"p151\" />\n\nAlexandra refused to allow Edward's body to be moved for eight days afterwards, though she allowed small groups of visitors to enter his room.<ref>Ridley, p. 558</ref> On 11 May, the late king was dressed in his uniform and placed in a massive oak coffin, which was moved on 14 May to the throne room, where it was sealed and lay in state, with a guardsman standing at each corner of the bier. Despite the time that had elapsed since his death, Alexandra noted the King's body remained \"wonderfully preserved\".<ref>Ridley, pp. 560\u2013561</ref> On the morning of 17 May, the coffin was placed on a gun carriage and drawn by black horses to [[Westminster Hall]], with the new king, his family and Edward's favourite dog, [[Caesar (dog)|Caesar]], walking behind. Following a brief service, the royal family left, and the hall was opened to the public; over 400,000 people filed past the coffin over the next two days.<ref>Ridley, pp. 563\u2013565</ref> As [[Barbara Tuchman]] noted in ''[[The Guns of August]]'', [[Funeral of King Edward VII|his funeral]], held on 20 May 1910, marked \"the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last.\" A royal train conveyed the king's coffin from London to Windsor Castle, where Edward was buried at [[St George's Chapel]].<ref>Ridley, p. 568</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{further|Cultural depictions of Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Royal eponyms in Canada}}\n{{Multiple image\n|width1=180\n|image1=King Edward VII 0918.jpg\n|caption1=Statue in [[Queen Victoria Gardens, Melbourne]]\n|width2=177\n|image2=Edward Edinburgh.jpg\n|caption2=Statue outside [[Holyrood Palace]], Edinburgh\n|image3=Edward VII Front Full, Bangalore.JPG\n|caption3=[[Statue of King Edward VII, Bangalore]], India\n|footer=Statues of Edward can be found throughout the former empire.\n}}\n[[File:Edward VII memorial in St Jude's Church, Hampstead Garden Suburb.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Edward VII in [[St Jude's Church, Hampstead Garden Suburb]]]]\nBefore his accession to the throne, Edward was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history.

In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, [[George V]], was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son,<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 155</ref> and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his \"best friend and the best of fathers&nbsp;... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief\".<ref>King George V's diary, 6 May 1910.

II, p. 738</ref> he had been afraid his nephew, the [[Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]], would tip Europe into war.<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 358, 650, 664; Middlemas, pp. 176, 179; Ridley, p. 474</ref> Four years after Edward's death, World War I broke out. The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the [[Triple Entente]] between Britain, France, and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war.<ref>Ridley, p. 474</ref> Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed until 1927 by its author, [[Sidney Lee]], who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger.<ref>Ridley, p. 487</ref> Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward's personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death.<ref>Ridley, pp. 482\u2013483</ref> Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.<ref>Ridley, pp. 494\u2013495</ref>\n\nHistorian [[R. C. K. Ensor]], writing in 1936, praised the King's political personality:\n: he had in many respects great natural ability. He knew how to be both dignified and charming; he had an excellent memory; and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional. He had a store of varied, though unsystematized, knowledge gathered at first-hand through talking to all sorts of eminent men. His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.<ref>Ensor, p. 343</ref> \n\nEnsor rejects the widespread notion that the King exerted an important influence on British foreign policy, believing he gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad, with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts. Ensor thought surviving documents showed \"how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were, how little he read, and of what na\u00efve indiscretions he was capable.\"<ref>Ensor, pp. 567\u2013569</ref> Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact. As his grandson Edward VIII wrote, \"his lighter side&nbsp;... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence.\"<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 69</ref> \"He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty\", wrote J. B. Priestley.<ref>Priestley, p. 25</ref> Lord Esher wrote that Edward VII was \"kind and debonair and not undignified\u2014but too human\".<ref>Hattersley, p. 17</ref>\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 9 November&nbsp;\u2013 8 December 1841: ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Cornwall\n* 8 December 1841&nbsp;\u2013 22 January 1901: ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales\n* 22 January 1901&nbsp;\u2013 6 May 1910: ''His Majesty'' The King\n\n===Honours===\n;British honours<ref name=cp>{{citation|author=Cokayne, G.

He was [[Prince of Wales]] and [[heir apparent]] to the British throne for almost 60 years. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power, and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties, and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but despite public approval, his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.\n\nAs king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]] and the reorganisation of the [[British Army]] after the [[Second Boer War]]. He reinstituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], for which he was popularly called \"Peacemaker\", but his relationship with his nephew, the [[German Emperor]] [[Wilhelm II]], was poor. The [[Edwardian era]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[steam turbine]] propulsion and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]]. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the unelected [[House of Lords]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Edward VII (1841_\u2013_1910).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]], 1846]]\nEdward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|authorlink=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}</ref> He was the eldest son and second child of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

It was the first [[royal tour]] on which an official photographer, [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]], was in attendance. As soon as Edward returned to Britain, preparations were made for his engagement, which was sealed at [[Laeken]] in Belgium on 9 September 1862.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 44; Ridley, p. 72</ref> Edward married Alexandra of Denmark at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 10 March 1863.

They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the [[German Confederation]] took the opportunity to [[Second Schleswig War|invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein]]. The Queen was of two minds as to whether it was a suitable match, given the political climate.<ref>Middlemas, p. 35; Ridley, p. 83</ref> After the marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.<ref>Ridley, pp. 85, 87, 93, 104</ref>\n\nEdward had [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] throughout his married life.

While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], Edward contracted [[typhoid fever]], the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests ([[George Stanhope, 7th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief.<ref name=\"dnb\" /> Public celebrations included the composition of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[Festival Te Deum]].

I claim for music that it produces that union of feeling which I much desire to promote.\"<ref name=bc104/> At the same time, he enjoyed gambling and country sports and was an enthusiastic hunter. He ordered all the clocks at Sandringham to run half an hour ahead to provide more daylight time for shooting.

By the 1870s the future king had taken a keen interest in horseracing and steeplechasing. In 1896, his horse [[Persimmon (horse)|Persimmon]] won both the [[Derby Stakes]] and the [[St Leger Stakes]]. In 1900, Persimmon's brother, [[Diamond Jubilee (horse)|Diamond Jubilee]], won five races (Derby, St Leger, [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]], [[Newmarket Stakes]] and [[Eclipse Stakes]])<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 110</ref> and another of Edward's horses, Ambush II, won the [[Grand National]].<ref>Middlemas, p. 98</ref>\n[[File:Royal family group 1896.jpg|thumb|right|Edward (right) with his mother (centre) and Russian relations: [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] (left), [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] and baby [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna]], 1896]]\n\nIn 1891 Edward was embroiled in the [[royal baccarat scandal]], when it was revealed he had played an illegal card game for money the previous year.

The friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged, and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives.<ref>Middlemas, p. 86; Ridley, pp. 265\u2013268</ref> Usually, Edward's outbursts of temper were short-lived, and \"after he had let himself go&nbsp;...

Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. \"To lose our eldest son\", he wrote, \"is one of those calamities one can never really get over\". Edward told Queen Victoria, \"[I would] have given my life for him, as I put no value on mine\".<ref>Middlemas, pp. 95\u201396</ref> Albert Victor was the second of Edward's children to die. In 1871, his youngest son, Alexander John, had died just 24 hours after being born.

Sipido, though obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage.<ref>Ridley, pp. 339\u2013340</ref> The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|Belgian atrocities]] in the [[Congo Free State|Congo]], worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent.

II, pp. 91\u201393; Ridley, p. 389</ref> He supported the redesign of army command, the creation of the [[Territorial Force]], and the decision to provide an [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Expeditionary Force]] supporting France in the event of war with Germany.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 130\u2013134</ref> Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the [[Imperial German Navy]] as a new strategic threat.<ref>{{citation|last=Kennedy|first=Paul M.|authorlink=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|year=2004|pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]], who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new [[dreadnought]]s.<ref>See, principally, {{citation|last=Lambert|first=Nicholas A.|title=Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57003-492-3}} For a much shorter summary of Fisher's reforms, see {{citation|last=Grove|first=Eric J.|authorlink=Eric Grove|title=The Royal Navy since 1815|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2005|isbn=978-0-333-72126-1|pages=88\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nThe King lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 134\u2013139</ref> The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Arthur Wilson]], who had retired in 1907.<ref>Lambert, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref> Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.<ref>{{citation|last=Bradford|first=Admiral Sir Edward E.|authorlink=Edward Eden Bradford|title=Life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1923|pages=223\u2013225}}</ref>\n\nEdward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time. During his reign he said use of the word \"[[nigger]]\" was \"disgraceful\", despite it then being in common parlance.<ref>{{citation|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|title=King George V|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1983|page=65}}</ref> In 1904, during an Anglo-German summit in [[Kiel]] between Wilhelm II and Edward, Wilhelm with the Russo-Japanese War in mind started to go on about the \"[[Yellow Peril]]\", which he called \"the greatest peril menacing&nbsp;... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in [[Moscow]] and [[Poznan|Posen]]\".<ref name=macdonogh>{{citation|last=MacDonogh|first=Giles|title=The Last Kaiser|location=New York|publisher=St Martin's Press|year=2003|page=277}}</ref> Wilhelm went on to attack his British guests for supporting Japan against Russia, suggesting that the British were committing \"race treason\". In response, Edward stated that he \"could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin\".<ref name=macdonogh/> Although Edward lived a life of luxury often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects, they expected it, and his personal charm with all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\n==Constitutional crisis==\n[[File:Francis Derwent Wood - Edouard VII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust by [[Francis Derwent Wood]]]]\n[[File:Edward VII Halfpenny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Profile of Edward VII on a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]], 1902]]\nIn the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the [[House of Lords]] refused to pass the \"[[People's Budget]]\" proposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister Asquith. The crisis eventually led\u2014after Edward's death\u2014to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.\n\nThe King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemical speech by [[David Lloyd George]] at [[Limehouse]].<ref>Heffer, pp. 276\u2013277; Ridley, p. 437</ref> Cabinet minister [[Winston Churchill]] publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]] and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so dispirited at the tone of class warfare\u2014although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the [[First Home Rule Bill]] in 1886\u2014that he introduced his son to [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] as \"the last King of England\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 282\u2013283</ref> After the King's horse [[Minoru (horse)|Minoru]] won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: \"Now, King. You've won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!\"<ref>Magnus, p. 526</ref>\n\nIn vain, the King urged Conservative leaders [[Arthur Balfour]] and Lord Lansdowne to pass the Budget, which [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over [[Irish disestablishment]] in 1869 and the [[Third Reform Act]] in 1884.<ref>Magnus, p. 534; Ridley, pp. 440\u2013441</ref> On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.<ref>Heffer, pp. 281\u2013282</ref>\n\nThe Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909, but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge<ref>Magnus, p. 536</ref> and had forbidden Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass.<ref>Heffer, pp. 283\u2013284</ref> In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered \"outrageous\" by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.<ref>Ridley, p. 443</ref>\n\nThe [[January 1910 United Kingdom general election|January 1910 election]] was dominated by talk of removing the Lords' veto. During the election campaign Lloyd George talked of \"guarantees\" and Asquith of \"safeguards\" that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election.<ref name=\"dnb\" /><ref>Hattersley, p. 168</ref> Balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change.<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\">Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288</ref> During the campaign the leading Conservative [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] had asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused on the grounds that it was not appropriate for the monarch's views to be known in public.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\">Magnus, p. 547</ref>\n\nThe election resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party, the [[Irish nationalists]]. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked.<ref name=\"Magnus, p. 547\"/> Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the Budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whiskey duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the Budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no \"guarantees\" for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.<ref>Heffer, pp. 290\u2013293</ref> \n\nThe King's [[Speech from the Throne]] on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase \"in the opinion of my advisers\" so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation.<ref>Heffer, p. 291</ref> The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the [[1911 Parliament Act]]: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four<ref name=\"Heffer, pp. 286\u2013288\"/>). But in that debate Asquith hinted\u2014to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs\u2014that he would ask the King to break the deadlock \"in that Parliament\" (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.<ref>Heffer, p. 293</ref>\n\nBy April the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and [[Randall Davidson]], Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal \"simply disgusting\" and that the government was \"in the hands of [[John Redmond|Redmond]] & Co\". Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government's wish to create peers should be treated as formal \"ministerial advice\" (which, by convention, the monarch must obey) although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled ''in extremis'' to dismiss the government rather than take their \"advice\".<ref>Heffer, pp. 294\u2013296</ref> Esher's view has been called \"obsolete and unhelpful\".<ref>Magnus, pp. 555\u2013556</ref>\n\n==Death==\n{{main|Funeral of King Edward VII}}\n[[File:King Edward VII on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace in 1910 Wellcome V0042567.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Edward on his deathbed in Buckingham Palace by Sir Luke Fildes, 1910]]\n[[File:4125s2.ogv|thumb|[[Funeral of King Edward VII|Funeral procession of King Edward VII]], London, 1910]]\nEdward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day.

The king's continued ill health was unreported, and he attracted criticism for staying in France while political tensions were so high.<ref name=\"dnb\" /> On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King [[George I of Greece]], in [[Corfu]] a week later on 5 May.\n\nOn 6 May, Edward suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed, saying, \"No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end.\"<ref name=\"p151\">Bentley-Cranch, p. 151</ref> Between moments of faintness, his son the Prince of Wales (shortly to be King [[George V]]) told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at [[Kempton Park Racecourse|Kempton Park]] that afternoon. The king replied, \"Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad\": his [[final words]].<ref name=\"dnb\" /> At 11:30&nbsp;p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.<ref name=\"p151\" />\n\nAlexandra refused to allow Edward's body to be moved for eight days afterwards, though she allowed small groups of visitors to enter his room.<ref>Ridley, p. 558</ref> On 11 May, the late king was dressed in his uniform and placed in a massive oak coffin, which was moved on 14 May to the throne room, where it was sealed and lay in state, with a guardsman standing at each corner of the bier. Despite the time that had elapsed since his death, Alexandra noted the King's body remained \"wonderfully preserved\".<ref>Ridley, pp. 560\u2013561</ref> On the morning of 17 May, the coffin was placed on a gun carriage and drawn by black horses to [[Westminster Hall]], with the new king, his family and Edward's favourite dog, [[Caesar (dog)|Caesar]], walking behind. Following a brief service, the royal family left, and the hall was opened to the public; over 400,000 people filed past the coffin over the next two days.<ref>Ridley, pp. 563\u2013565</ref> As [[Barbara Tuchman]] noted in ''[[The Guns of August]]'', [[Funeral of King Edward VII|his funeral]], held on 20 May 1910, marked \"the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last.\" A royal train conveyed the king's coffin from London to Windsor Castle, where Edward was buried at [[St George's Chapel]].<ref>Ridley, p. 568</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{further|Cultural depictions of Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Royal eponyms in Canada}}\n{{Multiple image\n|width1=180\n|image1=King Edward VII 0918.jpg\n|caption1=Statue in [[Queen Victoria Gardens, Melbourne]]\n|width2=177\n|image2=Edward Edinburgh.jpg\n|caption2=Statue outside [[Holyrood Palace]], Edinburgh\n|image3=Edward VII Front Full, Bangalore.JPG\n|caption3=[[Statue of King Edward VII, Bangalore]], India\n|footer=Statues of Edward can be found throughout the former empire.\n}}\n[[File:Edward VII memorial in St Jude's Church, Hampstead Garden Suburb.jpg|thumb|Memorial to Edward VII in [[St Jude's Church, Hampstead Garden Suburb]]]]\nBefore his accession to the throne, Edward was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history.

In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, [[George V]], was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son,<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 155</ref> and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his \"best friend and the best of fathers&nbsp;... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief\".<ref>King George V's diary, 6 May 1910.

The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the [[Triple Entente]] between Britain, France, and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war.<ref>Ridley, p. 474</ref> Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed until 1927 by its author, [[Sidney Lee]], who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger.<ref>Ridley, p. 487</ref> Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward's personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death.<ref>Ridley, pp. 482\u2013483</ref> Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.<ref>Ridley, pp. 494\u2013495</ref>\n\nHistorian [[R. C. K. Ensor]], writing in 1936, praised the King's political personality:\n: he had in many respects great natural ability. He knew how to be both dignified and charming; he had an excellent memory; and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional. He had a store of varied, though unsystematized, knowledge gathered at first-hand through talking to all sorts of eminent men. His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common instincts of the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.<ref>Ensor, p. 343</ref> \n\nEnsor rejects the widespread notion that the King exerted an important influence on British foreign policy, believing he gained that reputation by making frequent trips abroad, with many highly publicized visits to foreign courts. Ensor thought surviving documents showed \"how comparatively crude his views on foreign policy were, how little he read, and of what na\u00efve indiscretions he was capable.\"<ref>Ensor, pp. 567\u2013569</ref> Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure, but he received great praise for his affable manners and diplomatic tact. As his grandson Edward VIII wrote, \"his lighter side&nbsp;... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence.\"<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 69</ref> \"He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty\", wrote J. B. Priestley.<ref>Priestley, p. 25</ref> Lord Esher wrote that Edward VII was \"kind and debonair and not undignified\u2014but too human\".<ref>Hattersley, p. 17</ref>\n\n==Titles, styles, honours and arms==\n\n===Titles and styles===\n* 9 November&nbsp;\u2013 8 December 1841: ''His Royal Highness'' The Duke of Cornwall\n* 8 December 1841&nbsp;\u2013 22 January 1901: ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince of Wales\n* 22 January 1901&nbsp;\u2013 6 May 1910: ''His Majesty'' The King\n\n===Honours===\n;British honours<ref name=cp>{{citation|author=Cokayne, G.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day.

Her [[sobriquet]] means 'Lydia of the Dawn' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. It was given to her by the writer [[Carl Robert Jakobson]]. She is also frequently referred to as ''Koidulaulik'' \u2013 'Singer of the Dawn'.\n\nIn Estonia, like elsewhere in Europe, writing was not considered a suitable career for a respectable young lady in the mid-nineteenth-century. Koidula's poetry and her newspaper work for her populist father, [[Johann Voldemar Jannsen]] (1819\u20131890) remained anonymous. In spite of this, she was a major literary figure, the founder of [[Estonian theatre]], and closely allied to [[Carl Robert Jakobson]] (1841\u20131882), the influential radical and [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] (1803\u20131882), writer of the Estonian national epic, ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'' (''The Son of Kalev'').\n\n==Biography==\nLydia Jannsen was born in [[V\u00e4ndra|Fennern]] (present-day V\u00e4ndra),  [[Governorate of Livonia]], [[Russian Empire]]. The family moved to the nearby county town of [[P\u00e4rnu|Pernau]] (present-day P\u00e4rnu) in 1850 where, in 1857, her father started the first local [[Estonian language]] newspaper and where Lydia attended the German grammar school. The Jannsens moved to the university town of [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (present-day Tartu) in 1864. [[Nationalism]], including publication in indigenous languages, was a very touchy subject in the [[Russian Empire]] but the rule of the Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (1855\u20131881) was relatively liberal and Jannsen managed to persuade the imperial censorship to allow him to publish the first national Estonian language newspaper in 1864.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Estonians : the long road to Independence|last=Gunter.|first=Faure|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|others=Mensing, Teresa.|isbn=978-1105530036|location=London|pages=145\u2013146|oclc=868958072}}</ref> Both the P\u00e4rnu local and the national newspaper were called ''[[Postimees]]'' (''The Courier''). Lydia wrote for her father on both papers besides publishing her own work. In 1873 she married Eduard Michelson, a Livonian army physician, and moved to [[Kronstadt]], the headquarters of the Russian navy near [[St. Petersburg]]. In 1876\u201378 the Michelsons visited [[Breslau]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Vienna]]. Koidula lived in Kronstadt for 13 years but despite spending her summers in Estonia, she never stopped feeling inconsolably homesick. Lydia Koidula was the mother of three children. She died from breast cancer on 11 August 1886. Her last poem was ''Enne surma- Eestimaale!'' (''Before Death, To Estonia!'').\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Lydia Koidula portrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lydia Koidula. Same image was used on an [[Estonian kroon|Estonian banknote]]]]\n\nKoidula's most important work, ''Emaj\u00f5e \u00d6\u00f6bik'', (''The Nightingale of the [[Emaj\u00f5gi]] [the Mother River]''), was published in 1867.<ref name=\":0\" /> Three years earlier, in 1864, Adam Peterson, a farmer, and [[Johann K\u00f6ler]], a fashionable Estonian portraitist living in Saint Petersburg, had petitioned the Emperor for better treatment from the German landlords who ruled the Baltics, equality and for the language of education to be Estonian. Immediately afterwards they were taken to the police where they were interrogated about a petition that 'included false information and was directed against the state'. Adam Peterson was sentenced to imprisonment for a year. Two years later, in 1866, the censorship reforms of 1855 that had given Koidula's father a window to start ''[[Postimees]]'' were reversed. Pre-publication censorship was re-imposed and literary freedom was curtailed. This was the political and literary climate when Koidula started to publish. Nevertheless, it was also the time of the national awakening when the Estonian people, freed from serfdom in 1816, were beginning to feel a sense of pride in nationhood and to aspire to self-determination. Koidula was the most articulate voice of these aspirations.\n\nGerman influence in Koidula's work was unavoidable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.estonica.org/en/Culture/Literature/Baltic_German_literature_and_its_impact/|title=Estonica.org - Baltic German literature and its impact|website=www.estonica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref> The [[Baltic Germans]] had retained hegemony in the region since the 13th century, throughout German, Polish, Swedish and Russian rule and thus German was the language of tuition and of the intelligentsia in 19th century Estonia. Like her father (and all other Estonian writers at the time) Koidula translated much sentimental German prose, poetry and drama and there is a particular influence of the [[Biedermeier]] movement. Biedermeier, a style which dominated 'bourgeois' art in continental Europe from 1815 to 1848, developed in the wake of the suppression of revolutionary ideas following the defeat of Napoleon. It was plain, unpretentious and characterised by pastoral romanticism; its themes were the home, the family, religion and scenes of rural life. The themes of Koidula's early ''Vainulilled'' (''Meadow Flowers''; 1866) were certainly proto-Biedermeier, but her delicate, melodic treatment of them was in no way rustic or unsophisticated, as demonstrated in the unrestrained patriotic outpourings of ''Emaj\u00f5e \u00d6\u00f6bik''. Koidula reacted to the historical subjugation of the Estonian people as to a personal affront; she spoke of slavery and the yoke of subordination as if from personal experience. By the time of the [[Estonian Age of Awakening|National Awakening in the 1860s]], Estonia had been ruled by foreign powers \u2013 Danish, German, Swedish, Polish and Russian \u2013 for over 600 years. In this context, she was conscious of her own role in the destiny of the nation.  She once wrote to a Finnish correspondent: \"It is a sin, a great sin, to be little in great times when a person can actually make history\".\n\nThe Estonian literary tradition started by Kreutzwald continued with Koidula but whereas ''The Bard of [[Virumaa|Viru]]'' tried to imitate the ''regiv\u00e4rss'' folk traditions of ancient Estonian, Koidula wrote (mostly) in modern, [[Western Europe]]an end-rhyming metres that had, by the mid 19th century, become the dominant form. This made Koidula's poetry much more accessible to the popular reader. But the major importance of Koidula lay not so much in her preferred form of verse but in her potent use of the Estonian language. Estonian was, still, in the 1860s, in a German dominated Baltic province of [[Imperial Russia]], the language of the oppressed indigenous peasantry. It was still the subject of orthographical bickering, still used in the main for predominantly patronising educationalist or religious texts, practical advice to farmers or cheap and cheerful popular story telling. Koidula successfully used the vernacular language to express emotions that ranged from an affectionate poem about the family cat, in ''Meie kass'' (''Our Cat'') and delicate love poetry, ''Head \u00f6\u00f6d'' (''Good Night'') to a powerful ''cri de coeur'' and rallying call to an oppressed nation, ''Mu isamaa nad olid matnud'' (''My Country, They Have Buried You''). With Lydia Koidula, the colonial view that the Estonian language was an underdeveloped instrument for communication was, for the first time, demonstrably contradicted.\n\n==Drama==\n[[Image:Lydia Koidula Memorial Stone.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Memorial stone for Lydia Koidula at her birthplace near [[V\u00e4ndra]]]]\n\nKoidula is also considered the \"founder of Estonian theatre\" through her drama activities at the [[Vanemuine|Vanemuine Society]] (Estonian: ''Vanemuise Selts''), a society started by the Jannsens in [[Tartu]] in 1865 to promote Estonian culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kocur.uni.wroc.pl/ljubov-vassiljeva-the-origins-of-theatre-in-estonia/|title=Ljubov Vassiljeva, The Origins of Theatre in Estonia \u2013 Mirek Kocur|website=kocur.uni.wroc.pl|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref> Lydia was the first to write original plays in Estonian and to address the practicalities of stage direction and production. Despite some Estonian interludes at the German theatre in [[Tallinn]], in the early 19th century, there had been no appreciation of theatre as a medium and few writers considered drama of any consequence, though Kreutzwald had translated two verse tragedies. In the late 1860s, both Estonians and Finns started to develop performances in their native tongues and Koidula, following suit, wrote and directed the comedy, ''Saaremaa Onupoeg'' (''The Cousin from [[Saaremaa]]'') in 1870 for the Vanemuine Society. It was based on [[Theodor K\u00f6rner (author)|Theodor K\u00f6rner]]'s (1791\u20131813) farce ''Der Vetter aus Bremen'', (''The Cousin from Bremen'') adapted to an Estonian situation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new theatre of the Baltics : from Soviet to Western influence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania|last=1954-|first=Johnson, Jeff|date=2007|publisher=McFarland & Co|isbn=9780786429929|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=93|oclc=76786725}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanemuine.ee/theatre-vanemuine/?lang=en|title=Theatre Vanemuine - Teater Vanemuine|work=Teater Vanemuine|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}</ref> The characterisation was rudimentary and the plot was simple but it was popular and Koidula went on to write and direct ''Maret ja Miina,'' (aka ''Kosjakased''; ''The Betrothal Birches'', 1870) and her own creation, the first ever completely Estonian play, ''S\u00e4\u00e4rane mulk'' (''What a Bumpkin!''). Koidula's attitude to the theatre was influenced by the philosopher, dramatist, and critic [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729\u20131781), the author of ''Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''The Education of the Human Race''; 1780).  Her plays were didactic and a vehicle for popular education. Koidula's theatrical resources were few and raw \u2013 untrained, amateur actors and women played by men \u2013 but the qualities that impressed her contemporaries were a gallery of believable characters and cognizance of contemporary situations.\n\nAt the first [[Estonian Song Festival]], in 1869, an important rallying event of the Estonian clans, two poems were set to music with lyrics by Lydia Koidula: ''Sind Surmani'' (''Till Death'') and ''[[My Country is My Love|Mu isamaa on minu arm]]'' (''My Country is My Love''), which became the unofficial anthem during the [[Occupation of Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] when her father's ''[[Mu isamaa, mu \u00f5nn ja r\u00f5\u00f5m]]'' (''My Country is My Pride and Joy''), the anthem of the Estonian Republic between 1921 and 1940, was forbidden. Koidula's song always finished every festival, with or without permission. The tradition persists to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://enrs.eu/pl/articles/1576-revolution-by-song-choral-singing-and-political-change-in-estonia|title=Revolution by Song: Choral Singing and Political Change in Estonia|last=Jaworowska|first=Jagna|website=enrs.eu|language=pl-pl|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802193208/http://enrs.eu/pl/articles/1576-revolution-by-song-choral-singing-and-political-change-in-estonia|archive-date=2018-08-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Memorial Museum of Lydia Koidula==\n[[File:Lydia Koidula monument1.jpg|thumb|Monument to Lydia Koidula in [[P\u00e4rnu]] created by [[Amandus Adamson]].]]\nA branch of the [[P\u00e4rnu]] Museum, the museum gives an overview of the life and work of poet Lydia Koidula and her father Johann Voldemar Jannsen (author of the lyrics of Estonian anthem), important figures in Estonian national awakening period in the 19th century.\n\nThe Koidula museum is located in the [[P\u00e4rnu \u00dclej\u00f5e G\u00fcmnaasium|P\u00e4rnu \u00dclej\u00f5e]] schoolhouse.

Her [[sobriquet]] means 'Lydia of the Dawn' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. It was given to her by the writer [[Carl Robert Jakobson]]. She is also frequently referred to as ''Koidulaulik'' \u2013 'Singer of the Dawn'.\n\nIn Estonia, like elsewhere in Europe, writing was not considered a suitable career for a respectable young lady in the mid-nineteenth-century. Koidula's poetry and her newspaper work for her populist father, [[Johann Voldemar Jannsen]] (1819\u20131890) remained anonymous. In spite of this, she was a major literary figure, the founder of [[Estonian theatre]], and closely allied to [[Carl Robert Jakobson]] (1841\u20131882), the influential radical and [[Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald]] (1803\u20131882), writer of the Estonian national epic, ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'' (''The Son of Kalev'').\n\n==Biography==\nLydia Jannsen was born in [[V\u00e4ndra|Fennern]] (present-day V\u00e4ndra),  [[Governorate of Livonia]], [[Russian Empire]]. The family moved to the nearby county town of [[P\u00e4rnu|Pernau]] (present-day P\u00e4rnu) in 1850 where, in 1857, her father started the first local [[Estonian language]] newspaper and where Lydia attended the German grammar school. The Jannsens moved to the university town of [[Tartu|Dorpat]] (present-day Tartu) in 1864. [[Nationalism]], including publication in indigenous languages, was a very touchy subject in the [[Russian Empire]] but the rule of the Emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] (1855\u20131881) was relatively liberal and Jannsen managed to persuade the imperial censorship to allow him to publish the first national Estonian language newspaper in 1864.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Estonians : the long road to Independence|last=Gunter.|first=Faure|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|others=Mensing, Teresa.|isbn=978-1105530036|location=London|pages=145\u2013146|oclc=868958072}}</ref> Both the P\u00e4rnu local and the national newspaper were called ''[[Postimees]]'' (''The Courier''). Lydia wrote for her father on both papers besides publishing her own work. In 1873 she married Eduard Michelson, a Livonian army physician, and moved to [[Kronstadt]], the headquarters of the Russian navy near [[St. Petersburg]]. In 1876\u201378 the Michelsons visited [[Breslau]], [[Strasbourg]] and [[Vienna]]. Koidula lived in Kronstadt for 13 years but despite spending her summers in Estonia, she never stopped feeling inconsolably homesick. Lydia Koidula was the mother of three children. She died from breast cancer on 11 August 1886. Her last poem was ''Enne surma- Eestimaale!'' (''Before Death, To Estonia!'').\n\n==Works==\n[[Image:Lydia Koidula portrait.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lydia Koidula. Same image was used on an [[Estonian kroon|Estonian banknote]]]]\n\nKoidula's most important work, ''Emaj\u00f5e \u00d6\u00f6bik'', (''The Nightingale of the [[Emaj\u00f5gi]] [the Mother River]''), was published in 1867.<ref name=\":0\" /> Three years earlier, in 1864, Adam Peterson, a farmer, and [[Johann K\u00f6ler]], a fashionable Estonian portraitist living in Saint Petersburg, had petitioned the Emperor for better treatment from the German landlords who ruled the Baltics, equality and for the language of education to be Estonian. Immediately afterwards they were taken to the police where they were interrogated about a petition that 'included false information and was directed against the state'. Adam Peterson was sentenced to imprisonment for a year. Two years later, in 1866, the censorship reforms of 1855 that had given Koidula's father a window to start ''[[Postimees]]'' were reversed. Pre-publication censorship was re-imposed and literary freedom was curtailed. This was the political and literary climate when Koidula started to publish. Nevertheless, it was also the time of the national awakening when the Estonian people, freed from serfdom in 1816, were beginning to feel a sense of pride in nationhood and to aspire to self-determination. Koidula was the most articulate voice of these aspirations.\n\nGerman influence in Koidula's work was unavoidable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.estonica.org/en/Culture/Literature/Baltic_German_literature_and_its_impact/|title=Estonica.org - Baltic German literature and its impact|website=www.estonica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref> The [[Baltic Germans]] had retained hegemony in the region since the 13th century, throughout German, Polish, Swedish and Russian rule and thus German was the language of tuition and of the intelligentsia in 19th century Estonia. Like her father (and all other Estonian writers at the time) Koidula translated much sentimental German prose, poetry and drama and there is a particular influence of the [[Biedermeier]] movement. Biedermeier, a style which dominated 'bourgeois' art in continental Europe from 1815 to 1848, developed in the wake of the suppression of revolutionary ideas following the defeat of Napoleon. It was plain, unpretentious and characterised by pastoral romanticism; its themes were the home, the family, religion and scenes of rural life. The themes of Koidula's early ''Vainulilled'' (''Meadow Flowers''; 1866) were certainly proto-Biedermeier, but her delicate, melodic treatment of them was in no way rustic or unsophisticated, as demonstrated in the unrestrained patriotic outpourings of ''Emaj\u00f5e \u00d6\u00f6bik''. Koidula reacted to the historical subjugation of the Estonian people as to a personal affront; she spoke of slavery and the yoke of subordination as if from personal experience. By the time of the [[Estonian Age of Awakening|National Awakening in the 1860s]], Estonia had been ruled by foreign powers \u2013 Danish, German, Swedish, Polish and Russian \u2013 for over 600 years. In this context, she was conscious of her own role in the destiny of the nation.  She once wrote to a Finnish correspondent: \"It is a sin, a great sin, to be little in great times when a person can actually make history\".\n\nThe Estonian literary tradition started by Kreutzwald continued with Koidula but whereas ''The Bard of [[Virumaa|Viru]]'' tried to imitate the ''regiv\u00e4rss'' folk traditions of ancient Estonian, Koidula wrote (mostly) in modern, [[Western Europe]]an end-rhyming metres that had, by the mid 19th century, become the dominant form. This made Koidula's poetry much more accessible to the popular reader. But the major importance of Koidula lay not so much in her preferred form of verse but in her potent use of the Estonian language. Estonian was, still, in the 1860s, in a German dominated Baltic province of [[Imperial Russia]], the language of the oppressed indigenous peasantry. It was still the subject of orthographical bickering, still used in the main for predominantly patronising educationalist or religious texts, practical advice to farmers or cheap and cheerful popular story telling. Koidula successfully used the vernacular language to express emotions that ranged from an affectionate poem about the family cat, in ''Meie kass'' (''Our Cat'') and delicate love poetry, ''Head \u00f6\u00f6d'' (''Good Night'') to a powerful ''cri de coeur'' and rallying call to an oppressed nation, ''Mu isamaa nad olid matnud'' (''My Country, They Have Buried You''). With Lydia Koidula, the colonial view that the Estonian language was an underdeveloped instrument for communication was, for the first time, demonstrably contradicted.\n\n==Drama==\n[[Image:Lydia Koidula Memorial Stone.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Memorial stone for Lydia Koidula at her birthplace near [[V\u00e4ndra]]]]\n\nKoidula is also considered the \"founder of Estonian theatre\" through her drama activities at the [[Vanemuine|Vanemuine Society]] (Estonian: ''Vanemuise Selts''), a society started by the Jannsens in [[Tartu]] in 1865 to promote Estonian culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kocur.uni.wroc.pl/ljubov-vassiljeva-the-origins-of-theatre-in-estonia/|title=Ljubov Vassiljeva, The Origins of Theatre in Estonia \u2013 Mirek Kocur|website=kocur.uni.wroc.pl|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref> Lydia was the first to write original plays in Estonian and to address the practicalities of stage direction and production. Despite some Estonian interludes at the German theatre in [[Tallinn]], in the early 19th century, there had been no appreciation of theatre as a medium and few writers considered drama of any consequence, though Kreutzwald had translated two verse tragedies. In the late 1860s, both Estonians and Finns started to develop performances in their native tongues and Koidula, following suit, wrote and directed the comedy, ''Saaremaa Onupoeg'' (''The Cousin from [[Saaremaa]]'') in 1870 for the Vanemuine Society. It was based on [[Theodor K\u00f6rner (author)|Theodor K\u00f6rner]]'s (1791\u20131813) farce ''Der Vetter aus Bremen'', (''The Cousin from Bremen'') adapted to an Estonian situation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The new theatre of the Baltics : from Soviet to Western influence in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania|last=1954-|first=Johnson, Jeff|date=2007|publisher=McFarland & Co|isbn=9780786429929|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=93|oclc=76786725}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanemuine.ee/theatre-vanemuine/?lang=en|title=Theatre Vanemuine - Teater Vanemuine|work=Teater Vanemuine|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}</ref> The characterisation was rudimentary and the plot was simple but it was popular and Koidula went on to write and direct ''Maret ja Miina,'' (aka ''Kosjakased''; ''The Betrothal Birches'', 1870) and her own creation, the first ever completely Estonian play, ''S\u00e4\u00e4rane mulk'' (''What a Bumpkin!''). Koidula's attitude to the theatre was influenced by the philosopher, dramatist, and critic [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729\u20131781), the author of ''Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''The Education of the Human Race''; 1780).  Her plays were didactic and a vehicle for popular education. Koidula's theatrical resources were few and raw \u2013 untrained, amateur actors and women played by men \u2013 but the qualities that impressed her contemporaries were a gallery of believable characters and cognizance of contemporary situations.\n\nAt the first [[Estonian Song Festival]], in 1869, an important rallying event of the Estonian clans, two poems were set to music with lyrics by Lydia Koidula: ''Sind Surmani'' (''Till Death'') and ''[[My Country is My Love|Mu isamaa on minu arm]]'' (''My Country is My Love''), which became the unofficial anthem during the [[Occupation of Baltic states|Soviet occupation]] when her father's ''[[Mu isamaa, mu \u00f5nn ja r\u00f5\u00f5m]]'' (''My Country is My Pride and Joy''), the anthem of the Estonian Republic between 1921 and 1940, was forbidden. Koidula's song always finished every festival, with or without permission. The tradition persists to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://enrs.eu/pl/articles/1576-revolution-by-song-choral-singing-and-political-change-in-estonia|title=Revolution by Song: Choral Singing and Political Change in Estonia|last=Jaworowska|first=Jagna|website=enrs.eu|language=pl-pl|access-date=2018-03-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802193208/http://enrs.eu/pl/articles/1576-revolution-by-song-choral-singing-and-political-change-in-estonia|archive-date=2018-08-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Memorial Museum of Lydia Koidula==\n[[File:Lydia Koidula monument1.jpg|thumb|Monument to Lydia Koidula in [[P\u00e4rnu]] created by [[Amandus Adamson]].]]\nA branch of the [[P\u00e4rnu]] Museum, the museum gives an overview of the life and work of poet Lydia Koidula and her father Johann Voldemar Jannsen (author of the lyrics of Estonian anthem), important figures in Estonian national awakening period in the 19th century.\n\nThe Koidula museum is located in the [[P\u00e4rnu \u00dclej\u00f5e G\u00fcmnaasium|P\u00e4rnu \u00dclej\u00f5e]] schoolhouse.
