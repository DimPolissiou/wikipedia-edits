Aizu Kage-ry\u016b was transmitted to founder by Murakami Itt\u014d. He came to [[Yanagawa]] domain from [[\u014coka clan|\u014coka domain]]. He taught Aizu Kage-ry\u016b kenjutsu, Oshima-ry\u016b [[s\u014djutsu]] (use of [[spear]]) and Okuyama Shinkan-ry\u016b [[jujutsu]]. One of his student was Oishi Yuken who was a grandfather of Oishi Susumu. Oishi Yuken taught Oishi Susumu his kenjutsu and s\u014djutsu arts. Both Susumu's grandfather and his father were instructors of Yanagawa domain.\n\nOishi Susumu improved the protective gear used during practice. In addition, he improved ''[[fukuro shinai]]'' (bamboo sword covered with leather) to a modern bamboo sword. He devised stab technique, and a technique of striking one's opponent's breastplate. He was said to be five foot eleven inches tall (1.8 meters), a great height for a Japanese of his day. Therefore, his style of swordsmanship uses longer bamboo practice swords than most other styles. There are stories of him engaging in combat around Japan using his four ''[[shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' ''[[shinai]]'' (about 121&nbsp;cm).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hayakutake |first=Colin |title=Kage-ryu |year=1995 |publisher=Aikido Journal #104, 1995 }}</ref>\n\nBy the order of his feudal lord, he went to the capital city, [[Edo]] in 1832. In the next year, he did kenjutsu matches with many famous instructors. After Oishi Susumu, his son, also named Oishi Susume, inherited the school. Because the latter didn\u2019t have a son, his younger brother, Oishi Yukie was placed as the [[S\u014dke|headmaster]] of the ry\u016b. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], they didn\u2019t practice swordsmanship for some time, but the school survived still. When Oishi Yukie died, his son, Oishi Hajime was young, so Itai Masumi, the pupil of Oishi Yukie protected the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b. After Oishi Hajime grew up, he inherited his father's martial art. He taught the ry\u016b to his grandson, Oishi Eiichi. And Oishi Eiichi taught the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b to Morimoto Kunio. Morimoto Kunio was given [[menkyo kaiden]] (a teaching license) and is currently teaching the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b.\n\n== Lineage ==\n\nEarly history pre-dating Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b:\n# Aizu Ik\u014dsai (Founder of the school that Oishi Susumu learned)\n# Okuyama Saemondayu\n# Kamiizumi Musashinokami\n# Masunaga HakuenNyudo\n# Yoshida Masuemon\n# Ishihara Denjizaemon\n# Murakami Ittou\n# Oishi Yuken\n# Oishi Tarobei\n\nAfter founding of the school:\n# Oishi Susumu Tanetugu (Founder of the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b)\n# Oishi Susumu Tanemasa\n# Oishi Yukie\n# Itai Masumi\n# Oishi Hajime\n# Oishi Eiichi\n# Morimoto Kunio\n\n== Technical characteristics ==\n\nOishi Shinkage-ryu is a traditional school of swordsmanship. The features of the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b are techniques called ''morotezuki'' (to make a both hands pass), ''katatezuki'' (to make a single hand pass) and ''d\u014dgiri'' (to cut the waist). These techniques were used by Oishi Susumu for the first time in swordsmanship matches with the protective gear. Oishi Susumu made 79 [[kata]], which are called ''tekazu'' in Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nTechniques of the Oishi Shinkage-ryu kenjutsu include use of one sword with both hands, techniques to use two swords, ''saya-no-uchi'' ([[iaijutsu|iai]]) and [[naginata]].

He taught Aizu Kage-ry\u016b kenjutsu, Oshima-ry\u016b [[s\u014djutsu]] (use of [[spear]]) and Okuyama Shinkan-ry\u016b [[jujutsu]]. One of his student was Oishi Yuken who was a grandfather of Oishi Susumu. Oishi Yuken taught Oishi Susumu his kenjutsu and s\u014djutsu arts. Both Susumu's grandfather and his father were instructors of Yanagawa domain.\n\nOishi Susumu improved the protective gear used during practice. In addition, he improved ''[[fukuro shinai]]'' (bamboo sword covered with leather) to a modern bamboo sword. He devised stab technique, and a technique of striking one's opponent's breastplate. He was said to be five foot eleven inches tall (1.8 meters), a great height for a Japanese of his day. Therefore, his style of swordsmanship uses longer bamboo practice swords than most other styles. There are stories of him engaging in combat around Japan using his four ''[[shaku (unit)|shaku]]'' ''[[shinai]]'' (about 121&nbsp;cm).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hayakutake |first=Colin |title=Kage-ryu |year=1995 |publisher=Aikido Journal #104, 1995 }}</ref>\n\nBy the order of his feudal lord, he went to the capital city, [[Edo]] in 1832. In the next year, he did kenjutsu matches with many famous instructors. After Oishi Susumu, his son, also named Oishi Susume, inherited the school. Because the latter didn\u2019t have a son, his younger brother, Oishi Yukie was placed as the [[S\u014dke|headmaster]] of the ry\u016b. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], they didn\u2019t practice swordsmanship for some time, but the school survived still. When Oishi Yukie died, his son, Oishi Hajime was young, so Itai Masumi, the pupil of Oishi Yukie protected the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b. After Oishi Hajime grew up, he inherited his father's martial art. He taught the ry\u016b to his grandson, Oishi Eiichi. And Oishi Eiichi taught the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b to Morimoto Kunio. Morimoto Kunio was given [[menkyo kaiden]] (a teaching license) and is currently teaching the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b.\n\n== Lineage ==\n\nEarly history pre-dating Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b:\n# Aizu Ik\u014dsai (Founder of the school that Oishi Susumu learned)\n# Okuyama Saemondayu\n# Kamiizumi Musashinokami\n# Masunaga HakuenNyudo\n# Yoshida Masuemon\n# Ishihara Denjizaemon\n# Murakami Ittou\n# Oishi Yuken\n# Oishi Tarobei\n\nAfter founding of the school:\n# Oishi Susumu Tanetugu (Founder of the Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b)\n# Oishi Susumu Tanemasa\n# Oishi Yukie\n# Itai Masumi\n# Oishi Hajime\n# Oishi Eiichi\n# Morimoto Kunio\n\n== Technical characteristics ==\n\nOishi Shinkage-ryu is a traditional school of swordsmanship.

These techniques were used by Oishi Susumu for the first time in swordsmanship matches with the protective gear. Oishi Susumu made 79 [[kata]], which are called ''tekazu'' in Oishi Shinkage-ry\u016b.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nTechniques of the Oishi Shinkage-ryu kenjutsu include use of one sword with both hands, techniques to use two swords, ''saya-no-uchi'' ([[iaijutsu|iai]]) and [[naginata]].

The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the [[Black Elk Peak]] granite [[batholith]] in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith [[magma]] intruded into the pre-existing [[mica]] [[schist]] rocks during the [[Proterozoic]], 1.6 billion years ago.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616091103/http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/subenvironmentalfactors13.html Geologic Activity].

Remaining buried throughout the [[Paleozoic]], they were re-exposed again during the [[Laramide orogeny]] around 70 million years ago.<ref name=autogenerated3/> The Black Hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome.<ref>Irvin, James R.

Borglum selected Mount Rushmore as the site for several reasons. The rock of the mountain is composed of smooth, fine-grained granite.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone used the location as the headquarters for their 2004 film ''[[Team America: World Police]]''.  ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' (2007) also depicts this location as a secret cover for a fictional gold city.

Due to a curse placed on any witch whose identity is exposed by a human, Majo Rika is transformed into a magical frog. Wanting to return to her original form, Majo Rika makes Doremi her witch apprentice, giving her the ability to cast magic. Feeling guilty for placing that curse on her, Doremi accepts Majo Rika's offer in hopes of fixing her mistake. In order to become a fully-fledged witch capable of turning Majo Rika back into a human, Doremi has to pass nine different witch tests, whilst also keeping her identity a secret from other humans. Doremi is soon joined by her two best friends, Hazuki Fujiwara and Aiko Seno, and later by her younger sister Pop Harukaze who all become witch apprentices, helping to run the Maho-Do whilst using magic to help out their friends and families, with the occasional mishap. They soon come across a rival witch apprentice, Onpu Segawa, who has been using forbidden magic to influence people's memories. Whilst initially cold towards the other girls, Onpu soon warms up to them and sacrifices herself by wiping the memories of those that attempted to expose them (wiping memories is a witch taboo) to prevent their identities from being revealed. In order to save Onpu from an eternal sleep, the girls give up their magical powers to awaken her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Ojamajo Doremi (season one)|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|language=ja|work=toei-anim.co.jp|accessdate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''Ojamajo Doremi # (Sharp)''===\nAt the start of the fourth grade, Doremi and the others, who sneak into the Witch World to visit Majo Rika, witness the birth of a magical baby, who is given the name Hana. As witch law dictates that whoever witnesses a magical baby's birth must take care of it for a year, Doremi and the others are once again made witch apprentices, tasked with raising Hana. While also taking care of the Maho-Do, which has now become a gardening store, the girls must ensure Hana's growth and help her pass several health examinations held by the Witch World's head nurse, Majo Heart. Meanwhile, a wizard named Oyajide attempts to kidnap Hana to help aid the Wizard World, later enlisting the help of four young wizards known as the FLAT 4. At the end of the series, after the witch apprentices help mend relations between the Witch and Wizard Worlds, they once again give up their powers in order to protect Hana from the past queen of the Witch World.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi_s/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Ojamajo Doremi|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|language=ja|work=toei-anim.co.jp|accessdate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''M\u014dtto!

Thus, the Queen offers a compromise in that the girls, who are made into apprentices again, must pass six patissi\u00e8re exams in order to become full witches. With the Maho-Do remodeled into a bakery, Doremi and the others are joined by Momoko Asuka, a returnee from America who initially has little experience with Japanese outside of using a special intercom, to help them bake sweets needed for their exams. Midway through the series, Hana is afflicted by a curse from the past queen, causing her to have a dislike for vegetables which are necessary for her magical growth, prompting Doremi and the girls to help her get over her pickiness. After curing Hana's pickiness and passing the patissi\u00e8re exams, the girls appeal to the past queen, Majo Tourbillon, who had despised humans ever since she lost her human husband and child, undoing a curse placed upon a forest, where her true form is found sleeping, protected by magical vines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi_m/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Motto!

Meanwhile, the Queen discovers Majo Tourbillon's power will eventually cause all worlds to be put to sleep. As such, the Queen tasks the girls, who are assisted by Majo Tourbillon's fairy, Baba, to recreate various handmade gifts that Majo Tourbillon's six grandchildren had made and received from her in order to remind her of the happy times and break the vines imprisoning her. The vines soon start spawning black flowers that cause people and magical beings alike to be affected with laziness, with the girls enlisting the help of Hana and a white elephant named Pao to put a stop to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi_D/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Ojamajo Doremi Dokka~n!|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|language=ja|work=toei-anim.co.jp|accessdate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Anime===\n{{Main|List of Ojamajo Doremi episodes}}\n''Ojamajo Doremi'' is produced by [[Toei Animation]] and ABC.

Due to a curse placed on any witch whose identity is exposed by a human, Majo Rika is transformed into a magical frog. Wanting to return to her original form, Majo Rika makes Doremi her witch apprentice, giving her the ability to cast magic. Feeling guilty for placing that curse on her, Doremi accepts Majo Rika's offer in hopes of fixing her mistake. In order to become a fully-fledged witch capable of turning Majo Rika back into a human, Doremi has to pass nine different witch tests, whilst also keeping her identity a secret from other humans. Doremi is soon joined by her two best friends, Hazuki Fujiwara and Aiko Seno, and later by her younger sister Pop Harukaze who all become witch apprentices, helping to run the Maho-Do whilst using magic to help out their friends and families, with the occasional mishap. They soon come across a rival witch apprentice, Onpu Segawa, who has been using forbidden magic to influence people's memories. Whilst initially cold towards the other girls, Onpu soon warms up to them and sacrifices herself by wiping the memories of those that attempted to expose them (wiping memories is a witch taboo) to prevent their identities from being revealed. In order to save Onpu from an eternal sleep, the girls give up their magical powers to awaken her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Ojamajo Doremi (season one)|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|language=ja|work=toei-anim.co.jp|accessdate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''Ojamajo Doremi # (Sharp)''===\nAt the start of the fourth grade, Doremi and the others, who sneak into the Witch World to visit Majo Rika, witness the birth of a magical baby, who is given the name Hana. As witch law dictates that whoever witnesses a magical baby's birth must take care of it for a year, Doremi and the others are once again made witch apprentices, tasked with raising Hana. While also taking care of the Maho-Do, which has now become a gardening store, the girls must ensure Hana's growth and help her pass several health examinations held by the Witch World's head nurse, Majo Heart. Meanwhile, a wizard named Oyajide attempts to kidnap Hana to help aid the Wizard World, later enlisting the help of four young wizards known as the FLAT 4. At the end of the series, after the witch apprentices help mend relations between the Witch and Wizard Worlds, they once again give up their powers in order to protect Hana from the past queen of the Witch World.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi_s/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Ojamajo Doremi|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|language=ja|work=toei-anim.co.jp|accessdate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===''M\u014dtto!

Thus, the Queen offers a compromise in that the girls, who are made into apprentices again, must pass six patissi\u00e8re exams in order to become full witches. With the Maho-Do remodeled into a bakery, Doremi and the others are joined by Momoko Asuka, a returnee from America who initially has little experience with Japanese outside of using a special intercom, to help them bake sweets needed for their exams. Midway through the series, Hana is afflicted by a curse from the past queen, causing her to have a dislike for vegetables which are necessary for her magical growth, prompting Doremi and the girls to help her get over her pickiness. After curing Hana's pickiness and passing the patissi\u00e8re exams, the girls appeal to the past queen, Majo Tourbillon, who had despised humans ever since she lost her human husband and child, undoing a curse placed upon a forest, where her true form is found sleeping, protected by magical vines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi_m/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Motto!

Meanwhile, the Queen discovers Majo Tourbillon's power will eventually cause all worlds to be put to sleep. As such, the Queen tasks the girls, who are assisted by Majo Tourbillon's fairy, Baba, to recreate various handmade gifts that Majo Tourbillon's six grandchildren had made and received from her in order to remind her of the happy times and break the vines imprisoning her. The vines soon start spawning black flowers that cause people and magical beings alike to be affected with laziness, with the girls enlisting the help of Hana and a white elephant named Pao to put a stop to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi_D/episode/list/|title=Toei's summary of Ojamajo Doremi Dokka~n!|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Toei Animation]]|language=ja|work=toei-anim.co.jp|accessdate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Anime===\n{{Main|List of Ojamajo Doremi episodes}}\n''Ojamajo Doremi'' is produced by [[Toei Animation]] and ABC.

Many different criteria are used in worldwide charts, often in combination. These include [[record sales]], the amount of radio [[airplay]], the number of [[music download|downloads]], and the amount of [[streaming media|streaming]] activity.\n\nSome charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.\n\nA common format of radio and television programmes is to run down a music chart.\n\n==Chart hit==\nA ''chart hit'' is a recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases, that ranks highly in popularity compared to other songs in the same time frame. ''Chart-topper'' and related terms (like ''number one'', ''No. 1 hit'', ''top of the charts'', ''chart hit'', and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from \"buzz charts\" (based on opinions of various experts and [[:wiktionary:tastemaker|tastemaker]]s), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a ''chart-topper'' may be anything from an \"insiders' pick\" to a runaway seller. Most charts that are used to determine extant mainstream popularity rely on measurable data.\n\nRecord chart performance is inherently relative, as they rank songs, albums and records in comparison to each other at the same time, as opposed to [[music recording sales certification]] methods, which are measured in absolute numbers. Comparing the chart positions of songs at different times thus does not provide an accurate comparison of a song's overall impact. The nature of most charts, particularly weekly charts, also favors songs that sell very well for a brief period; thus, a song that is only briefly popular may chart higher than a song that sells more copies in the long range, but more slowly. As a result, a band's biggest hit single may not be its best-selling single.\n\nAccording to [[Joel Whitburn]], the American trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on August 4, 1958.  This was the first chart in the US to \"fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles.\"<ref name=whitburn>{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2003|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2002|edition=1st|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89820-155-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/ xi-xiii]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/}}</ref>  From 1958 until 1991, ''Billboard'' compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets.  Before 1958, several charts were published, including \"Best Sellers in Stores\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\" (later revived under the name [[Hot 100 Airplay]]), and \"Most Played in Juke Boxes\", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported.  On November 30, 1991, ''Billboard'' introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, \"by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan.\"<ref name=whitburn/>  Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a [[single (record)|single]].<ref name=whitburn/> The Hot 100 continues to be published.\n\n==Other terminology==\nThere are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.\n\nA ''new entry'' is a title which is making its d\u00e9but in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real ''new entry'' is a title that makes its chart d\u00e9but, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200 (this is also true of the Billboard Hot 100, which has a \"[[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|bubbling under]]\" addendum for new songs that have not yet made the Hot 100). The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.\n\nA ''re-entry'' is a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's \"Thriller 25\"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a \"new\" entry.\n\nA ''climber'' is a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term ''highest climber'' is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term \"faller\" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.\n\nThe ''top 10'', ''top 20'' and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the [[Official Charts Company]] produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.\n\nA ''[[one-hit wonder]]'' is an act that appears on the chart just once. The term ''true one-hit wonder'' was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.\n\n==Music charts and programs==\n===Top 10===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Many different criteria are used in worldwide charts, often in combination. These include [[record sales]], the amount of radio [[airplay]], the number of [[music download|downloads]], and the amount of [[streaming media|streaming]] activity.\n\nSome charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location. The most common period covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.\n\nA common format of radio and television programmes is to run down a music chart.\n\n==Chart hit==\nA ''chart hit'' is a recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases, that ranks highly in popularity compared to other songs in the same time frame. ''Chart-topper'' and related terms (like ''number one'', ''No. 1 hit'', ''top of the charts'', ''chart hit'', and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from \"buzz charts\" (based on opinions of various experts and [[:wiktionary:tastemaker|tastemaker]]s), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a ''chart-topper'' may be anything from an \"insiders' pick\" to a runaway seller. Most charts that are used to determine extant mainstream popularity rely on measurable data.\n\nRecord chart performance is inherently relative, as they rank songs, albums and records in comparison to each other at the same time, as opposed to [[music recording sales certification]] methods, which are measured in absolute numbers. Comparing the chart positions of songs at different times thus does not provide an accurate comparison of a song's overall impact. The nature of most charts, particularly weekly charts, also favors songs that sell very well for a brief period; thus, a song that is only briefly popular may chart higher than a song that sells more copies in the long range, but more slowly. As a result, a band's biggest hit single may not be its best-selling single.\n\nAccording to [[Joel Whitburn]], the American trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on August 4, 1958.  This was the first chart in the US to \"fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles.\"<ref name=whitburn>{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2003|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2002|edition=1st|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89820-155-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/ xi-xiii]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbur/page/}}</ref>  From 1958 until 1991, ''Billboard'' compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets.  Before 1958, several charts were published, including \"Best Sellers in Stores\", \"Most Played by Jockeys\" (later revived under the name [[Hot 100 Airplay]]), and \"Most Played in Juke Boxes\", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported.  On November 30, 1991, ''Billboard'' introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, \"by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan.\"<ref name=whitburn/>  Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a [[single (record)|single]].<ref name=whitburn/> The Hot 100 continues to be published.\n\n==Other terminology==\nThere are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.\n\nA ''new entry'' is a title which is making its d\u00e9but in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real ''new entry'' is a title that makes its chart d\u00e9but, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200 (this is also true of the Billboard Hot 100, which has a \"[[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|bubbling under]]\" addendum for new songs that have not yet made the Hot 100). The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.\n\nA ''re-entry'' is a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's \"Thriller 25\"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a \"new\" entry.\n\nA ''climber'' is a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term ''highest climber'' is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term \"faller\" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.\n\nThe ''top 10'', ''top 20'' and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the [[Official Charts Company]] produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.\n\nA ''[[one-hit wonder]]'' is an act that appears on the chart just once. The term ''true one-hit wonder'' was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.\n\n==Music charts and programs==\n===Top 10===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
