{"title_page": "Paint.net", "text_new": "'''Paint.net''' (stylized as '''Paint.NET''' or '''paint.net''') is a [[freeware]] [[raster graphics editor]] program for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed on the [[.NET Framework]].

Some plugins expand on the functionality that comes with Paint.net, such as Curves+ and Sharpen+, which extend the included tools Curves and Sharpen, respectively.\n\nExamples of file type plugins include an ''Animated Cursor and Icon'' plugin and an ''Adobe Photoshop file format plugin''.<ref name=\"pluginindex\" /> Several of these plugins are based on existing open source software, such as a [[raw image format]] plugin that uses [[dcraw]] and a PNG optimization plugin that uses [[OptiPNG]].\n\n==Forks==\n\n===paint-mono===\nPaint.net was created for Windows, and has no native support for any other system. With its previous open-source nature, the possibility for alternate versions was available. In May 2007, [[Miguel de Icaza]] officially started a [[porting]] project called ''paint-mono''.<ref name=\"paint-mono\" /> This project had partially ported Paint.net 3.0 to [[Mono (software)|Mono]], an open-source implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] on which the .NET Framework is based. This allowed Paint.net to be run on Mono-supported platforms, such as [[Linux]]. <!-- As of December 2010, -->This port is no longer maintained and has not been updated since March 2009.<ref name=\"paint-mono\">Project [http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ Paint Mono] at [[Google Code]]<!-- Archive https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ --></ref>\n\n===Pinta===\n{{main|Pinta (software)}}\nIn 2010 developer Jonathan Pobst started a project called [[Pinta (software)|Pinta]], describing it <!-- by the developer and the osnews article --> as a clone of Paint.net for Mono and [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]]. Pinta reused the adjustments and effects code from Paint.net but otherwise is original code.<ref name=\"ref-osnews\" />\n\n==Releases==\n<!-- Please only add significant changes/improvements.

For instance, a [[DirectDraw Surface]] file type plugin, (originally by Dean Ashton) and an Ink Sketch and Soften Portrait effect (originally by David Issel) were added to Paint.net in version 3.10.\n\nHundreds of plugins have been produced;<ref name=\"pluginindex\">{{Cite web|url=http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/15260-plugin-index/|title=Plugin Index}}</ref> such as Shape3D, which renders a 2D drawing into a 3D shape. Some plugins expand on the functionality that comes with Paint.net, such as Curves+ and Sharpen+, which extend the included tools Curves and Sharpen, respectively.\n\nExamples of file type plugins include an ''Animated Cursor and Icon'' plugin and an ''Adobe Photoshop file format plugin''.<ref name=\"pluginindex\" /> Several of these plugins are based on existing open source software, such as a [[raw image format]] plugin that uses [[dcraw]] and a PNG optimization plugin that uses [[OptiPNG]].\n\n==Forks==\n\n===paint-mono===\nPaint.net was created for Windows, and has no native support for any other system. With its previous open-source nature, the possibility for alternate versions was available. In May 2007, [[Miguel de Icaza]] officially started a [[porting]] project called ''paint-mono''.<ref name=\"paint-mono\" /> This project had partially ported Paint.net 3.0 to [[Mono (software)|Mono]], an open-source implementation of the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] on which the .NET Framework is based. This allowed Paint.net to be run on Mono-supported platforms, such as [[Linux]]. <!-- As of December 2010, -->This port is no longer maintained and has not been updated since March 2009.<ref name=\"paint-mono\">Project [http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ Paint Mono] at [[Google Code]]<!-- Archive https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://code.google.com/p/paint-mono/ --></ref>\n\n===Pinta===\n{{main|Pinta (software)}}\nIn 2010 developer Jonathan Pobst started a project called [[Pinta (software)|Pinta]], describing it <!-- by the developer and the osnews article --> as a clone of Paint.net for Mono and [[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]]. Pinta reused the adjustments and effects code from Paint.net but otherwise is original code.<ref name=\"ref-osnews\" />\n\n==Releases==\n<!-- Please only add significant changes/improvements.

Runway 06/24 was built as part of the US base which began operating in 1943. In 1974, the Air Ministry transferred to Infraero technical jurisdiction, administrative and operational airport. The current passenger terminal of Airport Marechal Cunha Machado opened in June 1998 The name of the airport is a tribute to the Air Marshall and Captain Lieutenant Commander Hugo da Cunha Machado, born in Maranh\u00e3o.

resource|computer resource]] for recording [[Data (computing)|data]] discretely in a [[Computer data storage|computer storage device]]. Just as words can be written to paper, so can information be written to a computer file. Files can be edited and transferred through the internet on that particular computer system.\n\nThere are different [[File format|types of computer files]], designed for different purposes. A file may be designed to store a picture, a written message, a [[Digital video|video]], a [[computer program]], or a wide variety of other kinds of data. Some types of files can store several types of information at once.\n\nBy using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, save, and close a computer file. Computer files may be reopened, modified, and copied an arbitrary number of times.\n\nTypically,  files are organised in a [[file system]], which keeps track of where the files are located on disk and enables user access.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:PunchCardDecks.agr.jpg|right|thumb|A [[punched card]] file]]\n[[File:BRL61-IBM 305 RAMAC.jpeg|right|thumb|The twin [[Disk storage|disk files]] of an [[IBM 305]] system]]\n\nThe word \"file\" derives from the Latin ''filum'' (\"a thread\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=file|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n\"File\" was used in the context of computer storage as early as January 1940.

Such a 'file' now exists in a 'memory' tube developed at RCA Laboratories.

Casey, et al. ''Punched Cards: Their Applications to Science and Industry''. 1952.</ref>\n\nIn early use, the underlying hardware, rather than the contents stored on it, was denominated a \"file\". For example, the [[IBM 350]] disk drives were denominated \"disk files\".<ref>Martin H. Weik. Ballistic Research Laboratories Report #1115. March 1961. [http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/BRL61-ibm03.html#IBM-305-RAMAC pp. 314\u2013331].</ref> The introduction, circa 1961, by the [[Burroughs MCP]] and the MIT [[Compatible Time-Sharing System]] of the concept of a \"[[file system]]\" that managed several virtual \"files\" on one storage device is the origin of the contemporary denotation of the word. Although the contemporary \"[[register file]]\" demonstrates the early concept of files, its use has greatly decreased.\n\n==File contents==\nOn most modern [[operating system]]s, files are organized into one-dimensional arrays of [[byte]]s. The [[file format|format]] of a file is defined by its content since a file is solely a container for data, although on some platforms the format is usually indicated by its [[filename extension]], specifying the rules for how the bytes must be organized and interpreted meaningfully. For example, the bytes of a plain text file ({{Mono|.txt}} in Windows) are associated with either [[ASCII]] or [[UTF-8]] characters, while the bytes of image, video, and audio files are interpreted otherwise. Most file types also allocate a few bytes for [[metadata]], which allows a file to carry some basic information about itself.\n\nSome file systems can store arbitrary (not interpreted by the file system) file-specific data outside of the file format, but linked to the file, for example [[extended attributes]] or [[Fork (file system)|forks]]. On other file systems this can be done via [[sidecar file]]s or software-specific databases. All those methods, however, are more susceptible to loss of metadata than are [[Digital container format|container]] and [[archive file]] formats.\n\n=== File size ===\n{{Misleading|section|date=March 2019}}\n{{Main article | File size}}\n\nAt any instant in time, a file might have a size, normally expressed as number of [[byte]]s, that indicates how much storage is associated with the file. In most modern operating systems the size can be any non-negative whole number of bytes up to a system limit. Many older operating systems kept track only of the number of [[disk sector|blocks]] or [[track (disk drive)|tracks]] occupied by a file on a physical storage device. In such systems, software employed other methods to track the exact byte count (e.g., [[CP/M]] used a special control character, [[Ctrl-Z]], to signal the end of text files).\n\nThe general definition of a file does not require that its size have any real meaning, however, unless the data within the file happens to correspond to data within a pool of persistent storage. A special case is a [[zero byte file]]; these files can be newly created files that have not yet had any data written to them, or may serve as some kind of [[Flag (computing)|flag]] in the file system, or are accidents (the results of aborted disk operations). For example, the file to which the link {{Mono|/bin/ls}} points in a typical [[Unix-like]] system probably has a defined size that seldom changes. Compare this with {{Mono|[[/dev/null]]}} which is also a file, but as a [[character special file]], its size is not meaningful.\n\n=== Organization of data in a file ===\nInformation in a computer file can consist of smaller packets of information (often called \"[[Row (database)|records]]\" or \"lines\") that are individually different but share some common traits. For example, a payroll file might contain information concerning all the employees in a company and their payroll details; each record in the payroll file concerns just one employee, and all the records have the common trait of being related to payroll\u2014this is very similar to placing all payroll information into a specific filing cabinet in an office that does not have a computer. A text file may contain lines of text, corresponding to printed lines on a piece of paper. Alternatively, a file may contain an arbitrary binary image (a [[Blob (computing)|blob]]) or it may contain an [[executable]].\n\nThe way information is grouped into a file is entirely up to how it is designed. This has led to a plethora of more or less standardized file structures for all imaginable purposes, from the simplest to the most complex. Most computer files are used by [[Computer program|computer programs]] which create, modify or delete the files for their own use on an as-needed basis. The programmers who create the programs decide what files are needed, how they are to be used and (often) their names.\n\nIn some cases, computer programs manipulate files that are made visible to the computer user. For example, in a [[Word processor|word-processing program]], the user manipulates document files that the user personally names. Although the content of the document file is arranged in a format that the word-processing program understands, the user is able to choose the name and location of the file and provide the bulk of the information (such as words and text) that will be stored in the file.\n\nMany applications pack all their data files into a single file called an [[archive file]], using internal markers to discern the different types of information contained within. The benefits of the archive file are to lower the number of files for easier transfer, to reduce storage usage, or just to organize outdated files. The archive file must often be unpacked before next using.\n\n=== Operations ===\nThe most basic operations that programs can perform on a file are:\n* Create<!--needs a link--> a new file\n* Change the [[file system permissions|access permissions]] and [[file attribute|attributes]] of a file\n* [[open (system call)|Open]] a file, which makes the file contents available to the program\n* [[read (system call)|Read]] data from a file\n* [[write (system call)|Write]] data to a file\n* [[close (system call)|Close]] a file, terminating the association between it and the program\n\nFiles on a computer can be created, moved, modified, grown, shrunk, and deleted. In most cases, computer programs that are executed on the computer handle these operations, but the user of a computer can also manipulate files if necessary. For instance, [[Microsoft Word]] files are normally created and modified by the Microsoft Word program in response to user commands, but the user can also move, [[rename (computing)|rename]], or [[File deletion|delete]] these files directly by using a [[file manager|file manager program]] such as [[Windows Explorer]] (on Windows computers) or by [[command-line interface|command lines]] (CLI).\n\nIn [[Unix-like]] systems, [[user space]] programs do not operate directly, at a low level, on a file. Only the [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] deals with files, and it handles all user-space interaction with files in a manner that is transparent to the user-space programs. The [[operating system]] provides a level of [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], which means that interaction with a file from user-space is simply through its filename (instead of its [[inode]]).  For example, <kbd>[[rm (Unix)|rm]] ''filename''</kbd> will not delete the file itself, but only a [[hard link|link]] to the file. There can be many links to a file, but when they are all removed, the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] considers that file's memory space free to be reallocated. This [[Data remanence|free space]] is commonly considered a security risk (due to the existence of [[File recovery|file recovery software]]). Any secure-deletion program uses kernel-space (system) functions to wipe the file's data.\n\n==Identifying and organizing==\n[[File:FileFolders.svg|thumb|200px|right|Files and folders arranged in a hierarchy]]\nIn modern computer systems, files are typically accessed using names ([[filename]]s).  In some operating systems, the name is associated with the file itself. In others, the file is anonymous, and is pointed to by links that have names. In the latter case, a user can identify the name of the link with the file itself, but this is a false analogue, especially where there exists more than one link to the same file.\n\nFiles (or links to files) can be located in directories. However, more generally, a [[File directory|directory]] can contain either a list of files or a list of links to files.  Within this definition, it is of paramount importance that the term \"file\" includes directories.  This permits the existence of directory hierarchies, i.e., directories containing sub-directories.  A name that refers to a file within a directory must be typically unique. In other words, there must be no identical names within a directory.  However, in some operating systems, a name may include a specification of type that means a directory can contain an identical name for more than one type of object such as a directory and a file.\n\nIn environments in which a file is named, a file's name and the path to the file's directory must uniquely identify it among all other files in the computer system\u2014no two files can have the same name and path.  Where a file is anonymous, named references to it will exist within a namespace.  In most cases, any name within the namespace will refer to exactly zero or one file.  However, any file may be represented within any namespace by zero, one or more names.\n\nAny string of characters may be a well-formed<!-- Could this be a misuse of a term? --> name for a file or a link depending upon the context of application. Whether or not a name is well-formed depends on the type of computer system being used. Early computers<!-- software? --> permitted only a few letters or digits in the name of a file, but modern computers allow long names (some up to 255 characters) containing almost any combination of [[unicode]] letters or unicode digits, making it easier to understand the purpose of a file at a glance. Some computer systems allow file names to contain spaces; others do not. Case-sensitivity of file names is determined by the [[file system]]. Unix file systems are usually case sensitive and allow user-level applications to create files whose names differ only in the case of characters. [[Microsoft Windows]] supports multiple<!-- after Unix, this could be \"only a few\" ;) --> file systems, each with different policies{{which|date=February 2014}} regarding case-sensitivity. The common [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system can have multiple files whose names differ only in case if the user uses a [[disk editor]] to edit the file names in the [[FAT directory table|directory entries]]. User applications, however, will usually not allow the user to create multiple files with the same name but differing in case.\n\nMost computers organize files into hierarchies using folders, directories, or catalogs. The concept is the same irrespective of the terminology used. Each folder can contain an arbitrary number of files, and it can also contain other folders. These other folders are referred to as subfolders. Subfolders can contain still more files and folders and so on, thus building a tree-like structure in which one \"master folder\" (or \"root folder\" \u2014 the name varies from one operating system to another) can contain any number of levels of other folders and files. Folders can be named just as files can (except for the root folder, which often does not have a name). The use of folders makes it easier to organize files in a logical way.\n\nWhen a computer allows the use of folders, each file and folder has not only a name of its own, but also a path, which identifies the folder or folders in which a file or folder resides. In the path, some sort of special character\u2014such as a slash\u2014is used to separate the file and folder names. For example, in the illustration shown in this article, the path {{Mono|/Payroll/Salaries/Managers}} uniquely identifies a file called {{Mono|Managers}} in a folder called {{Mono|Salaries}}, which in turn is contained in a folder called {{Mono|Payroll}}. The folder and file names are separated by slashes in this example; the topmost or root folder has no name, and so the path begins with a slash (if the root folder had a name, it would precede this first slash).\n\nMany computer systems use [[filename extension|extensions]] in file names to help identify what they contain, also known as the file type. On Windows computers, extensions consist of a dot (period) at the end of a file name, followed by a few letters to identify the type of file. An extension of {{Mono|.txt}} identifies a text file; a {{Mono|.doc}} extension identifies any type of document or documentation, commonly in the [[Microsoft Word]] [[file format]]; [[List of file formats|and so on]]. Even when extensions are used in a computer system, the degree to which the computer system recognizes and heeds them can vary; in some systems, they are required, while in other systems, they are completely ignored if they are presented.\n\n==Protection==\nMany modern computer systems provide methods for protecting files against accidental and deliberate damage. Computers that allow for multiple users implement [[file permissions]] to control who may or may not modify, delete, or create files and folders. For example, a given user may be granted only permission to read a file or folder, but not to modify or delete it; or a user may be given permission to read and modify files or folders, but not to execute them. Permissions may also be used to allow only certain users to see the contents of a file or folder. Permissions protect against unauthorized tampering or destruction of information in files, and keep private information confidential from unauthorized users.\n\nAnother protection mechanism implemented in many computers is a ''read-only flag.'' When this flag is turned on for a file (which can be accomplished by a computer program or by a human user), the file can be examined, but it cannot be modified. This flag is useful for critical information that must not be modified or erased, such as special files that are used only by internal parts of the computer system. Some systems also include a ''[[Hidden file and hidden directory|hidden flag]]'' to make certain files invisible; this flag is used by the computer system to hide essential system files that users should not alter.\n\n==Storage==\nAny file that has any useful purpose, must have some physical manifestation. That is, a file (an abstract concept) in a real computer system must have a real physical analogue if it is to exist at all.\n\nIn physical terms, most computer files are stored on some type of data storage device. For example, most [[operating system]]s store files on a [[hard disk]]. Hard disks have been the ubiquitous form of [[non-volatile]] storage since the early 1960s.<ref name=\"Mee\">Magnetic Storage Handbook 2nd Ed., Section 2.1.1, Disk File Technology, Mee and Daniel, (c)1990,</ref> Where files contain only temporary information, they may be stored in [[RAM]]. Computer files can be also stored on other media in some cases, such as [[magnetic tape]]s, [[compact disc]]s, [[Digital Versatile Disc]]s, [[Zip drive]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s, etc. The use of [[solid state drives]] is also beginning to rival the hard disk drive.\n\nIn Unix-like operating systems, many files have no associated physical storage device. Examples are {{Mono|[[/dev/null]]}} and most files under directories {{Mono|/dev}}, {{Mono|/proc}} and {{Mono|/sys}}.  These are virtual files: they exist as objects within the operating system kernel.\n\nAs seen by a running user program, files are usually represented either by a [[File Control Block|file control block]] or by a [[file handle]]. A file control block (FCB) is an area of memory which is manipulated to establish a filename etc. and then passed to the operating system as a parameter; it was used by older IBM operating systems and early PC operating systems including [[CP/M]] and early versions of [[MS-DOS]]. A file handle is generally either an [[opaque data type]] or an integer; it was introduced in around 1961 by the [[ALGOL 60|ALGOL-based]] [[Burroughs MCP]] running on the [[Burroughs B5000]] but is now ubiquitous.\n\n==File corruption==\n{{further|Data corruption|Data degradation}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | width = 200\n | image1 = Bitrot_in_JPEG_files,_0_bits_flipped.jpg\n | caption1 = Original [[JPEG]] file\n | alt1 = Photo of a child\n | image2 = Bitrot_in_JPEG_files,_1_bit_flipped.jpg\n | caption2 = Corrupted JPEG file, with a single [[bit]] flipped (turned from 0 to 1, or vice-versa)\n | al1 = The same photo of a child, but noticeably corrupted: a different color tone and square shapes from the middle to the bottom of the image\n | footer = While there is visible corruption on the second file, one can still make out what the original image might have looked like.\n}}\n\nWhen a file is said to be corrupted, it is because its contents have been saved to the computer in such a way that they can't be properly read, either by a human or by software. Depending on the extension of the damage, the original file can sometimes be [[Data recovery|recovered]], or at least partially understood.<ref name=\"techwalla-corruption\">{{ cite web | url=https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-causes-a-corrupt-file | title=What Causes a Corrupt File? | first=Victoria | last=Gorski | accessdate=2019-03-17 }}</ref> A file may be created corrupt, or it may be corrupted at a later point through [[Overwriting (computer science)|overwriting]].\n\nThere are many ways by which a file can become corrupted.

Backing up files simply means making copies of the files in a separate location so that they can be restored if something happens to the computer, or if they are deleted accidentally.\n\nThere are many ways to back up files. Most computer systems provide utility programs to assist in the back-up process, which can become very time-consuming if there are many files to safeguard. Files are often copied to removable media such as writable CDs or cartridge tapes. Copying files to another hard disk in the same computer protects against failure of one disk, but if it is necessary to protect against failure or destruction of the entire computer, then copies of the files must be made on other media that can be taken away from the computer and stored in a safe, distant location.\n\nThe [[grandfather-father-son backup]] method automatically makes three back-ups; the grandfather file is the oldest copy of the file and the son is the current copy.\n\n==File systems and file managers==\nThe way a computer organizes, names, stores and manipulates files is globally referred to as its ''[[file system]].'' Most computers have at least one file system. Some computers allow the use of several different file systems. For instance, on newer MS Windows computers, the older FAT-type file systems of [[MS-DOS]] and old versions of Windows are supported, in addition to the [[NTFS]] file system that is the normal file system for recent versions of Windows. Each system has its own advantages and disadvantages. Standard FAT allows only eight-character file names (plus a three-character extension) with no spaces, for example, whereas NTFS allows much longer names that can contain spaces. You can call a file \"{{Mono|Payroll records}}\" in NTFS, but in FAT you would be restricted to something like {{Mono|payroll.dat}} (unless you were using [[File Allocation Table#Long file names|VFAT]], a FAT extension allowing long file names).\n\n[[File manager]] programs are utility programs that allow users to manipulate files directly. They allow you to move, create, delete and rename files and folders, although they do not actually allow you to read the contents of a file or store information in it. Every computer system provides at least one file-manager program for its native file system. For example, [[File Explorer]] (formerly Windows Explorer) is commonly used in Microsoft Windows operating systems, and Nautilus is common under several distributions of Linux.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Block (data storage)]]\n* [[Computer file management]]\n* [[Data hierarchy]]\n* [[File camouflage]]\n* [[File copying]]\n* [[File conversion]]\n* [[File deletion]]\n* [[File directory]]\n* [[File manager]]\n* [[File system]]\n* [[Filename]]\n* [[Flat file database]]\n* [[Object composition]]\n* [[Soft copy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscatinline|Computer files}}\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Data_Formats/ Data Formats}}\n\n{{Computer files}}\n\n[[Category:Computer files| ]]\n[[Category:Computer file systems|File]]\n[[Category:Inter-process communication]]\n", "name_user": "65.35.3.211", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(stuff)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file"}

J. R. (2003)</ref>  is a medium-sized black-and-white [[albatross]] which breeds only on [[The Pyramid]], a large rock stack in the [[Chatham Islands]], [[New Zealand]]. It is sometimes treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[shy albatross]] ''Thalassarche cauta''. It is the smallest of the shy albatross group.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nMollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to family [[Diomedeidae]] of the order [[Procellariiformes]], along with [[shearwater]]s, [[fulmar]]s, [[storm petrel]]s, and [[diving petrel]]s. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]]. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\nThe Chatham albatross, with the [[White-capped albatross|white-capped]], shy and [[Salvin's albatross]]es, were all considered the same species until a 1998 book by Robertson and Nunn.<ref name=\"RN\">Robertson, C. J. R. & Nunn, G. B. (1998)</ref> Other experts followed suit, with [[BirdLife International]] in 2000,<ref name=\"BLI\">BirdLife International (2008)</ref> Brooke in 2004,<ref name=\"Brooke\">Brooke, M. (2004)</ref> [[Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels|ACAP]] in 2006,<ref name=\"ACAP\">ACAP (2007)</ref> and [[American Ornithologists' Union|SACC]] in 2008.<ref name=\"Remsen1\">Remsen Jr., J.

(2007)</ref>\n\nThe Chatham albatross was first described as ''Diomedea cauta eremita'' by [[Robert Cushman Murphy]], in 1930, based on a specimen from Pyramid Rock.<ref name = \"Robertson\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe Chatham albatross weighs {{convert|3.1|to(-)|4.7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/> and it has a length of {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The adult has a dark grey crown, face, upper mantle, back, upperwing, tail, and throat. They have a white rump and underparts. They also have a black thumbmark on the leading edge of the underwings, and a black tip on the wings. Their bill is yellow with a dark spot on the tip of the lower [[mandible]].<ref name=\"BLI\"/> Finally, they have an orange cheek stripe.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/> The juveniles have more extensive grey and their bill is blue-grey with black tips on both [[mandible]]s.<ref name=\"BLI\"/><ref name=\"Remsen1\" /><ref name=\"Remsen2\" /><ref name=\"Remsen\" />\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Chatham Albatross-off Eaglehawk TAS-03Sept2011.jpg|thumb]]\nThey are normally silent, but will emit a harsh buzzing bray when threatened and also during courtship. Besides the sound they will put on a courtship display which includes fanning of the tail, mutual jousting of bills, and grunting.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/>\n\n===Feeding===\nThe Chatham albatross feeds on fish, [[cephalopod]]s,<ref name=\"Marchant\">Marchant, S. & Higgins, P. J. (1990)</ref> [[krill]], and [[barnacle]]s.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThis species of albatross breeds annually on rocky ledges, steep slopes, and crevices. They build pedestal nests of soil and vegetation.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/> At this time The Pyramid is their only breeding site. They lay their single egg between 20 August and 1 October, with the egg hatching in November or December, after 68\u201372 days. The chicks [[fledge]] by March or April,<ref name=\"Marchant\" /> or 130 to 140 days after hatching. Juveniles return to the colony after four years, but do not breed until their seventh year.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/> \n\n==Range and habitat==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+'''Breeding Population and Trends'''<ref name=\"BLI\"/>\n|-\n!Location !!

Using aerial photography, in 1998, scientists estimated that there were between 3,200 and 4,200 pairs nesting.<ref name=\"Croxall\" /> Ground counts from 1999 to 2003 increased this number to 5,300<ref name=\"Robertson\" /> pairs for a total of approximately 11,000 breeding age birds. When not breeding they range in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] from [[Tasmania]] to [[Chile]] and [[Peru]]. From April to July they will utilize the [[Humboldt Current]] and go as far north as 6\u00b0S along the [[South America]]n coast.<ref name=\"Robertson\" /><ref name=\"BLI3\">BirdLife International (2004)</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe [[IUCN]] has classified this species as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]],<ref name=IUCN/> due to the fact that they nest on one small island, which has undergone significant decline in habitat condition. In 1985 a severe storm impacted the island by reducing the amount of vegetation.<ref name=\"Croxall\">Croxall, J. P. & Gales, R. (1998)</ref> The conditions have been improving since 1998.<ref name=\"Robertson\">Robertson, C. J. R., et al. (2003)</ref> As with other albatrosses, commercial fishing impacts their survival, with [[longline fishing|longline]]<ref name=\"Robertson\" /><ref name=\"NZ\">New Zealand Ministry of Fisheries (2007)</ref> and the occasional trawl line.

J. R. (2003)</ref>  is a medium-sized black-and-white [[albatross]] which breeds only on [[The Pyramid]], a large rock stack in the [[Chatham Islands]], [[New Zealand]]. It is sometimes treated as a [[subspecies]] of the [[shy albatross]] ''Thalassarche cauta''. It is the smallest of the shy albatross group.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nMollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to family [[Diomedeidae]] of the order [[Procellariiformes]], along with [[shearwater]]s, [[fulmar]]s, [[storm petrel]]s, and [[diving petrel]]s. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called [[naricorns]]. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of [[wax ester]]s and [[triglycerides]] that is stored in the [[proventriculus]]. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights.<ref>Double, M. C. (2003)</ref> They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.<ref>Ehrlich, Paul R. (1988)</ref>\n\nThe Chatham albatross, with the [[White-capped albatross|white-capped]], shy and [[Salvin's albatross]]es, were all considered the same species until a 1998 book by Robertson and Nunn.<ref name=\"RN\">Robertson, C. J. R. & Nunn, G. B.

The adult has a dark grey crown, face, upper mantle, back, upperwing, tail, and throat. They have a white rump and underparts. They also have a black thumbmark on the leading edge of the underwings, and a black tip on the wings. Their bill is yellow with a dark spot on the tip of the lower [[mandible]].<ref name=\"BLI\"/> Finally, they have an orange cheek stripe.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/> The juveniles have more extensive grey and their bill is blue-grey with black tips on both [[mandible]]s.<ref name=\"BLI\"/><ref name=\"Remsen1\" /><ref name=\"Remsen2\" /><ref name=\"Remsen\" />\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Chatham Albatross-off Eaglehawk TAS-03Sept2011.jpg|thumb]]\nThey are normally silent, but will emit a harsh buzzing bray when threatened and also during courtship. Besides the sound they will put on a courtship display which includes fanning of the tail, mutual jousting of bills, and grunting.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/>\n\n===Feeding===\nThe Chatham albatross feeds on fish, [[cephalopod]]s,<ref name=\"Marchant\">Marchant, S. & Higgins, P. J. (1990)</ref> [[krill]], and [[barnacle]]s.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/>\n\n===Reproduction===\nThis species of albatross breeds annually on rocky ledges, steep slopes, and crevices. They build pedestal nests of soil and vegetation.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/> At this time The Pyramid is their only breeding site. They lay their single egg between 20 August and 1 October, with the egg hatching in November or December, after 68\u201372 days. The chicks [[fledge]] by March or April,<ref name=\"Marchant\" /> or 130 to 140 days after hatching. Juveniles return to the colony after four years, but do not breed until their seventh year.<ref name=\"Robertson3\"/> \n\n==Range and habitat==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+'''Breeding Population and Trends'''<ref name=\"BLI\"/>\n|-\n!Location !!

Using aerial photography, in 1998, scientists estimated that there were between 3,200 and 4,200 pairs nesting.<ref name=\"Croxall\" /> Ground counts from 1999 to 2003 increased this number to 5,300<ref name=\"Robertson\" /> pairs for a total of approximately 11,000 breeding age birds. When not breeding they range in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] from [[Tasmania]] to [[Chile]] and [[Peru]]. From April to July they will utilize the [[Humboldt Current]] and go as far north as 6\u00b0S along the [[South America]]n coast.<ref name=\"Robertson\" /><ref name=\"BLI3\">BirdLife International (2004)</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe [[IUCN]] has classified this species as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]],<ref name=IUCN/> due to the fact that they nest on one small island, which has undergone significant decline in habitat condition. In 1985 a severe storm impacted the island by reducing the amount of vegetation.<ref name=\"Croxall\">Croxall, J. P. & Gales, R. (1998)</ref> The conditions have been improving since 1998.<ref name=\"Robertson\">Robertson, C. J. R., et al.
