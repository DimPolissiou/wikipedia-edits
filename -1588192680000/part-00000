{"title_page": "Human rights in Malaysia", "text_new": "{{Short description|Status of rights in Malaysia, considered bad}}\n\n{{EngvarB|date=March 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n{{Politics of Malaysia}}\nThe situation of '''human rights in Malaysia''' is controversial as there have been numerous allegations of [[human rights]] abuses in the country.  Human rights groups and foreign governments are generally critical of the Malaysian government and the [[Royal Malaysian Police]]. Preventive detention laws such as the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] and the Emergency (Public Order and Prevention of Crime) Ordinance 1969 allow for detention without trial or charge and as such are a source of concern for human rights organisations like [[SUARAM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Malaysia.pdf|title= COUNTRY PROFILE: MALAYSIA |publisher=Federal Research Division (Library of Congress)|accessdate=24 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Legislation ==\nSeveral Malaysian laws are used to restrict basic human rights. Recent sweeping changes in these laws have been described by the government as human-rights reforms but, according to critics, have actually, in some regards, made restrictions even more stringent.\n\nThe country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has defended its strict controls on human rights with the explanation that the nation \u201ctakes a holistic approach to human rights in that it views all rights as indivisible and interdependent. In Malaysia, the rights of every citizen are protected by legal provisions in the Federal Constitution....But these rights are not absolute and are subject to, among others, public order, morality and security of the country.\u201d Hence, while claiming to \u201cuphold...the universal principles of human rights,\u201d Malaysia finds it important to \u201ctake into account the history of the country as well as the religious, social and cultural diversities of its communities. This is to ensure that the respect for social harmony is preserved and protected. The practices of human rights in Malaysia are reflections of a wider Asian value system where welfare and collective well-being of the community are more significant compared to individual rights.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=HUMAN RIGHTS|url=http://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/md-human_right|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia|accessdate=20 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117143830/http://kln.gov.my/web/guest/md-human_right|archive-date=17 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe country is especially well known for arresting persons without warrants and detaining them indefinitely without trial, and for placing strict limitations on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association in the name of social order. Among the other problems cited in a US State Department report in 2011 are the abuse and even death of persons held by police; punishment by caning; trafficking in persons; systematic official  to safeguard the interests of ethnic Malays who have been economically marginalised and demographically outnumbered by non-Malays since the fall of Malacca to the Portuguese and Singapore to the overseas Chinese.\n\n===Traditional restrictive legislation===\nThere are several strong and sweeping pieces of legislation that have long been used by Malaysia to restrict the human rights of individuals and thus preserve, in its view, social order. In 2008 [[Amnesty International]] summed up the state of human rights in Malaysia, in part, by noting that the government had \u201ctightened control of dissent and curtailed the right to freedom of expression and religion,\u201d arresting bloggers under the Sedition Act, using the Printing Presses and Publications Act (PPPA) to control the content of newspapers, and arbitrarily arresting several individuals under the Internal Security Act (ISA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaysia Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/malaysia|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref> In 2012 there were major changes in a number of these laws that were officially described as human-rights reforms but that have been widely criticised either for not going far enough or for, in fact, further restricting human rights.\n\n===Internal Security Act===\n{{main|Internal Security Act (Malaysia)}}\nPerhaps the best known of these laws is the Internal Security Act, which was passed in 1960, three years after the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Widely viewed as draconian, it permits long-term detention without trial, and over the decades has been used systematically against individuals who have been viewed, for various reasons, as threats to Malaysia's government or to the \u201csocial order.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=PM announces repeal of ISA, three Emergency proclamations|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&file=/2011/9/15/nation/20110915205714|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101122631/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F9%2F15%2Fnation%2F20110915205714&sec=nation|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 January 2012|work=The Star|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sedition Act===\nAnother powerful and widely employed piece of legislation, which dates back to 1948, when Malaysia was still a British colony, is the Sedition Act, which criminalises speech or writing that is considered to be seditious. A great many critics and political opponents of the Malaysian regime have been arrested and held under the Sedition Act, the effect of which has been to restrict freedom of expression in Malaysia.\n\n===Printing Presses and Publications Act===\nPassed in 1984, the Printing Presses and Publications Act, which makes it a crime to publish anything without a government license that must be renewed every year by the Home Minister, has been used to silence government critics and to ban various publications for a variety of reasons. As with the Sedition Act, the practical effect of the Printing Presses and Publications Act has been to severely restrict freedom of speech in Malaysia. Meanwhile, in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), press is more free as there is less concern of controversy happenning there.\n\n===Police Act===\n{{main|Police Act 1967 (Malaysia)}}\nThe Police Act of 1967 allows the Malaysian police to detain persons without warrants, and has been used especially to restrict the freedom of assembly. Under the Police Act, until recently, police permits were required for gatherings of over four people, other than strikes,\n\n===Changes in restrictive laws===\nOn 15 September 2011, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak announced that the ISA would be totally repealed and \u201cbe replaced by a new law that incorporates far more judicial oversight and limits the powers of the police to detain suspect for preventive reasons.\u201d The government also committed itself to the repeal of some of its other best known legal instruments for restricting human rights, including the Sedition Act and Emergency Declarations and Banishment Act. In addition, the government agreed to review several laws, including Section 27 of the Police Act, the Printing Presses and Publications Act and the Official Secrets Act.\n\n===Security Offences (Special Measures) Act===\nIn a June 2012 article published in the East-West Centre in Asia Pacific Bulletin and reprinted in the Bangkok Post and on the website of Human Rights Watch, writer Mickey Spiegel noted that in April 2012, the Malaysian parliament had passed the replacement for the ISA, called the Security Offences (Special Measures) 2012 Act (SOSMA). Spiegel complained that SOSMA \u201cdoes not go far enough to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of Malaysians.\u201d In fact, asserted Spiegel, SOSMA is \"actually more repressive and retrograde\" than the ISA in some ways, an indication that the government was \u201cplaying 'bait and switch' with human rights.\u201d\n\nFor example, \u201ccoupled with amendments to other laws,\u201d SOSMA  \u201ctightened restrictions or banned outright activities already under constraint, added limits to previously unrestricted activities, and broadened police apprehension and surveillance powers in new and innovative ways.\u201d In addition, it \u201cfurther erodes citizens\u2019 individual protections, for example by ceding to the police rather than judges the power to intercept communications.\u201d\n\n===Peaceful Assembly Act===\n{{main|Peaceful Assembly Act 2012}}\nThe Peaceful Assembly Act (PAA) replaces Section 27 of the Police Act, which required police permits for large gatherings. Under the new act, such permits are not necessary. Instead, organizers must give the police 10 days notice of any planned gathering, after which the police will reply, outlining any restrictions they wish to place on the gathering.<ref name=\"nst\">{{cite web|title=Bill on constitutional right of citizens to assemble|url=http://www.nst.com.my/top-news/rules-on-assembly-1.9697|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> The new act forbids street protest,<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaysia passes street protest ban as lawyers march|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15933269|work=BBC News Asia|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> prohibits persons under 15 from taking part in gatherings,<ref>{{cite web|title=Peaceful Assembly Bill 2011 tabled for first reading|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/11/23/peaceful-assembly-bill-2011-tabled-for-first-reading/|work=The Borneo Post|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> prohibits persons under 21 from organising them,<ref name=\"nst\" /> and bars them from taking place near schools, mosques, airports, railway stations, and other designated places.<ref name=\"nst\" /> Though touted as a reform of Section 27 of the Police Act, the PAA has been severely criticised by the government opponents and by others as more restrictive than the legislation it replaced, with one opposition leader saying that the PAA gives \u201cabsolute powers to the police.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Kamal|first=Shazwan|title=Pakatan wants assembly law withdrawn|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pakatan-wants-assembly-law-withdrawn/|work=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124233710/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pakatan-wants-assembly-law-withdrawn|archive-date=24 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===ASEAN human-rights declaration===\nIn November 2012, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak signed the first human-rights declaration by the ASEAN nations, an action that officially committed the nation \u201cto its first foreign convention to promote fair treatment of every individual irrespective of race, religion and political opinion.\u201d This signing, it was noted, took place at a time when Malaysia had \u201ccome under close international scrutiny for its alleged mishandling of several recent human rights issues,\u201d including crackdowns on two major pro-democracy protests in July 2011 and April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Najib signs ASEAN's first human rights convention|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/najib-signs-aseans-first-human-rights-convention|work=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123045005/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/najib-signs-aseans-first-human-rights-convention/|archive-date=23 November 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia expressed its disappointment that the declaration permits \u201crestrictions to be made on grounds wider than what are accepted internationally,\u201d and pointed especially to General Principle 7, \u201cwhich declares on the one hand, that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, recognises on the other, that Member States may take into consideration their political, economic, legal, socio-cultural, and historical backgrounds in the realisation of human rights in their countries.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaysia: ASEAN Human Rights Declaration falls short of expectation|url=http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/malaysia-asean-human-rights-declaration-falls-short-of-expectation|work=Asia Pacific Forum|accessdate=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131190922/http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/malaysia-asean-human-rights-declaration-falls-short-of-expectation|archive-date=31 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Human Rights Commission of Malaysia==\n{{Main|Human Rights Commission of Malaysia}}\nThe Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, better known in the country as Suhakam (which is short for Suruhanjaya Hak Asasi Malaysia), is the country's major agency for addressing human-rights issues.\n\n==Human-rights groups==\nThe leading human-rights organisation in Malaysia is Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM). On 17 September 2012, several dozen international human-rights groups issued a joint press release protesting what they described as \u201cthe Malaysian government's ongoing harassment\u201d of SUARAM.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asian and International Human Rights Groups Urge Government to End Harassment against SUARAM|url=http://www.fidh.org/Asian-and-International-Human-12183|work=FIDH|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Basic rights==\nThe constitution forbids discrimination against citizens based on sex, religion, and race, but also accords a \"special position\" in article 153 of the constitution, to Bumiputeras, the indigenous peoples of Malaysia that applies both to ethnic Malays and to members of tribes that are indigenous to the states of Sabah and Sarawak in eastern Malaysia. Those who are not members of the ethnic Malay majority are treated according to article 153 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution where special previliges to ethnic Malays and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak are to be provided in education, employment, and other spheres.<ref name=\"state\">{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Malaysia|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154391.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Freedom of speech===\nThe freedom of speech in malaysia has been widely disputed upon as many rallies and protests including \"[[bersih]]\" has been seen to have its members arrested without warrant.\n\n===Freedom of assembly and movement===\nAlthough citizens technically enjoy the right to assembly, public gatherings are subject to police approval. The Societies Act requires organisations of seven or more people to register, with the government denying registration to certain groups, including human-rights organisations, and the Universities and University Colleges Act restricts the formation of student groups. While Malaysians generally enjoy freedom to travel within the country and abroad, and to move abroad and move back to Malaysia, residents of peninsula Malaysia require passports or national IDs to enter the states of Sabah and Sarawak, and citizens cannot travel to Israel without official permission.\n\n===Freedom of religion===\nThe constitution guarantees [[freedom of religion in Malaysia|freedom of religion]], but also describes Islam as the official religion. Among the official [[public holidays in Malaysia]] (varying by area) are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian holy days. Marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims are '''not''' recognised;<ref name=\"state\" /> ethnic Malays are considered Muslim by law.<ref name=\"state_religion\" /> Non-Sunni interpretations of Islam are illegal.<ref name=\"state_religion\">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?dlid=192641  International Religious Freedom Report for 2011: Malaysia] \u2013 U.S. State Department</ref> Islamic courts enforce [[sharia]] law in certain areas of responsibility.<ref name=\"state_religion\" /> In practice, non-Muslims face religious discrimination, including the right to own land .<ref name=\"state_religion\" /> Furthermore in several states, apostasy by Muslims is punishable by death. Malaysia will also not register interfaith marriages with Muslims.\n\n===Political freedoms===\nThough Malaysia is a multiparty constitutional monarchy, the same party has held power since 1957 and opposition parties do not compete on a level playing ground.However, the party has been voted out of office in the year 2018, ending their 61 year reign. Over the years the prime minister's power has increased and parliament's has declined. The only elected officials are members of state assemblies and of the federal parliament. Since 1969, municipal and other officials have been appointed.<ref name=\"state\" />\n\n==Children's rights==\n{{main|Children's rights in Malaysia}}\nMalaysians inherit citizenship from their parents. Persons who cannot prove that their parents were married, or whose parents were of different religions, are denied citizenship and considered stateless. Children who lack birth certificates cannot attend public or private schools. Primary education is compulsory, but this requirement is not enforced. Incest and other forms of sexual exploitation of children are common, as is the genital mutilation of girls. While statutory rape is illegal, enforcement is complicated by the fact that sharia law regards menstruating girls as adults. Child prostitutes are often treated not as victims but as delinquents. Many children of illegal immigrants live on the street and work menial jobs, commit crimes, or engage in prostitution. Malaysia is not a party to the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]],<ref name=\"state\" /> but after the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the government withdrew several but not all of its reservations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and acceded to the two optional protocols to the CRC.<ref name=\"nst\" />\n\n==Women's rights==\n{{main|Women in Malaysia}}\nAfter the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2010, although with certain reservations.<ref name=\"nst\" /> The punishment for rape in Malaysia is a prison term of up to 30 years, plus caning and a fine; the law against rape is enforced effectively.\n\nThere are crisis centres at many government hospitals where victims can report acts of rape and domestic abuse, but owing to cultural attitudes and other factors about 90 percent of rape victims remain silent. Domestic abuse cases are often complicated, moreover, by provisions of sharia law that forbid wives to disobey their husbands, including in bed. Medical treatment for women is adequate, including pre- and postpartum care.\n\n===Controversial rape laws===\nDespite effective rape enforcement, however, there is also a complicated issue concerning the way the law limits, much to the detriment of rape victims, what actually constitutes as rape. Under Section 375A of the Penal Code, page 45, rape only happens when a man's penis enters a woman's vagina sans prior consent. The penetration of women via other orifices, and by objects other than the penis, may not be considered as rape, as so was the case in 2011, where a man who had impregnated a 15-year-old girl was released by high court only because he used his finger, prompting public outcry and an ensuing rally.\n\nThis same section under the Penal Code also allows men to perform intercourse against their spouses without permission. Marital rape is not officially recognized as a crime in Malaysia, but since 2007 the government has outlawed husbands from deliberately hurting their wives for sex. Despite that, it can still be a problem for victims who have not sustained injury.\n\nAdding to the issue of marital rape is also the fact that Sharia courts allow the release of rapists who decide to marry their own victims. One case involved a man in his twenties who sexually abused an underaged girl 14 years of age, but was acquitted by the Bornean court for having married her.<ref name=theborneopost>[http://www.theborneopost.com/2016/08/05/is-marrying-the-rapist-to-the-victim-the-malaysian-way/ \"Is marrying the rapist to the victim the Malaysian way?\" The Borneo Post, Aug 5 2016.]</ref>\n\n=== Sharia courts ===\n{{main|Syariah Court}}\nWomen are discriminated against in sharia courts, especially in family-law matters. Sharia allows men to have multiple wives and favours males in inheritance cases. Non-Muslim women, and Muslim women in four states, enjoy equal parental rights. There is employment discrimination against women. In Kedah State, women performers can appear only before female audiences.<ref name=\"state\" />\n\n=== Sexual harassment ===\nSexual harassment is common, and since 2010 trains on the Malaysian Railway have included pink-coloured [[women-only passenger car|women-only cars]] as a means of cutting down on it.<ref name=\"nbcnews.com\">[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40468372/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/women-only-buses-aim-halt-sex-harassment/#.U0578CiUc_g  \"Women only buses aim to halt sex harassment\", MSNBC, 12/2/2010.]</ref> There are also women-only buses in Kuala Lumpur since 2010.<ref name=\"nbcnews.com\"/> In 2011, the government launched a women-only taxi service in the greater Kuala Lumpur area.<ref name=\"alarabiya.net\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/27/179417.html |title=\"Malaysia launches women-only taxis, hoping to reduce number of rape and robbery cases\", Al Arabiya News, Nov 27, 2011. |access-date=16 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004034930/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/27/179417.html |archive-date=4 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The taxis have women drivers, and operate on an on-call basis.<ref name=\"alarabiya.net\"/>\n\n==Disabled rights==\nDiscrimination against the disabled is legal, but the government promotes the acceptance and employment of such persons. While new government buildings are designed with disabled people in mind, older buildings and public-transportation vehicles are not. A lower excise duty is charged on cars and motorcycles designed for disabled persons. The Ministry of Human Resources is tasked with protecting disabled rights. A Persons with Disabilities Act was passed in 2008 but violators are not penalised.<ref name=\"state\" /> In the wake of the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, though with certain reservations.<ref name=\"nst\" />\n\n==Indigenous people's rights==\nFor the most part, indigenous people do not participate in decisions affecting their lives, and their rights are not effectively protected. Under the Aboriginal People's Act, members of indigenous groups do not have land rights, and logging firms encroach on their traditional lands. Although for a long time indigenous persons were often deprived of their lands without due process, this situation has improved in recent years. Malaysia is signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), but has still not ratified ILO Convention 169.\n\nThe 20-point agreement, or the 20-point memorandum, is a list of 20 points drawn up for North Borneo, proposing terms for its incorporation into the new federation as the State of Sabah, during negotiations prior to the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. Some of the twenty points were incorporated, to varying degrees, into what became the Constitution of Malaysia; others were merely accepted orally, thus not gaining legal status.

Malaysia's constitution provides for a dual justice system, under which secular law and sharia (syariah) law are both recognised, and secular criminal and civil courts coexist with sharia courts. Sharia law applies only to, and sharia courts have jurisdiction over, only Muslims. In some states sharia courts solely or principally adjudicate family and personal law, while in other states they are empowered to pass judgment on criminal matters.\n\nMalaysia's secular law is based on English common law. Defendants in serious criminal cases are entitled to government-paid lawyers. Pretrial discovery in criminal cases is limited. Testimony by witnesses is sometimes disallowed. Defendants are not routinely entitled to see evidence held by the government. The right to appeal is sometimes restricted.\n\nDue-process rights are sometimes compromised. Women do not enjoy equal treatment in sharia courts, especially in divorce and custody cases.\n\nPrivacy rights are sometimes infringed upon, with the authorities monitoring e-mails sent to websites and police permitted to search homes, confiscate items, and take people into custody without a warrant. JAKIM officials may enter private premises without a warrant if they believe Muslims are gambling, consuming alcohol, or committing adultery. Messages sent or received by individuals suspected of corruption or terrorism may be intercepted.\n\nUnder the new SOSMA legislation, the prosecutor at a trial is permitted to keep secret the identity of prosecution witnesses, thus preventing cross examination. SOSMA also revised the rules of evidence, enabling prosecutors to use information without disclosing sources.<ref name=\"hrw\" />\n\n==Rights of inmates==\nPrisoners suffer from overcrowding, poor food, and irregular water supplies.

In 2008 [[Amnesty International]] summed up the state of human rights in Malaysia, in part, by noting that the government had \u201ctightened control of dissent and curtailed the right to freedom of expression and religion,\u201d arresting bloggers under the Sedition Act, using the Printing Presses and Publications Act (PPPA) to control the content of newspapers, and arbitrarily arresting several individuals under the Internal Security Act (ISA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaysia Human Rights|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/countries/asia-and-the-pacific/malaysia|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref> In 2012 there were major changes in a number of these laws that were officially described as human-rights reforms but that have been widely criticised either for not going far enough or for, in fact, further restricting human rights.\n\n===Internal Security Act===\n{{main|Internal Security Act (Malaysia)}}\nPerhaps the best known of these laws is the Internal Security Act, which was passed in 1960, three years after the nation gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Widely viewed as draconian, it permits long-term detention without trial, and over the decades has been used systematically against individuals who have been viewed, for various reasons, as threats to Malaysia's government or to the \u201csocial order.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=PM announces repeal of ISA, three Emergency proclamations|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?sec=nation&file=/2011/9/15/nation/20110915205714|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101122631/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2011%2F9%2F15%2Fnation%2F20110915205714&sec=nation|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 January 2012|work=The Star|accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sedition Act===\nAnother powerful and widely employed piece of legislation, which dates back to 1948, when Malaysia was still a British colony, is the Sedition Act, which criminalises speech or writing that is considered to be seditious. A great many critics and political opponents of the Malaysian regime have been arrested and held under the Sedition Act, the effect of which has been to restrict freedom of expression in Malaysia.\n\n===Printing Presses and Publications Act===\nPassed in 1984, the Printing Presses and Publications Act, which makes it a crime to publish anything without a government license that must be renewed every year by the Home Minister, has been used to silence government critics and to ban various publications for a variety of reasons. As with the Sedition Act, the practical effect of the Printing Presses and Publications Act has been to severely restrict freedom of speech in Malaysia. Meanwhile, in East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), press is more free as there is less concern of controversy happenning there.\n\n===Police Act===\n{{main|Police Act 1967 (Malaysia)}}\nThe Police Act of 1967 allows the Malaysian police to detain persons without warrants, and has been used especially to restrict the freedom of assembly. Under the Police Act, until recently, police permits were required for gatherings of over four people, other than strikes,\n\n===Changes in restrictive laws===\nOn 15 September 2011, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak announced that the ISA would be totally repealed and \u201cbe replaced by a new law that incorporates far more judicial oversight and limits the powers of the police to detain suspect for preventive reasons.\u201d The government also committed itself to the repeal of some of its other best known legal instruments for restricting human rights, including the Sedition Act and Emergency Declarations and Banishment Act. In addition, the government agreed to review several laws, including Section 27 of the Police Act, the Printing Presses and Publications Act and the Official Secrets Act.\n\n===Security Offences (Special Measures) Act===\nIn a June 2012 article published in the East-West Centre in Asia Pacific Bulletin and reprinted in the Bangkok Post and on the website of Human Rights Watch, writer Mickey Spiegel noted that in April 2012, the Malaysian parliament had passed the replacement for the ISA, called the Security Offences (Special Measures) 2012 Act (SOSMA). Spiegel complained that SOSMA \u201cdoes not go far enough to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of Malaysians.\u201d In fact, asserted Spiegel, SOSMA is \"actually more repressive and retrograde\" than the ISA in some ways, an indication that the government was \u201cplaying 'bait and switch' with human rights.\u201d\n\nFor example, \u201ccoupled with amendments to other laws,\u201d SOSMA  \u201ctightened restrictions or banned outright activities already under constraint, added limits to previously unrestricted activities, and broadened police apprehension and surveillance powers in new and innovative ways.\u201d In addition, it \u201cfurther erodes citizens\u2019 individual protections, for example by ceding to the police rather than judges the power to intercept communications.\u201d\n\n===Peaceful Assembly Act===\n{{main|Peaceful Assembly Act 2012}}\nThe Peaceful Assembly Act (PAA) replaces Section 27 of the Police Act, which required police permits for large gatherings. Under the new act, such permits are not necessary. Instead, organizers must give the police 10 days notice of any planned gathering, after which the police will reply, outlining any restrictions they wish to place on the gathering.<ref name=\"nst\">{{cite web|title=Bill on constitutional right of citizens to assemble|url=http://www.nst.com.my/top-news/rules-on-assembly-1.9697|work=New Straits Times|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> The new act forbids street protest,<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaysia passes street protest ban as lawyers march|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15933269|work=BBC News Asia|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> prohibits persons under 15 from taking part in gatherings,<ref>{{cite web|title=Peaceful Assembly Bill 2011 tabled for first reading|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2011/11/23/peaceful-assembly-bill-2011-tabled-for-first-reading/|work=The Borneo Post|accessdate=24 January 2013}}</ref> prohibits persons under 21 from organising them,<ref name=\"nst\" /> and bars them from taking place near schools, mosques, airports, railway stations, and other designated places.<ref name=\"nst\" /> Though touted as a reform of Section 27 of the Police Act, the PAA has been severely criticised by the government opponents and by others as more restrictive than the legislation it replaced, with one opposition leader saying that the PAA gives \u201cabsolute powers to the police.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Kamal|first=Shazwan|title=Pakatan wants assembly law withdrawn|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pakatan-wants-assembly-law-withdrawn/|work=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124233710/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/pakatan-wants-assembly-law-withdrawn|archive-date=24 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===ASEAN human-rights declaration===\nIn November 2012, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak signed the first human-rights declaration by the ASEAN nations, an action that officially committed the nation \u201cto its first foreign convention to promote fair treatment of every individual irrespective of race, religion and political opinion.\u201d This signing, it was noted, took place at a time when Malaysia had \u201ccome under close international scrutiny for its alleged mishandling of several recent human rights issues,\u201d including crackdowns on two major pro-democracy protests in July 2011 and April 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Najib signs ASEAN's first human rights convention|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/najib-signs-aseans-first-human-rights-convention|work=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123045005/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/najib-signs-aseans-first-human-rights-convention/|archive-date=23 November 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia expressed its disappointment that the declaration permits \u201crestrictions to be made on grounds wider than what are accepted internationally,\u201d and pointed especially to General Principle 7, \u201cwhich declares on the one hand, that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, recognises on the other, that Member States may take into consideration their political, economic, legal, socio-cultural, and historical backgrounds in the realisation of human rights in their countries.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaysia: ASEAN Human Rights Declaration falls short of expectation|url=http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/malaysia-asean-human-rights-declaration-falls-short-of-expectation|work=Asia Pacific Forum|accessdate=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131190922/http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/malaysia-asean-human-rights-declaration-falls-short-of-expectation|archive-date=31 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Human Rights Commission of Malaysia==\n{{Main|Human Rights Commission of Malaysia}}\nThe Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, better known in the country as Suhakam (which is short for Suruhanjaya Hak Asasi Malaysia), is the country's major agency for addressing human-rights issues.\n\n==Human-rights groups==\nThe leading human-rights organisation in Malaysia is Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM). On 17 September 2012, several dozen international human-rights groups issued a joint press release protesting what they described as \u201cthe Malaysian government's ongoing harassment\u201d of SUARAM.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asian and International Human Rights Groups Urge Government to End Harassment against SUARAM|url=http://www.fidh.org/Asian-and-International-Human-12183|work=FIDH|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Basic rights==\nThe constitution forbids discrimination against citizens based on sex, religion, and race, but also accords a \"special position\" in article 153 of the constitution, to Bumiputeras, the indigenous peoples of Malaysia that applies both to ethnic Malays and to members of tribes that are indigenous to the states of Sabah and Sarawak in eastern Malaysia.

The Societies Act requires organisations of seven or more people to register, with the government denying registration to certain groups, including human-rights organisations, and the Universities and University Colleges Act restricts the formation of student groups. While Malaysians generally enjoy freedom to travel within the country and abroad, and to move abroad and move back to Malaysia, residents of peninsula Malaysia require passports or national IDs to enter the states of Sabah and Sarawak, and citizens cannot travel to Israel without official permission.\n\n===Freedom of religion===\nThe constitution guarantees [[freedom of religion in Malaysia|freedom of religion]], but also describes Islam as the official religion. Among the official [[public holidays in Malaysia]] (varying by area) are Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian holy days. Marriages between Muslims and non-Muslims are '''not''' recognised;<ref name=\"state\" /> ethnic Malays are considered Muslim by law.<ref name=\"state_religion\" /> Non-Sunni interpretations of Islam are illegal.<ref name=\"state_religion\">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm?dlid=192641  International Religious Freedom Report for 2011: Malaysia] \u2013 U.S. State Department</ref> Islamic courts enforce [[sharia]] law in certain areas of responsibility.<ref name=\"state_religion\" /> In practice, non-Muslims face religious discrimination, including the right to own land .<ref name=\"state_religion\" /> Furthermore in several states, apostasy by Muslims is punishable by death. Malaysia will also not register interfaith marriages with Muslims.\n\n===Political freedoms===\nThough Malaysia is a multiparty constitutional monarchy, the same party has held power since 1957 and opposition parties do not compete on a level playing ground.However, the party has been voted out of office in the year 2018, ending their 61 year reign. Over the years the prime minister's power has increased and parliament's has declined. The only elected officials are members of state assemblies and of the federal parliament. Since 1969, municipal and other officials have been appointed.<ref name=\"state\" />\n\n==Children's rights==\n{{main|Children's rights in Malaysia}}\nMalaysians inherit citizenship from their parents. Persons who cannot prove that their parents were married, or whose parents were of different religions, are denied citizenship and considered stateless. Children who lack birth certificates cannot attend public or private schools. Primary education is compulsory, but this requirement is not enforced. Incest and other forms of sexual exploitation of children are common, as is the genital mutilation of girls. While statutory rape is illegal, enforcement is complicated by the fact that sharia law regards menstruating girls as adults. Child prostitutes are often treated not as victims but as delinquents. Many children of illegal immigrants live on the street and work menial jobs, commit crimes, or engage in prostitution. Malaysia is not a party to the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]],<ref name=\"state\" /> but after the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the government withdrew several but not all of its reservations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and acceded to the two optional protocols to the CRC.<ref name=\"nst\" />\n\n==Women's rights==\n{{main|Women in Malaysia}}\nAfter the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, the government ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 2010, although with certain reservations.<ref name=\"nst\" /> The punishment for rape in Malaysia is a prison term of up to 30 years, plus caning and a fine; the law against rape is enforced effectively.\n\nThere are crisis centres at many government hospitals where victims can report acts of rape and domestic abuse, but owing to cultural attitudes and other factors about 90 percent of rape victims remain silent. Domestic abuse cases are often complicated, moreover, by provisions of sharia law that forbid wives to disobey their husbands, including in bed. Medical treatment for women is adequate, including pre- and postpartum care.\n\n===Controversial rape laws===\nDespite effective rape enforcement, however, there is also a complicated issue concerning the way the law limits, much to the detriment of rape victims, what actually constitutes as rape. Under Section 375A of the Penal Code, page 45, rape only happens when a man's penis enters a woman's vagina sans prior consent. The penetration of women via other orifices, and by objects other than the penis, may not be considered as rape, as so was the case in 2011, where a man who had impregnated a 15-year-old girl was released by high court only because he used his finger, prompting public outcry and an ensuing rally.\n\nThis same section under the Penal Code also allows men to perform intercourse against their spouses without permission. Marital rape is not officially recognized as a crime in Malaysia, but since 2007 the government has outlawed husbands from deliberately hurting their wives for sex. Despite that, it can still be a problem for victims who have not sustained injury.\n\nAdding to the issue of marital rape is also the fact that Sharia courts allow the release of rapists who decide to marry their own victims. One case involved a man in his twenties who sexually abused an underaged girl 14 years of age, but was acquitted by the Bornean court for having married her.<ref name=theborneopost>[http://www.theborneopost.com/2016/08/05/is-marrying-the-rapist-to-the-victim-the-malaysian-way/ \"Is marrying the rapist to the victim the Malaysian way?\" The Borneo Post, Aug 5 2016.]</ref>\n\n=== Sharia courts ===\n{{main|Syariah Court}}\nWomen are discriminated against in sharia courts, especially in family-law matters. Sharia allows men to have multiple wives and favours males in inheritance cases. Non-Muslim women, and Muslim women in four states, enjoy equal parental rights. There is employment discrimination against women. In Kedah State, women performers can appear only before female audiences.<ref name=\"state\" />\n\n=== Sexual harassment ===\nSexual harassment is common, and since 2010 trains on the Malaysian Railway have included pink-coloured [[women-only passenger car|women-only cars]] as a means of cutting down on it.<ref name=\"nbcnews.com\">[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40468372/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/women-only-buses-aim-halt-sex-harassment/#.U0578CiUc_g  \"Women only buses aim to halt sex harassment\", MSNBC, 12/2/2010.]</ref> There are also women-only buses in Kuala Lumpur since 2010.<ref name=\"nbcnews.com\"/> In 2011, the government launched a women-only taxi service in the greater Kuala Lumpur area.<ref name=\"alarabiya.net\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/27/179417.html |title=\"Malaysia launches women-only taxis, hoping to reduce number of rape and robbery cases\", Al Arabiya News, Nov 27, 2011. |access-date=16 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004034930/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/11/27/179417.html |archive-date=4 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The taxis have women drivers, and operate on an on-call basis.<ref name=\"alarabiya.net\"/>\n\n==Disabled rights==\nDiscrimination against the disabled is legal, but the government promotes the acceptance and employment of such persons. While new government buildings are designed with disabled people in mind, older buildings and public-transportation vehicles are not. A lower excise duty is charged on cars and motorcycles designed for disabled persons. The Ministry of Human Resources is tasked with protecting disabled rights. A Persons with Disabilities Act was passed in 2008 but violators are not penalised.<ref name=\"state\" /> In the wake of the UN's Universal Periodic Review of Malaysia in 2009, Malaysia ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, though with certain reservations.<ref name=\"nst\" />\n\n==Indigenous people's rights==\nFor the most part, indigenous people do not participate in decisions affecting their lives, and their rights are not effectively protected. Under the Aboriginal People's Act, members of indigenous groups do not have land rights, and logging firms encroach on their traditional lands. Although for a long time indigenous persons were often deprived of their lands without due process, this situation has improved in recent years. Malaysia is signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), but has still not ratified ILO Convention 169.\n\nThe 20-point agreement, or the 20-point memorandum, is a list of 20 points drawn up for North Borneo, proposing terms for its incorporation into the new federation as the State of Sabah, during negotiations prior to the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. Some of the twenty points were incorporated, to varying degrees, into what became the Constitution of Malaysia; others were merely accepted orally, thus not gaining legal status.

In December of that year Human Rights Watch decried Najib's remarks, saying that his \u201cactions against LGBT people are a glaring contradiction to his self-proclaimed profile as a 'global moderate' leader.\u201d Those actions include shutting down a November 2011 sexual-diversity festival and a government program to train people to \u201cconvert gays.\u201d\n\nThe Malaysian establishment's view of LGBT rights was reflected in a 12 September 2012, letter to a Malaysian newspaper by the vice-president of the Muslim Lawyers Association of Malaysia, [http://azrilmohdamin.com/ Azril Mohd Amin]. Writing about the proposed declaration of human rights by the ASEAN countries, Azril, [http://azrilmohdamin.com/2012/09/09/the-ultimate-confrontation-2/ wrote] that: \u201cThere will be attempts by LGBTs, NGOs, and various other activists to include LGBT rights and the right of absolute freedom of religion in the declaration.\u201d But if such rights were included in the declaration, \u201cMalaysia as a Muslim-majority country would have to reiterate her strong objections; as such a policy clearly contradicts the principles enshrined in the religion of Islam.\u201d According social recognition to LGBT people \u201cwould be confusing and destructive to the development and witness of our own children....Malaysian and those who are against LGBT rights are thereby protecting the human race from the secular fallacy, perpetrated by the United Nations, that human beings may do as they please, within their so-called 'sovereign borders' (as laid down by the European powers).<ref name=\"malaysianbar\" />\n\n==Rights of refugees and asylum seekers==\nMalaysia is not a party to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, and it has no provision for the granting of asylum or refugee status or for protecting persons from being returned to countries where their lives are in danger.  Nonetheless, Malaysia does co-operate with UNHCR by not deporting registered refugees whose resettlement in other nations is being arranged. Illegal immigrants and asylum seekers are held in immigration detention centres (IDCs). Since 2009, Malaysia has not deported persons carrying UNHCR refugee cards. Refugees may work but are not provided with access to education. Immigration officials used to be accused of trafficking IDC-held refugees to Thailand to be sold into slavery, but no such accusations were made in 2010.<ref name=\"state\" />\nAccording to Amnesty International, officers of RELA (Ikatan Relawan Rakyat), a civilian volunteer force that is empowered to arrest migrants and refugees, \u201coften extort money from migrants and refugees, and sometimes beat them.\u201d<ref name=\"amnestyusa\">{{cite web|title=Annual Report: Malaysia 2011|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-malaysia-2011?page=3|work=Amnesty International|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Trafficking in persons==\nMalaysia, according to Amnesty International, \u201cis a destination and, to a lesser extent, a source and transit country for women and children trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation, and men, women, and children for forced labor....Malaysia improved from Tier 3 to the Tier 2 Watch List for 2008 when it enacted comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation in July 2007.\u201d<ref name=\"amnestyusa\" />\n\n==Employee rights==\nMost workers can join unions, but this right is restricted by the Trade Unions Act (TUA) and the Industrial Relations Act (IRA), as well as by other laws limiting the freedom of association.

Forced labour is illegal, but occurs, with many women and children essentially being forced to work in households, and many of them suffering abuse. Children under 14 are not allowed to work but some exceptions are permitted. The Employment Act limits working hours and imposes other restrictions, but they are not enforced strictly. The [[US Department of Labor]]'s ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]'' indicates that instances of child labour and forced labour have been observed in the electronics and the textile industries as well as in the [[Palm oil production in Malaysia|production of palm oil]]. Many foreign employees work under unfair and abusive conditions, with employers withholding pay and confiscating passports. There is an Occupational Safety and Health Act, but workers who walk out of dangerous workplaces are subject to dismissal.<ref name=\"state\" />\n\n==Rights of persons under arrest==\nWarrantless arrests are not permitted, and suspects may be held without charge for up to three weeks with a magistrate's permission. Suspects are sometimes released and then rearrested, often questioned without being offered legal representation, and occasionally denied family visits. Detention of material witnesses in criminal cases is permitted. Pretrial detention can last several years. Several laws permit the detention of suspects without judicial review or the filing of charges.<ref name=\"state\" />\n\nUnder the ISA, police were permitted to arrest and detain for sixty days, without warrant or counsel or judicial review, persons who acted \u201cin a manner prejudicial to the national security or economic life of Malaysia.\u201d The ISA did not permit judicial review of most ISA decisions, and the UN Human Rights Council considered the ISA inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Under SOSMA, \u201cinitial police detention is cut to a maximum of 28 days, after which the attorney-general must decide whether to prosecute and on what charges.\u201d But \u201cjudicial oversight is notably absent during the first 24 hours of police custody and such absence can be extended to the entire 28-day investigatory period.\u201d While SOSMA \u201cpromised to ease incommunicado detention by mandating immediate notification of next-of-kin and access to a lawyer chosen by the suspect,\u201d in fact \u201cinitial access can be postponed for 48 hours should a higher level police officer consider it prudent; another serious violation of an individual's due process rights.\u201d<ref name=\"hrw\">{{cite web|title=Smoke and Mirrors: Malaysia's \"New\" Internal Security Act|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/06/19/smoke-and-mirrors-malaysia-s-new-internal-security-act|work=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Emergency Ordinance (EO) empowers the home minister to issue an order to detain persons for up to two years to preserve public order or prevent violent crimes. In 2009, 548 persons were held under the EO. Suspected drug traffickers, including those already freed by ordinary court processes, may be arrested and held for 39 days without trial or a detention order, and thereafter held without charge indefinitely, with their detention approved every two years by an advisory board. In 2009, over 1000 persons were detained in this fashion. Under the Restricted Residence Act, the home affairs minister may compel individuals to live in residences other than their homes and to remain within the neighbourhood; such an order can be renewed indefinitely by authorities.\n\nIn 2009 alone, police killed 108 persons during arrests. Torture as such is not illegal.

Malaysia's constitution provides for a dual justice system, under which secular law and sharia (syariah) law are both recognised, and secular criminal and civil courts coexist with sharia courts. Sharia law applies only to, and sharia courts have jurisdiction over, only Muslims. In some states sharia courts solely or principally adjudicate family and personal law, while in other states they are empowered to pass judgment on criminal matters.\n\nMalaysia's secular law is based on English common law. Defendants in serious criminal cases are entitled to government-paid lawyers. Pretrial discovery in criminal cases is limited. Testimony by witnesses is sometimes disallowed. Defendants are not routinely entitled to see evidence held by the government. The right to appeal is sometimes restricted.\n\nDue-process rights are sometimes compromised. Women do not enjoy equal treatment in sharia courts, especially in divorce and custody cases.\n\nPrivacy rights are sometimes infringed upon, with the authorities monitoring e-mails sent to websites and police permitted to search homes, confiscate items, and take people into custody without a warrant. JAKIM officials may enter private premises without a warrant if they believe Muslims are gambling, consuming alcohol, or committing adultery. Messages sent or received by individuals suspected of corruption or terrorism may be intercepted.\n\nUnder the new SOSMA legislation, the prosecutor at a trial is permitted to keep secret the identity of prosecution witnesses, thus preventing cross examination. SOSMA also revised the rules of evidence, enabling prosecutors to use information without disclosing sources.<ref name=\"hrw\" />\n\n==Rights of inmates==\nPrisoners suffer from overcrowding, poor food, and irregular water supplies. Inmates are allowed visitors. Religious observance is allowed, provided the religion in question is not one of 56 Islamic sects considered \u201cdeviant.\u201d Medical care is poor, with hundreds dying of communicable diseases in IDCs, prisons, and jails from 2001\u20132007. NGOs and the media are usually not allowed to monitor conditions in prison. Preventive and investigative detention are permitted. Police are provided with human-rights training. Caning is a common punishment for serious crimes; boys over 10 may be sentenced to what is called a light caning.<ref name=\"state\" />\n\n==Caning==\n{{main|Caning in Malaysia}}\nUnder sharia, several dozen offences such as drinking alcohol and being close to a person of the opposite sex are subject to caning.<ref name=\"state\" /> The death penalty is the mandatory punishment for persons found guilty of possessing illegal drugs above certain quantities; in 2010, 114 people were sentenced to hanging.<ref name=\"amnestyusa\" />\n\nA 6 December 2010 [[Amnesty International]] report entitled ''A Blow to Humanity'' criticises the increasing use of judicial canings in Malaysia and concludes the punishment \"subjects thousands of people each year to systematic torture and ill-treatment, leaving them with permanent physical and psychological scars\". The report describes the abuse: \"In Malaysian prisons specially trained caning officers tear into victims\u2019 bodies with a metre-long cane swung with both hands at high speed.

It was originally sent to radio on January 19, 2010 by [[J Records]], as the fourth single from Keys' fourth [[studio album]], ''[[The Element of Freedom]]'' (2009). However, the full single release was postponed and \"[[Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)]]\" was released as the next single. The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] song talks about a girl who just wants her lover to write her a song and prove to her he's worth her time.\n\nShortly after being sent to radio, the song peaked at number 23 on the US [[Rhythmic (chart)|Rhythmic Songs]] chart and number 60 on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. The single charted at number seventy-one on the [[Canadian Hot 100]]. The song was more successful in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]], where it peaked at number eighteen and was certified [[List of music recording sales certifications|Gold]] by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), for selling over 35,000 units.

In 1835, he enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], where he studied with [[Johann Ender]] and [[Leopold Kupelwieser]],<ref name=\"M\">[http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC16920/16992.htm Magyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikonban]: Brief biography.</ref> who taught the history of [[aesthetics]]. Under their influence, he rejected the prevailing [[Academic art|Academicism]] and embraced [[Realism (art)|Realism]]. During his studies, he also worked as a [[lithographer]] and gave art lessons. After holding a successful exhibition, he became popular as a portrait painter and was able to stay in Vienna until the end of the 1830s, working in both urban and rural areas.\n\nIn 1840, as the vogue for portraits waned in Vienna, he moved to Munich<ref name=\"M\" /> in hopes of continuing his career. He had no better luck there and turned to producing scenes from Hungarian history, such as the death of [[John Hunyadi]].

Lilley]] with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole persuaded Lilley to coach the football team during its first full season that fall.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOSU's first home game took place at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the [[The College of Wooster|University of Wooster]] on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64\u20130.\n\nOver the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], was a 34\u20130 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1\u20137\u20131 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against [[Oberlin College]] and [[John Heisman]], on October 15, 1892.<ref>Walsh, Christopher (2009). ''Ohio State Football Football Huddleup'', Triumph Books (Random House, Inc.), {{ISBN|978-1-60078-186-5}}, p. 69.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.<ref name=\"Spring08\">[http://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/fls/17300/pdf/fb/guide/08_Spring_p100to129.pdf?SPSID=87751&SPID=10408&DB_OEM_ID=17300 Ohio State Spring Football 2008 \u2013 Part 2]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}, OSU Athletics, Spring 2008.</ref> In 1901, however, [[Center (American football)|center]] John Segrist was fatally injured in a game against [[Case Western Reserve Spartans football|Western Reserve University]] and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.<ref>Park, p.28</ref>  In 1912 football underwent a number of developments that included joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]], making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring [[Lynn St. John|Lynn W. St. John]] to be [[athletic director]].\n\n[[Chic Harley]] attended East High in Columbus and was one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. He passed, ran, received, punted, kicked and played defense. Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with the Chic. Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7\u20130. He would repeat in 1917 finishing 8\u20130\u20131, giving the Buckeyes a second outright title. In 1918, he left to be a pilot in the air force for World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game\u2014to Illinois. Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22\u20131\u20131. At the time, OSU played at the small [[Ohio Field]] and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open [[Ohio Stadium]] in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member.\n\nOhio State's very first rival was [[Kenyon College]], a small liberal arts college in [[Gambier, Ohio|Gambier]], roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished.  Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 18\u20136, OSU.\n\n===Francis Schmidt (1934\u20131940)===\nIn hiring [[Francis Schmidt]] in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7\u20131, its sole loss was to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], 18\u201313, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.<ref>Park, p.166.</ref> On December 17, 1940, he resigned.\n\n===Paul Brown (1941\u20131943)===\n[[File:Paul Brown, American football head coach.png|right|thumb|175px|[[Paul Brown]] (shown here as head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]]) \u2013 who led the Buckeyes to their first national championship in 1942.]]\nOhio State hired the coach of [[Massillon Washington High School]] football team, [[Paul Brown]], to succeed Schmidt. Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship.\n\n===Carroll Widdoes (1944\u20131945), Paul Bixler (1946) and Wes Fesler (1947\u20131950)===\nBrown accepted a commission in the [[United States Navy]] in 1944 and directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31&nbsp;[[First year|freshmen]] but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind [[United States Military Academy#Other sports|Army]] and [[Les Horvath]] became the first Buckeye to be awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Also prominent on the 1942\u201344 teams was the first Buckeye [[African American]] star, [[Bill Willis]].\n\nBrown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator [[Paul Bixler]] and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4\u20133\u20132 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.<ref name=\"SIbix\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/specials/preview/2006/teams/ten/ohiost.html| title = 2006 Team previews- Ohio State| work =  | publisher = SI.com| accessdate = August 20, 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Wes Fesler]] became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore [[Vic Janowicz]]. Ohio State received the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] invitation, where they came from behind to defeat [[California Golden Bears|California]]. In 1950 Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a [[blizzard]], a game that came to be known as the \"[[Snow Bowl (1950)|Snow Bowl]]\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned.\n\n===Woody Hayes era (1951\u20131978)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[Woody Hayes|Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes]] beat out Paul Brown,<ref>Park, p.275</ref> among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952 the team improved to 6\u20133, and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes.\n\nIn 1954 the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of [[Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady]], and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18&nbsp;years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\".\n\nIn a 1955 article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Hayes admitted making small personal loans to financially needy players.<ref name=\"sishaplen\">{{cite web| url = http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| title = #11\u2014Iowa at Ohio State\u2014November 11, 1957| publisher = The Buckeye 50 Yard Line| accessdate = October 2, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061127011223/http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| archivedate = November 27, 2006| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>  The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957 Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], and share a national title with [[Auburn University|Auburn]], for which Hayes was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]].\n\nIn 1961 the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the [[Football Writers Association of America|FWAA]] but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.<ref>Park, pp. 340 and 342.</ref>  Over the next 6 seasons Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd, and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as coach grew to its highest point since 1953.\n\nIn 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked [[Purdue Boilermakers]] and continued to an undefeated season including a 50\u201314 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the [[USC Trojans]] that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968, and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach [[Bo Schembechler]], Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24\u201312 upset.\n\nThe 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.<ref name=\"maisel\">{{cite web | year = | url = http://proxy.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=1667333| title = UM-OSU more than just a game| work =  | publisher = ESPN| accessdate = October 13, 2006}}</ref> Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup.  The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10\u20137 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971.\n\nBoth teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention.\n\nHayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 \u2014 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.<ref>Park, p.391. Park has a picture of the rug.</ref>  The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37&nbsp;yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to [[Bruce Jankowski]] to win 20\u20139. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] 27\u201317. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27\u20132, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The [[National Football Foundation]] named Ohio State its national champion for 1970.\n\n1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. [[Archie Griffin]] began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against [[North Carolina Tarheels|North Carolina]] late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239&nbsp;yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867.\n\n[[File:Archie Griffin.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Former Buckeyes RB [[Archie Griffin]], the only two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in college football history (1974\u201375)]]\nThe following season Hayes installed an [[I-formation]] attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore [[Cornelius Greene]] at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10\u201310 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion [[University of Southern California|USC]], however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]] in the final [[Associated Press|AP]] rankings. Griffin, [[Randy Gradishar]], [[Van DeCree]], and [[John Hicks (American football)|John Hicks]] were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the [[Outland Trophy|Outland]] and [[Lombardi Award|Lombardi Trophies]], but placed second in the [[Heisman Trophy]] competition.\n\n1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's 4-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year the #1-ranked Bucks lost 23\u201310 to 11th-ranked [[UCLA]] in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all the Buckeyes were 40\u20135\u20131 from 1972\u201375, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but each loss and the tie were crucial in failing to win another championship. Archie Griffin, however, received the [[Heisman Trophy]] for both years, off-setting much of the frustration, and amassed 5,589&nbsp;yards in his career.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe falloff in success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9\u20132\u20131, 9\u20133, and 7\u20134\u20131, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised [[Gator Bowl]], Hayes punched [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]] [[middle guard]] Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win. Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Earle Bruce (1979\u20131987)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\nHayes was replaced by a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Earle Bruce]]. Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17\u201316, but Bruce was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]]. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".<ref name=\"earle\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946372-1,00.html| title = Making 'Em Forget Woody| work =  | publisher = Time Magazine| accessdate = December 11, 2006 | date=November 12, 1979}}</ref>\n\n1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9\u20133 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9\u20133. Though each of these seasons, and the 10\u20133 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future [[National Football League]] stars included [[Keith Byars]], [[Cris Carter]], [[Chris Spielman]], [[John E. Frank|John Frank]], [[Jim Lachey]], [[Tom Tupa]], [[Marcus Marek]], and [[Pepper Johnson]]. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including [[Jim Tressel]], [[Glen Mason]], [[Pete Carroll]], [[Nick Saban]], [[Urban Meyer]] and [[Dom Capers]].\n\nThe 1980 team was selected as the top-ranked team of the pre-season AP poll and opened the season with four games at home, but were shocked in the fourth game by UCLA, shut out 17\u20130. The team rebounded to win its next six easily, but then were shut down by a ball-control Michigan team that allowed the Buckeyes only 23 minutes with the ball, then lost again to [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] in the [[Fiesta Bowl]].\n\nIn 1981, Ohio State opened strong, including a victory at [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] in which senior Art Schlichter out-dueled [[John Elway]], but then lost back-to-back games to [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]] and [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] (their first victory over the Buckeyes in 22 games). The Buckeyes continued to struggle on defense, losing a third time, at [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Minnesota]]. Victories over Michigan to gain a share of the Big Ten championship and over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]] salvaged the season.\n\nFor the first time since 1922 the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over [[Brigham Young University#Football|BYU]] in the [[Holiday Bowl]]. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24\u20130 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45\u201338. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting.\n\nByars broke his toe just prior to the start of the 1985 season, ending his Heisman hopes and seriously handicapping the Buckeye attack. He returned against Purdue with Ohio State at 4\u20131 and scored twice, but then re-injured his foot the next week against Minnesota. Iowa was top-ranked nationally when they came into Ohio Stadium favored to end the longest home winning streak in the country, and were the first #1 team the Buckeyes faced since Purdue in 1968. Ohio State's defense dominated with four interceptions to win 22\u201313.\n\nIn 1986 Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his [[alma mater]] by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver [[Cris Carter]] was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31\u201310, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\", and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game.\n\nOn the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President [[Edward H. Jennings|Edward Jennings]] fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.<ref>Park, pp. 537\u2013538</ref> The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore [[headband]]s bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the [[Sun Bowl]].\n\n===John Cooper (1988\u20132000)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[John Cooper (coach)|John Cooper]] was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at [[Arizona State University]]. Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]] prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.\n\nCooper's thirteen years as Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2\u201310\u20131 record against Michigan, a 3\u20138 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6\u20137 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28\u201324 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the [[National Football League]].<ref name=\"coopbio\">{{cite web| year = | url = http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/cooper_john01.html| title = John Cooper Profile| work = | publisher = TOSU Football Official Site| accessdate = December 19, 2006}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nBoth 1988 and 1989 began identically: an impressive season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team ([[Pitt Panthers|Pitt]] and [[USC Trojans|USC]]); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs ([[LSU Tigers|LSU]] and [[Boston College Eagles|Boston College]]) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4\u20136\u20131 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8\u20134. The most noteworthy victory occurred in [[Minneapolis]] when Ohio State overcame a 31\u20130 deficit to Minnesota to win 41\u201337.\n\n1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7\u20134\u20131 record that included an embarrassing loss to [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]]. 1991 was 8\u20134, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back [[Robert Smith (running back)|Robert Smith]] quit the team. 1992, with senior [[Kirk Herbstreit]] at quarterback, and Smith back on the team was 8\u20133\u20131, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13\u201313 tie.

The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with [[South Carolina Gamecocks|South Carolina]] in the [[Outback Bowl]], when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 [[GPA]], team captain [[Matt Wilhelm]] publicly criticized fellow player [[Ken-Yon Rambo]], and one Buckeye lineman sued another.<ref name=\"reggie&co\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/2000/bowls/outback/| title = Getting a Little Payback| work =  | publisher = CNN-Sports Illustrated| accessdate = December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2001, Cooper was fired. His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game.  Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team.\n\n===Jim Tressel (2001\u20132010)===\n[[File:Coach Tressel.png|175px|thumb|left|Former head coach [[Jim Tressel]], who led the Buckeyes to the 2002 national championship, and six Big Ten titles.]]\nOhio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel. With four NCAA [[Division I-AA]] National Championships at [[Youngstown State University]], Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm.

its most renowned and intense, Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity, both [[Big Ten Conference]] rivals, those of [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]]. The series versus Indiana began as a non-conference matchup, with Indiana going undefeated at 4\u20130\u20131. In conference, however, the Buckeyes (despite losing the opening conference game) are 70\u20138\u20134 through the 2014 season, the most wins against any opponent. Illinois also began with non-conference games (0\u20131\u20131) but became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year (that record was tied by Michigan in 2007). Through 2014 Ohio State's record against the Illini is 66\u201330\u20134. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini.\n\nWhen Penn State was added to the conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan, and Illinois was set to be paired with in-state rival [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and neighboring Indiana despite Ohio State's historical rivalry with Illinois.\n\nWith Nebraska's entry to the Big Ten and the establishment of division play in football, Ohio State and Illinois played every season in the Leaders Division from 2011 to 2013. Michigan was the Buckeyes' permanent cross-division rival from the Legends Division.\n\nWith the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten, Ohio State and Illinois will be in separate divisions and will no longer meet every year. Ohio State and Michigan also became East Division rivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2013/04/28/big-ten-sets-new-divisions-nine-game-schedule/2119055/ | work=USA Today | first1=Mark | last1=Snyder | title=Big Ten approves new divisions, schedule | date=April 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Coaches==\n{{See also|List of Ohio State Buckeyes head football coaches}}\nThe Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history.

On the site of the first OSU game, on the campus of [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in [[Delaware, Ohio]], on May 3, 1890, the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book |last=Roman |first=Robert J. |date=2017 |title=Ohio State Football: The Forgotten Dawn |url= |location= |publisher=University of Akron Press |page= |isbn=1629220663 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nSome histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole, an undergraduate, and [[Alexander S. Lilley]] with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole persuaded Lilley to coach the football team during its first full season that fall.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOSU's first home game took place at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the [[The College of Wooster|University of Wooster]] on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64\u20130.\n\nOver the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], was a 34\u20130 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1\u20137\u20131 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against [[Oberlin College]] and [[John Heisman]], on October 15, 1892.<ref>Walsh, Christopher (2009). ''Ohio State Football Football Huddleup'', Triumph Books (Random House, Inc.), {{ISBN|978-1-60078-186-5}}, p. 69.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.<ref name=\"Spring08\">[http://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/fls/17300/pdf/fb/guide/08_Spring_p100to129.pdf?SPSID=87751&SPID=10408&DB_OEM_ID=17300 Ohio State Spring Football 2008 \u2013 Part 2]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}, OSU Athletics, Spring 2008.</ref> In 1901, however, [[Center (American football)|center]] John Segrist was fatally injured in a game against [[Case Western Reserve Spartans football|Western Reserve University]] and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.<ref>Park, p.28</ref>  In 1912 football underwent a number of developments that included joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]], making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring [[Lynn St. John|Lynn W. St. John]] to be [[athletic director]].\n\n[[Chic Harley]] attended East High in Columbus and was one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. He passed, ran, received, punted, kicked and played defense. Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with the Chic. Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7\u20130. He would repeat in 1917 finishing 8\u20130\u20131, giving the Buckeyes a second outright title. In 1918, he left to be a pilot in the air force for World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game\u2014to Illinois. Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22\u20131\u20131. At the time, OSU played at the small [[Ohio Field]] and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open [[Ohio Stadium]] in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member.\n\nOhio State's very first rival was [[Kenyon College]], a small liberal arts college in [[Gambier, Ohio|Gambier]], roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished.  Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 18\u20136, OSU.\n\n===Francis Schmidt (1934\u20131940)===\nIn hiring [[Francis Schmidt]] in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7\u20131, its sole loss was to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], 18\u201313, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.<ref>Park, p.166.</ref> On December 17, 1940, he resigned.\n\n===Paul Brown (1941\u20131943)===\n[[File:Paul Brown, American football head coach.png|right|thumb|175px|[[Paul Brown]] (shown here as head coach of the [[Cleveland Browns]]) \u2013 who led the Buckeyes to their first national championship in 1942.]]\nOhio State hired the coach of [[Massillon Washington High School]] football team, [[Paul Brown]], to succeed Schmidt. Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship.\n\n===Carroll Widdoes (1944\u20131945), Paul Bixler (1946) and Wes Fesler (1947\u20131950)===\nBrown accepted a commission in the [[United States Navy]] in 1944 and directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31&nbsp;[[First year|freshmen]] but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind [[United States Military Academy#Other sports|Army]] and [[Les Horvath]] became the first Buckeye to be awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Also prominent on the 1942\u201344 teams was the first Buckeye [[African American]] star, [[Bill Willis]].\n\nBrown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator [[Paul Bixler]] and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4\u20133\u20132 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.<ref name=\"SIbix\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/specials/preview/2006/teams/ten/ohiost.html| title = 2006 Team previews- Ohio State| work =  | publisher = SI.com| accessdate = August 20, 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Wes Fesler]] became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore [[Vic Janowicz]]. Ohio State received the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] invitation, where they came from behind to defeat [[California Golden Bears|California]]. In 1950 Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a [[blizzard]], a game that came to be known as the \"[[Snow Bowl (1950)|Snow Bowl]]\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned.\n\n===Woody Hayes era (1951\u20131978)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[Woody Hayes|Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes]] beat out Paul Brown,<ref>Park, p.275</ref> among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952 the team improved to 6\u20133, and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes.\n\nIn 1954 the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of [[Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady]], and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18&nbsp;years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\".\n\nIn a 1955 article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Hayes admitted making small personal loans to financially needy players.<ref name=\"sishaplen\">{{cite web| url = http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| title = #11\u2014Iowa at Ohio State\u2014November 11, 1957| publisher = The Buckeye 50 Yard Line| accessdate = October 2, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061127011223/http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| archivedate = November 27, 2006| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>  The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957 Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], and share a national title with [[Auburn University|Auburn]], for which Hayes was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]].\n\nIn 1961 the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the [[Football Writers Association of America|FWAA]] but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.<ref>Park, pp. 340 and 342.</ref>  Over the next 6 seasons Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd, and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as coach grew to its highest point since 1953.\n\nIn 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked [[Purdue Boilermakers]] and continued to an undefeated season including a 50\u201314 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the [[USC Trojans]] that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968, and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach [[Bo Schembechler]], Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24\u201312 upset.\n\nThe 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.<ref name=\"maisel\">{{cite web | year = | url = http://proxy.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&id=1667333| title = UM-OSU more than just a game| work =  | publisher = ESPN| accessdate = October 13, 2006}}</ref> Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup.  The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10\u20137 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971.\n\nBoth teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention.\n\nHayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 \u2014 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.<ref>Park, p.391. Park has a picture of the rug.</ref>  The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37&nbsp;yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to [[Bruce Jankowski]] to win 20\u20139. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] 27\u201317. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27\u20132, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The [[National Football Foundation]] named Ohio State its national champion for 1970.\n\n1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. [[Archie Griffin]] began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against [[North Carolina Tarheels|North Carolina]] late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239&nbsp;yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867.\n\n[[File:Archie Griffin.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Former Buckeyes RB [[Archie Griffin]], the only two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in college football history (1974\u201375)]]\nThe following season Hayes installed an [[I-formation]] attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore [[Cornelius Greene]] at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10\u201310 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion [[University of Southern California|USC]], however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]] in the final [[Associated Press|AP]] rankings. Griffin, [[Randy Gradishar]], [[Van DeCree]], and [[John Hicks (American football)|John Hicks]] were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the [[Outland Trophy|Outland]] and [[Lombardi Award|Lombardi Trophies]], but placed second in the [[Heisman Trophy]] competition.\n\n1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked [[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]] (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's 4-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year the #1-ranked Bucks lost 23\u201310 to 11th-ranked [[UCLA]] in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all the Buckeyes were 40\u20135\u20131 from 1972\u201375, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but each loss and the tie were crucial in failing to win another championship. Archie Griffin, however, received the [[Heisman Trophy]] for both years, off-setting much of the frustration, and amassed 5,589&nbsp;yards in his career.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe falloff in success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9\u20132\u20131, 9\u20133, and 7\u20134\u20131, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised [[Gator Bowl]], Hayes punched [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]] [[middle guard]] Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win. Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Earle Bruce (1979\u20131987)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\nHayes was replaced by a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Earle Bruce]]. Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17\u201316, but Bruce was named [[Paul \"Bear\" Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]]. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".<ref name=\"earle\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946372-1,00.html| title = Making 'Em Forget Woody| work =  | publisher = Time Magazine| accessdate = December 11, 2006 | date=November 12, 1979}}</ref>\n\n1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9\u20133 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9\u20133. Though each of these seasons, and the 10\u20133 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future [[National Football League]] stars included [[Keith Byars]], [[Cris Carter]], [[Chris Spielman]], [[John E. Frank|John Frank]], [[Jim Lachey]], [[Tom Tupa]], [[Marcus Marek]], and [[Pepper Johnson]]. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including [[Jim Tressel]], [[Glen Mason]], [[Pete Carroll]], [[Nick Saban]], [[Urban Meyer]] and [[Dom Capers]].\n\nThe 1980 team was selected as the top-ranked team of the pre-season AP poll and opened the season with four games at home, but were shocked in the fourth game by UCLA, shut out 17\u20130. The team rebounded to win its next six easily, but then were shut down by a ball-control Michigan team that allowed the Buckeyes only 23 minutes with the ball, then lost again to [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] in the [[Fiesta Bowl]].\n\nIn 1981, Ohio State opened strong, including a victory at [[Stanford Cardinal|Stanford]] in which senior Art Schlichter out-dueled [[John Elway]], but then lost back-to-back games to [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]] and [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]] (their first victory over the Buckeyes in 22 games). The Buckeyes continued to struggle on defense, losing a third time, at [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Minnesota]]. Victories over Michigan to gain a share of the Big Ten championship and over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]] salvaged the season.\n\nFor the first time since 1922 the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over [[Brigham Young University#Football|BYU]] in the [[Holiday Bowl]]. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24\u20130 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45\u201338. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting.\n\nByars broke his toe just prior to the start of the 1985 season, ending his Heisman hopes and seriously handicapping the Buckeye attack. He returned against Purdue with Ohio State at 4\u20131 and scored twice, but then re-injured his foot the next week against Minnesota. Iowa was top-ranked nationally when they came into Ohio Stadium favored to end the longest home winning streak in the country, and were the first #1 team the Buckeyes faced since Purdue in 1968. Ohio State's defense dominated with four interceptions to win 22\u201313.\n\nIn 1986 Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his [[alma mater]] by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver [[Cris Carter]] was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31\u201310, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\", and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game.\n\nOn the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President [[Edward H. Jennings|Edward Jennings]] fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.<ref>Park, pp. 537\u2013538</ref> The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore [[headband]]s bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the [[Sun Bowl]].\n\n===John Cooper (1988\u20132000)===\n{{Very long section|date=August 2019}}\n[[John Cooper (coach)|John Cooper]] was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at [[Arizona State University]]. Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]] prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.\n\nCooper's thirteen years as Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2\u201310\u20131 record against Michigan, a 3\u20138 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6\u20137 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28\u201324 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the [[National Football League]].<ref name=\"coopbio\">{{cite web| year = | url = http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/cooper_john01.html| title = John Cooper Profile| work = | publisher = TOSU Football Official Site| accessdate = December 19, 2006}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=Red Director |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nBoth 1988 and 1989 began identically: an impressive season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team ([[Pitt Panthers|Pitt]] and [[USC Trojans|USC]]); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs ([[LSU Tigers|LSU]] and [[Boston College Eagles|Boston College]]) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4\u20136\u20131 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8\u20134. The most noteworthy victory occurred in [[Minneapolis]] when Ohio State overcame a 31\u20130 deficit to Minnesota to win 41\u201337.\n\n1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7\u20134\u20131 record that included an embarrassing loss to [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] in the [[Liberty Bowl]]. 1991 was 8\u20134, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back [[Robert Smith (running back)|Robert Smith]] quit the team. 1992, with senior [[Kirk Herbstreit]] at quarterback, and Smith back on the team was 8\u20133\u20131, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13\u201313 tie.

The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with [[South Carolina Gamecocks|South Carolina]] in the [[Outback Bowl]], when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 [[GPA]], team captain [[Matt Wilhelm]] publicly criticized fellow player [[Ken-Yon Rambo]], and one Buckeye lineman sued another.<ref name=\"reggie&co\">{{cite news | year = | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/2000/bowls/outback/| title = Getting a Little Payback| work =  | publisher = CNN-Sports Illustrated| accessdate = December 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2001, Cooper was fired. His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game.  Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team.\n\n===Jim Tressel (2001\u20132010)===\n[[File:Coach Tressel.png|175px|thumb|left|Former head coach [[Jim Tressel]], who led the Buckeyes to the 2002 national championship, and six Big Ten titles.]]\nOhio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel. With four NCAA [[Division I-AA]] National Championships at [[Youngstown State University]], Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm.

its most renowned and intense, Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity, both [[Big Ten Conference]] rivals, those of [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]]. The series versus Indiana began as a non-conference matchup, with Indiana going undefeated at 4\u20130\u20131. In conference, however, the Buckeyes (despite losing the opening conference game) are 70\u20138\u20134 through the 2014 season, the most wins against any opponent. Illinois also began with non-conference games (0\u20131\u20131) but became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year (that record was tied by Michigan in 2007). Through 2014 Ohio State's record against the Illini is 66\u201330\u20134. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini.\n\nWhen Penn State was added to the conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan, and Illinois was set to be paired with in-state rival [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and neighboring Indiana despite Ohio State's historical rivalry with Illinois.\n\nWith Nebraska's entry to the Big Ten and the establishment of division play in football, Ohio State and Illinois played every season in the Leaders Division from 2011 to 2013. Michigan was the Buckeyes' permanent cross-division rival from the Legends Division.\n\nWith the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten, Ohio State and Illinois will be in separate divisions and will no longer meet every year. Ohio State and Michigan also became East Division rivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/bigten/2013/04/28/big-ten-sets-new-divisions-nine-game-schedule/2119055/ | work=USA Today | first1=Mark | last1=Snyder | title=Big Ten approves new divisions, schedule | date=April 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Coaches==\n{{See also|List of Ohio State Buckeyes head football coaches}}\nThe Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history.

Shocked out of their dumb disbelief, many people joined in the destruction. Cotton was rolled from the warehouses, ships loaded with produce were boarded, and fire was set to the lot. Crowds of the city poor broke  open warehouses and carried away baskets, bags, and carts spilling over with rice, bacon, sugar, molasses, corn, and other foods. What they could not carry away they attempted to destroy by dumping in the river, burning, or throwing into the open gutters.

The largest railroad presence had been the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] yard.<ref name=\"Seymour\"/> That location is still known to Algerines as \"the SP yard.\" For decades it was largely a vacant strip. Portions of the tract were redeveloped for housing in the early 21st century.  In the yard's active days, a [[steam-powered]] Southern Pacific [[train ferry]] brought railroad cars from there across the Mississippi River.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, Algiers was the home of [[Martin Behrman]], the longest-serving mayor of New Orleans. In 1901, the U.S. Navy established a naval station in Algiers. From 1966 until 2009, the site was one of the two campuses of the [[Naval Support Activity New Orleans]] base. Now the shuttered facility's West Bank campus is being redeveloped as a federal city. For centuries, intensive settlement in Algiers extended little beyond Algiers Point. The completion of the [[Greater New Orleans]] bridge across the Mississippi River in 1958 (now the [[Crescent City Connection]]) and the construction of Victory Drive (now General DeGaulle) and General Meyer Avenue made significant new development possible, and Algiers grew rapidly for the next 25 years.

Newton Street in McDonoghville, became the heart of Algiers's black community as it was once occupied with bars, [[Juke joint]]s, grocery stores and small restaurants. The most famous, Greystone Voter's League, became the place for Rhythm & Blues shows and great singers such as [[Ray Charles]], [[Son House]], and [[B. B. King]], who all played there.

Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], which included a railway bridge, was built upriver at [[Bridge City, Louisiana|Bridge City]], Louisiana. The largest railroad presence had been the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] yard.<ref name=\"Seymour\"/> That location is still known to Algerines as \"the SP yard.\" For decades it was largely a vacant strip. Portions of the tract were redeveloped for housing in the early 21st century.  In the yard's active days, a [[steam-powered]] Southern Pacific [[train ferry]] brought railroad cars from there across the Mississippi River. The Algiers rail yards were known for their ability to repair or create replacements for any part needed for any type of [[locomotive]] and mechanical parts for ships.<ref name=\"Seymour\"/>\n\n[[File:DailyStates1895AlgiersFirePelicanAve.jpg|right|thumb|After the Great Fire of 1895]]\nA fire destroyed most of the buildings in Algiers in 1895.<ref name=\"Seymour\"/>  Most of the gingerbread-fronted houses seen in the neighborhood today date from the rebuilding that began almost immediately after that fire; although a small number of older buildings still survived. In the early decades of the twentieth century, Algiers was the home of [[Martin Behrman]], the longest-serving mayor of New Orleans. In 1901, the U.S. Navy established a naval station in Algiers. From 1966 until 2009, the site was one of the two campuses of the [[Naval Support Activity New Orleans]] base. Now the shuttered facility's West Bank campus is being redeveloped as a federal city. For centuries, intensive settlement in Algiers extended little beyond Algiers Point. The completion of the [[Greater New Orleans]] bridge across the Mississippi River in 1958 (now the [[Crescent City Connection]]) and the construction of Victory Drive (now General DeGaulle) and General Meyer Avenue made significant new development possible, and Algiers grew rapidly for the next 25 years.

Lawton School and Oakdale. Oakdale once stood south of [[Algiers Point]] and stretched from Whitney Avenue to the Mississippi River. It was one of the larger African-American communities in Algiers and was partly destroyed in the late 1950s to make room for the Greater New Orleans Bridge. Newton Street in McDonoghville, became the heart of Algiers's black community as it was once occupied with bars, [[Juke joint]]s, grocery stores and small restaurants. The most famous, Greystone Voter's League, became the place for Rhythm & Blues shows and great singers such as [[Ray Charles]], [[Son House]], and [[B. B. King]], who all played there. The busy street would slowly decline by 1965, at which that time Oakdale was completely destroyed and built over for the Fischer housing project.

There's so much more to celebrate on ''All Play and No Work'', but space is insufficient to do proper justice to each of the 15 tracks, except to say each one plays a crucial role in yielding this modern rootsy gem.\" [http://www.mnblues.com/cdreview/2003/cameoblues-allplay-gt.html Review of ''All Play and No Work''].

It is the campus and community radio station owned and operated by [[Bluffton University]]. WBWH-LP offers a diversified programming schedule geared to university students and the residents of Bluffton. Its power output of 66 watts serves the community of Bluffton exclusively. WBWH-LP broadcasts many of the athletic events on campus, including football, volleyball, basketball, and baseball games. The call letters WBWH-LP stand for Beavers With Headphones-a tribute to the Bluffton mascot, which is a beaver.\n\n==96.1 WBWH Your Bluffton Connection==\nWBWH-LP's primary music format is [[New AC (NAC)/Smooth Jazz]] (making it the only station in [[Northwest Ohio]] to have [[Smooth Jazz]] as its primary format). During this format, Smooth Jazz is the basis and Vocals from a wide variety of genres such as [[Sophisti-pop]], [[Blue-eyed soul]], and  [[R&B]]/[[Soul Music]] as well as Chill or [[Chill-out music]] along with [[Nu-jazz]] and [[Acid Jazz]] is normally sprinkled in. WBWH-LP flipped to the Smooth Jazz format in October 2011. As of August 18, 2012 WBWH-LP brands its Smooth Jazz-based programming as \"Smooth 96.1.\"\n\nWBWH-LP reports its Smooth Jazz playlist to [http://www.smoothjazz.com/charts/stations.php SmoothJazz.com] weekly. More specifics on the music and segments heard on WBWH-LP can be found at its [http://www.blufftonconnection.com/radio/programming-info website.]\n\nWBWH-LP switched frequencies from 99.3 FM to [http://www.radio-locator.com/cgi-bin/pat?call=WBWH&service=FL&status=C&hours=U 96.1 FM.] The switch took place on August 18, 2012. WBWH-LP went off the air August 18, 2012, and returned to the airwaves at 96.1 FM on August 24, 2012.\n\n===Syndicated shows produced at WBWH-LP===\n\nWBWH is currently the place of production for two internationally syndicated radio shows. The first show to be syndicated from WBWH-LP was [http://www.thechilloutsessionsradio.com The Chillout Sessions], hosted by Donald Isaac. The Chillout Sessions is heard on many online and FM stations in places such as [[New York City]], [[Orlando]], [[Cincinnati]], [[London]], [[Nicosia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], in addition to West Virginia. Most recently, [http://www.alternativeprojectradio.com The Alternative Project], hosted by Evan  Skilliter, became the second show to be syndicated from WBWH-LP. The Alternative Project is currently heard on many FM and online stations in locations such as [[Porirua, New Zealand]], [[Boston]], and [[West Virginia]].\n\n===The Smooth 96.1===\n\nSmooth 96.1 strives to keep the sounds of Smooth Jazz as the noticeable basis when the format is on the air.
