[[Randy Stuart]] was cast in 12 episodes in the 1959\u20131960 season as Tombstone saloon and hotel owner [[Nellie Cashman]], a romantic interest for Earp.

In seven episodes in 1959 and 1961, [[Carol Thurston]] played the fictitious Emma Clanton, daughter of Old Man Clanton and an unlikely romantic interest for Earp.

[[John Milford]] appeared in eight episodes as the historical [[Ike Clanton]]. In seven episodes in 1959 and 1961, [[Carol Thurston]] played the fictitious Emma Clanton, daughter of Old Man Clanton and an unlikely romantic interest for Earp. Thurston also was cast in different roles in four earlier episodes before she landed the continuing role as Emma Clanton. [[James Seay]] was cast 16 times as Judge Spicer, who became a close friend of Earp's.\n\n[[William Phipps (actor)|William Phipps]] in 16 episodes played the gunman and rustler [[William Brocius|Curly Bill Brocius]]. In the episode \"The Clantons' Family Row\", Brocius is facing a potential gunfight with [[Johnny Ringo]] (Peter M.

A town mob demands that Curly Bill be hanged, but Earp places [[dynamite]] under the main street to protect his prisoner until the trial. Earp must defend Curly Bill in court because White accidentally caused Curly Bill's gun to discharge; White signed a statement attesting to the facts prior to his death.

Many episodes show Douglas Fowley as playing the part of Doc Fabrique when he actually is not in the episodes.  O'Flynn was left off the credits most of the time.  In \"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960), Dr. Goodfellow must obtain a truce with Marshal Earp, who is apprehending a wounded outlaw. The man will die if moved after surgery, but he does not wait the three days to recuperate out of distrust of Earp and the protection of the $15,000 loot his gang and he have taken from [[Wells Fargo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0631786/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_181|title=\"Frontier Surgeon\" (January 19, 1960)|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Walter Coy]] appeared twice on ''The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp'', as Henry Mason in \"The Doctor\" (1960) and as [[Ben Thompson (lawman)|Ben Thompson]] in \"Dodge Is Civilized\" (1959).

{"title_page": "Disease surveillance", "text_new": "{{short description|Monitoring spread of disease to establish patterns of progression}}\n'''Disease surveillance''' is an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] practice by which the spread of [[disease]] is monitored in order to establish patterns of progression. The main role of disease surveillance is to predict, observe, and minimize the harm caused by [[outbreak]], [[epidemic]], and [[pandemic]] situations, as well as increase knowledge about which factors contribute to such circumstances. A key part of modern disease surveillance is the practice of '''disease case reporting'''.\n\nIn modern times, reporting incidences of disease outbreaks has been transformed from manual record keeping, to instant worldwide internet communication.\n\nThe number of cases could be gathered from hospitals - which would be expected to see most of the occurrences - collated, and eventually made public. With the advent of modern [[communication technology]], this has changed dramatically. Organizations like the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) now can report cases and deaths from significant diseases within days - sometimes within hours - of the occurrence. Further, there is considerable public pressure to make this information available quickly and accurately. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Mandatory reporting==\nFormal reporting of [[Notifiable disease|notifiable]] infectious diseases is a requirement placed upon health care providers by many regional and national governments, and upon national governments by the [[World Health Organization]] to monitor spread as a result of the [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] of infectious agents. Since 1969, WHO has required that all cases of the following diseases be reported to the organization: [[cholera]], [[bubonic plague|plague]], [[yellow fever]], [[smallpox]], [[relapsing fever]] and [[typhus]]. In 2005, the list was extended to include [[polio]] and [[SARS]].  Regional and national governments typically monitor a larger set of (around 80 in the U.S.) communicable diseases that can potentially threaten the general population. [[Tuberculosis]], [[HIV]], [[botulism]], [[hantavirus]], [[anthrax]], and [[rabies]] are examples of such diseases. The incidence counts of diseases are often used as [[health indicators]] to describe the overall health of a population.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==World Health Organization==\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] is the lead agency for coordinating global response to major diseases. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] maintains Web sites for a number of diseases, and has active teams in many countries where these diseases occur.\n\nDuring the [[SARS]] outbreak in early 2004, for example, the [[Beijing]] staff of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] produced updates every few days for the duration of the outbreak.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome/en/index.html WHO SARS]</ref> Beginning in January 2004, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] has produced similar updates for [[H5N1]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/ WHO H5N1]</ref> These results are [[Global spread of H5N1|widely reported]] and closely watched.\n\n[[WHO]]'s Epidemic and Pandemic Alert and Response (EPR) to detect, verify rapidly and respond appropriately to epidemic-prone and emerging disease threats covers the following diseases:<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/en/ WHO EPR]</ref>\n*[[Anthrax]]\n*[[Avian influenza]]\n*[[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever]]\n*[[Dengue hemorrhagic fever]]\n*[[Ebola virus disease]]\n*[[Hepatitis]]\n*[[Influenza]]\n*[[Lassa fever]]\n*[[Marburg virus|Marburg hemorrhagic fever]]\n*[[Meningococcal disease]]\n*[[Bubonic plague|Plague]]\n*[[Rift Valley fever]]\n*[[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]]\n*[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)]]\n*[[Smallpox]]\n*[[Tularaemia]]\n*[[Yellow fever]]\n\n==Political challenges==\nAs the lead organization in global public health, the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] occupies a delicate role in [[global politics]]. It must maintain good relationships with each of the many countries in which it is active. As a result, it may only report results within a particular country with the agreement of the country's government. Because some governments regard the release of ''any'' information on disease outbreaks as a state secret, this can place the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] in a difficult position.\n\nThe WHO coordinated ''International Outbreak Alert and Response'' is designed to ensure \"outbreaks of potential international importance are rapidly verified and information is quickly shared within the Network\" but not necessarily by the public; integrate and coordinate \"activities to support national efforts\" rather than challenge national authority within that nation in order to \"respect the independence and objectivity of all partners\". The commitment that \"All Network responses will proceed with full respect for ethical standards, human rights, national and local laws, cultural sensitivities and tradition\" ensures each nation that its security, financial, and other interests will be given full weight.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/guidingprinciples/en/index.html WHO Outbreak Network]</ref>\n\n==Technical challenges==\nTesting for a disease can be expensive, and distinguishing between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries. One standard means of determining if a person has had a particular disease is to test for the presence of [[antibodies]] that are particular to this disease. In the case of H5N1, for example, there is a low pathogenic H5N1 strain in wild birds in North America that a human could conceivably have antibodies against. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish between antibodies produced by this strain, and antibodies produced by [[H5N1|Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)]]. Similar difficulties are common, and make it difficult to determine how widely a disease may have spread.\n\nThere is currently little available data on the spread of [[H5N1]] in wild birds in Africa and Asia. Without such data, predicting how the disease might spread in the future is difficult. Information that scientists and decision makers need to make useful medical products and informed decisions for health care, but currently lack include:\n* Surveillance of wild bird populations\n* Cell cultures of particular strains of diseases\n\n==H5N1==\nSurveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.\n\nH5N1 in China is less than fully reported. Blogs have described many discrepancies between official China government announcements concerning H5N1 and what people in China see with their own eyes. Many reports of total H5N1 cases have excluded China due to widespread disbelief in China's official numbers.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf WHO]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727000000/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf |date=July 27, 2011 }} [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html WHO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213164120/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html |date=2006-02-13 }} [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_27a/en/index.html WHO] [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/ WHO]</ref> (See [[Disease surveillance in China]].)\n\n\"Only half the world's human bird flu cases are being reported to the World Health Organization within two weeks of being detected, a response time that must be improved to avert a pandemic, a senior WHO official said Saturday.

The other two strategies involve domestic bird testing and environmental sampling of water and wild-bird droppings.

Last year officials tested just 721 birds from Alaska and none from most other states, another map shows.

The commitment that \"All Network responses will proceed with full respect for ethical standards, human rights, national and local laws, cultural sensitivities and tradition\" ensures each nation that its security, financial, and other interests will be given full weight.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/outbreaknetwork/guidingprinciples/en/index.html WHO Outbreak Network]</ref>\n\n==Technical challenges==\nTesting for a disease can be expensive, and distinguishing between two diseases can be prohibitively difficult in many countries. One standard means of determining if a person has had a particular disease is to test for the presence of [[antibodies]] that are particular to this disease. In the case of H5N1, for example, there is a low pathogenic H5N1 strain in wild birds in North America that a human could conceivably have antibodies against. It would be extremely difficult to distinguish between antibodies produced by this strain, and antibodies produced by [[H5N1|Asian lineage HPAI A(H5N1)]]. Similar difficulties are common, and make it difficult to determine how widely a disease may have spread.\n\nThere is currently little available data on the spread of [[H5N1]] in wild birds in Africa and Asia. Without such data, predicting how the disease might spread in the future is difficult. Information that scientists and decision makers need to make useful medical products and informed decisions for health care, but currently lack include:\n* Surveillance of wild bird populations\n* Cell cultures of particular strains of diseases\n\n==H5N1==\nSurveillance of [[H5N1]] in humans, poultry, wild birds, cats and other animals remains very weak in many parts of Asia and Africa. Much remains unknown about the exact extent of its spread.\n\nH5N1 in China is less than fully reported. Blogs have described many discrepancies between official China government announcements concerning H5N1 and what people in China see with their own eyes. Many reports of total H5N1 cases have excluded China due to widespread disbelief in China's official numbers.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf WHO]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727000000/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/Timeline_28_10a.pdf |date=July 27, 2011 }} [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html WHO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213164120/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_01_19/en/index.html |date=2006-02-13 }} [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_27a/en/index.html WHO] [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_07_04/en/ WHO]</ref> (See [[Disease surveillance in China]].)\n\n\"Only half the world's human bird flu cases are being reported to the World Health Organization within two weeks of being detected, a response time that must be improved to avert a pandemic, a senior WHO official said Saturday.

Turns out that Charlotte and Tiffany's patience with Ashley not pulling his weight at home are running thin, and they're desperate to find a way to get Ashley to help out a little more around the house. Tiffany has the idea to create a chore chart so that everyone can understand what jobs need to get done.\nLater on, Ashley gets out of the house for a little down time with his buddies Trevor and Jackie.

Trevor, who is sympathetic to Ashley's cause, helps him out by taking out the trash.\nMeanwhile Ashley has been spending a lot of time with his friend Xandy Barry, writing and recording new music.

In these stressful times, a little help from mom is just the extra boost that Ashley needs.\nWhen Paula's visit is over, Ashley is sad to see her leave. He is, however, excited when he learns that his manager is sending him and his friends away for a weekend off in Las Vegas. Ash is even more psyched once he gets to Vegas and learns they will be staying in the penthouse at the Palms Resort.\nAfter a night on the casino floor, Ashley has a revelation that he wants to marry Tiffany in Vegas. When Ashley dares Tiffany to fly home with him as his wife, Tiffany accepts and tells their limo driver to take them to the chapel. Everything goes as planned until Tiffany backs down at the last second, not because she doesn't want to marry, but because the entire family isn't present. Looks like Ashley is going to have to wait a little longer to be a husband.\n |LineColor=359FD4\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |Title=Season Finale\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|3|13}}\n |EpisodeNumber=110\n |ShortSummary=Fame and fortune should be just around the corner considering all the work Ashley has been putting in lately. Now that he's finished recording his album, Ashley is going to have to start promoting it, which is going to be an uphill battle in itself. Since most people are used to seeing Ashley during his O-Town days, he has to convince nearly everyone that he's a credible musician. This means hours on the phone and at radio stations doing interviews, and weeks at a time on the road playing back-to-back gigs.\nBecause he is going to spending so much time promoting his new album, it's going to be hard for Ashley to be spend as much time at home as he's used to. When Ashley has to break lunch plans with Tiffany and his son Lyric to do phone interviews all day, she is disappointed. Ash and Tiff's relationship is put to the ultimate test when Tiffany finds out that Ashley will be leaving home for several weeks to go on tour by himself. Seeing how upset Tiffany is about him leaving home, Ashley works out a special plan with his manager that will allow Tiffany and Lyric to meet up with him on the road from time to time.\nAll of Ashley's hard work pays off when he gets a call from his manager informing him that his advance check has finally arrived. Finally Ashley will have the means to provide for his family. On the way to pick up his check, Ashley receives a phone call informing him that his music is being played on the radio.

The biggest problem these two have to face is finishing Lyric's nursery, which is looking to be a little bigger of a problem than they could have anticipated. With the nursery's final touch delayed indefinitely, who knows when Lyric will have a completed room of his own?\nEveryday Ashley's solo career is looking brighter and brighter. With the completion of a new track, it should be any day now that we see Ash back in the spotlight.\nBack on the home front Ash and Tiff's relationship is about to take a turn towards something a lot more serious.

Since his O-Town money is running thin, Ashley is determined to get a new job in an effort to make some extra cash for his family. There's only problem, since Ash has spent the past several years being a pop star, he doesn't really have the qualifications necessary for your average 9-to-5. Turns out Ashley's good buddy from his O-Town days, Jacob Underwood, will be able to help him out with a new job in construction. Ashley hopes this will solve some financial problems while he tries to kick his solo career into high gear.\nLater, Ashley and his crew step out for a night on the town, only to run into trouble when a total stranger picks a fight with Ashley for no reason. Even more trouble ensues when Ashley is kicked out of the club for standing up for himself. Luckily, the group is able to salvage their evening and move everyone to a new hot spot.\nThe next morning the previous night's escapades catch up with Ashley when he is awoken at the crack of dawn by his baby boy. For the first time, Ash comes to the realization that he's going to have to slow down the partying, and switch up his priorities a little bit.\n\n |LineColor=359FD4\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |Title=Chore Night\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|2|27}}\n |EpisodeNumber=108\n |ShortSummary=As if trying to become a rock star while raising a family wasn't enough to fill Ashley's plate, it looks like he is also going to have to start worrying about picking up after himself. Turns out that Charlotte and Tiffany's patience with Ashley not pulling his weight at home are running thin, and they're desperate to find a way to get Ashley to help out a little more around the house. Tiffany has the idea to create a chore chart so that everyone can understand what jobs need to get done.\nLater on, Ashley gets out of the house for a little down time with his buddies Trevor and Jackie. The boys head out to Disco Delve's Sushi Bar and are greeted with a night of sushi and dancing. When Ashley gets home he must face the dreaded chore chart. Trevor, who is sympathetic to Ashley's cause, helps him out by taking out the trash.\nMeanwhile Ashley has been spending a lot of time with his friend Xandy Barry, writing and recording new music. Xandy helps Ashley get his first gig as a solo artist at a local L.A. open- mic night. Ashley, who is used to big bucks from his O-Town gigs, is shocked when Xandy tells him he'll only make money from a tip-jar. Since this is his first time performing in a long while, Ashley is naturally very nervous beforehand. Ashley performs his new song \"My Apology\" at the small club, and the show is flawless until he accidentally hits the wrong chord towards the end of the song. Regardless of a minor slipup, and only getting paid in tips, Ashley is glad that he got up on stage again and is one step closer to being a rock star.\n |LineColor=359FD4\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |Title=Weekend in Vegas\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|3|6}}\n |EpisodeNumber=109\n |ShortSummary=It seems like Ashley has been working harder than ever. Between writing and recording a rock album, keeping the house clean, and raising his son Lyric, Ash definitely has his hands full.

In these stressful times, a little help from mom is just the extra boost that Ashley needs.\nWhen Paula's visit is over, Ashley is sad to see her leave. He is, however, excited when he learns that his manager is sending him and his friends away for a weekend off in Las Vegas. Ash is even more psyched once he gets to Vegas and learns they will be staying in the penthouse at the Palms Resort.\nAfter a night on the casino floor, Ashley has a revelation that he wants to get married to Tiffany in Vegas. When Ashley dares Tiffany to fly home with him as his wife, Tiffany accepts and tells their limo driver to take them to the chapel. Everything goes as planned until Tiffany backs down at the last second, not because she doesn't want to get married, but because the entire family isn't present. Looks like Ashley is going to have to wait a little longer to be a husband.\n |LineColor=359FD4\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |Title=Season Finale\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2006|3|13}}\n |EpisodeNumber=110\n |ShortSummary=Fame and fortune should be just around the corner considering all the work Ashley has been putting in lately. Now that he's finished recording his album, Ashley is going to have to start promoting it, which is going to be an uphill battle in itself. Since most people are used to seeing Ashley during his O-Town days, he has to convince nearly everyone that he's a credible musician. This means hours on the phone and at radio stations doing interviews, and weeks at a time on the road playing back-to-back gigs.\nBecause he is going to spending so much time promoting his new album, it's going to be hard for Ashley to be spend as much time at home as he's used to.

Ash and Tiff's relationship is put to the ultimate test when Tiffany finds out that Ashley will be leaving home for several weeks to go on tour by himself.
