During the Vietnam War, U.S. military advisers to Vietnamese airborne units often wore the Vietnamese French-style red beret.\n\nHQDA policy from 1973 through 1979 permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing distinctions. Airborne forces chose to wear the maroon beret as a mark of distinction. This permission was rescinded in 1979 when the army Chief of Staff, GEN Bernard Rogers, required all units to adhere to the uniform regulation (AR 670-1). On 28 November 1980, the updated regulation authorized airborne (parachute) organizations to resume wearing the maroon beret.

On completion of training at the Commando Training Depot at [[Achnacarry|Achnacarry Castle]] in [[Scotland]], those Rangers had the right to wear the British Commando green beret, but it was not part of the regulation uniform at the time and was disallowed by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. \n<ref name=\"www.army.mil\">{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) had many veterans of World War II and Korea in its ranks when it was formed in 1952. Members of the 10th SFG began to unofficially wear a variety of berets while training, some favoring the red or maroon airborne beret, the black beret, or the green commando beret. In 1953, a beret whose design was based on that of the Canadian Army pattern, and which was rifle-green in color, was chosen for wear by Special Forces units.\n\nTheir new headgear was first worn at a retirement parade at Fort Bragg on 12 June 1955 for Lt. Gen. [[Joseph P. Cleland]], the now-former commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Onlookers thought that the commandos were a foreign delegation from NATO.<ref>P.32, \"Inside the Green Berets\" by Charles Simpson III</ref>\n\nIn 1956 Gen. Paul D. Adams, the post commander at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, banned its wear, even though it was worn on the sly when units were in the field or deployed overseas. This was reversed on 25 September 1961 by ''Department of the Army Message 578636,'' which designated the green beret as the exclusive headgear of the Army Special Forces.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\"/>\n\nWhen visiting the Special Forces at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Fort Bragg]] on 12 October 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] asked Brig. Gen. [[William P. Yarborough]] to make sure that the men under his command wore green berets for the visit. Later that day, Kennedy sent a memorandum that included the line: '\"I am sure that the green beret will be a mark of distinction in the trying times ahead\".<ref name=\"LeFavor 2013, p. 90\"/> By America's entry into the [[Vietnam War]], the green beret had become a symbol of excellence throughout the U.S. Army.

In 2011, the Army changed back to the patrol cap for wear with the utility uniform, with the beret remaining the headgear for the dress uniform.<ref name=\"Army Dumps Beret\">{{cite web|title=Army dumps beret as official ACU headgear|url=http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140220043908/http://www.armytimes.com/article/20110613/NEWS/106130309/Army-dumps-beret-official-ACU-headgear|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-02-20}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Brown==\n[[File:US Army Security Force Assistance Brigade Beret.jpg|thumb|A soldier from the 1st SFAB wearing her brown beret, circa February 2018]]\nThe brown beret was created in 2018 for soldiers of the U.S. Army's then-new [[Security Force Assistance Brigade]] (SFAB).<ref>https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2018/02/08/its-official-army-unveils-brown-beret-new-patch-for-military-advisers-sfab/</ref> Those soldiers in the SFAB are authorized to wear the brown beret\u2014with a brigade specific [[United States military beret flash|beret flash]] and [[distinctive unit insignia]] (DUI)\u2014to recognize these new specialized units whose core mission is to conduct training, advising, assisting, enabling and accompanying operations with allied and partner nations.

During the Vietnam War, U.S. military advisers to Vietnamese airborne units often wore the Vietnamese French-style red beret.\n\nHQDA policy from 1973 through 1979 permitted local commanders to encourage morale-enhancing distinctions. Airborne forces chose to wear the maroon beret as a mark of distinction. This permission was rescinded in 1979 when the army Chief of Staff, GEN Bernard Rogers, required all units to adhere to the uniform regulation (AR 670-1). On 28 November 1980, the updated regulation authorized airborne (parachute) organizations to resume wearing the maroon beret.  In the interim, airborne units wore baseball caps with silver wings and the oval flash above the rank badge with the fatigue uniform, and the overseas cap with glider and parachute patch with the dress green uniform.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Tan==\n[[Image:COL Richard Clarke official portrait.jpg|thumb|A former commander of the 75th Ranger Regiment wearing his tan beret]]\n{{main|Tan beret}}\nOn 14 June 2001, [[U.S. Army Rangers]] assigned to the [[75th Ranger Regiment]] were authorized to wear a distinctive tan beret to replace the black berets that had recently become the army-wide standard. The color was chosen by the members of the 75th Ranger Regiment as being similar to other elite units with similar missions worldwide, notably the British, Australian and New Zealand Special Air Service regiments.\n\nThe change in color also required modification of the associated [[United States military beret flash|flashes]] worn by the Ranger units, changing the borders from white to black in order to provide better contrast to the lighter beret.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Green==\n{{Multiple image\n| width1   = 275\n| image1   = US Army Special Forces UDT training-1956.png\n| caption1 = Special Forces soldiers prepare for a combat diving training operation on a US Naval ship near [[Okinawa, Japan]] in 1956, wearing their green berets prior to their approved wear in 1961.\n| width2   = 220\n| image2   = US Army Special Operations Center of Excellence Command Chief Warrant Officer CW5 Robert W.

The first [[United States Army Rangers|Ranger]] unit, commonly known as [[Darby's Rangers]], was formed in [[Northern Ireland]] during the summer of 1942. On completion of training at the Commando Training Depot at [[Achnacarry|Achnacarry Castle]] in [[Scotland]], those Rangers had the right to wear the British Commando green beret, but it was not part of the regulation uniform at the time and was disallowed by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. \n<ref name=\"www.army.mil\">{{cite web |url=https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm |title=A Short History of the Use of Berets in the U.S. Army |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010624053826/https://www.army.mil/features/beret/beret.htm#History |archive-date=24 June 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne) had many veterans of World War II and Korea in its ranks when it was formed in 1952. Members of the 10th SFG began to unofficially wear a variety of berets while training, some favoring the red or maroon airborne beret, the black beret, or the green commando beret. In 1953, a beret whose design was based on that of the Canadian Army pattern, and which was rifle-green in color, was chosen for wear by Special Forces units.\n\nTheir new headgear was first worn at a retirement parade at Fort Bragg on 12 June 1955 for Lt. Gen. [[Joseph P. Cleland]], the now-former commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Onlookers thought that the commandos were a foreign delegation from NATO.<ref>P.32, \"Inside the Green Berets\" by Charles Simpson III</ref>\n\nIn 1956 Gen. Paul D. Adams, the post commander at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, banned its wear, even though it was worn on the sly when units were in the field or deployed overseas. This was reversed on 25 September 1961 by ''Department of the Army Message 578636,'' which designated the green beret as the exclusive headgear of the Army Special Forces.<ref name=\"www.army.mil\"/>\n\nWhen visiting the Special Forces at [[Fort Bragg, North Carolina|Fort Bragg]] on 12 October 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy]] asked Brig. Gen. [[William P. Yarborough]] to make sure that the men under his command wore green berets for the visit. Later that day, Kennedy sent a memorandum that included the line: '\"I am sure that the green beret will be a mark of distinction in the trying times ahead\".<ref name=\"LeFavor 2013, p. 90\"/> By America's entry into the [[Vietnam War]], the green beret had become a symbol of excellence throughout the U.S. Army. On 11 April 1962 in a White House memorandum to the United States Army, President Kennedy reiterated his view: \"The green beret is a symbol of excellence, a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom\".<ref name=\"LeFavor 2013, p. 90\"/> Previously, both Yarborough and [[Edson Raff]] had petitioned the Pentagon to allow wearing of the green beret, to no avail.<ref name=\"LeFavor 2013, p. 90\">{{cite book |last=LeFavor |first=Paul |date=2013 |title=US Army Special Forces Small Unit Tactics Handbook |publisher=Blacksmith Publishing |isbn=978-0-9895513-0-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNoQXkhZgGAC&pg=PA90 90]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States military beret flash]]\n*[[Military beret]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{US Army uniforms}}\n\n[[Category:United States Army uniforms]]\n", "name_user": "McChizzle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMaroon:Continuing previous", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berets_of_the_United_States_Army"}

The inaugural season was participated by four teams; the Bandits, Barracudas, Juggernauts and the Wolves.  The first season started initially with a 7-on-7 format utilizing 3 offensive linemen on offense.\n\nThe first champions of the league were the Bandits.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philippines|url=http://ifaf.org/countries/federation/3|website=IFAF|accessdate=7 February 2015}}</ref> The Bandits' [[running back]] and team captain, Will Yeh, was named [[MVP]] of the first season.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABP Personalities: Will Yeh|url=http://arenaballphilippines.com.ph/news26.html|accessdate=7 February 2015|publisher=ArenaBall Philippines}}</ref>\n\n===Season 2===\nIn season two, the league switched to a 9-on-9 format.

All of them, with the exception of the Individual Jumping Grand Prix, were held in the [[Trade Unions' Equestrian Complex]], which is situated in the [[Bitsa Forest Park]] (southern part of [[Moscow]]). Individual Jumping Grand Prix was held in the [[Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium]] at Luzhniki (south-western part of [[Moscow]]). \n\nDue to [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|the boycott]], only eleven nations competed in the equestrian events: Austria, Bulgaria, Guatemala, Finland, Hungary, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the USSR. Therefore, only a few of the top riders in the world competed, including the Italian eventing team and the current European champion in dressage, Austrian [[Sissy Theurer]]. India also sent an eventing team, but all four of its riders were eliminated. There were only 68 entries total in the equestrian competition at the 1980 Olympics.\n\n==Disciplines==\n[[Image:Mon Cherie 2 1980-1-.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Individual gold medalist in dressage, [[Elisabeth Theurer]] and Mon Cherie]]\n===Show jumping===\n26 riders from seven nations competed over Viatcheslav Kartavski's course, including six teams, none of whom were dominating powers in international show jumping. The course was kept easy, with ideal distances between fences. Only sixteen riders competed in the individual show jumping competition, including one each from Finland and Guatemala. The Guatemalan, Oswaldo Mendaz, finished in fourth place after losing the jump-off for bronze to Mexico\u2019s Joaquin Perez de la Heras. This remained the highest placing of a Guatemalan athlete at the Olympics until [[Erick Barrondo]] won an athletics silver medal in [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]. Silver went to Nikolaj Korolkov, finishing with 9.5 penalties, and gold went to Poland\u2019s [[Jan Kowalczyk]], who had a rail in each round.\n\n===Dressage===\nOf the 14 riders (seven nations) competing in dressage, there was only one top international competitor: 26-year-old Elisabeth Theurer on her [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]] Mon Cheri. She finished the Grand Prix an astonishing 35 points ahead of the second place finisher [[Yuri Kovshov]], and 82 points ahead of the third place winner Viktor Ugriumov. She spread this margin even further in the Grand Prix Special, to 90 points ahead of silver and 136 points ahead of bronze. However, her win was not marred by controversy, and the Austrian National Equestrian Federation's President resigned after her decision to compete.\n\nFollowing the boycott from west-block nations, the Soviet Union had to stimulate east-block countries of Bulgaria, Poland and Romania to take part in a team competition on a short notice. As a consequence, most of the participants were very inexperienced and have scored some of the lowest marks in the Olympic history. Without any significant competition, the Soviet dressage team won by a record 803 points ahead of the silver medal winning Bulgarian team. This was managed even without one of their top riders, Elena Petushkova, after her horse died from an illness.\n\n===Eventing===\nOnly six nations competed, but with the addition of the 1964 Olympics gold medal winners (Italy) to the team fielded by the USSR (three-time European Champion), there was true competition. Endurance day was held in Bitsa forest park, over very deep footing, and included a 5500 meter Phase A, 3795 meter Steeplechase, 12100 meter Phase C, and a final 7685 meter cross-country course.

All of them, with the exception of the Individual Jumping Grand Prix, were held in the [[Trade Unions' Equestrian Complex]], which is situated in the [[Bitsa Forest Park]] (southern part of [[Moscow]]). Individual Jumping Grand Prix was held in the [[Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium]] at Luzhniki (south-western part of [[Moscow]]). \n\nDue to [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|the boycott]], only eleven nations competed in the equestrian events: Austria, Bulgaria, Guatemala, Finland, Hungary, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Romania, and the USSR. Therefore, only a few of the top riders in the world competed, including the Italian eventing team and the current European champion in dressage, Austrian [[Sissy Theurer]]. India also sent an eventing team, but all four of its riders were eliminated. There were only 68 entries total in the equestrian competition at the 1980 Olympics.\n\n==Disciplines==\n[[Image:Mon Cherie 2 1980-1-.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Individual gold medalist in dressage, [[Elisabeth Theurer]] and Mon Cherie]]\n===Show jumping===\n26 riders from seven nations competed over Viatcheslav Kartavski's course, including six teams, none of whom were dominating powers in international show jumping. The course was kept easy, with ideal distances between fences. Only sixteen riders competed in the individual show jumping competition, including one each from Finland and Guatemala. The Guatemalan, Oswaldo Mendaz, finished in fourth place after losing the jump-off for bronze to Mexico\u2019s Joaquin Perez de la Heras. This remained the highest placing of a Guatemalan athlete at the Olympics until [[Erick Barrondo]] won an athletics silver medal in [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]. Silver went to Nikolaj Korolkov, finishing with 9.5 penalties, and gold went to Poland\u2019s [[Jan Kowalczyk]], who had a rail in each round.\n\n===Dressage===\nOf the 14 riders (seven nations) competing in dressage, there was only one top international competitor: 26-year-old Elisabeth Theurer on her [[Hanoverian (horse)|Hanoverian]] Mon Cheri. She finished the Grand Prix an astonishing 35 points ahead of the second place finisher [[Yuri Kovshov]], and 82 points ahead of the third place winner Viktor Ugriumov. She spread this margin even further in the Grand Prix Special, to 90 points ahead of silver and 136 points ahead of bronze. However, her win was not marred by controversy, and the Austrian National Equestrian Federation's President resigned after her decision to compete.\n\nFollowing the boycott from west-block nations, the Soviet Union had to stimulate east-block countries of Bulgaria, Poland and Romania to take part in a team competition on a short notice. As a consequence, most of the participants were very inexperienced and have scored some of the lowest marks in the Olympic history. Without any significant competition, the Soviet dressage team won by a record 803 points ahead of the silver medal winning Bulgarian team. This was managed even without one of their top riders, Elena Petushkova, after her horse died from an illness.\n\n===Eventing===\nOnly six nations competed, but with the addition of the 1964 Olympics gold medal winners (Italy) to the team fielded by the USSR (three-time European Champion), there was true competition. Endurance day was held in Bitsa forest park, over very deep footing, and included a 5500 meter Phase A, 3795 meter Steeplechase, 12100 meter Phase C, and a final 7685 meter cross-country course. Although the course was inviting, 11 of the 28 starters were eliminated.\n\n==Medal summary==\n{| {{MedalistTable|type=Event}}\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Individual dressage<br>{{DetailsLink|Equestrian at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual dressage}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Elisabeth Theurer]] <br> on ''Mon Cherie''|AUT|1980 Summer}} \n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Yuri Kovshov]] <br> on ''Igrok''|URS|1980 Summer}} \n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Viktor Ugryumov]] <br> on ''Shkval''|URS|1980 Summer}} \n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Team dressage<br>{{DetailsLink|Equestrian at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team dressage}}\n|{{flagIOCteam|URS|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Yuri Kovshov]] <br> and ''Igrok'' <br>[[Viktor Ugryumov]] <br> and ''Shkfval'' <br>[[Vera Misevich]] <br> and ''Plot''\n|{{flagIOCteam|BUL|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Petar Mandajiev]] <br> and ''Stchibor''<br>[[Svetoslav lvanov]] <br> and ''Aleko''<br>[[Gheorghi Gadjev]] <br> and ''Vnimatelen''\n|{{flagIOCteam|ROU|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Anghelache Donescu]] <br> and ''Dor'' <br>[[Dumitru Veliku]] <br> and ''Decebal''<br>[[Petre Rosca]] <br> and ''Derbist''\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Individual eventing<br>{{DetailsLink|Equestrian at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual eventing}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Federico Roman]] <br> on ''Rossinan''|ITA|1980 Summer}} \n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Aleksandr Blinov (equestrian)|Aleksandr Blinov]] <br> on ''Galzun''|URS|1980 Summer}} \n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Yuri Salnikov]] <br> on ''Pintset''|URS|1980 Summer}} \n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Team eventing<br>{{DetailsLink|Equestrian at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team eventing}}\n|{{flagIOCteam|URS|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Aleksandr Blinov (equestrian)|Aleksandr Blinov]] <br> and ''Galzun''<br>[[Yuri Salnikov]] <br> and ''Pintset''<br>[[Valery Volkov]] <br> and ''Tskheti''<br>[[Sergei Rogozhin]] <br> and ''Gelespont''\n|{{flagIOCteam|ITA|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Federico Roman]] <br> and ''Rossinan'' <br>[[Anna Casagrande]] <br> and ''Daleye''<br>[[Mauro Roman]] <br> and ''Dourakine 4''<br>[[Marina Sciocchetti]] <br> and Rohan de Lechereo \n|{{flagIOCteam|MEX|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Yocupicio Manuel Mendivil]] <br> and ''Remember'' <br>[[Rios David Barcena]] <br> and ''Bombon''<br>[[Soto Jose Luis Perez]] <br> and ''Quelite''<br>[[Lopez Fabian Vazquez]] <br> and ''Cocaleco''\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Individual jumping<br>{{DetailsLink|Equestrian at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual jumping}}\n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Jan Kowalczyk]] <br> on ''Artemor''|POL|1980 Summer}} \n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Nikolai Korolkov]] <br> on ''Espadron''|URS|1980 Summer}} \n|{{flagIOCathlete|[[Joaqu\u00edn P\u00e9rez (equestrian)|Joaquin Perez Heras]] <br> on ''Alymony''|MEX|1980 Summer}} \n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Team jumping<br>{{DetailsLink|Equestrian at the 1980 Summer Olympics \u2013 Team jumping}}\n|{{flagIOCteam|URS|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Vyacheslav Chukanov]] <br> and ''Gepatit''<br>[[Viktor Poganovsky]] <br> and ''Topky''<br>[[Viktor Asmaev]] <br> and ''Reis''<br>[[Nikolai Korolkov]] <br> and ''Espadron''\n|{{flagIOCteam|POL|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Marian Kozicki]] <br> and ''Bremen''<br>[[Jan Kowalczyk]] <br> and ''Artemor''<br>[[Wies\u0142aw Hartman]] <br> and ''Norton''<br>[[Janusz Bobik]] <br> and ''Szampan''\n|{{flagIOCteam|MEX|1980 Summer}}<br>[[Joaqu\u00edn P\u00e9rez (equestrian)|Joaquin Perez Heras]] <br> and ''Alymony''<br>[[Jes\u00fas G\u00f3mez (equestrian)|Jesus Gomez Portugal]] <br> and ''Massacre''<br>[[Gerardo Tazzer|Valencia Gerardo Tazzer]] <br> and ''Caribe''<br>[[Alberto Vald\u00e9s Jr.|Alberto Valdes Lacarra]] <br> and ''Lady Mirka''\n|}\n\n==Medals==\n\nSoviet Union dominated team competitions, winning gold medals in all of them.

The population was 903 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nIt sits at the tip of the [[Marblehead Peninsula]],<ref>{{GNIS|1065884|Marblehead Peninsula}}</ref> which divides [[Lake Erie]] proper from [[Sandusky Bay]]. Marblehead is part of the area that is referred to regionally as [[Vacationland (Ohio)|Vacationland]] (which includes nearby [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]] and the [[Lake Erie Islands]]), due to the large number of tourists who flock to the area in the summer months. It remains a popular vacation destination due to its lake frontage, ferry service to the [[Lake Erie Islands]], quality sport fishery, the nearby [[Lakeside, Ohio|Lakeside Chautauqua]], and the [[Cedar Point]] amusement park. Marblehead is also home to the Lakeside Daisy State Nature Preserve, home to the only natural U.S. population of the Lakeside Daisy, an endangered species.\n\nMarblehead is home to the [[Marblehead Light (Ohio)|Marblehead Lighthouse]], the oldest continuously-operating lighthouse on the American side of the Great Lakes. The lighthouse is a part of the [[Marblehead Lighthouse State Park]] located within the village.\n\nAdditionally, Marblehead is home to a [[United States Coast Guard]] station, and to the [[Marblehead Lighthouse]], the oldest continuously operating lighthouse on the [[Great Lakes]]. Nearby, in [[Sandusky Bay]], is [[Johnson's Island]], a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nMarblehead is also commercially important as a major [[limestone]] producer. The limestone is mined in nearby quarries and transported by conveyor belt to the Marblehead loading dock, where it is loaded on commercial [[lake freighter]]s. The blocks of stone used to construct the [[Stannard Rock Light]] on [[Lake Superior]] were cut at Marblehead and hauled to the site from 1877 to 1881.<ref name=\"Lighthouse Adventures\">Oleszewski, Wes(1999), ''Lighthouse Adventures: Heroes, haunts, & havoc on the Great Lakes'', pp. 21 - 37, Avery Color Studios, Inc, Gwinn, Michigan, USA, {{ISBN|1892384019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMarblehead is located at {{coord|41.534668|-82.729119|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|4.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|3.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.00|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nMarblehead, as with much of the [[Great Lakes]] region, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), characterized by four distinct seasons. [[Lake Erie]] moderates the climate, especially in late spring and fall, when air and water temperature differences are maximal. Fall temperatures tend to be warmer than the inland areas, while spring temperatures tend to be cooler than inland areas. However, this effect is lessened in the winter because Lake Erie (unlike the other Great Lakes) usually freezes over, coupled with prevailing winds that are often westerly.\n\nThe warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 73.2 \u00b0F (22.9 \u00b0C). January has the lowest average temperature of the year of 24.6 \u00b0F (-4.1 \u00b0C). The driest month is February, with 1.7 inches (44 mm) of precipitation. With an average of 3.7 inches (94 mm), the most precipitation falls in June. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/ohio/marblehead-137636/|title=Marblehead climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Marblehead weather averages - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>{{Weather box     <!-- Infobox begins -->\n| width        =  auto\n| single line  =  <!-- Any entry in this line will display metric and imperial units in the same cell.

The population was 903 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nIt sits at the tip of the [[Marblehead Peninsula]],<ref>{{GNIS|1065884|Marblehead Peninsula}}</ref> which divides [[Lake Erie]] proper from [[Sandusky Bay]]. Marblehead is part of the area that is referred to regionally as [[Vacationland (Ohio)|Vacationland]] (which includes nearby [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]] and the [[Lake Erie Islands]]), due to the large number of tourists who flock to the area in the summer months. It remains a popular vacation destination due to its lake frontage, ferry service to the [[Lake Erie Islands]], quality sport fishery, the nearby [[Lakeside, Ohio|Lakeside Chautauqua]], and the [[Cedar Point]] amusement park. Marblehead is also home to the Lakeside Daisy State Nature Preserve, home to the only natural U.S. population of the Lakeside Daisy, an endangered species.\n\nMarblehead is home to the [[Marblehead Light (Ohio)|Marblehead Lighthouse]], the oldest continuously-operating lighthouse on the American side of the Great Lakes. The lighthouse is a part of the [[Marblehead Lighthouse State Park]] located within the village.\n\nAdditionally, Marblehead is home to a [[United States Coast Guard]] station, and to the [[Marblehead Lighthouse]], the oldest continuously operating lighthouse on the [[Great Lakes]]. Nearby, in [[Sandusky Bay]], is [[Johnson's Island]], a former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] officer [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nMarblehead is also commercially important as a major [[limestone]] producer. The limestone is mined in nearby quarries and transported by conveyor belt to the Marblehead loading dock, where it is loaded on commercial [[lake freighter]]s. The blocks of stone used to construct the [[Stannard Rock Light]] on [[Lake Superior]] were cut at Marblehead and hauled to the site from 1877 to 1881.<ref name=\"Lighthouse Adventures\">Oleszewski, Wes(1999), ''Lighthouse Adventures: Heroes, haunts, & havoc on the Great Lakes'', pp. 21 - 37, Avery Color Studios, Inc, Gwinn, Michigan, USA, {{ISBN|1892384019}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMarblehead is located at {{coord|41.534668|-82.729119|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the village has a total area of {{convert|4.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|3.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|1.00|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-06|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nMarblehead, as with much of the [[Great Lakes]] region, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), characterized by four distinct seasons. [[Lake Erie]] moderates the climate, especially in late spring and fall, when air and water temperature differences are maximal. Fall temperatures tend to be warmer than the inland areas, while spring temperatures tend to be cooler than inland areas. However, this effect is lessened in the winter because Lake Erie (unlike the other Great Lakes) usually freezes over, coupled with prevailing winds that are often westerly.\n\nThe warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of 73.2 \u00b0F (22.9 \u00b0C). January has the lowest average temperature of the year of 24.6 \u00b0F (-4.1 \u00b0C). The driest month is February, with 1.7 inches (44 mm) of precipitation. With an average of 3.7 inches (94 mm), the most precipitation falls in June. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/ohio/marblehead-137636/|title=Marblehead climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Marblehead weather averages - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>{{Weather box     <!-- Infobox begins -->\n| width        =  auto\n| single line  =  <!-- Any entry in this line will display metric and imperial units in the same cell.
