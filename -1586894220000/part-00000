On 6 April 2018 he filed a request for the opening of a commission of inquiry to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] on the respect of France's international commitments with regard to arms export licenses in [[Yemen]].[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/dossiers/respect_engagements_france_exportations_armes_yemen.asphttp://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/dossiers/respect_engagements_france_exportations_armes_yemen.asp] He is also very involved on the issue of human rights in [[Cameroon]], stressing the risks of an eruption of violence in the English-speaking area which is reminiscent of the process that led to the [[genocide]] in [[Rwanda]].\n\n== Academic career ==\nNadot has taught at various secondary and university educational institutions and Apprenticeship Training Center (Mantes-la-Jolie, Orleans, Bourges, Nice, Toulouse, several institutions of Haute-Garonne). Holder of a PhD in history and civilizations from EHESS Paris (2009), he also taught history at the University of Orleans (1998-2003) and the University of Nice (2005-2008). In 2015/2016, he follows a preparation at ENA in continuing education at the Institute of Political Studies of Toulouse.\n\nHis academic work focuses on the history of the body, physical practices and education. His thesis and his recent work make it possible to approach sport in its anthropological continuum, from ancient Greece and its Olympic Games, to the present day. The contours of the current sport and their complexity would be largely related to the strong relationship of corporal practices with the media. In contrast to the work of Norbert Elias, who links the birth of sport to a lowering of the degree of violence in practice and to the advent of a specific ethic, his theory is not contrary to certain ideas of Pierre de Coubertin who wrote about the medieval knight that \"The sporting passion takes hold of him, lifts him up and, through him and through him, will spread throughout all of Western Europe from Germany, Spain, from Italy to England, France serving as a central hub for movement \"\n\nInspired by the ideas of Georges Duby and Eric Hobsbawm, his work also focuses on the relationship between men and their territories and on the notion of human networks through the example of the orders of chivalry or the heralds of arms: the construction of a sporting code of conduct predates the eighteenth century.\n\nIn his thesis titled Jousts, Roots and No Weapons in Castile, Burgundy and France (1428-1470), S\u00e9bastien Nadot shows that sport already existed in the fifteenth century and that, therefore, sport was not born in France. 19th century in England within the bourgeoisie.\n\nThis historical vision opens a breach in a building built on the basis of the work of Norbert Elias. In addition to this contribution in break with the widespread doxa (see on this subject the works of synthesis of Georges Vigarello), it also showed that the organization of the chivalry around European contests works like a system in elaborate network. S\u00e9bastien Nadot evokes an \"International chivalrous\", sharing the same codes, especially at the approach of tournaments and games. These sporting events go beyond the borders and are accompanied by a common cultural base, in which are courtesy, fair play, honor and loyalty. Part of the thesis attempts to demonstrate that medieval sports events are first-class communication media, prefiguration of the modern Olympic Games. Political, diplomatic and financial issues are emerging behind the greatest medieval spectacle. Specialist games, S\u00e9bastien Nadot is more interested in the sporting phenomenon, the notion of conflict (physical or verbal) and also the \"revival\" of the Middle Ages in the twenty-first century. His work on chivalric orders, knightly journeys and heralds of arms also led to a reflection on medieval social networks.\n\nOn the other hand, if sport was not born with the British industrial revolution within the bourgeoisie, it calls into question its \"capitalist\" essence and questions its nature as a terrain of ideological struggles.\n\nStarting from the results of his investigation of medieval chivalric combats, S\u00e9bastien Nadot proposes a new theory of the evolution of sport. In each era, the ruling class would try through sport to impose on others its values and beyond, its superiority. Sport is therefore today the expression of neo-conservative liberalism. The idea of its birth in the early nineteenth century would be the expression of the new domination of the bourgeoisie. The belief in the birth of sport ex-nihilo in England at this time would be a confusion with a process of increased democratization, especially in its gradual opening to women.\n\nThese works are to be placed in a wider debate: the dedicated authors of the history of sport (Norbert Elias, Allen Guttmann) consider that modern sport emerges only at the turn of the eighteenth century and nineteenth century, the specialists of medieval and modern periods claiming the right to use this concept, even though many of the criteria of modern sport do not end up before the nineteenth century.\n\n==Political career==\nCitizen candidate for the 2017 presidential election supported by the Progressists Movement, which promotes a new democratic dynamic around three pillars: social progress that benefits all, the environmental filter posed prior to any public decision and the participation of citizens decision-making phases of political action. He says he wants to erase the line between the political elite and the citizens. His candidacy was initially to be inserted in the primary citizen of 2017 but the first secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|PS]] Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis the recale{{Clarify|reason=what is recale?|date=March 2020}}.

In this novel, he discusses the relationship between democracy, the Internet and social networks.\n\nIn February 2017, faced with the difficulty of collecting the 500 sponsorships needed to run for the presidential election, he announced his withdrawal, to support [[Emmanuel Macron]] personally and joined the political council of En marche!\n\nNadot was selected by [[En Marche!|En marche!]] to be their candidate in the legislative elections on the [[Haute-Garonne's 10th constituency|10th district of Haute-Garonne]]. He was elected with 60.7% [[Haute-Garonne's 10th constituency#Election Results#2017|of the votes]] int the second round. In parliament, he serves on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In addition to his committee assignments, he chairs the France - [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] Parliamentary Friendship Group.\n\nIn 2018, Nadot and 15 other co-signatories officially filed a request for a commission of inquiry into the legality of French weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, days before an official visit of [[Saudi Crown Prince]] [[Mohammed bin Salman]] to Paris.<ref>John Irish and Marine Pennetier (5 April 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-saudi-arms/ahead-of-saudi-prince-visit-macron-lawmaker-asks-for-inquiry-over-french-arms-sales-idUSKCN1HC2N9 Ahead of Saudi prince visit, Macron lawmaker asks for inquiry over French arms sales]\u00a0''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> \n\n== Bibliography ==\nCameroon?

He is a member of the [[Assembl\u00e9e parlementaire de la Francophonie|Parliamentary Assembly of La Francophonie]]. Sitting on the Foreign Affairs Committee, after officially calling on the government in a written question, he is against the sale of French weapons used by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to bomb the civilian population of Yemen on a daily basis. In an interview given on the program \"[[Quotidien]]\" of 23 February 2018 presented by [[Yann Barth\u00e8s]] he clearly asks to suspend arms sales to [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] that use it on civilian populations, in line with a resolution of the European Parliament. On 6 April 2018 he filed a request for the opening of a commission of inquiry to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] on the respect of France's international commitments with regard to arms export licenses in [[Yemen]].[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/dossiers/respect_engagements_france_exportations_armes_yemen.asphttp://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/15/dossiers/respect_engagements_france_exportations_armes_yemen.asp] He is also very involved on the issue of human rights in [[Cameroon]], stressing the risks of an eruption of violence in the English-speaking area which is reminiscent of the process that led to the [[genocide]] in [[Rwanda]].\n\n== Academic career ==\nNadot has taught at various secondary and university educational institutions and Apprenticeship Training Center (Mantes-la-Jolie, Orleans, Bourges, Nice, Toulouse, several institutions of Haute-Garonne). Holder of a PhD in history and civilizations from EHESS Paris (2009), he also taught history at the University of Orleans (1998-2003) and the University of Nice (2005-2008). In 2015/2016, he follows a preparation at ENA in continuing education at the Institute of Political Studies of Toulouse.\n\nHis academic work focuses on the history of the body, physical practices and education. His thesis and his recent work make it possible to approach sport in its anthropological continuum, from ancient Greece and its Olympic Games, to the present day. The contours of the current sport and their complexity would be largely related to the strong relationship of corporal practices with the media. In contrast to the work of Norbert Elias, who links the birth of sport to a lowering of the degree of violence in practice and to the advent of a specific ethic, his theory is not contrary to certain ideas of Pierre de Coubertin who wrote about the medieval knight that \"The sporting passion takes hold of him, lifts him up and, through him and through him, will spread throughout all of Western Europe from Germany, Spain, from Italy to England, France serving as a central hub for movement \"\n\nInspired by the ideas of Georges Duby and Eric Hobsbawm, his work also focuses on the relationship between men and their territories and on the notion of human networks through the example of the orders of chivalry or the heralds of arms: the construction of a sporting code of conduct predates the eighteenth century.\n\nIn his thesis titled Jousts, Roots and No Weapons in Castile, Burgundy and France (1428-1470), S\u00e9bastien Nadot shows that sport already existed in the fifteenth century and that, therefore, sport was not born in France. 19th century in England within the bourgeoisie.\n\nThis historical vision opens a breach in a building built on the basis of the work of Norbert Elias. In addition to this contribution in break with the widespread doxa (see on this subject the works of synthesis of Georges Vigarello), it also showed that the organization of the chivalry around European contests works like a system in elaborate network. S\u00e9bastien Nadot evokes an \"International chivalrous\", sharing the same codes, especially at the approach of tournaments and games. These sporting events go beyond the borders and are accompanied by a common cultural base, in which are courtesy, fair play, honor and loyalty. Part of the thesis attempts to demonstrate that medieval sports events are first-class communication media, prefiguration of the modern Olympic Games. Political, diplomatic and financial issues are emerging behind the greatest medieval spectacle. Specialist games, S\u00e9bastien Nadot is more interested in the sporting phenomenon, the notion of conflict (physical or verbal) and also the \"revival\" of the Middle Ages in the twenty-first century. His work on chivalric orders, knightly journeys and heralds of arms also led to a reflection on medieval social networks.\n\nOn the other hand, if sport was not born with the British industrial revolution within the bourgeoisie, it calls into question its \"capitalist\" essence and questions its nature as a terrain of ideological struggles.\n\nStarting from the results of his investigation of medieval chivalric combats, S\u00e9bastien Nadot proposes a new theory of the evolution of sport. In each era, the ruling class would try through sport to impose on others its values and beyond, its superiority. Sport is therefore today the expression of neo-conservative liberalism. The idea of its birth in the early nineteenth century would be the expression of the new domination of the bourgeoisie. The belief in the birth of sport ex-nihilo in England at this time would be a confusion with a process of increased democratization, especially in its gradual opening to women.\n\nThese works are to be placed in a wider debate: the dedicated authors of the history of sport (Norbert Elias, Allen Guttmann) consider that modern sport emerges only at the turn of the eighteenth century and nineteenth century, the specialists of medieval and modern periods claiming the right to use this concept, even though many of the criteria of modern sport do not end up before the nineteenth century.\n\n==Political career==\nCitizen candidate for the 2017 presidential election supported by the Progressists Movement, which promotes a new democratic dynamic around three pillars: social progress that benefits all, the environmental filter posed prior to any public decision and the participation of citizens decision-making phases of political action. He says he wants to erase the line between the political elite and the citizens. His candidacy was initially to be inserted in the primary citizen of 2017 but the first secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|PS]] Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis the recale{{Clarify|reason=what is recale?|date=March 2020}}. To block Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Marine Le Pen, he made a call to the gathering of \"progressive forces\" for the presidential election addressed to [[Emmanuel Macron]], [[Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon|Jean-Luc Melenchon]], Charlotte Marchandise and [[Yannick Jadot]].\n\nHe is the first French politician to have used an augmented reality campaign poster. \n\nIn January 2017, Nadot published a political tale titled Reinette 2.0. In this novel, he discusses the relationship between democracy, the Internet and social networks.\n\nIn February 2017, faced with the difficulty of collecting the 500 sponsorships needed to run for the presidential election, he announced his withdrawal, to support [[Emmanuel Macron]] personally and joined the political council of En marche!\n\nNadot was selected by [[En Marche!|En marche!]] to be their candidate in the legislative elections on the [[Haute-Garonne's 10th constituency|10th district of Haute-Garonne]].

In addition to his committee assignments, he chairs the France - [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] Parliamentary Friendship Group.\n\nIn 2018, Nadot and 15 other co-signatories officially filed a request for a commission of inquiry into the legality of French weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen, days before an official visit of [[Saudi Crown Prince]] [[Mohammed bin Salman]] to Paris.<ref>John Irish and Marine Pennetier (April 5, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-saudi-arms/ahead-of-saudi-prince-visit-macron-lawmaker-asks-for-inquiry-over-french-arms-sales-idUSKCN1HC2N9 Ahead of Saudi prince visit, Macron lawmaker asks for inquiry over French arms sales]\u00a0''[[Reuters]]''.</ref> \n\n== Bibliography ==\nCameroon?

{"title_page": "Jean-Jacques Boisard", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Jean-Jacques Boissard}}\n'''Jean-Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Marius Boisard''' ([[Caen]], 1743 \u2013 1831) was a French [[fabulist]].\n\n==Biography==\nBoisard was a French fabulist born in 1743 in [[Caen]], a historical town located in [[Normandy]], North-West France, about 150 kilometers from Paris. Educated by his family to be a member of the local Bar, he was appointed Secretary of the Finance Council and, in 1778, Secretary of the Chancery of \"Monsieur\", namely the elder brother of the king of France. With the [[French Revolution]], he lost his post and, later on, the modest pension allocated to it.\n\nAs a member of the Royal Academy of Literature (Acad\u00e9mie royale des Belles-lettres) of Caen, the first academy established in France after the \"[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]\", he started publishing fables in 1764 in the [[Mercure de France]]. Fables were very popular in the French literature of the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment, under the shadow of Jean de La Fontaine. In 1771, the publisher Lottin published the ''Fablier fran\u00e7ais'', which was a compilation of texts from some hundred authors who wrote fables, since La Fontaine. This literary art dates back, at least, to Greek antiquity. Fables were usually written in verses and used animals for their symbolic value. They carry implicit or explicit messages of moral philosophy.\n\nFacing  problems due to his antirevolutionary ideas against the Republic, Boisard left Paris and returned to Caen. The city was incidentally a centre of \"federalist\" insurgents against the revolutionary government. One of its citizens, [[Charlotte Corday]], in 1793, murdered a prominent leader of the Revolution, [[Jean Paul Marat]]. Boisard was, at this time, apparently not involved in politics. Up to 1805, he published several collections of fables and various works. The richness of his imagination was matchless.\n\nAt the time, he was recognized as a very respectable author. Beside the fables, he wrote some light poetry and translated several poems of Horace. Voltaire praised him, Diderot (''Epitre \u00e0 Boisard'') dedicated one of his very few rhymed Epistle to the fabulist: \"nobody has been such a charming rhyme writer ... Nobody has been such a perfect rhyme writer\" (\"Oncques ne fut un rimeur si charmant ... Oncques ne fut un rimeur si parfait\"). It must be noticed however that modern literary critics are now of the opinion that this epistle may have been addressed to his nephew (mentioned below) since it implicitly refers to a bad fortune. For his part, [[Jacob Grimm]], who was a close friend, considered Boisard's fables as natural and diverse, but sometimes na\u00efve. He was quite laudatory in writing that Boisard was the fabulist who imitated the less La Fontaine, but came the closest to the master. The polemical writer [[Antoine de Rivarol]] was sarcastic in stating that Boisard's fables \"have outmoded those of La Fontaine, which is always somewhat unfair\" (\"ont fait passer de mode celles de La Fontaine, ce qui est toujours un peu injuste!\")\n\nBoisard is one of the most prolific authors of  French literature. His publications were produced over a period of 33 years (1773 to 1806). Presently, he is broadly considered as the best fabulist after La Fontaine, although his literary style, pleasant and light but sometimes inelegant, is certainly not of the same standard. In 1806, ''Mille et une fables'' (''A Thousand and One Fables'') was published as a compilation of at least five former editions. It was a bulky and sumptuously printed and illustrated publication, which does not seem to be available now. As with hundreds of French fabulists of that time, except La Fontaine, the work of Boisard did not really survive as centuries passed. Boisard also produced a lyrical poem, \"Ode sur le d\u00e9luge\", which was crowned, in 1790, by the Academy of Rouen. Boisard died in his home town of Caen in 1831 or 1833.\n\n==Works ==\nFirst collection of Fables published in 1773, second collection in 1777, third collection in 1803, fourth in 1804, fifth in 1805.
