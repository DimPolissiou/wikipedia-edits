He directed more than 20 campaigns and won 65 [[pitched battle]]s, during which he conquered or overran more territory than any other commander in history.<ref>Ch 1 Great Captains Unveiled Liddell Hart {{ISBN|0-8369-0618-7}}</ref> He gained victory by means of imaginative and sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that were hundreds of kilometers away from each other. Subutai is well known for his expedition from central Asia to the Russian steppe and into Europe. \n\n==Early life==\nHistorians believe Subutai was born in the year 1175,<ref>Gabriel, Richard. \"Genghis Khan's Greatest General Subotai the Valiant\". University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 6.</ref> probably just west of the upper [[Onon River]] in what is now [[Mongolia]]. He belonged to the [[Uriankhai]] clan, known as the reindeer people, a group of Siberian forest-dwellers who did not live like the plains Mongols to their south. As a result of his upbringing, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.<ref>Gabriel, 6-8.</ref> Subutai's family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai's great-great grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai's father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai's elder brother [[Jelme]] also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from [[Jebe]], then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca'urqan) is mentioned in the [[The Secret History of the Mongols|Secret History of the Mongols]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsendiin Damdins\u00fcren |first= |year=1970 |title=\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0446 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0447\u043e\u043e |edition=1st |language=Mongolian |trans-title=[[The Secret History of the Mongols]] |chapter=120 (III)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Subutai's biography in the [[History of Yuan]]Subutai's father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai's brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father's difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor's station.<ref>Yuanshi, 121, 1a-5a</ref>\n\nDespite this close family association, some consider Subutai's career proof that the [[Mongol Empire]] was a [[meritocracy]]. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a [[blacksmith]]. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin's army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis.<ref>Gabriel 2004, pp. 1, 3.</ref>  Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe's death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his \"dogs of war,\" who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'':<ref>Cummins, Joseph.

These four dogs are [[Jebe]], and Kublai (different than [[Kublai Khan]]), [[Jelme]], and Subotai.|The Secret History of the Mongols}}\n\nAppointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan's ger (yurt) door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to [[Genghis Khan]], \"I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind.\"<ref name=Saunders>Saunders, J. J. (1971). ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. {{ISBN|0-8122-1766-7}}</ref> This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties.<ref>Gabriel, 10</ref> Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite [[Jebe]] (1211\u201312, 1213\u201314, 1219\u201323) and [[Muqali]] (1213\u201314), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219).\n\nSubutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the [[Merkit]], when he was just 22 years old.  Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals.<ref>Gabriel, 12-13.</ref>  He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia.\n\n==As a general==\nSubutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances.  Subutai's maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and [[Scorched earth|devastated the surrounded agriculture]] so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.<ref>Gabriel, Chapter 8; Carl Svedrup, Sube`etei Ba`atur, Anonymous Strategist.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the [[battle of Carrhae]] or the [[battle of Manzikert]], Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the [[battle of the Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.<ref>Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015), 157-159.</ref>\n\nSubutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in [[siege warfare]]. Even in field battles he made use of [[siege engine]]s. In the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge [[Lithobolos|stonethrower]]<nowiki/>s to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the [[Barrage (artillery)|creeping barrage]] of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.<ref>Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War.</ref> \n\nLike Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity.  \n\n==Central Asian campaigns (1217\u20131220)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Central Asia}}\nIn 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated [[Merkit]]s and their allies, the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak confederation]], in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the [[Chu River]] in 1217 and again in 1219 in [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchak]] territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children's toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai's army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture of all the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2975-76.</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Mohammad II]] of [[Khwarizm]] attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan's elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed's confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 370\u2013371.</ref> Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the [[Kara-Khitai]] Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars.\n\nGenghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade [[Khwarazm|Khwarizm]] as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically inferior to the forces of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarizim Empire]], but through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan's Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan's army through the deadly [[Kyzylkum Desert]] to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 373\u2013385.</ref> After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammad attempted to save himself by fleeing into central [[Persia]], but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan's main army.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'',  375\u2013410.</ref> Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the 'Second Alexander'.\n\n==Great Cavalry Raid (1220\u20131223)==\nSubutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in [[Azerbaijan]] and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] \"which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated\": 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the [[Caspian Sea]] through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]].<ref>''In the Service of the Khans'', 19.</ref>\n\nAfter destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Though the Georgian king was reluctant to actually commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated a powerful Georgian army with many thousands of knights at the [[Battle of Caucasus Mountain|Battle of the Caucasus Mountains]], by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men in front parade crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.<ref>Kirakos Gandzaketsi, History of the Armenians, 166\u2013167.</ref> This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the [[Fifth Crusade]]. Instead, King George's sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated.<ref>Oliver of Paderborn, \"The Capture of Damietta\", trans. Joseph J. Gavigan, ''Christian Society and the Crusades, 1198\u20131229'', ed. Edward Peters (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 90, 123\u2013124.</ref> Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer.\n\nAfter ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] during the winter to get around the [[Derbent]] Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a [[Wikt:perilous#Adjective|perilous]] route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the [[Alans]], [[Circassians]], and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. After 9 days of pursuit, Jebe and Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and [[Cuman]] army at the [[Battle of the Kalka River|Kalka]] (31 May 1223). The Volga Bulgars claimed that they had ambushed Subutai's army, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 607\u2013613.</ref>\n\n==Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin Chinese (1207, 1209, 1211\u20131215, 1226\u201327)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nIn the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe's army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming [[Great Wall]]). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic [[battle of Yehuling]]. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter's daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.<ref>''In the Service of the Khan'', Paul Buell, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nSubutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of [[Xi Xia]] in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis's main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] districts along the upper [[Wei River]], and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet.<ref>Buell, 20.</ref> Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] in 1229.\n\n===Conquest of Jin China (1231\u20131235)===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nAfter a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230\u20131231, \u00d6gedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central [[China]]) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229,<ref>Rashid al-Din, ''Annals of Ogedei Khan'', 33.</ref> but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229\u20131230 after the Mongolian general Dolqolqu suffered a major defeat.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31.</ref> Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them.\n\nSubutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai's main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of [[Henan]] ended in failure after Subutai's advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch\u2019e-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 1231\u20131232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and [[Tolui]], invading the [[Song Empire]] and attacking Henan from the more exposed south.<ref>Atwood, 34.</ref> The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides.<ref>Yuan Shi, 115.2885-6.</ref> This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south.\n\nThe main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai's army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin's attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube'etei Ba'atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nWith part of his force harassing the Jin army's foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin's line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai's army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army's food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the [[battle of Sanfeng Mountain]] (9 February 1232), capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T\u2019iehling (1 March 1232).<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube`etei Ba`atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of [[Wikt:circumvallate#Verb|circumvallation]] that had a perimeter stretching {{convert|54|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called \"Thunder Crash Bombs\", which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, [[mangonel]]<nowiki/>s, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their [[Wikt:intransigence|intransigence]] and extremely long resistance. However, \u00d6gedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly. <ref>McLynn, 407\u2013410.</ref>  With assistance from the Song Dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234.\n\nHowever, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized [[Kaifeng]] and [[Luoyang]] during the summer of 1234 during Subutai's absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them , and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai's victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward.\n\n==Conquest of Russia (1236\u20131240)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'}}\n\u00d6gedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchaks]] and [[Bulgars]]. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince [[Batu Khan|Batu]]). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: \u00d6gedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died.<ref>McLynn, 435.</ref> In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains.<ref>Svedrup, 43\u201344.</ref> After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader [[Bachman Khan|Bachman]] on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had [[Wikt:ensconce|ensconced]] himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the 'net'.<ref>McLynn, 436\u2013437.</ref>\n\nUnlike in 1222\u201323 when the majority of the Rus' states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Russians were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked [[Ryazan]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the [[Black Sea]]. In 1239, the Rus' state of [[Chernigov]] was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer [[Novgorod]] when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.<ref>Frank McLynn, 434\u2013441.</ref>\n\nThe most notable encounter of the campaign was the [[battle of the Sit River]] in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated.<ref>''The Chronicle of Novgorod'' (1914), 83.</ref> The Mongols had made a treaty with Galich-Vladimir, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. [[Kiev]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and other cities were quickly taken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Invasion of Central Europe (1241\u20131242)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of [[Jochi]], was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against [[Kievan Rus']]. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates.\n\nThough the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, [[Bela IV]], was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to.<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat''.</ref> Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories [[Baidar]] and [[Kadan]] regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the [[Battle of Legnica]], right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]]'s army triumphed in [[Transylvania]], a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King [[Bela IV]] had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai's force still managed an astonishing pace of {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela's obstacles.<ref>McLynn, 465\u2013466.</ref>\n\nOnly one day after the smaller Mongol army in [[Poland]] had won the [[Battle of Legnica]], Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the [[Battle of Mohi]] during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so [[catapult]]s were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2978.</ref> Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled.\n\nThe result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the [[Mongols]] left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this 'hole' in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men.<ref>Denis Sinor, ''[http://deremilitari.org/2014/07/the-mongols-in-the-west/ The Mongols in the West]'' (1999).</ref> In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong [[Baghatur|ba'aaturs]] (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.<ref>Yuan Shi, 121, 1a\u20135a</ref>\n\n===Mongol subjugation of Hungary===\n{{Main|First Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\nThe after battle tensions reached its climax at a very argumentative feast. One unique feature of this campaign, due to the large number of princes, was that in addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preempetively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|Guyuk]] and [[B\u00fcri|Buri]].<ref>Hodong Kim, ''A Reappraisal of G\u00fcy\u00fcg Khan'', 319\u2013320.</ref> Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to \u00d6gedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.<ref>Urgunge Onon, ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', 270.</ref>\n\nDespite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary.  From Rogerius' writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy. According to Rogerius, The Mongols would sack a town and pretend to depart, only to hide and return shortly thereafter to kill everyone who had been hiding under rubble or in the forests. he also claims that in other instances they enlisted willing Hungarians to organize their brethren to work at Mongol direction, or spread false word of a general amnesty being ordained.<ref>McLynn, 472\u2013479; Thomas of Spalato, ''Historia''; Rogerius of Apulia, ''Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaro''.</ref>\n\nIn order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at [[Oradea]], the castle of [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]] of [[Pannonia]], and the capital [[Esztergom]], though the latter's stone citadel held out, though not all sieges proved successful. In the west, Kadan's army was unable to catch Bela, and lacking siege equipment, he could not forcibly capture the Adriatic cities. However, Bela, hiding on the island of [[Trogir]] in [[Croatia]], was also unable to effectively rally his people due to his flight, which meant that for the time being Hungary was at the total mercy of the main Mongol army.\n\nBy early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the [[Holy Roman Empire]], when news came of the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, ''The Story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars''.</ref> Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. It should be noted however that this account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan's death after they had already begun the withdrawal. Furthermore, the campaign had become bogged down in a series of unprofitable sieges at Klist and other fortified strongholds. The Mongols always practiced a \"tsunami strategy\" of temporarily retreating from the furthest outlying provinces they had won to avoid overextension, only to return shortly after their closer conquests were properly solidified.<ref>Timothy May, ''The Mongol Art of War and the Tsunami Strategy''.</ref> However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary's population may have died from the invasion.<ref>McLynn, 479; ''Carmen Miserabile''.</ref> A Bavarian monk tersely recorded in 1241 that \"In this year, after existing for 350 years, the kingdom of Hungary was annihilated by the Tatars.\"<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat'', 49.</ref> Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to [[Pope Innocent IV]] that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.<ref>King Belas IV's letter to the Pope, 310.</ref>{{full citation needed|reason=What's the source for this letter?|date=May 2019}} It has been noted however that the level of within Hungary was quite unevenly distributed, with archaeological evidence of destruction heavily concentrated east of the Danube, in the Great Hungarian Plain. It has also been pointed out that, given that Bela IV was able to recover his territories from Frederick II Babenburg of Austria almost immediately after the Mongols left, the damage done to his military structure can hardly have been as severe as Rogerius and Thomas of Split claimed.<ref>Laszlovszky, J\u00f3zsef & Pow, Stephen & Romh\u00e1nyi, Beatrix & Ferenczi, Laszlo & Pinke, Zsolt.

Though Baldwin defeated a small skirmishing force, he was apparently lured into overconfidence and suffered a severe defeat.<ref>McLynn, 479.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter subduing a [[Cumans|Cuman]] revolt in what is now Russia, Subutai turned towards Mongolia. Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] was elected after three years, with Subutai's support. G\u00fcy\u00fck had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge at the age of 71 of the campaign against the [[Song dynasty]] for 1246\u20131247. The Papal envoy [[Plano Carpini]] saw him when he was in [[Karakorum]], Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the rest of his life at his home in the vicinity of the [[Tuul River]] (near modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), dying there at the age of 72.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the [[Danube|Danube river]].<ref name=\"weatherford\">{{cite book |title=Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |publisher=Penguin |year=2017 |isbn=0735221170 |page=286}}</ref>\n\nSubutai's descendants such as [[Uriyangkhadai]] and [[Aju]] would serve the [[Great Khans]] for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], invade [[Dai Viet]] and obtain their submission, and achieve great success invading the Song from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the [[battle of Xiangyang]], which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote|\"No Mongol general played a greater role than Subotei Ba'atur in establishing and maintaining the early Mongol Empire.

When he first entered the service of Temujin, the later Cinggis Qan, the realm of that minor Mongol chieftain comprised only a few families.

Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 110.</ref> The Mongols did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3\u20135 axes of approach, often 500\u20131000&nbsp;km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail.  Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state's will to fight.<ref>Gabriel, 113.</ref> Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.<ref>LTC Sean Slappy, ''Command and Control Began with Subotai Bahadur'' (2010).</ref>\n\nThough unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai's exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book ''Great Captains Unveiled'' after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise.  In particular, [[Erwin Rommel]] and [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] were avid students of Mongol campaigns.<ref>James C. Bradford, ed., ''International Encyclopedia of Military History''.</ref>\n\n==='Deep Battle' theory===\n{{Main|Deep Battle}}\nRussia derived the most use out of a careful study of the Mongol campaigns.

The Red Army even went so far as to copy Subutai's use of smokescreens on the battlefield to cover troop movements.<ref>Gabriel, 112\u2013118.</ref> Later in the 20th century, American military theorist [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] and some of his followers used Genghis Khan and Subutai's campaigns as examples of maneuver warfare.<ref>LTC Joe E.

He directed more than 20 campaigns and won 65 [[pitched battle]]s, during which he conquered or overran more territory than any other commander in history.<ref>Ch 1 Great Captains Unveiled Liddell Hart {{ISBN|0-8369-0618-7}}</ref> He gained victory by means of imaginative and sophisticated strategies and routinely coordinated movements of armies that were hundreds of kilometers away from each other. Subutai is well known for his expedition from central Asia to the Russian steppe and into Europe. \n\n==Early life==\nHistorians believe Subutai was born in the year 1175,<ref>Gabriel, Richard. \"Genghis Khan's Greatest General Subotai the Valiant\". University of Oklahoma Press, 2004, p. 6.</ref> probably just west of the upper [[Onon River]] in what is now [[Mongolia]]. He belonged to the [[Uriankhai]] clan, known as the reindeer people, a group of Siberian forest-dwellers who did not live like the plains Mongols to their south. As a result of his upbringing, Subutai lacked the natural horsemanship training from birth that all Mongols possessed, making him an outsider among them.<ref>Gabriel, 6-8.</ref> Subutai's family had been associated with the family of Temujin (future Genghis Khan) for many generations. Subutai's great-great grandfather, Nerbi, was supposedly an ally of the Mongol Khan Tumbina Sechen. Subutai's father, Jarchigudai, supposedly supplied food to Temujin and his followers when they were in dire straits at lake Baljuna, and Subutai's elder brother [[Jelme]] also served as a general in the Mongol army and was a close companion of Temujin. Jelme rescued a severely wounded Temujin (hit by an arrow from [[Jebe]], then an enemy) in the process of unification of the Mongolian plateau. Another brother, Chaurkhan (also romanized as Ca'urqan) is mentioned in the [[The Secret History of the Mongols|Secret History of the Mongols]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsendiin Damdins\u00fcren |first= |year=1970 |title=\u041c\u043e\u043d\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044b\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0443\u0446 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0447\u043e\u043e |edition=1st |language=Mongolian |trans-title=[[The Secret History of the Mongols]] |chapter=120 (III)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Subutai's biography in the [[History of Yuan]]Subutai's father was once driving a herd of sheep in order to present them to his overlord, Taizu (Genghis Khan). Encountering robbers, he was seized. Huluhun (Subutai's brother) and Subutai arrived in good time, and with their lances stabbed some of the robbers. Horses and men fell together, and the remainder of the band withdrew and departed. Consequently, they relieved their father's difficulty, and the sheep were able to attain the emperor's station.<ref>Yuanshi, 121, 1a-5a</ref>\n\nDespite this close family association, some consider Subutai's career proof that the [[Mongol Empire]] was a [[meritocracy]]. He was a commoner by birth, the son of Jarchigudai, who was supposedly a [[blacksmith]]. When he was 14 years old, Subutai left his clan to join Temujin's army, following in the footsteps of his older brother Jelme who had joined when he was 17 years old, and he rose to the very highest command available to one who was not a blood relative to Genghis.<ref>Gabriel 2004, pp. 1, 3.</ref>  Within a decade he rose to become a general, in command of one of 4 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]] operating in the vanguard. During the invasion of Northern China in 1211, Subutai was partnered with the senior Mongol general Jebe, an apprentice and partnership they would maintain until Jebe's death in 1223. In 1212 he took Huan by storm, the first major independent exploit mentioned in the sources. Genghis Khan is reported to have called him one of his \"dogs of war,\" who were 4 of his 8 top lieutenants, in ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'':<ref>Cummins, Joseph.

These four dogs are [[Jebe]], and Kublai (different than [[Kublai Khan]]), [[Jelme]], and Subotai.|The Secret History of the Mongols}}\n\n Appointed to the prestigious post of Genghis Khan's ger (yurt) door guard during his teen years, Mongol histories say that Subutai said to [[Genghis Khan]], \"I will ward off your enemies as felt cloth protects one from the wind.\"<ref name=Saunders>Saunders, J. J. (1971). ''The History of the Mongol Conquests'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. {{ISBN|0-8122-1766-7}}</ref> This access enabled him to listen on, and later join, the Mongol strategy meetings somewhere around his late teens and early twenties.<ref>Gabriel, 10</ref> Throughout most of Genghis Khan's lifetime, Subutai would have the opportunity to apprentice on detached missions under the elite [[Jebe]] (1211\u201312, 1213\u201314, 1219\u201323) and [[Muqali]] (1213\u201314), in addition to Genghis Khan himself (1219).\n\nSubutai's first chance at independent command came in 1197 during action against the [[Merkit]], when he was just 22 years old.  Subutai's role was to act as the vanguard and defeat one of the Merkit camps at the Tchen River. Subutai refused Genghis Khan's offer for extra elite troops, and instead traveled to the Merkit camp alone, posing as a Mongol deserter. Subutai managed to convince the Merkits that the main Mongol army was far away, and they were in no danger. As a result, the Merkit lowered their guard and limited their patrols, allowing the Mongols to easily surprise and encircle the Merkits, capturing two generals.<ref>Gabriel, 12-13.</ref>  He also served as a commander of the vanguard with distinction in the 1204 battle against the Naiman that gave the Mongols total control over Mongolia.\n\n==As a general==\nSubutai was a major innovator in the art of war. In the invasions of China, Russia, and Europe, Subutai routinely coordinated large forces often separated by large distances.  Subutai's maneuvers were designed to mislead his foes and strike them from unexpected directions. The Mongol invasion of the Jin in 1232 continually pulled the hitherto successful Jin forces apart despite their highly advantageous terrain, as they could not determine which Mongol armies were the feints and which were the true threats until their main army became isolated and starved. Strongly fortified locations would be bypassed and ignored until all organized resistance had been destroyed. Sieges would be limited to critical or vulnerable locations; in other situations, the Mongols either left a blockading force, or simply ignored fortified citadels and [[Scorched earth|devastated the surrounded agriculture]] so that the remaining people would starve if they remained within fortified walls.<ref>Gabriel, Chapter 8; Carl Svedrup, Sube`etei Ba`atur, Anonymous Strategist.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the common perception of steppe horse archer armies slowly weakening their foes with arrows for many hours or even days, such as at the [[battle of Carrhae]] or the [[battle of Manzikert]], Subutai fought in a much more decisive and fluid manner where heavy firepower was used to create openings for rapid cavalry charges with deep formations. At the [[battle of the Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's 20,000 man army routed the 80,000 man Russian army by stringing it out after a 9-day retreat, and then immediately turning and delivering a decisive charge without a prolonged missile bombardment. The vanguard of the Russian army was already put in flight before the second wave even reached the battlefield and began to deploy.<ref>Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015), 157-159.</ref>\n\nSubutai was one of the first Mongol generals, alongside Genghis Khan, who realized the value of engineers in [[siege warfare]]. Even in field battles he made use of [[siege engine]]s. In the [[Battle of Mohi]], the Hungarian crossbowmen repelled a night bridge crossing by the Mongols, and inflicted considerable casualties on the Mongols fighting to cross the river the following day. Subutai ordered huge [[Lithobolos|stonethrower]]<nowiki/>s to clear the bank of Hungarian crossbowmen and open the way for his light cavalry to cross the river without further losses. This use of siege weapons was one of the first recorded uses of artillery bombardments against the enemy army to disrupt their resistance while simultaneously attacking them. In execution, his usage functioned more akin to the [[Barrage (artillery)|creeping barrage]] of World War I, used to soften and disrupt enemy lines right before an attack.<ref>Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War.</ref> \n\nLike Genghis Khan, Subutai was a master at creating divisions within the enemy ranks and surprising them. The terrifying Mongol reputation, combined with highly effective spy networks that spread discord, as well as incentives to key local leaders, prevented his opponents from effectively uniting and fighting at their full capacity.  \n\n==Central Asian campaigns (1217\u20131220)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Central Asia}}\nIn 1217, Genghis Khan sent Subutai to hunt down the hated [[Merkit]]s and their allies, the [[Cumania|Cuman-Kipchak confederation]], in modern-day central Kazakhstan. Subutai defeated them on the [[Chu River]] in 1217 and again in 1219 in [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchak]] territory. Before the battle of the Chem River in 1219, Subutai had his vanguard carry children's toys and leave them behind, as if they were a group of families fleeing from the Merkit. As a result of this deception, Subutai's army was able to surprise, encircle, and capture of all the Merkit/Kipchak leadership.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2975-76.</ref>\n\n[[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Mohammad II]] of [[Khwarizm]] attacked Subutai shortly afterwards along the Irghiz River. Despite being outnumbered three to one against the Sultan's elite forces which had conquered much of Central Asia, Subutai held him off after a fierce battle and retreated during the night. According to Persian sources, this battle seems to have eroded Mohammed's confidence in his ability to defeat the Mongols in pitched battle, since Subutai only commanded a small 20,000 man force and did not want to even fight him. Supposedly the Mongol army had destroyed his left wing, and nearly broken his center and captured him, until reinforcements from his son arrived and the battlefield turned dark.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 370\u2013371.</ref> Because of this battle, Mohammed was unable to take advantage of the upheaval in the [[Kara-Khitai]] Empire (simultaneously being conquered by the Mongolian general Jebe), like he had in earlier wars.\n\nGenghis Khan led the Mongol army westwards in late 1219 to invade [[Khwarazm|Khwarizm]] as retaliation for the execution of Mongol ambassadors. With roughly 100,000 armed men, the Mongol army was numerically inferior to the forces of the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarizim Empire]], but through deception and rapid maneuver, the Mongols defeated the isolated Khwarezm armies in detail before they could react. Serving as the Mongol equivalent of Genghis Khan's Chief of Staff, Subutai marched with the Khan's army through the deadly [[Kyzylkum Desert]] to emerge behind the Khwarezm defense network at Bukhara.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'', 373\u2013385.</ref> After the rapid capture of the Khwarezm center of defense, Samarkand, Genghis Khan dispatched Subutai and Jebe with 30,000 men to hunt the Khwarezm Shah and prevent him from rallying the other Khwarezm armies. Shah Mohammad attempted to save himself by fleeing into central [[Persia]], but while he eluded capture, the relentless chase meant he could not rally his forces. As a result, the several hundred thousand man Khwarezm forces in reserve remained divided and were easily destroyed piecemeal by Genghis Khan's main army.<ref>Juvaini, ''History of the World Conqueror'',  375\u2013410.</ref> Drained by the fierce pursuit, Mohammed fell ill and died at a fishing village on an island in the Caspian Sea in early 1221, an ignominious end for the man who styled himself the 'Second Alexander'.\n\n==Great Cavalry Raid (1220\u20131223)==\nSubutai and Jebe spent part of the 1219 winter in [[Azerbaijan]] and Iran, raiding and looting while preventing the western Khwarezm forces from assisting the rest of the empire to the east. Here he conceived the idea of conducting the most audacious reconnaissance-in-force in history, which was described by Edward Gibbon as [an expedition] \"which has never been attempted, and has never been repeated\": 20,000 Mongol forces would circle the [[Caspian Sea]] through the Caucasus Mountains to fall on the rear of the Wild [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]].<ref>''In the Service of the Khans'', 19.</ref>\n\nAfter destroying resistance in Persia and submitting Azerbaijan, the Mongols invaded the Christian Kingdom of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Though the Georgian king was reluctant to actually commit to battle, Subutai and Jebe forced his hand by ravaging the countryside and killing his people. Subutai and Jebe then defeated a powerful Georgian army with many thousands of knights at the [[Battle of Caucasus Mountain|Battle of the Caucasus Mountains]], by luring the knights away from their infantry with a feigned retreat, then enveloping the knights. After destroying them, the Mongols encircled and crushed the Georgian army. Subutai, who was identified by the Georgians as being in command, originally lured the Georgians into thinking his army was a friendly ally by having his men in front parade crosses, and using spies to start false rumors that the Mongols were actually Christian wonder-workers who had come to assist the Georgians.<ref>Kirakos Gandzaketsi, History of the Armenians, 166\u2013167.</ref> This Mongol reconnaissance mission may have inadvertently altered the history of the Crusades, as Georgia had planned on sending their now destroyed army to join the [[Fifth Crusade]]. Instead, King George's sister Rusudan had to write to the Pope to explain that they could not assist the Crusade because their whole army had been disintegrated.<ref>Oliver of Paderborn, \"The Capture of Damietta\", trans. Joseph J. Gavigan, ''Christian Society and the Crusades, 1198\u20131229'', ed. Edward Peters (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971), 90, 123\u2013124.</ref> Though Georgia lay defenseless after these catastrophic defeats, the Mongol mission was to raid and scout, not conquer.\n\nAfter ravaging Georgia, the Mongols cut across the [[Caucasus Mountains]] during the winter to get around the [[Derbent]] Pass. The Mongols were tricked by their guides into taking a [[Wikt:perilous#Adjective|perilous]] route and emerged from the mountains exhausted, only to be confronted with a far larger steppe coalition army. Using clever diplomacy, Subutai isolated and defeated the [[Alans]], [[Circassians]], and Don Kipchaks/Cumans in detail. After plundering the southern Russian steppes, the Russian princes united with the retreating Cuman confederacy to defeat the Mongols with an 80,000 man host. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Subutai sacrificed the 1,000 men of his rear guard to induce the coalition army to recklessly pursue him and become separated. After 9 days of pursuit, Jebe and Subutai suddenly turned and crushed the combined [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] and [[Cuman]] army at the [[Battle of the Kalka River|Kalka]] (31 May 1223). The Volga Bulgars claimed that they had ambushed Subutai's army, but historians have doubted this account in light of the Mongols seeking out and defeating the Qangli Turks in southern Russia shortly afterward.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015), 607\u2013613.</ref>\n\n==Invasions of the Xi Xia and Jin Chinese (1207, 1209, 1211\u20131215, 1226\u201327)==\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nIn the initial invasion of the Jin in 1211, Subutai served with Jebe's army that attacked the Chinese forts around the eastern edge of the Great Wall (not the Ming [[Great Wall]]). In late 1211 he was the first to scale the walls of the key fortress of Huan-Chou, and took part in the ambush of a major Jin army at Wu Sha Pao and the climactic [[battle of Yehuling]]. In 1212, he may have served with Jebe during the latter's daring capture of Liaoyang, and in 1213 he served with Muqali and Jebe in a great raid in Shandong.<ref>''In the Service of the Khan'', Paul Buell, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nSubutai played a key part in the campaign against the Tanguts of [[Xi Xia]] in 1226, serving as commander of the flank army to strike the Tanguts in the rear. While Genghis invaded the Xi Xia by a more traditional northern route, Subutai unexpectedly attacked from the west over the mountains and inhospitable deserts in modern Turkestan, causing Tangut resistance to collapse. The Tangut Empire was cut in two: with Genghis preventing reinforcements being sent west, Subutai subdued resistance in the west and joined with Genghis's main army to conquer the east. In 1227, he conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] districts along the upper [[Wei River]], and even raided the Kingdom of Tibet.<ref>Buell, 20.</ref> Though the Mongols conquered Xi Xia, Mongol operations against Jin China were interrupted by the death of Genghis Khan in 1227. Genghis Khan was succeeded by his son [[\u00d6gedei Khan|\u00d6gedei]] in 1229.\n\n===Conquest of Jin China (1231\u20131235)===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Jin China}}\nAfter a humiliating defeat by the resurgent Jin in 1230\u20131231, \u00d6gedei personally led the main Mongol army against the Jin (in Central [[China]]) and appointed Subutai to salvage the situation. Subutai had originally been assigned to conquer the Kipchak Turks in central Russia in 1229,<ref>Rashid al-Din, ''Annals of Ogedei Khan'', 33.</ref> but was hurriedly recalled to China in 1229\u20131230 after the Mongolian general Dolqolqu suffered a major defeat.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31.</ref> Against Subutai, the Jin generals retreated from Shaanxi and implemented a scorched earth policy to hold the fortified Tongguan Pass and block any access to the Jin stronghold of Henan. They calculated that the scorched earth policies would deny the Mongols the ability to sustain a lengthy siege, and their lines of fortifications and difficult terrain would prevent the Mongols from outmaneuvering them.\n\nSubutai initially attempted to outflank the Jin by feinting an attack at the fortified location of Weizhou and maneuvering through an unguarded side corridor. Though the Jin were fooled by the feint, they moved with great alacrity once Subutai's main advance was discovered, and the attempt to break into the plains of [[Henan]] ended in failure after Subutai's advanced raiding parties were checked at Shan-ch\u2019e-hui. The Mongols defeated a relieving force and captured Fengxiang, a secondary target, by concentrating 400 trebuchets at a corner of the wall. However, the overall campaign seemed to have reached a stalemate.<ref>Christopher P. Atwood, ''Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin'', 31\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 1231\u20131232 Subutai made another attempt to outmaneuver the Jin fortified lines by using a similar highly audacious approach that they had employed in Khwarezm (1219) and Xi Xia (1226). The Mongols divided into three armies, one to attack Henan from the North in the center of the Yellow River, another to attempt to cross the Yellow River in Shandong in the east, and the last, under Subutai and [[Tolui]], invading the [[Song Empire]] and attacking Henan from the more exposed south.<ref>Atwood, 34.</ref> The Song initially refused to allow the Mongols passage through the rugged Qinling mountains, so Subutai dodged their forces and isolated the mountain citadels one by one. Disheartened by the ease of the Mongol advance against their strong fortifications, the Song agreed to supply guides.<ref>Yuan Shi, 115.2885-6.</ref> This time Subutai was able to outmaneuver the Jin armies and cross the Han River to invade Henan from the south.\n\nThe main Jin army promptly marched to intercept Subutai's army at Mount Yu. Its commander, Wan Yen Heda attempted to ambush the Mongols, but the ambush was detected. In turn, the Mongols attempted to draw him into their own ambush with a feigned retreat, but he held his strong position. After a full day of fierce fighting that resulted in a stalemate, the Mongols retreated under darkness and attempted to hide their trail and outflank the Jin. Wan Yen Heda had retreated towards the city of Tengzhou in order to obtain supplies. Changing tracks, Subutai, identifying that the Jin were vulnerable to attrition, used a feint attack to temporarily divert the Jin forces away from their supply train, which he promptly seized with a hidden force.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Rather than continually attempting to attack the vigilant Jin during their retreat, Subutai instead dispersed his army into several detachments to target supplies in the area. 3,000 men masked the Mongol dispersion and occupied the Jin's attention, while other Mongol forces slowly slipped away from the field in small numbers to hide their movements towards the Jin capital of Kaifeng, the route that Wan Yen Heda was retreating along.<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube'etei Ba'atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nWith part of his force harassing the Jin army's foragers, the other units marched around the flanks in a wide arc and emerged ahead of the Jin army, aiming to destroy or steal the supplies of nearby villages along the Jin's line of retreat. Ogedei Khan had been able to cross the Yellow River after the Jin army blocking him had to march south to help Wan Yan Heda. With Subutai's army having maneuvered along the Jin rear, Ogedei was able to send reinforcements to Subutai, bringing the total Mongol strength to 50,000 men. After these reinforcements arrived and with the Jin army's food supplies severely depleted over the past three weeks, Subutai forced a battle on his terms and won a decisive victory at the [[battle of Sanfeng Mountain]] (9 February 1232), capturing Wan Yen Heda and annihilating the main Jin army which had nowhere safe to retreat to. He then made forced marches and eliminated the other Jin armies holding the other fronts at the battles of Yangyi (24 February 1232), and T\u2019iehling (1 March 1232).<ref>Carl Svedrup, \"Sube`etei Ba`atur\", ''Anonymous Strategist'', 41\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe heavily fortified city of Kaifeng required an eight month long siege. Subutai was forced to construct lines of [[Wikt:circumvallate#Verb|circumvallation]] that had a perimeter stretching {{convert|54|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the Jin began to employ a cutting edge gunpowder weapon called \"Thunder Crash Bombs\", which made it very difficult for the Mongols to get close enough for more concentrated fire. After cutting off Kaifeng from any outside help, Subutai alternated intense bombardments using a mixture of Muslim trebuchets, [[mangonel]]<nowiki/>s, and captured gunpowder with periods of rest and plundering the countryside. The Mongol dispersion helped them avoid contagion by the plague that devastated Kaifeng, and after being stretched to the limit, the Emperor fled and the city surrendered. Subutai originally wanted to execute everyone in Kaifeng to punish them for their [[Wikt:intransigence|intransigence]] and extremely long resistance. However, \u00d6gedei intervened and ordered Subutai to treat them fairly. <ref>McLynn, 407\u2013410.</ref>  With assistance from the Song Dynasty, the last Jin stronghold of Caizhou fell in 1234.\n\nHowever, it did not take the Song long to fall out with the Mongols. Two Song armies seized [[Kaifeng]] and [[Luoyang]] during the summer of 1234 during Subutai's absence. Subutai returned, destroyed the three Song armies by isolating and defeating them , and retook the cities. He then made a preemptive raid into Song territory to force them to adopt a defensive position.<ref>Yuan Shi, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2977.</ref> Though war had begun between the Mongols and Song, Subutai was recalled to the west. Still, Subutai's victories had taught the Song a lesson they would heed: no Song army would dare venture north to attack Mongol territory afterward.\n\n==Conquest of Russia (1236\u20131240)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'}}\n\u00d6gedei decided to send a major part of the army into the western regions to finally crush the [[Kipchaks|Wild Kipchaks]] and [[Bulgars]]. Subutai was tasked to direct the operations (under the overall command of prince [[Batu Khan|Batu]]). This mission was more than just a typical invasion: \u00d6gedei sent many of the next generation of Mongol princes, including the heirs of each of the four families, most likely to be trained by Subutai before he died.<ref>McLynn, 435.</ref> In order to crush the Volga Bulgars, who had previously defeated Batu in 1232, Subutai launched another giant encirclement campaign. The Mongols marched up the Volga river in a wide arc on the west side. However, this force was just to occupy their attention, for he sent a secondary army to surprise the Bulgars from the east by crossing the Ural mountains.<ref>Svedrup, 43\u201344.</ref> After squashing the Bulgar armies, he defeated the guerrilla leader [[Bachman Khan|Bachman]] on the north side of the Caspian Sea. Bachman had [[Wikt:ensconce|ensconced]] himself on an island, and taunted the Mongols. However, they constructed a mini-navy of 200 boats, trapped Bachman within a limited area, and gradually closed the 'net'.<ref>McLynn, 436\u2013437.</ref>\n\nUnlike in 1222\u201323 when the majority of the Rus' states allied against Subutai and Jebe, this time the Mongols apparently struck with such speed that the Russians were either too paralyzed, or possibly too bitter or distracted to ally. In late 1237, Subutai attacked [[Ryazan]] and [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], operating with three columns (attacking as the Mongols usually did during the winter, when the rivers froze over). The [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] forces were defeated in 3 separate engagements and their cities were taken in quick succession. The Mongols spent the summer of 1238 resting along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]]. Columns were sent out to subjugate the various tribes living in the plains around the [[Black Sea]]. In 1239, the Rus' state of [[Chernigov]] was defeated and their cities were taken. The Mongols were spared the need to conquer [[Novgorod]] when the principality surrendered, agreed to pay tribute in the future, and gave the Mongols a large bribe.<ref>Frank McLynn, 434\u2013441.</ref>\n\nThe most notable encounter of the campaign was the [[battle of the Sit River]] in 1238. The Grand Duke Yuri of Vladimir, the most prominent of the Rus leaders, had left Vladimir to raise an army and defeat the Mongols before they reached his city. However, the Mongols evaded his army and captured Vladimir before he even knew what had happened. When Yuri sent out a strong reconnaissance force to penetrate the Mongol scouting screen, his lieutenant told him in horror that his army was already entirely surrounded. Not surprisingly, Yuri and his army were easily defeated.<ref>''The Chronicle of Novgorod'' (1914), 83.</ref> The Mongols had made a treaty with Galich-Vladimir, whose prince was therefore taken by surprise when the Mongols suddenly attacked in December 1240. [[Kiev]], [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], and other cities were quickly taken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Invasion of Central Europe (1241\u20131242)==\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of Europe}}\nThe attack on Europe was planned and carried out by Subutai, who achieved his lasting fame with his victories there. Having devastated the various Russian principalities, he sent spies as far as Poland, Hungary, and Austria in preparation for an attack into the heartland of Europe. Having a clear picture of the European kingdoms, he brilliantly prepared an attack nominally commanded by Batu Khan and two other princes of the blood. While Batu Khan, son of [[Jochi]], was the overall leader, Subutai was the actual commander in the field, and as such was present in both the northern and southern campaigns against [[Kievan Rus']]. He personally commanded the central column that moved against the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and likely gave detailed instructions to his subordinates.\n\nThough the Mongol methods of warfare were mostly a mystery in the west, the King of Hungary, [[Bela IV]], was well-informed of the Mongol invasion of Russia and prepared as well as the fractured relations of Europe would allow him to.<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat''.</ref> Though Bela was unable to obtain help from the Holy Roman Empire or the Pope, he did at least have the support of his cousins in Poland. Once again, Subutai invaded during winter, when they would be least expected. The Mongol invasion of Europe was a five-pronged attack. Kaidu and Orda Khan ravaged Northern Poland, Baidar Southern Poland, while Shiban attacked through the rugged terrain in northeastern Hungary, Subutai and Batu invaded central Hungary, and Guyuk marched south through Transylvania. The Mongols dispersed their forces in order to confuse the Europeans as to their ultimate objectives, and defeat the European armies piecemeal before they could mass into a central force. After a series of sweeping victories [[Baidar]] and [[Kadan]] regrouped their northern force and defeated the main Polish army at the [[Battle of Legnica]], right before it could merge with the Bohemian Army a days march away. While [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]]'s army triumphed in [[Transylvania]], a day after Legnica, Subutai was waiting for the Hungarian army on the Hungarian plain. Though the Hungarian King [[Bela IV]] had effectively blocked the Carpathian passes using felled trees, ditches, traps, and other natural obstacles, in addition to the general disrepair or simple nonexistence of roads in eastern Hungary, Subutai's force still managed an astonishing pace of {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} a day despite several feet of snow. The Mongols retained a pioneer corps capable of efficiently clearing pathways through the forest, and were unfazed by Bela's obstacles.<ref>McLynn, 465\u2013466.</ref>\n\nOnly one day after the smaller Mongol army in [[Poland]] had won the [[Battle of Legnica]], Subutai launched his attack, thus beginning the [[Battle of Mohi]] during the night of 10 April 1241. At Mohi, the Mongols fixated the Hungarian attention in the center by assaulting the lone bridge and attempting to ford to the north and around the bridge. The main body began to cross the Sajo by the bridge at Mohi, and continued to attack the following day. This was met with fierce resistance, so [[catapult]]s were used to clear the opposite bank of crossbowmen, as was noted earlier. Meanwhile, Subutai in secret created a pontoon bridge to the south, where the river was too deep to be forded, and crossed the river in secret with a large force. When the crossing was completed, the second contingent attacked from the south, and a third from the north. The threat of now reassembled Mongol force, enveloping the Hungarian army on the far side of the Sajo river, forced the Hungarians to retreat into their wagon laager camp, a traditional tool of fighting against nomadic armies. However, the Mongols surrounded the fortified Hungarian camp, and bombarded it with trebuchets, gunpowder weapons, and flaming arrows.<ref>Yuan Shih, ''Biography of Subedei'', 121.2978.</ref> Hungarian cavalry charges were lured further away from their camp and encircled.\n\nThe result was complete panic; and to ensure that the Hungarians did not fight to the last man, the [[Mongols]] left an obvious gap in their encirclement. This was one of Subutai's classic tricks, to create a tactical situation which appeared to be favourable to the enemy. Subutai did not want a battle where the massed crossbowmen, supported by mounted knights, stood firm and fought to the death against his army. He far preferred to let them flee and be slaughtered individually. The apparent gap in the Mongol lines was an invitation to retreat, which would leave the knights and crossbowmen spread out all over the countryside, easy pickings for the disciplined Mongols. As Subutai had planned, the Hungarians poured through this 'hole' in the Mongol lines, which led to a swampy area, poor footing for horses and hard going for infantry. When the Hungarian knights split up, the Mongol archers picked them off at will. It was later noted that corpses littered the countryside over the space of a two-day journey. Two archbishops and three bishops were killed at the Sajo, plus more than 10,000 fighting men.<ref>Denis Sinor, ''[http://deremilitari.org/2014/07/the-mongols-in-the-west/ The Mongols in the West]'' (1999).</ref> In one stroke, the bulk of Hungarian fighting men were totally destroyed, but Mongol casualties in the center had been higher than normal: in addition to anywhere from many hundreds to many thousands of regular soldiers, Batu lost 30 of his 4,000 strong [[Baghatur|ba'aaturs]] (heavily armored bodyguards) and one of his lieutenants (Bagatu/Bakatu), which caused tension later in the camp.<ref>Yuan Shi, 121, 1a\u20135a</ref>\n\n===Mongol subjugation of Hungary===\n{{Main|First Mongol invasion of Hungary}}\nThe after battle tensions reached its climax at a very argumentative feast. One unique feature of this campaign, due to the large number of princes, was that in addition to defeating the enemy, Subutai also had to spend substantial energy keeping the egos of the Mongol princes in check. During the battle, Subutai had to shame Batu into continuing the fight after the first failed attack on the bridge. Batu first blamed Subutai for taking too long to ford the river, but Subutai rebuffed him by saying that they knew fording the river would take time, and Batu had launched his attack preempetively. In the end Batu apologized to Subutai.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> This was not the first time that Subutai had to bail Batu out of a mistake: during the invasion of Russia, Batu had struggled for weeks to conquer the fortress of Torzhok, launching several failed assaults. Subutai had to divert his movements, take command, and conquered the fortress in three days with ease.<ref>YS, 121.2978.</ref> Either at this feast or another one shortly after, Batu got into a heated argument with the Mongol princes [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|Guyuk]] and [[B\u00fcri|Buri]].<ref>Hodong Kim, ''A Reappraisal of G\u00fcy\u00fcg Khan'', 319\u2013320.</ref> Guyuk and Buri, jealous of Batu, accused Batu of incompetence and riding Subutai's coattails. This resulted in Guyuk and Batu, and possibly some of their men being sent home to \u00d6gedei Khan for judgment, causing further rifts in the Mongol army.<ref>Urgunge Onon, ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', 270.</ref>\n\nDespite these obstacles, the Mongols still attempted to solidify their control over Hungary.  From Rogerius' writings it would seem that scattered resistance by the peasantry was attempted, but it never really got off the ground, perhaps in part due to the flat open plains of central Hungary allowing scant opportunity for ambush or withdrawal. After the defeat of the Hungarians at Mohi, Subutai used a stolen royal seal to issue bogus decrees across the country, leaving many unassuming inhabitants at his mercy. According to Rogerius, The Mongols would sack a town and pretend to depart, only to hide and return shortly thereafter to kill everyone who had been hiding under rubble or in the forests. he also claims that in other instances they enlisted willing Hungarians to organize their brethren to work at Mongol direction, or spread false word of a general amnesty being ordained.<ref>McLynn, 472\u2013479; Thomas of Spalato, ''Historia''; Rogerius of Apulia, ''Carmen Miserabile super Destructione Regni Hungariae per Tartaro''.</ref>\n\nIn order to keep the pressure on Bela, Subutai split his forces into several detachments. A light cavalry force under Kadan was sent to chase King Bela along the Adriatic Coast, while the main army with its siege engines under Subutai and Batu attempted to pacify Hungary proper. Other Mongol forces raided outside the borders of Hungary, even reaching Austria before being repulsed in a skirmish near Wiener Neustadt. The Mongols successfully besieged several cities, including the fortified city at [[Oradea]], the castle of [[Saint Martin|St. Martin]] of [[Pannonia]], and the capital [[Esztergom]], though the latter's stone citadel held out, though not all sieges proved successful. In the west, Kadan's army was unable to catch Bela, and lacking siege equipment, he could not forcibly capture the Adriatic cities. However, Bela, hiding on the island of [[Trogir]] in [[Croatia]], was also unable to effectively rally his people due to his flight, which meant that for the time being Hungary was at the total mercy of the main Mongol army.\n\nBy early 1242, Subutai was discussing plans to invade the [[Holy Roman Empire]], when news came of the death of [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] and a revolt by the Cumans in Russia.<ref>John of Plano Carpini, ''The Story of the Mongols whom we call the Tartars''.</ref> Carpini alleges that, over the objections of Subutai, the Mongol princes withdrew the army to Mongolia for the election of a new Great Khan. It should be noted however that this account of events is disputed, with Rashid al-Din specifically noting that Batu and Subutai only heard of the Khan's death after they had already begun the withdrawal. Furthermore, the campaign had become bogged down in a series of unprofitable sieges at Klist and other fortified strongholds. The Mongols always practiced a \"tsunami strategy\" of temporarily retreating from the furthest outlying provinces they had won to avoid overextension, only to return shortly after their closer conquests were properly solidified.<ref>Timothy May, ''The Mongol Art of War and the Tsunami Strategy''.</ref> However, the death of Ogedei and the turmoil immediately after it prevented the Mongols from returning to Europe for decades. Still, the devastation had been immense. Subutai had devastated the agriculture of any area that was resisting. Though some of the civilians had escaped capture or death by hiding in castles, forests, or marshes, they returned to their ruined fields only to starve. Some historians have claimed that a quarter to a half of Hungary's population may have died from the invasion.<ref>McLynn, 479; ''Carmen Miserabile''.</ref> A Bavarian monk tersely recorded in 1241 that \"In this year, after existing for 350 years, the kingdom of Hungary was annihilated by the Tatars.\"<ref>Paul Lendvai, ''The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat'', 49.</ref> Even in 1250, eight years after the Mongols had left, Hungarian King Bela wrote to [[Pope Innocent IV]] that Hungary could not withstand another invasion and would have to surrender to the Mongols if they returned.<ref>King Belas IV's letter to the Pope, 310.</ref>{{full citation needed|reason=What's the source for this letter?|date=May 2019}} It has been noted however that the level of within Hungary was quite unevenly distributed, with archaeological evidence of destruction heavily concentrated east of the Danube, in the Great Hungarian Plain. It has also been pointed out that, given that Bela IV was able to recover his territories from Frederick II Babenburg of Austria almost immediately after the Mongols left, the damage done to his military structure can hardly have been as severe as Rogerius and Thomas of Split claimed.<ref>Laszlovszky, J\u00f3zsef & Pow, Stephen & Romh\u00e1nyi, Beatrix & Ferenczi, Laszlo & Pinke, Zsolt.

Though Baldwin defeated a small skirmishing force, he was apparently lured into overconfidence and suffered a severe defeat.<ref>McLynn, 479.</ref>\n\n==Final years==\nAfter subduing a [[Cumans|Cuman]] revolt in what is now Russia, Subutai turned towards Mongolia. Subutai insisted that Batu attend the kurultai to elect the successor of Ogedei in Mongolian heartland. Batu declined to come and [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan|G\u00fcy\u00fck]] was elected after three years, with Subutai's support. G\u00fcy\u00fck had no love for Batu and wanted the best of the Mongol generals unavailable to Batu if the feud between them came to open war. The new Khagan placed Subutai in charge at the age of 71 of the campaign against the [[Song dynasty]] for 1246\u20131247. The Papal envoy [[Plano Carpini]] saw him when he was in [[Karakorum]], Mongolia. He said Subutai was well respected among the Mongols and called Knight/Valiant/Hero (translation of Baghatur). Subutai returned to Mongolia from the Song campaign in 1248 and spent the rest of his life at his home in the vicinity of the [[Tuul River]] (near modern [[Ulaanbaatar]]), dying there at the age of 72.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A folk legend claimed that Subutai wished to die by his son Uriyangkhadai by the banks of the [[Danube|Danube river]].<ref name=\"weatherford\">{{cite book |title=Genghis Khan and the Quest for God: How the World's Greatest Conqueror Gave Us Religious Freedom |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |publisher=Penguin |year=2017 |isbn=0735221170 |page=286}}</ref>\n\nSubutai's descendants such as [[Uriyangkhadai]] and [[Aju]] would serve the [[Great Khans]] for the next three decades as commanders. Uriyangkhadai would successfully conquer the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Dali|Dali]], invade [[Dai Viet]] and obtain their submission, and achieve great success invading the Song from the southwest in the 1258 invasion of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan]]. Aju fought with his father, and then later led the successful five-year Mongol siege of the pivotal dual fortress of Xiangyang-Fancheng in the [[battle of Xiangyang]], which opened up a gateway into the heart of the Song and enabled their total conquest six years later in 1279.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{quote|\"No Mongol general played a greater role than Subotei Ba'atur in establishing and maintaining the early Mongol Empire.

When he first entered the service of Temujin, the later Cinggis Qan, the realm of that minor Mongol chieftain comprised only a few families.

Even though Subutai had devastated the armies of Russia, Georgia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, and Latin Constantinople in a series of one-sided campaigns, Western military leaders, historians, and theorists completely ignored him until the 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 110.</ref> The Mongols did not operate as one distinct mass, but instead moved along 3\u20135 axes of approach, often 500\u20131000&nbsp;km apart, and threatened numerous objectives simultaneously. Like Napoleon, Subutai (and Genghis Khan) would disperse their forces along a wide frontage and rapidly coalesce at decisive points to defeat the enemy in detail.  Their methods were aligned to completely crush the enemy state's will to fight.<ref>Gabriel, 113.</ref> Subutai has been credited as the first general to operate campaigns using the modern organizational methods of command and control.<ref>LTC Sean Slappy, ''Command and Control Began with Subotai Bahadur'' (2010).</ref>\n\nThough unknown to the west for many centuries, Subutai's exploits were featured by the British military theorist B. H. Liddell Hart in his book ''Great Captains Unveiled'' after World War I. Liddell Hart used the example of the Mongols under Genghis and Subutai to demonstrate how a mechanized army could fight using the principles of mobility, dispersion and surprise.  In particular, [[Erwin Rommel]] and [[George S. Patton|George Patton]] were avid students of Mongol campaigns.<ref>James C. Bradford, ed., ''International Encyclopedia of Military History''.</ref>\n\n==='Deep Battle' theory===\n{{Main|Deep Battle}}\nRussia derived the most use out of a careful study of the Mongol campaigns. Their closer proximity to the steppe gave them greater interest and access to the Mongolian campaigns, first analyzed by the Russian General [[Mikhail Ivanin]] in the 19th century, which became a recommended text in the Russian military academies up until the mid 20th century.<ref>Gabriel, 111.</ref> Ivanin's work became used in the [[Deep Battle]] doctrine developed by Soviet Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], [[Mikhail Frunze]], and [[G.

Deep Battle doctrine bore a heavy resemblance to Mongol strategic methods, substituting tanks, motorized troop carriers, artillery, and airplanes for Mongol horse archers, lancers, and field artillery. The Red Army even went so far as to copy Subutai's use of smokescreens on the battlefield to cover troop movements.<ref>Gabriel, 112\u2013118.</ref> Later in the 20th century, American military theorist [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] and some of his followers used Genghis Khan and Subutai's campaigns as examples of maneuver warfare.<ref>LTC Joe E.

In 1997, he was named to the [[All-NBA Third Team]] and the [[NBA All-Defensive Second Team]]. He was selected to the [[2001 NBA All-Star Game]].

He then played for the [[Anadolu Efes S.K.|Efes Pilsen]] basketball club in Turkey and [[Marinos de Oriente]] in [[Venezuela]] and had brief NBA stints with the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]] and the [[Denver Nuggets]].\n\nIn the 1990\u20131991 season, Mason played 26 games for the CBA's Tulsa Fast Breakers, with whom he averaged 29.9 points and 14.8 rebounds per game in his only season in the league.<ref>1991\u201392 Official CBA Guide and Register, page 289</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/national/former-new-york-knick-tulsa-fast-breaker-anthony-mason-suffers/article_3d1db9e9-b145-5d59-8ecb-73b2d93a216f.html|title=Former New York Knick, Tulsa Fast Breaker Anthony Mason suffers heart attack|first=Staff and Wire|last=Reports|website=Tulsa World}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1991, Mason played as a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] for the Long Island Surf of the USBL.

Under coach [[Pat Riley]], Mason blossomed in [[New York Knicks|New York]], where he became part of a strong frontcourt alongside [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Charles Oakley]] and [[Charles D. Smith|Charles Smith]]. Mason played for the Knicks until 1996. In 1994, the Knicks reached the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] for the first time since 1973, but lost in seven games to the [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]-led [[Houston Rockets]]. \n\nMason won the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]] in 1995. He led the league in minutes played in [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/sports/basketball/anthony-mason-bruising-forward-who-personified-mid-90s-knicks-dies-at-48.html|title=Anthony Mason, Bruising Knicks Forward in the \u201890s, Dies at 48|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=February 28, 2015|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> with 3,457, setting a Knicks team record. In 1996, Mason and [[Brad Lohaus]] were traded to the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]].\n\n==== Charlotte Hornets ====\nIn the 1996-1997 season, Mason recorded career highs in minutes played (43.1), points (16.2), rebounds (11.4) and assists (5.7). He led the league in minutes. Following the season, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team and to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. Mason missed the entire 1998\u201399 season due to a ruptured bicep<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/preview99/cha.html|title=ESPN.com - NBA - Charlotte Hornets preview|website=assets.espn.go.com}}</ref>, then averaged 11.6 points and 8.5 rebounds in the 1999-2000 season.\n\n==== Miami Heat ====\nIn 2000, Mason was traded to the [[Miami Heat]] along with [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]], [[Ricky Davis]] and [[Dale Ellis]] for [[Jamal Mashburn]], [[P.J. Brown|P. J. Brown]], [[Tim James (basketball)|Tim James]], [[Rodney Buford]] and [[Otis Thorpe]] In Miami, although Mason had been brought over by Miami coach [[Pat Riley]] to be a role player on what was thought to have been a contender Heat team, the [[kidney]] ailment of [[Alonzo Mourning]] forced Mourning to sit out and made Mason a starter for the team. Mason would respond by finishing second on the team in scoring, with 16.1 points per game, and averaging 9.6 rebounds. With Mourning and [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]] selected but unable to play due to injury in the [[2001 NBA All-Star Game]], Mason was chosen to represent the Heat in his only selection to an All-Star team. Mason helped the Heat make the playoffs with a 50 win season for the injury-ravaged squad. Mason, however, virtually disappeared in the playoffs, taking only 13 shots and averaging a mere 5.3 points and 3 rebounds in three games. Mason was waived during the offseason.\n\n==== Milwaukee Bucks ====\nMason signed with the Milwaukee Bucks for the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]]. In Mason's first season with the Bucks, the team stumbled to a 41\u201341 record (11 games worse than the previous season) and missed the playoffs altogether. Mason's numbers went down as well: 9.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg. Nonetheless, Milwaukee stuck with Mason for another year, waiving him after the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]]. Mason retired from the NBA in 2003.\n\n==TV/film/music appearances==\nIn the TV series ''[[New York Undercover]]'', Mason appeared in two different episodes, playing himself in one.

In his 13-year career he played with the [[New Jersey Nets]], [[Denver Nuggets]], [[New York Knicks]], [[Charlotte Hornets]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]] and [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. He averaged 10.8 points and 8.3 rebounds in his 13-year NBA career. Mason earned the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]] in 1995 and led the NBA in minutes played in the following two seasons. In 1997, he was named to the [[All-NBA Third Team]] and the [[NBA All-Defensive Second Team]]. He was selected to the [[2001 NBA All-Star Game]]. Mason was a member of the 1993-1994 New York Knicks team that reached the NBA Finals.\n\nMason played collegiately for [[Tennessee State University]] and also played professionally in [[Turkey]], [[Venezuela]], the [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA) and the [[United States Basketball League]] (USBL).\n\n==Basketball career==\n\n=== Early years ===\nMason attended [[Tennessee State University]] and was drafted by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in the third round of the [[1988 NBA draft]] (53rd pick), but was cut shortly afterwards. He then played for the [[Anadolu Efes S.K.|Efes Pilsen]] basketball club in Turkey and [[Marinos de Oriente]] in [[Venezuela]] and had brief NBA stints with the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]] and the [[Denver Nuggets]].\n\nIn the 1990\u20131991 season, Mason played 26 games for the CBA's Tulsa Fast Breakers, with whom he averaged 29.9 points and 14.8 rebounds per game in his only season in the league.<ref>1991\u201392 Official CBA Guide and Register, page 289</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/national/former-new-york-knick-tulsa-fast-breaker-anthony-mason-suffers/article_3d1db9e9-b145-5d59-8ecb-73b2d93a216f.html|title=Former New York Knick, Tulsa Fast Breaker Anthony Mason suffers heart attack|first=Staff and Wire|last=Reports|website=Tulsa World}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1991, Mason played as a [[Power forward (basketball)|power forward]] for the Long Island Surf of the USBL.

Ed Krinsky, general manager of the Surf, said, \"I really believed he could play in the [[National Basketball Association|N.B.A.]] He was a huge guy with backcourt skills\". Later that year, Mason was already on the [[New York Knicks|New York Knicks']] summer league roster, with [[Pat Riley]] as coach.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/sports/basketball/edgy-knick-anthony-mason-was-true-to-the-city.html |title=Tough Knick Anthony Mason Was True to the City |work=New York Times |location=New York, NY |date=February 28, 2015 |author=Araton, Harvey}}</ref><ref name=\"new york mag\">{{cite news |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RkAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=1991+Long+Island+Surf+Basketball+Mason+PPG&source=bl&ots=dxbYXuWi7U&sig=XOsjilJWF6YovWDPrfoAGPxLnkM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi19d__yLjTAhVO02MKHf37DlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=1991%20Long%20Island%20Surf%20Basketball%20Mason%20PPG&f=false |title=The Knicks Go For the Grand Slam |work=New York Magazine |location=New York, NY |date=May 31, 1993 |author=Smith, Chris}}</ref> In the year 2000, in celebration of the USBL's 15th anniversary, USBL fans voted on the \"All-15 Team,\" a collection of the best USBL players from 1985 to 2000, many of whom went on to become renowned NBA stars, with Mason included among the 15.<ref name=\"all-15\">{{cite news |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |url=http://www.siliconinvestor.com/readmsgs.aspx?subjectid=30764&msgnum=5&batchsize=10&batchtype=Previous |title=In Celebration Of Its 15th Anniversary Season, USBL Fans Select The \"All-15 Team\" |work=Silicon Investor |location=San Francisco, CA |date=January 24, 2000 |author=Fisher, Sean}}</ref>\n\n=== NBA success ===\n====New York Knicks====\nMason signed with the [[New York Knicks]] in the summer of 1991. Under coach [[Pat Riley]], Mason blossomed in [[New York Knicks|New York]], where he became part of a strong frontcourt alongside [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Charles Oakley]] and [[Charles D. Smith|Charles Smith]]. Mason played for the Knicks until 1996. In 1994, the Knicks reached the [[1994 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] for the first time since 1973, but lost in seven games to the [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]-led [[Houston Rockets]]. \n\nMason won the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award]] in 1995. He led the league in minutes played in [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/sports/basketball/anthony-mason-bruising-forward-who-personified-mid-90s-knicks-dies-at-48.html|title=Anthony Mason, Bruising Knicks Forward in the \u201890s, Dies at 48|first=Bruce|last=Weber|date=February 28, 2015|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> with 3,457, setting a Knicks team record. In 1996, Mason and [[Brad Lohaus]] were traded to the [[Charlotte Hornets]] for [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]].\n\n==== Charlotte Hornets ====\nIn the 1996-1997 season, Mason recorded career highs in minutes played (43.1), points (16.2), rebounds (11.4) and assists (5.7). He led the league in minutes. Following the season, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team and to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team. Mason missed the entire 1998\u201399 season due to a ruptured bicep<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/preview99/cha.html|title=ESPN.com - NBA - Charlotte Hornets preview|website=assets.espn.go.com}}</ref>, then averaged 11.6 points and 8.5 rebounds in the 1999-2000 season.\n\n==== Miami Heat ====\nIn 2000, Mason was traded to the [[Miami Heat]] along with [[Eddie Jones (basketball)|Eddie Jones]], [[Ricky Davis]] and [[Dale Ellis]] for [[Jamal Mashburn]], [[P.J. Brown|P. J. Brown]], [[Tim James (basketball)|Tim James]], [[Rodney Buford]] and [[Otis Thorpe]] In Miami, although Mason had been brought over by Miami coach [[Pat Riley]] to be a role player on what was thought to have been a contender Heat team, the [[kidney]] ailment of [[Alonzo Mourning]] forced Mourning to sit out and made Mason a starter for the team. Mason would respond by finishing second on the team in scoring, with 16.1 points per game, and averaging 9.6 rebounds. With Mourning and [[Grant Hill (basketball)|Grant Hill]] selected but unable to play due to injury in the [[2001 NBA All-Star Game]], Mason was chosen to represent the Heat in his only selection to an All-Star team. Mason helped the Heat make the playoffs with a 50 win season for the injury-ravaged squad. Mason, however, virtually disappeared in the playoffs, taking only 13 shots and averaging a mere 5.3 points and 3 rebounds in three games. Mason was waived during the offseason.\n\n==== Milwaukee Bucks ====\nMason signed with the Milwaukee Bucks for the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]]. In Mason's first season with the Bucks, the team stumbled to a 41\u201341 record (11 games worse than the previous season) and missed the playoffs altogether. Mason's numbers went down as well: 9.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg. Nonetheless, Milwaukee stuck with Mason for another year, waiving him after the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]]. Mason retired from the NBA in 2003.\n\n==TV/film/music appearances==\nIn the TV series ''[[New York Undercover]]'', Mason appeared in two different episodes, playing himself in one. He also plays a pickup player in the 1996 film ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]'', and himself in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]''.\n\nIn addition, Mason appears in the [[Diamond D]] rap video \"Best Kept Secret\", dunking his way through the video on a New York City playground basketball court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postingandtoasting.com/2007/8/2/193035/2409|title=P&amp;T Top Ten: Number 9- Anthony Mason  \u2013 Posting and Toasting|work=Posting and Toasting|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Beastie Boys]] song \"B-Boys Makin' With The Freak Freak\" from 1994's \"[[Ill Communication]]\" LP mentions him with the lyric \"I got my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason\"\u2014the Beasties being NY Knicks fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelyricarchive.com/song/972505-129883/B-Boys-Makin'-With-the-Freak-Freak|title=Beastie Boys \u2013 B-Boys Makin' With the Freak Freak lyrics|work=thelyricarchive.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref>  The [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] song \"Story to Tell\" tells of the Rapper sleeping with the girlfriend of a New York Knick in the player's home.

{"title_page": "CPDRC Dancing Inmates", "text_new": "'''CPDRC Dancing Inmates''' or the '''CPDRC dancers''' is a collective of [[Prisoner|prison inmates]] in [[Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center]] (CPDRC), a maximum security prison in [[Cebu City|Cebu]], in [[Cebu|Cebu Province]], [[Philippines]] where the prisoners perform dance routines as part of their daily exercise and rehabilitation, and many of their performances are filmed and released online, making them a popular feature among fans and veritable [[Internet celebrity|online celebrities]].\n\nByron F. Garcia, the official security advisor to the Cebu government, is credited for starting a program of choreographed exercise routines for the inmates. He was appointed head of the prison by his sister [[Gwendolyn Garcia]], then governor of Cebu. In 2006, he began uploading videos of the dance performances; its best known video was the [[Thriller (viral video)|rendition]] of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Thriller (Michael Jackson song)|Thriller]]\" video, uploaded in 2007. Other music video performances covering popular songs were also uploaded, and public performances were held through 2010, including some outside the facility. The dance program was launched at other prison facilities, has been referenced by other television shows worldwide, and inspired the creation of several documentaries, musicals and drama films.\n\n== History ==\nByron Garcia had originally wanted to introduce a program at Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC) where inmates would exercise for an hour each day.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12643181 |title=Filipino Inmates' Video Is a 'Thriller' on the Web |publisher=NPR |agency=Associated Press |date=2007-08-09 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> He also claims in a British [[documentary]] that his inspiration came while watching the movie ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' in particular the scene where the sounds of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro|Figaro]]'' flood the prison yard.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Garcia initially introduced an exercise program where the prisoners marched in unison, starting out with marching to the beat of a drum, but moved on to [[Dance|dancing]] to [[pop music]]; he began with one of his favourite songs, [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Another Brick in the Wall]]\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He chose camp music such as \"[[In the Navy]]\" and \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\" by the [[Village People]], so macho prisoners would not be offended at being asked to dance.<ref name=\"bbc\"/>\n\nGarcia's first upload of prisoner choreography was the [[Algorithm March]], with 967 inmates,<ref>{{cite AV media |author=byronfgarcia |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjMd2Vabcv8 |title=Algorithm March with Prisoners |via=YouTube |date=2006-10-01 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}</ref> but only generated 400 views in its first eight months.<ref name=\"npr\"/> The next upload, ''Thriller'', however, enjoyed a massive response.\n\nThe prison now even has its own official [[choreographer]] teachers, like Vince Rosales and Gwen Laydor.

This is a pioneering initiative to institutionalize music therapy in other jails, similar to CPDRC's original program, with Cebu former inmates dancing making a tour of three prisons initially, Manila City Jail, Makati City Jail, and Quezon City Jail according to an agreement signed between Resendo M. Dial, chief of Philippines \"Bureau of Jail Management and Penology\" (BJMP) and Byron Garcia on March 26, 2010 as a collaborative effort to introduce music therapy in jail facilities nationwide.\n\nOn the occasion of the signing of the protocol, Garcia characterized general prison facilities as \"living hells\", because those who are in penology and rehabilitation \"are missing out the essence of compassion, redemption and restoration in jail management\". He added: \"They are too busy looking for creative ways to punish an offender instead of restoring him to become the human being that he is. We have to look at prisons beyond the cycle of crime and punishment and certainly look inside underlying social, cultural and scriptural implications of rehabilitation. As it is, those creative ways of punishing offenders that have led to restrictive and punitive conditions in jails have also bred demons out of prisoners\". Garcia said that this therapeutic protocol of dance and music is meant to restore dignity to people who suffer the stigma of incarceration and restore self-esteem to inmates because they are alienated from society. Therapeutic music and dance is meant to help prisoners cope with their depression and anxiety, improve their well-being as they go through a transition phase and reintegrate to society. Music is a protocol to heal them of emotional and psychological disorders and trauma as a result of the offense or incarceration\". He concluded that \"the experience of the CPDRC Dancing Inmates has proven a clinical breakthrough of using therapeutic music and dance in healing, restoring and rehabilitating inmates to become dignified human beings. This is actually what prompted BMJP to take interest in spreading such a program\", he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/byronfgarcia|title=byronfgarcia|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nA group of former dancing inmates will also tour the country's prisons for presentations in addition to a series of public performances to increase awareness to the program among the general population.\n\nThe offshoots of the program can be seen in The Quezon City Dancing Inmates and the Manila City Jail Dancing Inmates programs, greatly structured on the concepts applied in CPDRC.\n\n== Awards ==\nIn April 2011, during the 10th [[Tribeca Film Festival]], Byron Garcia was awarded Tribeca's \"[[Disruptive Innovator Award]] 2011\", the second annual award of the sort.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radiantview.com/blog/2011/05/02/byron-garcia-is-honored-at-the-2nd-annual-disruptive-innovation-award-at-the-tribeca-film-festival/ |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><!-- Lorna L.

Garcia, the official security advisor to the Cebu government, is credited for starting a program of choreographed exercise routines for the inmates.

Other music video performances covering popular songs were also uploaded, and public performances were held through 2010, including some outside the facility.

This is a pioneering initiative to institutionalize music therapy in other jails, similar to CPDRC's original program, with Cebu former inmates dancing making a tour of three prisons initially, Manila City Jail, Makati City Jail, and Quezon City Jail according to an agreement signed between Resendo M. Dial, chief of Philippines \"Bureau of Jail Management and Penology\" (BJMP) and Byron Garcia on March 26, 2010 as a collaborative effort to introduce music therapy in jail facilities nationwide.\n\nOn the occasion of the signing of the protocol, Garcia characterized general prison facilities as \"living hells\", because those who are in penology and rehabilitation \"are missing out the essence of compassion, redemption and restoration in jail management\". He added: \"They are too busy looking for creative ways to punish an offender instead of restoring him to become the human being that he is. We have to look at prisons beyond the cycle of crime and punishment and certainly look inside underlying social, cultural and scriptural implications of rehabilitation. As it is, those creative ways of punishing offenders that have led to restrictive and punitive conditions in jails have also bred demons out of prisoners\". Garcia said that this therapeutic protocol of dance and music is meant to restore dignity to people who suffer the stigma of incarceration and restore self-esteem to inmates because they are alienated from society. Therapeutic music and dance is meant to help prisoners cope with their depression and anxiety, improve their well-being as they go through a transition phase and reintegrate to society. Music is a protocol to heal them of emotional and psychological disorders and trauma as a result of the offense or incarceration\". He concluded that \"the experience of the CPDRC Dancing Inmates has proven a clinical breakthrough of using therapeutic music and dance in healing, restoring and rehabilitating inmates to become dignified human beings. This is actually what prompted BMJP to take interest in spreading such a program\", he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/byronfgarcia|title=byronfgarcia|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nA group of former dancing inmates will also tour the country's prisons for presentations in addition to a series of public performances to increase awareness to the program among the general population.\n\nThe offshoots of the program can be seen in The Quezon City Dancing Inmates and the Manila City Jail Dancing Inmates programs, greatly structured on the concepts applied in CPDRC.\n\n== Awards ==\nIn April 2011, during the 10th [[Tribeca Film Festival]], Byron Garcia was awarded Tribeca's \"[[Disruptive Innovator Award]] 2011\", the second annual award of the sort that had started in 2010 in the festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://radiantview.com/blog/2011/05/02/byron-garcia-is-honored-at-the-2nd-annual-disruptive-innovation-award-at-the-tribeca-film-festival/ |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><!-- Lorna L.

The '''history of geodesy''' began in pre-scientific antiquity and blossomed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\nEarly ideas about the figure of the Earth held the Earth to be flat (see [[flat Earth]]), and the heavens a physical dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical Earth were that lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a spherical Earth, and that [[Polaris]] is seen lower in the sky as one travels South.\n\n==Hellenic world==\nThe [[Ancient Greece|early Greeks]], in their speculation and theorizing, ranged from the flat disc advocated by [[Homer]] to the spherical body postulated by [[Pythagoras]]. Pythagoras's idea was supported later by [[Aristotle]].<ref>Aristotle [[On the Heavens]], Book II 298 B</ref>  Pythagoras was a mathematician and to him the most perfect figure was a [[sphere]].  He reasoned that the gods would create a perfect figure and therefore the Earth was created to be spherical in shape.  [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], an early Greek philosopher, believed strongly that the Earth was [[rectangular]] in shape.\n\nSince the spherical shape was the most widely supported during the Greek Era, efforts to determine its size followed. Aristotle reported that mathematicians had calculated the circumference of the Earth (which is slightly over 40,000&nbsp;km) to be 400,000 stadia (between 62,800 and 74,000&nbsp;km or 46,250 and 39,250&nbsp;mi) while [[Archimedes]] stated an upper bound of 3,000,000 stadia (483,000&nbsp;km or 300,000&nbsp;mi) using the Hellenic [[stadia (length)|stadion]] which scholars generally take to be 185 meters or {{frac|9}} of a [[geographical mile]].\n\n===Hellenistic world===\nIn Egypt, a Greek scholar and philosopher, [[Eratosthenes]] (276 BCE \u2013 195 BCE) measured [[Earth's circumference]] with great precision.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> He estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]], with an error on the real value between -2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres).<ref name=\"russo273277\" /> Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled ''On the measure of the Earth'', which has not been preserved.\n\n[[File:Eratostene--Calcolo Raggio Terrestre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Measure of Earth's circumference according to Cleomedes' simplyfied version, based on the wrong assumption that [[Syene]] is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the same meridian as [[Alexandria]]]]\n\nEratosthenes' method to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplified version described by [[Cleomedes]] to popularise the discovery.<ref>Cleomedes, ''Caelestia'', i.7.49-52.</ref> Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, [[Alexandria]] and [[Syene]], modern [[Assuan]]:\n# Cleomedes assumes that the distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]] (a figure that was checked yearly by professional [[bematist]]s, ''mensores regii'');<ref>Martianus Capella, ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'', VI.598.</ref> \n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene was precisely on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], saying that at [[Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer [[solstice]] the Sun was directly overhead;\n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene and Alexandria are on the same meridian.\n\nUnder the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a [[gnomon]]) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground; it is then possible to calculated the angle of the Sun's rays, which he claims to be about 7\u00b0, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, the Earth's circumference would be fifty times the distance between Alexandria and Syene, that is 250,000 stadia. Since 1 Egyptian stadium is equal to 157.5 metres, the result is 39,375&nbsp;km, which is 1.4% less than the real number, 39,941&nbsp;km.\n\nEratosthenes' method was actually more complicated, as stated by the same Cleomedes, whose purpose was to present a simplified version of the one described in Eratosthenes' book. The method was based on several [[surveying]] trips conducted by professional [[bematist]]s, whose job was to precisely measure the extent of the territory of Egypt for agricultural and taxation-related purposes.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> Furthermore, the fact that Eratosthenes' measure corresponds precisely to 252,000 stadia might be intentional, since it is a number that can be divided by all natural numbers from 1 to 10: some historians believe that Eratosthenes changed from the 250,000 value written by Cleomedes to this new value to simply calculations;<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dennis |last=Rawlins |title=The Erathostenes-Strabo Nile Map.

He noted that the star [[Canopus]] was hidden from view in most parts of Greece but that it just grazed the horizon at Rhodes. Posidonius is supposed to have measured the angular elevation of Canopus at Alexandria and determined that the angle was 1/48 of circle. He used a distance from Alexandria to Rhodes, 5000 stadia, and so he computed the Earth's circumference in stadia as 48 times 5000 = 240,000.<ref>Cleomedes 1.10</ref> Some scholars see these results as luckily semi-accurate due to cancellation of errors. But since the Canopus observations are both mistaken by over a degree, the \"experiment\" may be not much more than a recycling of Eratosthenes's numbers, while altering 1/50 to the correct 1/48 of a circle. Later, either he or a follower appears to have altered the base distance to agree with Eratosthenes's Alexandria-to-Rhodes figure of 3750 stadia since Posidonius' final circumference was 180,000 stadia, which equals 48\u00d73750 stadia.<ref>Strabo 2.2.2, 2.5.24; D.Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#gkpz Contributions]</ref> The 180,000 stadia circumference of Posidonius is suspiciously close to that which results from another method of measuring the earth, by timing ocean sunsets from different heights, a method which is inaccurate due to horizontal [[atmospheric refraction]].\n\nThe above mentioned larger and smaller sizes of the Earth were those used by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] at different times, 252,000 stadia in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and 180,000 stadia in his later ''[[Geographia]]''. His mid-career conversion resulted in the latter work's systematic exaggeration of degree longitudes in the Mediterranean by a factor close to the ratio of the two seriously differing sizes discussed here, which indicates that the conventional size of the earth was what changed, not the stadion.<ref>D.Rawlins (2007). \"[http://dioi.org/gad.htm#fftg Investigations of the ''Geographical Directory'' 1979\u20132007] \"; [http://dioi.org/vols/w61.pdf DIO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306232751/http://dioi.org/vols/w61.pdf |date=2008-03-06 }}, volume 6, number 1, page 11, note 47, 1996.</ref>\n\n== Ancient India ==\nThe Indian mathematician [[Aryabhata]] (AD 476\u2013550) was a pioneer of [[Indian astronomy|mathematical astronomy]].

Gitika, Ganitha (mathematics), Kalakriya (reckoning of time) and Gola ([[celestial sphere]]).

He gave the circumference of the earth as 4967 yojanas and its diameter as 1581+1/24 yojanas.

During that period the Flemish cartographer, [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]], made successive reductions in the size of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and all of Europe which had the effect of increasing the size of the earth.\n\n== Early modern period ==\nThe invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[theodolite]] and the development of [[logarithm table]]s allowed exact [[triangulation]] and [[grade measurement]].\n\n===Europe===\n\nIn the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian era]], scholars discussed Macrobius's view of the ''[[antipodes]]''.

He measured a [[Baseline (surveying)|baseline]] using wooden rods, a telescope (for his [[Angle#Angles in geography and astronomy|angular measurements]]), and [[logarithms]] (for computation). [[Jacques Cassini]] later continued Picard's arc ([[Paris meridian]] arc) northward to [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] and southward to the [[France\u2013Spain border|Spanish border]]. Cassini divided the measured arc into two parts, one northward from [[Paris]], another southward. When he computed the length of a degree from both chains, he found that the length of one degree of [[latitude]] in the northern part of the chain was shorter than that in the southern part (see illustration).\n\n[[Image:CASSINIS' ELLIPSOID; HUYGEN'S THEORETICAL ELLIPSOID.GIF|thumb|right|Cassini's ellipsoid; Huygens' theoretical ellipsoid]]\n\nThis result, if correct, meant that the earth was not a sphere, but a [[spheroid|prolate spheroid]] (taller than wide).  However, this contradicted computations by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]. In 1659, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to derive the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]] in his work ''De vi centrifuga''. The formula played a central role in [[classical mechanics]] and became known as the second of [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Newton's [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of gravitation]] combined with the rotation of the Earth predicted the Earth to be an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]] (wider than tall), with a [[flattening]] of 1:230.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Full meridian of glory : perilous adventures in the competition to measure the Earth|last=Paul.|first=Murdin|date=2009|publisher=Copernicus Books/Springer|isbn=9780387755342|location=New York|pages=39\u201375|oclc=314175913}}</ref>\n\nThe issue could be settled by measuring, for a number of points on earth, the relationship between their distance (in north-south direction) and the angles between their [[zenith]]s. On an oblate Earth, the [[meridional]] [[Meridian arc|distance corresponding to one degree of latitude]] will grow toward the poles, as can be [[Meridian arc#Meridian distance on the ellipsoid|demonstrated mathematically]].\n\nThe [[French Academy of Sciences]] dispatched two expeditions. One expedition (1736\u201337) under [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] was sent to [[Me\u00e4nmaa#French Geodesic Mission|Torne Valley]] (near the Earth's northern pole). The [[French Geodesic Mission|second mission]] (1735\u201344) under [[Pierre Bouguer]] was sent to what is modern-day [[Ecuador]], near the equator. Their measurements demonstrated an oblate Earth, with a flattening of 1:210. This approximation to the true shape of the Earth became the new [[reference ellipsoid]].\n\nIn 1787 the first precise trigonometric survey to be undertaken within Britain was the [[Anglo-French Survey (1784\u20131790)|Anglo-French Survey]].

Some thought that the base of the metric system could be attacked by pointing out some errors that crept into the measurement of the two French scientists. M\u00e9chain had even noticed an inaccuracy he did not dare to admit. That is why from 1861 to 1866, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected. In 1866, at the conference of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] announced Spain's contribution to the measurement of the French meridian arc. In 1870, [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] was in charge of resuming the triangulation between Dunkirk and Barcelona. This new survey of the [[Paris meridian|Paris meridian arc]], named West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc by [[Alexander Ross Clarke]], was undertaken in France and in [[Algeria]] under the direction of [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] from 1870 to his death in 1888. Jean-Antonin-L\u00e9on Bassot completed the task in 1896. According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, the Earth equatorial radius was 6377935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15.\n\nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Sturves invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52\u00b0 and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements, it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the [[Ordnance Survey]] office in Southampton. Notably the standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the [[toise]], of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for [[Pierre Bouguer|Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|De La Condamine]] as their standard of reference in the [[French Geodesic Mission]], conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers [[Jorge Juan y Santacilia|Jorge Juan]] and [[Antonio de Ulloa]].\n\n[[Alexander Ross Clarke]] and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" and the General Conference of the association proposed the [[metre]] as a uniform length standard for the Arc Measurement and recommended the establishment of an [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]].\n\nThe [[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]] decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The [[Metre Convention]] was signed in 1875 in Paris and the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] was created under the supervision of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]]. The first president of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] was the Spanish geodesist [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]]. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] and [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" proposed to select the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Greenwich meridian]] as the prime meridian in the hope that [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] would accede to the [[Metre Convention]]. Moreover according to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc the meridian of Greenwich was nearer the mean than that of Paris.<ref>Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert {{Citation|title=Earth, Figure of the|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Earth,_Figure_of_the|encyclopedia=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|volume=8|access-date=2019-11-11}} p. 811</ref>\n\n=== Geodesy and mathematics ===\nMost of the relevant theories were derived by the German geodesist [[Friedrich Robert Helmert]] in his famous books ''Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorieen der h\u00f6heren Geod\u00e4sie'', Einleitung und 1.

The '''history of geodesy''' began in pre-scientific antiquity and blossomed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\nEarly ideas about the figure of the Earth held the Earth to be flat (see [[flat Earth]]), and the heavens a physical dome spanning over it. Two early arguments for a spherical Earth were that lunar eclipses were seen as circular shadows which could only be caused by a spherical Earth, and that [[Polaris]] is seen lower in the sky as one travels South.\n\n==Hellenic world==\nThe [[Ancient Greece|early Greeks]], in their speculation and theorizing, ranged from the flat disc advocated by [[Homer]] to the spherical body postulated by [[Pythagoras]]. Pythagoras's idea was supported later by [[Aristotle]].<ref>Aristotle [[On the Heavens]], Book II 298 B</ref>  Pythagoras was a mathematician and to him the most perfect figure was a [[sphere]].  He reasoned that the gods would create a perfect figure and therefore the Earth was created to be spherical in shape.  [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], an early Greek philosopher, believed strongly that the Earth was [[rectangular]] in shape.\n\nSince the spherical shape was the most widely supported during the Greek Era, efforts to determine its size followed. Aristotle reported that mathematicians had calculated the circumference of the Earth (which is slightly over 40,000&nbsp;km) to be 400,000 stadia (between 62,800 and 74,000&nbsp;km or 46,250 and 39,250&nbsp;mi) while [[Archimedes]] stated an upper bound of 3,000,000 stadia (483,000&nbsp;km or 300,000&nbsp;mi) using the Hellenic [[stadia (length)|stadion]] which scholars generally take to be 185 meters or {{frac|9}} of a [[geographical mile]].\n\n===Hellenistic world===\nIn Egypt, a Greek scholar and philosopher, [[Eratosthenes]] (276 BCE \u2013 195 BCE) measured [[Earth's circumference]] with great precision.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> He estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]], with an error on the real value between -2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres).<ref name=\"russo273277\" /> Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled ''On the measure of the Earth'', which has not been preserved.\n\n[[File:Eratostene--Calcolo Raggio Terrestre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Measure of Earth's circumference according to Cleomedes' simplyfied version, based on the wrong assumption that [[Syene]] is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the same meridian as [[Alexandria]]]]\n\nEratosthenes' method to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplyfied version described by [[Cleomedes]] to popularise the discovery.<ref>Cleomedes, ''Caelestia'', i.7.49-52.</ref> Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, [[Alexandria]] and [[Syene]], modern [[Assuan]]:\n# Cleomedes assumes that the distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]] (a figure that was checked yearly by professional [[bematist]]s, ''mensores regii'');<ref>Martianus Capella, ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'', VI.598.</ref> \n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene was precisely on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], saying that at [[Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer [[solstice]] the Sun was directly overhead;\n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene and Alexandria are on the same meridian.\n\nUnder the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a [[gnomon]]) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground; it is then possible to calculated the angle of the Sun's rays, which he claims to be about 7\u00b0, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle.

He noted that the star [[Canopus]] was hidden from view in most parts of Greece but that it just grazed the horizon at Rhodes. Posidonius is supposed to have measured the angular elevation of Canopus at Alexandria and determined that the angle was 1/48 of circle. He used a distance from Alexandria to Rhodes, 5000 stadia, and so he computed the Earth's circumference in stadia as 48 times 5000 = 240,000.<ref>Cleomedes 1.10</ref> Some scholars see these results as luckily semi-accurate due to cancellation of errors. But since the Canopus observations are both mistaken by over a degree, the \"experiment\" may be not much more than a recycling of Eratosthenes's numbers, while altering 1/50 to the correct 1/48 of a circle. Later, either he or a follower appears to have altered the base distance to agree with Eratosthenes's Alexandria-to-Rhodes figure of 3750 stadia since Posidonius' final circumference was 180,000 stadia, which equals 48\u00d73750 stadia.<ref>Strabo 2.2.2, 2.5.24; D.Rawlins, [http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#gkpz Contributions]</ref> The 180,000 stadia circumference of Posidonius is suspiciously close to that which results from another method of measuring the earth, by timing ocean sunsets from different heights, a method which is inaccurate due to horizontal [[atmospheric refraction]].\n\nThe above mentioned larger and smaller sizes of the Earth were those used by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] at different times, 252,000 stadia in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and 180,000 stadia in his later ''[[Geographia]]''.

During that period the Flemish cartographer, [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]], made successive reductions in the size of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and all of Europe which had the effect of increasing the size of the earth.\n\n== Early modern period ==\nThe invention of the [[telescope]] and the [[theodolite]] and the development of [[logarithm table]]s allowed exact [[triangulation]] and [[grade measurement]].\n\n===Europe===\n\nIn the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian era]], scholars discussed Macrobius's view of the ''[[antipodes]]''.

[[Jacques Cassini]] later continued Picard's arc ([[Paris meridian]] arc) northward to [[Dunkirk, France|Dunkirk]] and southward to the [[France\u2013Spain border|Spanish border]]. Cassini divided the measured arc into two parts, one northward from [[Paris]], another southward.

However, this contradicted computations by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Christiaan Huygens]]. In 1659, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first to derive the now standard formula for the [[centripetal force]] in his work ''De vi centrifuga''. The formula played a central role in [[classical mechanics]] and became known as the second of [[Newton's laws of motion]].

In 1821 they published their work as a fourth volume following the three volumes of \"''Bases du syst\u00e8me m\u00e9trique d\u00e9cimal ou mesure de l'arc m\u00e9ridien compris entre les parall\u00e8les de Dunkerque et Barcelone''\" (Basis for the decimal [[metric system]] or measurement of the meridian arc comprised between [[Dunkirk]] and [[Barcelona]]) by [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] and [[Pierre M\u00e9chain|M\u00e9chain]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/pageview/3795517|title=ETH-Bibliothek / Base du syst\u00e8me m\u00e9trique... [7]|website=www.e-rara.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Louis Puissant]] declared in 1836 in front of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] that Delambre and M\u00e9chain had made an error in the measurement of the French meridian arc. Some thought that the base of the metric system could be attacked by pointing out some errors that crept into the measurement of the two French scientists. M\u00e9chain had even noticed an inaccuracy he did not dare to admit. That is why from 1861 to 1866, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected. In 1866, at the conference of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] announced Spain's contribution to the measurement of the French meridian arc. In 1870, [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] was in charge of resuming the triangulation between Dunkirk and Barcelona. This new survey of the [[Paris meridian|Paris meridian arc]], named West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc by [[Alexander Ross Clarke]], was undertaken in France and in [[Algeria]] under the direction of [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] from 1870 to his death in 1888. Jean-Antonin-L\u00e9on Bassot completed the task in 1896. According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, the Earth equatorial radius was 6377935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15.\n\nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Sturves invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52\u00b0 and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements, it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the [[Ordnance Survey]] office in Southampton. Notably the standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the [[toise]], of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for [[Pierre Bouguer|Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine|De La Condamine]] as their standard of reference in the [[French Geodesic Mission]], conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers [[Jorge Juan y Santacilia|Jorge Juan]] and [[Antonio de Ulloa]].\n\n[[Alexander Ross Clarke]] and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" and the General Conference of the association proposed the [[metre]] as a uniform length standard for the Arc Measurement and recommended the establishment of an [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]].\n\nThe [[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]] decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The [[Metre Convention]] was signed in 1875 in Paris and the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] was created under the supervision of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]]. The first president of the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] was the Spanish geodesist [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]]. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] and [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the \"[[International Association of Geodesy|Europ\u00e4ische Gradmessung]]\" proposed to select the [[Prime meridian (Greenwich)|Greenwich meridian]] as the prime meridian in the hope that [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] would accede to the [[Metre Convention]]. Moreover according to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the West Europe-Africa Meridian-arc the meridian of Greenwich was nearer the mean than that of Paris.<ref>Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert {{Citation|title=Earth, Figure of the|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Earth,_Figure_of_the|encyclopedia=1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|volume=8|access-date=2019-11-11}} p. 811</ref>\n\n=== Geodesy and mathematics ===\nMost of the relevant theories were derived by the German geodesist [[Friedrich Robert Helmert]] in his famous books ''Die mathematischen und physikalischen Theorieen der h\u00f6heren Geod\u00e4sie'', Einleitung und 1.

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.<ref name=\"Plan\"/>\n\n[[File:BlockOs-68-Gl 3.JPG|thumb|right|Large-scale industrialization caused many laborers to move from rural to urban areas, which required the construction of numerous pre-fabricated apartment buildings such as this one in Sofia]]\n\nBy the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture.<ref name=\"Experimentation\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The Era of Experimentation and Reform], Library of Congress</ref> Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the \"thaw\" years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures. Party meetings and the press criticized monopolistic abuses resulting from irrational decisions at the top and poor implementation of rational policies at the enterprise level.<ref name=\"Units\"/>\n\nAfter a relative stagnation in the 1970s, the New Economic Model (NEM), instituted in 1981 as the latest economic reform program, seemingly improved the supply of consumer goods and generally upgraded the economy.<ref name=\"1980s\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) Bulgaria in the 1980s], Library of Congress</ref> In an effort to remedy the [[shortage economy|chronic distribution problems]] of the central economy, higher economic institutions became financially accountable for damage inflicted by their decisions on subordinate levels.<ref name=\"NEM\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0116) The New Economic Model], Library of Congress</ref> Complexes or associations were given explicit freedom to sign their own contracts with suppliers and customers at home and abroad.<ref name=\"NEM\"/> However, NEM was unable to drastically improve the quality or quantity of Bulgarian goods and produce. In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticized all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria's hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986-88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.<ref name=\"Last round\"/>\n\n=== Social ===\n[[File:Gini since WWII.svg|right|thumb|230px|Zhivkov's social policies resulted in Bulgaria having [[Gini coefficient]] of 18 in the 1970s, ranking among the countries with the lowest levels of [[income inequality]] in the world]]\n\nEven before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education. The system united previously separate specialized middle schools in a single, twelve-grade program heavily emphasizing technical subjects. In 1981 a national program introduced [[computer]]s to most of the ESPUs.<ref name=\"Education\"/>\n\n=== Foreign ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0615-0001-141, Berlin, VIII.

Zhivkov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in 1977.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2164 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia</ref> Yet, though Bulgarian ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' dissident [[Georgi Markov]] wrote that \"[Zhivkov] served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet leaders themselves did,\" in many ways he can be said to have exploited the USSR for political purposes, with Bulgaria serving a buffer between the USSR and NATO. Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States. In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 314.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ([[North Vietnam]]), [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Afghanistan, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s. Even back in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s.<ref name=\"Affairs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0066) Foreign Affairs in the 1960s-70s], Library of Congress</ref> Emulating Soviet d\u00e9tente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria's position. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> A 1988 application for membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.<ref name=\"Western Europe\"/>\n\nBulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Greece\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0190) Greece]</ref> In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit [[NATO]]'s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in [[Cyprus]]. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.

On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as \"gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics\".<ref name=expel/> Mladenov contended that Zhivkov's stewardship had left the country in \"a near heart-attack condition\".<ref name=expel/> The party also began an investigation into Zhivkov's high living.\n\nAfter being placed under house arrest on 18 January 1990, on 25 February 1991, Zhivkov was brought to stand trial on charges of [[embezzling]] the equivalent of $24 million (in 1990 dollars) in government funds. There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home.

Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. It is however widely regarded that incompetent administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n;Bulgaria\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of Socialist Labour|Hero of Socialist Labour (Bulgaria)]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius|Order of Cyril and Methodius]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: [[Gold Star]] [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (No. 11281) (31 May 1977 -

The following year he obtained a post at the ''Darzhavna pechatnitsa'', the official government publisher in [[Sofia]]. In 1932, he joined the BWP proper, later serving as secretary of its Second Borough Committee and as a member of its Sofia County Committee. Although the BWP was banned along with all other political parties after the uprising of [[1934 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|19 May 1934]], it continued fielding a handful of non-party National Assembly Deputies and Zhivkov retained his posts at its Sofia structure.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zhivkov participated in Bulgaria's resistance movement against the country's alignment with [[Nazi Germany]] and was sympathetic to the country's 50,000 Jews.<ref>Bar-Zohar, Michael, ''Beyond Hitler's Grasp: The Heroic Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews''. Adams Media Corp. 1998, p.199</ref> In 1943, he was involved in organising the [[Chavdar (resistance brigade)|Chavdar]] partisan detachment in and around his place of birth, becoming deputy commander of the Sofia operations area in the summer of 1944. Under his rule, many fellow former combatants with Chavdar were to rise to positions of prominence in Bulgarian affairs. He is said to have coordinated partisan movements with those of pro-Soviet army units during the [[1944 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|9 September 1944 uprising]].\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov.jpg|thumb|Todor Zhivkov and Georgi Dimitrov in a Fatherland Front congress in 1946.]]\nAfter 9 September 1944, Zhivkov became head of the [[Sofia]] police force, restyled as the ''Narodna Militsiya'' (People's Militia). He was elected to the BCP [[Central Committee]] as a candidate member in 1945 and a full member in 1948. In the run-up to the 1949 treason trial against [[Traicho Kostov]], Zhivkov criticised the Party and judicial authorities for what he claimed was their leniency with regard to Kostov. This placed him in the [[Stalinist]] [[hardline]] wing of the Party. In 1950, Zhivkov became a candidate member of the BCP [[Politburo]], then led by [[Vulko Chervenkov]], leading to a full membership in 1951. In the years which followed, he was involved in countering countryside resistance to forced [[collective farming|farm collectivisation]] in northwestern Bulgaria.\n\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death, an emphasis on shared leadership emerged. The hardline Stalinist Chervenkov gave up his post as General Secretary of the BCP in 1954. Zhivkov took his place, but Chervenkov retained most of his powers as [[prime minister]]. Bulgarian opinion at the time interpreted this as a self-preservation move by Chervenkov, since Zhivkov was a less well known figure in the party. After [[Nikita Khrushchev]] delivered his famous secret speech against Stalin at the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] 20th Congress, a BCP Central Committee plenary meeting was convened in April 1956 to agree to adopt a new Krushchevite line. At that ''plenum'', Zhivkov criticized Chervenkov as a disciple of Stalin, had him demoted from prime minister to a cabinet post, and promoted former [[Committee for State Security (Bulgaria)|Committee for State Security]] (CSS) head [[Anton Yugov]] to the post of prime minister. It was at this point that he became the ''de facto'' leader of Bulgaria. Subsequently, Zhivkov was associated with the \"April Line,\" which had [[anti-Stalinist]] credentials. At the BCP 8th Congress in late 1962, Zhivkov accused Yugov of anti-Party activity, expelled him from the BCP and had him placed under [[house arrest]].\n\nWith the increasingly strengthening positions of Zhivkov as the country's and Communist party's leader, former [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] leaders and active military took a critical stance on the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] policies of the communist leadership. In the events described as the \"[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|April Conspiracy]]\" of 1965 or the \"Plot of Gorunia,\" general [[Ivan Todorov-Gorunia]], general [[Tzviatko Anev]] (''\u0426\u0432\u044f\u0442\u043a\u043e \u0410\u043d\u0435\u0432'') and [[Tzolo \u041arastev]] (''\u0426\u043e\u043b\u043e \u041a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0432'') organized a group of high-ranking military officers planning to overthrow the regime. Their plan was to establish a pro-Chinese leadership in the country. The coup was exposed and between 28 March and 12 April 1965 and most of the plotters were arrested.\n\nAs prime minister, Zhivkov then held both of Bulgaria's leading political and government posts; for nearly all of Bulgaria's existence as an independent nation, the prime minister has been reckoned as the country's leading political figure. Though the post of head of state was traditionally reserved for the leader of the surviving pro-Communist faction of the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]], the \"[[Zhivkov Constitution]]\" adopted by referendum in July 1971 promoted him to chairman of the new State Council. The post, equivalent to that of president, confirmed his position as the country's top leader. Zhivkov remained faithful to Moscow during his 35 years in power, but adopted a more liberal stance than his predecessor by allowing some market reforms (such as allowing surplus agricultural goods to be sold for profit) and ending persecution of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.\n\n== Policies ==\n=== Economic ===\nIn the mid-1950s, Soviet-style centralized planning produced economic indicators showing that Bulgarians were returning to their prewar lifestyle in some respects: real wages increased 75%, consumption of meat, fruit, and vegetables increased markedly, medical facilities and doctors became available to more of the population, and in 1957 collective farm workers benefited from the first agricultural pension and welfare system in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0062) Domestic Policy and Its Results], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1959 the Communist Party borrowed from the Chinese [[Great Leap Forward]] to symbolize a sudden burst of economic activity to be injected into the Third Five-Year Plan (1958\u20131962), whose original scope was quite conservative. According to the revised plan, industrial production would double and agricultural production would triple by 1962; a new agricultural collectivization and consolidation drive would achieve great economies of scale in that branch; investment in light industry would double, and foreign trade would expand.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Following the Chinese model, all of Bulgarian society was to be propagandized and mobilized to meet the planning goals.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Two purposes of the grandiose revised plan were to keep Bulgaria in step with the Soviet bloc, all of whose members were embarking on plans for accelerated growth, and to quell internal party conflicts. Amalgamation of collective farms cut their number by 70 percent, after which average farm acreage was second only to the Soviet Union among countries in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Plan\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The First Five-Year Plans], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov, whose \"theses\" had defined the goals of the plan, purged Politburo members and party rivals [[Boris Taskov]] (in 1959) and [[Anton Yugov]] (in 1962), citing their criticism of his policy as economically obstructionist. Already by 1960, however, Zhivkov had been forced to redefine the impossible goals of his theses.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Lack of skilled labor and materials made completion of projects at the prescribed pace impossible. Harvests were disastrously poor in the early 1960s; peasant unrest forced the government to raise food prices; and the urban dissatisfaction that resulted from higher prices compounded a crisis that broke in the summer of 1962. Blame fell on Zhivkov's experiments with decentralized planning, which was totally abandoned by 1963.<ref name=\"Domestic Policy\"/> Despite this, by 1960 the value produced by heavy industry matched that of light industry, and food processing for export grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Plan\"/> Throughout the second phase, budget expenditures consisted primarily of reinvestment in sectors given initial priority. The completion of collectivization in 1958 had shifted 678,000 peasants, about 20 percent of the active labor force, into industrial jobs.<ref name=\"Plan\"/>\n\n[[File:BlockOs-68-Gl 3.JPG|thumb|right|Large-scale industrialization caused many laborers to move from rural to urban areas, which required the construction of numerous pre-fabricated apartment buildings such as this one in Sofia]]\n\nBy the early 1960s, however, changes to the system were obviously needed to achieve sustained growth in all branches of production, including agriculture.<ref name=\"Experimentation\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) The Era of Experimentation and Reform], Library of Congress</ref> Specific incentives to reform were shortages of labor and energy and the growing importance of foreign trade in the \"thaw\" years of the mid-1960s. Consequently, in 1962 the Fourth Five-Year Plan began an era of economic reform that brought a series of new approaches to the old goal of [[intensive growth]].<ref name=\"Experimentation\"/> In industry the \"New System of Management\" was introduced in 1964 and lasted until 1968. This approach intended to streamline economic units and make enterprise managers more responsible for performance. In June 1964, about fifty industrial enterprises, mostly producers of [[textiles]] and other consumer goods, were placed under the new system. [[Wage]]s, bonuses, and investment funds were tied to enterprise profits, up to 70% of which could be retained.<ref name=\"Decentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0113) Industrial decentralization], Library of Congress</ref> Outside investment funds were to come primarily from [[bank credit]] rather than the [[state budget]]. In 1965 state subsidies still accounted for 63% of enterprise investment funds, however, while 30% came from retained enterprise earnings and only 7% from bank credits.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1970 budget subsidies accounted for only 27% of investment funds, while bank credits jumped to 39%, and retained enterprise earnings reached 34%.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> The pilot enterprises did very well, earning profits that were double the norm.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/> By 1967 two-thirds of industrial production came from firms under the new system, which by that time had embraced areas outside consumer production.<ref name=\"Decentralization\"/>\n\n[[File:Cocacola cyrilic.JPG|thumb|left|upright|130px|Zhivkov's reforms resulted in some expansion of trade with the West, as evidenced by licensed [[Coca-Cola]] production since the 1960s with a [[Cyrillic]] logo]]\n\nBefore the end of the 1960s, however, Bulgarian economic planning moved back toward the conventional CPE approach. Many Western analysts attributed the Bulgarian retreat from the reforms of the 1960s to tension caused by the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968. International events may well have played a role, but the timing of the retreat and the invasion suggest another component: dissatisfaction among the Party elite with the results and ideological implications of the reform.<ref name=\"Recentralization\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0114) Industrial Recentralization]</ref> For example, in July 1968, one month before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria's unorthodox, three-tiered pricing system was eliminated. The party leadership had never accepted the concept of free and flexible pricing for some products, which was an important Bulgarian departure from centralized planning in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> Resistance to reform was further encouraged by a series of cases in which major enterprise directors used newly decentralized financial resources to line their own pockets.<ref name=\"Recentralization\"/> However, some of the recentralization measures, such as the creation of an agricultural-industrial complex, also received domestic criticism.<ref name=\"Units\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0115) Larger Economic Units], Library of Congress</ref> Both Western and domestic customers remained dissatisfied with the quality of many Bulgarian manufactures. Party meetings and the press criticized monopolistic abuses resulting from irrational decisions at the top and poor implementation of rational policies at the enterprise level.<ref name=\"Units\"/>\n\nAfter a relative stagnation in the 1970s, the New Economic Model (NEM), instituted in 1981 as the latest economic reform program, seemingly improved the supply of consumer goods and generally upgraded the economy.<ref name=\"1980s\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0111) Bulgaria in the 1980s], Library of Congress</ref> In an effort to remedy the [[shortage economy|chronic distribution problems]] of the central economy, higher economic institutions became financially accountable for damage inflicted by their decisions on subordinate levels.<ref name=\"NEM\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0116) The New Economic Model], Library of Congress</ref> Complexes or associations were given explicit freedom to sign their own contracts with suppliers and customers at home and abroad.<ref name=\"NEM\"/> However, NEM was unable to drastically improve the quality or quantity of Bulgarian goods and produce. In 1983 Zhivkov harshly criticized all of Bulgarian industry and agriculture in a major speech, but the reforms generated by his speech did nothing to improve the situation.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> A large percentage of high-quality domestic goods were shipped abroad in the early 1980s to shrink Bulgaria's hard-currency debt, and the purchase of Western technology was sacrificed for the same reason, crippling technical advancement and disillusioning consumers. The NEM proved to be a failure, and GNP growth between 1981 and 1982 was only 2.9%.<ref name=\"Last round\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0117) Last Round of Zhivkov Reforms], Library of Congress</ref> By 1984 Bulgaria was suffering a serious energy shortage because its [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant|Soviet-made nuclear power plant]] was undependable and droughts reduced the productivity of hydroelectric plants.<ref name=\"1980s\"/> Bulgaria marked significant progress in scientific research by [[Bulgarian cosmonaut program|sending two men in space]] and supplying 70% of all electronics in the Eastern Bloc,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14354979.html |title=Milliarden Dollar Schulden in Moskau.

This led to a Bulgarian version of the Soviet [[perestroika]] program. After a round of failed experimental measures, in January 1989 the Party issued Decree Number 56. This decree established \"firms\" as the primary unit of economic management.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> In a fundamental departure from the socialist prohibition of private citizens hiring labor, as many as ten people could now be hired permanently, and an unlimited number could be hired on temporary contracts.<ref name=\"Last round\"/> This last round of reforms by the Zhivkov regime confused rather than improved economic performance. However, statistics on growth for 1986-88 still indicated a 5.5% annual rate, up from the 3.7% rate achieved during the previous five-year plan.<ref name=\"Last round\"/>\n\n=== Social ===\n[[File:Gini since WWII.svg|right|thumb|230px|Zhivkov's social policies resulted in Bulgaria having [[Gini coefficient]] of 18 in the 1970s, ranking among the countries with the lowest levels of [[income inequality]] in the world]]\n\nEven before Zhivkov, Bulgaria made significant progress in increasing life expectancy and decreasing infant mortality rates. Consistent social policies led to an increase in life expectancy to 68.1 years for men and 74.4 years for women.<ref name=\"Health\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0099) Health], Library of Congress</ref> In 1939 the mortality rate for children under one year had been 138.9 per 1,000; by 1986 it was 18.2 per 1,000, and in 1990 it was 14 per 1,000, the lowest rate in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Health\"/> The proportion of long-lived people in Bulgaria was quite large; a 1988 study cited a figure of 52 centenarians per 1 million inhabitants. One of the first mass HIV testing programs was initiated under Zhivkov, and as of October 1989, some 2.5 million people in Bulgaria, including about 66,000 foreigners, had been tested for HIV, and 81 Bulgarians were diagnosed as HIV positive.<ref name=\"Health\"/> Increases in real incomes in agriculture rose by 6.7 percent per year during the 1960s. During this same period, industrial wages increased by 4.9 percent annually.<ref name=\"Standards\"/> Availability of consumer durables significantly improved in the 1970s. According to official statistics, between 1965 and 1988 the number of televisions per 100 households increased from 8 to 100; radios increased from 59 to 95; refrigerators from 5 to 96; washing machines from 23 to 96; and automobiles from 2 to 40. Available automobiles were primarily Soviet Fiats, some of which were manufactured in Bulgaria.<ref name=\"Standards\"/>\n\nIn the postwar era, and especially under Zhivkov, housing in Bulgaria improved significantly as more and better-quality homes were built.<ref name=\"Housing\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0100) Housing], Library of Congress</ref> However, many of them were cramped - the average home in Bulgaria had three rooms and an area of {{convert|65|m2}}.<ref name=\"Housing\"/> Housing remained one of the most serious shortcomings in the Bulgarian standard of living throughout Zhivkov's rule. Residential construction targets in the Five-Year Plans were regularly underfulfilled. Consequently, families often waited several years for apartments; in Sofia, where overcrowding was at its worst, the wait was as long as ten years.<ref name=\"Standards\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0144) Standards of living], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nThe educational system, despite the addition of ideological subjects, remained relatively unchanged after the beginning of the Communist era. In 1979 Zhivkov introduced a sweeping educational reform, claiming that [[Marxism|Marxist]] teachings on educating youth were still not being applied completely.<ref name=\"Education\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0101) Education], Library of Congress</ref> Zhivkov therefore created Unified Secondary Polytechnical Schools (''Edinni sredni politekhnicheski uchilishta'', ESPU), in which all students would receive the same general education.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Bulgaria improved its diplomatic relations with nations outside the Soviet sphere.<ref name=\"Foreign Policy\"/> The 1970s was a period of closeness between [[Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's]] USSR and Zhivkov's Bulgaria. Zhivkov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] in 1977.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=2164 Biography] at the website on Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia</ref> Yet, though Bulgarian ''\u00e9migr\u00e9'' dissident [[Georgi Markov]] wrote that \"[Zhivkov] served the Soviet Union more ardently than the Soviet leaders themselves did,\" in many ways he can be said to have exploited the USSR for political purposes, with Bulgaria serving a buffer between the USSR and NATO. Thus, he claims in his memoirs that the USSR had become \"a raw material appendage to Bulgaria,\" something obliquely confirmed by Gorbachev when he wrote in his memoirs that \"Bulgaria was a country which had lived beyond its means for a long time.\" An example of how the \"raw material appendage\" was exploited was the trade in Soviet [[crude oil]]. This would be shipped to Bulgaria's modern [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in [[Burgas]] at subsidized prices, processed, and resold on world markets at a huge premium.\n\nIn 1963 and 1973, the Zhivkov regime made requests \u2014 it is unclear how far these were in earnest \u2014 that\nBulgaria be incorporated into the USSR, both times because the Bulgarian government, having engaged in\nbitter polemics with [[Yugoslavia]] over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], feared a Soviet\u2013Yugoslav reconciliation at its own expense. In 1963, following the decision of [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow]] to recognize the autonomy of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]], the Bulgarian leaders openly declared that there was no \"historic Macedonian nation.\" In the face of Moscow's post-1953 efforts to reach out to Belgrade and Athens, Zhivkov seems to have calculated that a policy of unswerving loyalty to the Kremlin would ensure that it remained more valuable for the USSR than non-aligned Yugoslavia or NATO-affiliated Greece.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Political and Economic Relations between Communist States. In: Stephen Anthony Smith (ed.), ''Oxford Handbook in the History of Communism'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 314.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Bulgaria gave official military support to many national liberation causes, most notably in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, ([[North Vietnam]]), [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]], Afghanistan, the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Middle East]]. In 1984 the 9,000 Bulgarian advisers stationed in Libya for military and nonmilitary aid put that country in first place among Bulgaria's [[Third World]] clients. Through its Kintex arms export enterprise, Bulgaria also engaged in covert military support activities, many of which were subsequently disclosed. In the 1970s, diplomatic crises with [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]] were triggered by Bulgarian involvement in coup plots.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/>\n\nUnder Zhivkov Bulgaria's policy toward [[Western Europe]] and the [[United States]] was determined largely by the position of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Western Europe\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0193) Western Europe and the US], Library of Congress</ref> Events such as the invasions of Czechoslovakia and [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] automatically distanced Bulgaria from the West; then, in the early 1980s Soviet efforts to split NATO by cultivating Western Europe brought Bulgaria closer to [[France]] and [[West Germany]] - a position that continued through the 1980s. Even back in the 1970s, Zhivkov actively pursued better relations with the West, overcoming conservative opposition and the tentative, tourism-based approach to the West taken as early as the 1960s.<ref name=\"Affairs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0066) Foreign Affairs in the 1960s-70s], Library of Congress</ref> Emulating Soviet d\u00e9tente policy of the 1970s, Bulgaria gained Western technology, expanded cultural contacts, and attracted Western investments with the most liberal foreign investment policy in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> As in 1956 and 1968, however, Soviet actions altered Bulgaria's position. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in late 1979, which Bulgaria supported vigorously, renewed tension between Bulgaria and the West. Alleged Bulgarian implication in the attempted assassination of Pope [[John Paul II]] in 1981 exacerbated the problem and kept relations cool through the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Affairs\"/> A 1988 application for membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] was refused because of the Turkish assimilation program, after widespread expectations of success.<ref name=\"Western Europe\"/>\n\nBulgarian relations with Greece, a traditional enemy, were stable throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in spite of major government changes in both countries. Zhivkov made this stability a model for the overall Balkan cooperation that was a centerpiece of his foreign policy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Greece\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0190) Greece]</ref> In 1986 the two countries signed a declaration of good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation that was based on mutual enmity toward Turkey and toward Yugoslav demands for recognition of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] minorities in Bulgaria and Greece. An important motivation for friendship with Greece was to exploit [[NATO]]'s Greek-Turkish split, which was based on the claims of the two countries in [[Cyprus]]. In early 1989, Bulgaria signed a ten-year bilateral economic agreement with Greece.<ref name=\"Greece\"/>\n\n=== Cultural ===\n\nUntil the late 1980s, Zhivkov successfully prevented unrest in the Bulgarian intellectual community.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0181) Zhivkov and the Intelligentsia], Library of Congress</ref> Membership in the writers' union brought enormous privilege and social stature, and that drew many dissident writers such as Georgi Dzhagarov and Lyubomir Levchev into the circle of the officially approved intelligentsia. On the other hand, entry required intellectual compromise, and refusal to compromise led to dismissal from the union and loss of all privileges. The punishment of dissident writers sometimes went far beyond loss of privileges. In 1978 \u00e9migr\u00e9 writer [[Georgi Markov]] was murdered in London for his anticommunist broadcasts for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and [[Blaga Dimitrova]] was harshly denounced for her critical portrayal of party officials in her 1982 novel ''Litse''.<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/>\n\nZhivkov also softened organized opposition by restoring symbols of the Bulgarian cultural past that had been cast aside in the postwar campaign to consolidate Soviet-style party control. Beginning in 1967, he appealed loudly to the people to remember \"our motherland Bulgaria\".<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> In the late 1970s, Zhivkov mended relations with the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=\"Inteligentsia\"/> Zhivkov's extensive campaign of cultural restoration provided at least some common ground between him and the Bulgarian intelligentsia. In 1980 Zhivkov had improved his domestic position by appointing his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] as chair of the commission on science, culture, and art.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+bg0068) The Political Atmosphere in the 1970s], Library of Congress</ref> In this powerful position, Zhivkova became extremely popular by promoting Bulgaria's separate national cultural heritage. She spent large sums of money in a highly visible campaign to support scholars, collect Bulgarian art, and sponsor cultural institutions. Among her policies was closer cultural contact with the West; her most visible project was the spectacular national celebration of [[1300th Anniversary of the Bulgarian State|Bulgaria's 1,300th anniversary]] in 1981. When Zhivkova died in 1981, relations with the West had already been chilled by the Afghanistan issue, but her brief administration of Bulgaria's official cultural life was a successful phase of her father's appeal to Bulgarian national tradition to bind the country together.<ref name=\"Athmosphere\"/>\n\nSports also prospered during Zhivkov's rule. From 1956 to 1988, Bulgaria won an unprecedented 153 Olympic medals and numerous European and world competitions in sports as diverse as [[volleyball]], [[rhythmic gymnastics]] and [[wrestling]].\n\n== Dissent and human rights violations ==\n\nDissent was punished under Zhivkov's rule. The CSS was a feared tool of control, and overt opposition largely stayed underground until the late 1980s. In 1978, the Bulgarian dissident [[Georgi Markov]] was assassinated in London by an agent who stabbed him with an umbrella tip which implanted a very small [[ricin]] ball. According to former [[KGB]] [[general]] [[Oleg Kalugin]], this was requested by Zhivkov and either performed by the [[KGB]] or it assisted the CSS; the actual assassin is reputed to have been [[Francesco Gullino]], working for the CSS. In Zhivkov's time, Bulgarians found it extremely difficult to travel abroad.\n\nZhivkov was particularly intolerant of dissent within the Party.  When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced his reform program, Zhivkov made a show of copying it, believing that Gorbachev wasn't really serious about ''[[glasnost]]'' or ''[[perestroika]].''<ref name=Revolution1989>{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/revolution1989fa00sebe}}</ref>  However, he showed his true colors when he expelled several members of a human-rights watch group from the Party. Soon afterward, when several intellectuals announced the formation of the \"Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost,\" he arrested the leaders and threw them out of the Party.<ref name=Thompson>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008|last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unreferenced section : == Nepotism and insistence on ''predanost'' ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nZhivkov married Mara Maleeva (1911\u20131971) in 1938. They had two children, both would be promoted in the BCP hierarchy, daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]] and son Vladimir Zhivkov. Lyudmila became a Politburo member and earned the ire of the BCP and Bulgaria's benefactors in [[Moscow]] with her unorthodox artistic ideas and practice of Eastern religions. She died abruptly at the age of 38 in 1981. Her health was severely compromised by stress, failed marriages, and unusual dietary/lifestyle practices, although rumours of assassination or suicide abounded. With Lyudmila's death, her friends and supporters were quickly removed from all positions of power. Son-in-law [[Ivan Slavkov]] was made chairman of Bulgaria's state television company and later became president of the [[Bulgarian Olympic Committee]].\n\nApart from promoting his family, Zhivkov instituted a complex system of privileges which extended to former Resistance figures, Party members and ''prominenti'' of the sciences, arts and manufacture. In the early 1960s, he was instrumental in constructing a large set of housing, financial, educational, electoral and other benefits to be granted to a large category of people called \"Active Fighters against Capitalism and Fascism\" who had ostensibly been members of the rather modest Bulgarian Wartime resistance and which was expanded to absurd proportions. Without necessarily receiving great remuneration (pay differentials under Zhivkov were within the 5:1 range, with the overwhelming majority of salaries being within the 3:1 range), Party members and CSS informers received very significant perquisites which involved access to accommodation, luxury imported goods, hard currency, the ability to travel abroad, superior medical and dental treatment and unhindered entry to higher education for their children. The scope of these privileges broadened as they rose in the Party hierarchy. Eminent artists, scientists and \"Heroes of Socialist Labour\" (mostly collective farmers and shop-floor workers) received similar privileges. Established in the early years of Zhivkov's terms in power, [[Corecom]] was a retail chain in which foreigners could shop with hard currency, but its main customers were privileged Bulgarians close to the Zhivkov regime.\n\nIn Zhivkov's Bulgaria, money had lost many of its traditional properties, being replaced by sets of complex personal and family material and career considerations which have been described as \"feudal\". This hampered the prosecution in post-Zhivkov fraud and corruption trials, since no venality could be proved against those charged: they had merely received goods in kind and services which moreover had been their \"legal due\".\n\nZhivkov reserved a special attention for his birthplace of [[Pravets]]. In the 1960s this small village was declared \"an Urban Community,\" becoming a town a decade later. In 1982 Bulgaria's first Apple clone personal computer was named the ''Pravets''. The grateful citizens of Pravets responded by erecting a heroic statue to Zhivkov which he duly had taken down, ostensibly to prevent a personal cult growing around him. It was re-erected after his death.\n\nThroughout his tenure of power, Zhivkov surrounded himself with those who exhibited ''predanost'' (loyalty, devotion, the desire to proffer all). In his reminiscences, Vladimir Kostov, a Bulgarian secret agent who defected to [[France]] in 1978, recalls how the powerful minister of internal affairs would suffer nervous episodes before meeting Zhivkov lest his ''predanost'' should fail to come across sufficiently expressively..-->\n\n== Image ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThroughout his tenure, Zhivkov's [[dialect]] and poor manners made him the butt of many acerbic jibes and jokes in Bulgaria's urbane circles. While the feared CSS secret police was commonly said to persecute those who told political jokes, Zhivkov himself was said to have found them amusing and \"collected\" an archive of them. His popular nickname was \"bai Tosho\" (approximately \"Ol' Uncle Tosho\") or occasionally (and later) \"Tato\" (a dialectal word for [[Father|\"Dad\" or \"Pop\"]]). Markov tells a story of how Zhivkov reproached a popular newspaper cartoonist for modifying his signature to resemble a pig's tail, yet did not persecute him. A handful of satirist dissidents such as [[Radoy Ralin]] enjoyed some prominence, although Ralin was not favored by the authorities due to his sharp satire.\n\nZhivkov survived the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Khrushchev's fall in October 1964, an attempted Stalinist-Maoist ''[[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt of 1965|coup d\u2019\u00e9tat]]'' in 1965, his daughter [[Lyudmila Zhivkova]]'s death in 1981, [[Death and funeral of Leonid Brezhnev|Brezhnev's death]] in 1982, and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s post-1985 reforms.\n\n== Fall ==\n\nIn December 1984, Todor Zhivkov began a campaign of forcible assimilation of Bulgaria's Turkish minority, most notably forcing all Turks to take Bulgarian names. By 1989, resistance to this policy led to riots, which resulted in multiple deaths. In May 1989, Zhivkov ordered an expulsion of Turks (and Muslims) to Turkey across the then [[Iron Curtain]] boundary between these two countries. This led to the largest [[ethnic cleansing]] in Europe during the [[Cold War]], in which over 360,000 Turks (and Muslims) were targeted within three months.<ref>See:'2. \u041e\u0431\u044f\u0432\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0434 360 000 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0445\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 1989 \u0433. \u0437\u0430 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435, \u0438\u0437\u0432\u044a\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c.'

Bulgaria was the target of near-unanimous condemnation from the international community; even the Soviets protested. Gorbachev already did not think much of Zhivkov; he had lumped Zhivkov in with a group of inflexible hardliners that included [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia's]] [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania's]] [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]].  However, after the Turkish episode, he was determined to see Zhivkov gone.  The Turkish affair also alarmed several high-ranking Bulgarian officials as well, including [[Prime Minister of Bulgaria|Prime Minister]] [[Georgi Atanasov (politician)|Georgi Atanasov]], Foreign Minister [[Petar Mladenov]] and Finance Minister [[Andrey Lukanov]].  They began plotting to remove him, but had to move discreetly given the ubiquity of the CSS.<ref name=Revolution1989/>\n\nIn October 1989, Mladenov organised a [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|CSCE]] environmental summit in Sofia.  He invited an independent group of Bulgarian environmental activists, Ecoglasnost, to participate.  Ten days into the conference, several Ecoglasnost activists and supporters were brutally beaten up by CSS and militia officers\u2014on orders from Zhivkov.  They then collared 36 other opposition activists, drove them to the countryside and forced them to walk back to Sofia.  Amid near-unanimous international condemnation, Mladenov, Lukanov and Atanasov decided that Zhivkov had to go.  In a critical step, they convinced Defence Minister [[Dobri Dzhurov]] to support them.<ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nThe plotters struck on 9 November, a day before a Politburo meeting.  Dzhurov met Zhivkov in private and told him that he needed to resign, and there was enough support on the Politburo to vote him out. Zhivkov was taken by surprise and tried to marshal support, to no avail. Just before the Politburo met on 10 November, Dzhurov gave Zhivkov an ultimatum\u2013unless Zhivkov resigned, the Politburo would not only vote him out, but have him executed. Seeing the writing on the wall after the motion calling for his removal passed, Zhivkov resigned, officially for reasons of age and health. Mladenov was elected his successor. On 17 November the National Assembly removed him from the post of Chairman of the State Council, replacing him with Mladenov.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/18/world/clamor-east-bulgarian-leader-hints-future-free-voting-other-changes.html|title=Bulgarian Leader Hints at Free Voting and Other Changes|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-11-18}}</ref><ref name=Revolution1989/><ref name=Thompson/>\n\nOn 11 December, only a month after Zhivkov's ouster, Mladenov called for the Communist Party to give up its guaranteed right to rule.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/12/world/upheaval-east-bulgaria-s-communist-chief-plans-relax-grip-hold-elections.html|title=Bulgaria's Communist Chief Plans To Relax Grip and Hold Elections|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-12}}</ref> The Central Committee fell into line two days later, calling for free elections in the spring and asking the National Assembly to delete the portions of the Constitution that enshrined the party's \"leading role\".<ref name=expel>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/14/world/upheaval-in-the-east-communists-in-bulgaria-expel-zhivkov.html|title=Communists in Bulgaria Expel Zhivkov|last=Haberman|first=Clyde|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1989-12-14}}</ref>  On 15 January, the National Assembly struck out the portions of the constitution giving the Communist Party a monopoly of power.

On 13 December, Zhivkov was expelled from the party for what Lukanov described as \"gross violations of laws and gross mistakes in politics\".<ref name=expel/> Mladenov contended that Zhivkov's stewardship had left the country in \"a near heart-attack condition\".<ref name=expel/> The party also began an investigation into Zhivkov's high living.\n\nAfter being placed under house arrest on 18 January 1990, on 25 February 1991, Zhivkov was brought to stand trial on charges of [[embezzling]] the equivalent of $24 million (in 1990 dollars) in government funds. There had been calls to try him for political crimes as well, but prosecutors balked, believing they did not have enough evidence to convict him. On 4 September 1992 after an 18-month trial, he was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to seven years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/05/world/ousted-bulgarian-gets-7-year-term-for-embezzlement.html|title=Ousted Bulgarian Gets 7-Year Term For Embezzlement|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992-09-05}}</ref> Due to old age and heart problems, he was allowed to serve his term under [[house arrest]] at his granddaughter's home.

Like the Soviet Bloc in the face of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (SEV, Comecon), the [[Warsaw Pact Organization]] and the USSR itself collapsed, by 1992 Bulgaria entered a period of transition from socialism to a free market economy and democracy. The country's political ideology and foreign policies of Zhivkov's era have thus been reversed.\n\nZhivkov's onslaught on Bulgaria's Muslims and Turks radicalized and united what had been scattered and quiescent minorities. Since 2001 (and also from 1991 to 1994) the DPS ([[Movement for Rights and Freedoms]]) party, composed almost entirely of Bulgarian Turks, has held the balance of power in Bulgarian politics. Thus, one of the major Zhivkov projects produced the very opposite effect of what had been intended.\n\nA most damaging process, which emerged during the early years of Zhivkov's rule, was the \"demographic problem\" which saw traditionally large Bulgarian village families emigrate to industrial cities where they tended to have one child or none at all. The reforms undertaken during Zhivkov's regime consisted mostly of fines for families without children and limiting abortion.\n\n===Economic===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nOn the other hand, after very significant reverses and difficulties in the 1940s and 1950s, the Bulgarian economy developed apace from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. Most of today's large industrial facilities such as the [[Kremikovtsi]] steelworks and the Chervena Mogila engineering works were built under Zhivkov. Bulgaria's nuclear power station, [[AEC Kozloduy]], was built in the 1970s, all six large reactors commissioned in under five years. This, and Bulgaria's many coal-fired and hydroelectric power stations, made the country a major electric power exporter. By the 1970s, the focus switched to high technologies such as electronics and even space exploration: on 10 April 1979 Bulgaria launched the first of two ''kosmonavti'' (cosmonauts), [[Georgi Ivanov (cosmonaut)|Georgi Ivanov]], aboard Soviet ''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]]'' spaceships and later launched its own space satellites. Having been among the first nations to market electronic calculators (the [[ELKA]] brand, since 1973) and digital watches ([[Elektronika]], since 1975), in 1982 the country launched its [[Pravetz series 8|Pravets]] personal computer (a near-\"[[Apple II]] clone\") for business and domestic use. In the mid-1960s an economic reform package was introduced, which allowed for farmers to freely sell their overplanned production. Shortly after that Bulgaria became the first and only Eastern Bloc country which locally produced [[Coca-Cola]]. Mass tourism developed under Zhivkov's direction from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nHowever, this Bulgarian economy was exceptionally susceptible to Soviet largesse and Soviet-bloc markets. After the Soviet crude oil price shock of 1979, it entered a very severe recession from which it hardly recovered in the 1980s. After the early-1990s loss of Soviet and Comecon markets, this economy (unused to competing in a free market environment) entered prolonged and significant contraction. Zhivkov-era industrial facilities were largely unattractive to investors, many being left to decay. Great numbers of specialist personnel retired and died without being replaced, or else emigrated or left their state jobs for more lucrative private employment. As agriculture declined, tourism has emerged as almost the sole Zhivkov-era industrial survivor. It is however widely regarded that incompetent administration after 1989 had a much greater effect on the decline of the economy, as even successful industries declined.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\n;Bulgaria\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of Socialist Labour|Hero of Socialist Labour (Bulgaria)]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: [[Hero of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n* {{Flagicon|People's Republic of Bulgaria|1971}} [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]: Grand Master of the [[Order of Saints Cyril and Methodius|Order of Cyril and Methodius]]\n\n;Foreign\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: [[Gold Star]] [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] (No. 11281) (31 May 1977 - for his contribution to the fight against fascism in the Second World War)\n* {{Flag|Soviet Union}}: Two [[Orders of Lenin]]\n* {{Flag|Portugal}}: Grand Collar of the [[Order of Infante Dom Henrique]] (21 August 1979)\n* {{Flag|Cuba}}: [[Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Todor Zhivkov}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Georgi Traikov]] (as chairman of the National Assembly Presidium)| title = [[List of Presidents of Bulgaria|Chairman of the State Council]]|years=7 July 1971 \u2013 17 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{Succession box|title=[[List of Prime Ministers of Bulgaria|Prime Minister of Bulgaria]] |before=[[Anton Yugov]]|after= [[Stanko Todorov]]|years=19 November 1962 \u2013 7 July 1971}}\n{{s-ppo}}\n{{Succession box| before = [[Vulko Chervenkov]]| title = [[Bulgarian Communist Party|General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party]]|years=4 March 1954 \u2013 10 November 1989| after = [[Petar Mladenov]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{BulgarianPresidents}}\n{{BulgarianPrimeMinisters}}\n{{Leaders of the Ruling Parties of the Eastern Bloc}}\n{{Fall of Communism}}\n{{Cold War}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zhivkov, Todor}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Pravets]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Communist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian Socialist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Bulgarian politicians]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian anti-fascists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian atheists]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian communists]]\n[[Category:Collaborators with the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Georgi Dimitrov]]\n[[Category:Heroes of the People's Republic of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin]]\n[[Category:Grand Collars of the Order of Prince Henry]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Jos\u00e9 Marti]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Sofia]]\n[[Category:Prime Ministers of Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian resistance members]]\n[[Category:Communist rulers]]\n[[Category:Burials at Central Sofia Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Former Bulgarian Orthodox Christians]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pneumonia]]\n[[Category:Foreign Heroes of the Soviet Union]]\n[[Category:Heads of regimes who were later imprisoned]]\n[[Category:Politicians convicted of embezzlement]]\n", "name_user": "Goodposts", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eImage and Approval ratings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todor_Zhivkov"}

It was created in 1953; its ancestor, the ''Luchtvaartafdeling'' (aviation department) of the Dutch Army was founded in 1913. The aerobatic display team of the Royal Netherlands Air Force is the [[Solo Display Team]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin in 1913===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Farman HF 20 at militare luchtvaart museum Soesterberg.jpg|thumb|Farman]]\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) is the second youngest operational part of the Dutch Armed Forces, which consists of four parts: Navy, Army, Air Force and Marechaussee.\n\nDutch air power started on 1 July 1913 with the founding of the Army Aviation Group (''Luchtvaartafdeeling'' or LVA) at Soesterberg airfield (''vliegbasis Soesterberg'') with four pilots. When founded, the Army Aviation Group operated one aircraft, the ''Brik'', which was supplemented with three French [[Farman HF.20]] aircraft a few months later.\n\nThese aircraft were soon outdated and the Dutch government ordered several fighter/reconnaissance [[Nieuport]] and [[Caudron]] aircraft to replace them.\n\n===World War I (1914\u20131918)===\nThe Netherlands maintained a neutral position during World War I and the Army Aviation Group did not take part in any action, instead developing the force's capabilities.\n\nPilot training was opened for ranks below officer, and technical, aerial photography, meteorological and navigation flights were established.\n\nNew airfields were established at Arnhem, [[Gilze-Rijen|Gilze-Rijen air base]], Venlo and Vlissingen.\n\nBecause of the war it was difficult to procure suitable aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1917 this changed and 1918 personnel numbered 650.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn5/sacre|title=bwn5|last=owner|first=No|date=2013-11-12|website=resources.huygens.knaw.nl|language=Dutch|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n===Between the wars===\nAfter the end of World War I the Dutch government cut the defence budget and the Army Aviation Group was almost dissolved. As political tensions in Europe increased during the late 1930s the government tried to rebuild the armed forces again in 1938 but there were many problems, not least the shortage of pilot instructors, navigators and pilots to fly the new multiple engine aircraft. Lack of standardisation and resulting maintenance issues added to the complexity of the rebuilding task.\n\n===World War II and late 1940s===\n[[File:Fokker g1.gif|thumb|[[Fokker G.I]] ''Jachtkruiser'']]\n\nAs war loomed, in July 1939 the Army Aviation Group was renamed the Army Aviation Brigade (''Luchtvaartbrigade'').\n\nIn August 1939, the Netherlands government mobilised its armed forces, but due to limited budgets the Army Aviation Brigade operated only 176 combat aircraft of the following types:\n\n* 16 [[Fokker T.V]] type bombers\n* 36 [[Fokker D.XXI]] single-engine fighters\n* 35 [[Fokker G.I]] twin-engine fighters\n*  7 [[Fokker D.XVII]] single engine fighters\n* 17 [[Douglas DB-8|Douglas DB-8A-3N]] light bombers\n* 20 [[Fokker C.X]] light bombers\n* 33 [[Fokker C.V]] reconnaissance aircraft\n* 20 [[Koolhoven FK-51]] artillery observer aircraft\n\n[[File:Fokker D.XXI Soesterberg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fokker D.XXI]] at the Air Force Museum in Soesterberg]]\n\nIn May 1940, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[battle of the Netherlands|invaded]] the Netherlands. Within five days the Dutch Army Aviation Brigade was defeated by the [[Luftwaffe]]. All of the Brigade's bombers, along with 30 D.XXI and 17 G.I fighters were shot down; two D.XXI and eight G.I were destroyed on the ground. Two G.I were captured by German forces, one of which was later flown to England by a Fokker pilot. The Douglas bombers were used as fighters because no suitable bombs were available; these aircraft were poorly suited for this role and eight were shot down and three destroyed on the ground in the first hours of the conflict.\n\nIn spite of their numerical inferiority the Dutch Armed Forces did achieve some success against the Luftwaffe, which lost 350 aircraft in the conquest of the Netherlands, although many of these were lost to [[anti-aircraft]] fire and crashes at improvised landing fields in the Netherlands rather than due to action by Dutch fighter-aircraft. The cost was high \u2013 almost 95% of the Dutch pilots were lost. In recognition of their actions [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] granted the highest Dutch military decoration, the ''[[Militaire Willemsorde]]'' (MWO), to the Army Aviation Brigade collectively.\n\nSome aircrews escaped to England and on 1 June 1940, [[No. 320 Squadron RAF|320 Squadron]] and [[No. 321 Squadron RAF|321 Squadron]] were established there under [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] operational command. Due to a shortage of personnel, 321 Squadron was absorbed by 320 Sqn in January 1941. Although their personnel were predominantly from the Navy Air Service, Army Aviation aircrew also served with 320 Sqn until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1941, the '''Royal Netherlands Military Flying-School''' was re-established, in the [[United States]] at [[Hawkins Field (airport)|Jackson Field]] (also known as Hawkins Field), [[Jackson, Mississippi]], operating [[lend-lease]] aircraft and training all military aircrew for the Netherlands.\n\nThe separate ''[[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force|Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger]]'' (ML-KNIL; Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Military Air Service) continued in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (NEI), until its [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupation by Japan]] in 1942.<ref>{{cite web |last = Klemen |first = L |url = http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/ |title = Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942 |access-date = 2 June 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110417021949/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/ |archive-date = 17 April 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Broshot |first = James A. |url = http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/Dutch_OOB.html |title = Dutch Air Force Order of Battle in the Dutch East Indies, 30 November 1941 |date = 1999\u20132000 |work = Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942 |access-date = 2 June 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052128/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/Dutch_OOB.html |archive-date = 26 July 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref> Some personnel escaped to [[Australia]] and [[Ceylon]].

It saw action in the [[New Guinea campaign]] and over the Dutch East Indies. In 1943, [[No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron RAAF|120 (NEI) Squadron]] was established. Equipped with [[Curtiss P-40|Kittyhawk]] fighters, it flew many missions under Australian command, including the [[Western New Guinea campaign|recapturing of Dutch New Guinea]].\n[[File:Curtiss 87A Kittyhawk 2 ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|P-40D Kittyhawk]]\n\nIn June 1943, a Dutch fighter squadron was established in England. [[No. 322 Squadron RAF|322 (Dutch) Squadron]], equipped with the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], saw action as part of the RAF. 322 Sqn aircraft featured the British RAF roundels as well as the Dutch orange triangle. 322 Sqn was successfully deployed against incoming [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] flying bombs. From mid-1944, during the [[invasion of Normandy]], it executed [[close air support|ground attack]] missions over France and Belgium.\n\nIn July 1944, the Directorate of Netherlands Airpower was established in London.\n\nIn 1947, its Chief of Air Force Staff was appointed.\n\n===1950s and 1960s===\nIn 1951 several non-combat functions in the Army Aviation were opened to women.\n\nOn 27 March 1953 the Royal Netherlands Air Force officially became an independent part of the Dutch armed forces, rather than part of the Army.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1953/1953%20-%200450.html/ |title=The Royal Netherlands Air Force |magazine=Flight and Aircraft Engineer |volume=LXIII |number=2307 |page=446 |date=10 April 1953 |accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Air Defense Command, (''Commando Lucht Verdediging, abbreviated CLV'') consisting of a command unit, five radar stations and six fighter squadrons, had been established.

These aircraft were supplied by the United States under the ''Mutual Defense Aid Program'' from 1952\u20131956. 311 was the first flying squadron to be stood up at Volkel on 1 May 1951.<ref name=AW20120927 />\n* 322, 323, 324, 325, 326 and 327 Sqn operated the [[Hawker Hunter|Hawker Hunter F Mk.4]] between 1955\u20131964, and 322, 324, 325 and 326 Sqn operated the [[Hawker Hunter|Hawker Hunter F Mk.6]] between 1957\u20131968.\n* 700, 701 and 702 Sqn operated the [[North American F-86D Sabre|North American F-86K Sabre]] all-weather fighter between 1955\u20131964.\n* 306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315 and 316 Sqn changed aircraft configuration from 1955\u20131970 as the [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak|Republic F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash]] became available.\n\n===Western New Guinea conflict===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Vlootschouw van de Luchtmacht-517877.ogv|thumb|Video of RNLAF aircraft in 1961 from a Dutch newsreel]]\nThe Indonesian government claimed [[Western New Guinea]] following the end of the Second World War. The Dutch government considered the area Dutch territory. Negotiations over the country were conducted for years, but tensions grew until Indonesia broke diplomatic relations with the Netherlands at the end of the 1950s.\n\nIn response, in 1958, the Netherlands deployed military reinforcements to New Guinea, including an Air Force detachment for the air defense of the island ''Biak'' as there was evidence that Indonesia was infiltrating the island in advance of a military operation.\n\nThe first Air Force contribution was the installation of two MkIV early warning radars on  ''Biak'' and neighbouring ''Woendi'' island.\n\nThe political situation between the Netherlands and Indonesia continued to deteriorate and in 1960 the Dutch government deployed reinforcements. The operations were known by name as 'Plan Fidelio'. For the Dutch Air Force this meant the establishment of an Air Defense Command for New Guinea (''Commando Luchtverdediging Nederlands Nieuw-Guinea \u2013 CLV NNG'') consisting of:\n* one Hawker Hunter Mk.4 air defence squadron;\n* a radar navigation system at ''Biak'', and;\n* a reserve airstrip at ''Noemfoer''.\n\nThe Dutch government deployed a squadron consisting of 12 Hawker Hunter Mk.4 AD fighters and two Alouette II SAR helicopters. They were transported to Southeast Asia by the [[HNLMS Karel Doorman (R81)|''Karel Doorman'']]. One year later the Dutch government deployed another 12 Hawker Hunter Mk6 AD fighters; these aircraft carried more fuel and had a larger combat radius.\n\nIn August 1962 Indonesia was ready to attack New Guinea. Despite reinforcements the Dutch defences would be insufficient to withstand the coming attack. Therefore, and because of international political pressure the Dutch government was forced to agree to the peaceful surrender of New Guinea. Dutch forces were withdrawn from the territory.\n\nThe establishment of 336 transport squadron is closely connected to New Guinea. Soon after activation this unit was deployed to New Guinea to take over air transport from the Dutch Navy. 336 Sqn deployed and took over three Navy Dakotas and three US supplied aircraft. 336 Sqn operated from ''Mokmer'' airstrip and transported more than 5,400 passengers between September 1961 and September 1962.\n\n===Cold War era, 1960s, 1970s and later===\nDuring the [[cold war]] Dutch Air Force flying units were integrated in [[NATO]]'s [[Second Allied Tactical Air Force]] tasked with defending northern [[West Germany]] against [[Warsaw Pact]] forces. Additionally the Dutch Air Force manned five fully operational self-supporting Missile Groups in West Germany (1 and 2 MslGrp were initially equipped with [[Nike-Hercules Missile|NIKE]] batteries, while 3,4 and 5 MslGrp were equipped with [[MIM-23 HAWK|Hawk]]) and replaced by the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] Air Defence Missile System. \n\n* 306, 311, 312, 322 and 323 Sqn changed configuration again from 1962\u20131984 after the dual role [[F-104 Starfighter]] was introduced.\n* 313, 314, 315 and 316 Sqn switched over to the [[Canadair CF-5|NF-5 Freedom Fighter]] from 1969\u20131991. The NF-5 was a development of the Canadair CF-5 fighter. Northrop incorporated some NF-5 features into the F-5E/F Tiger II.\n* Since 1979 all RNLAF fast-jet squadrons (originally 306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 322 and 323) have operated the multi role [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]].\n\nThe Dutch Air Force played a key role in ending the [[1977 Dutch train hostage crisis]] when six F-104 Starfighters flew low over the train to distract the hijackers while Dutch anti-terrorist forces stormed the train.\n\n===Former Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 arrives RIAT Fairford 10thJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|Royal Netherlands Air Force [[F-16]] arriving for the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], [[England]], 2014]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas KDC-10-30CF der RNLAF.jpg|thumb|KDC-10 in support of NATO aircraft]]\nIn 1992 [[Ypenburg Air Base]] closed. After the USAF handed over their section of Soesterberg in September 1994, Soesterberg then became a RNLAF transport helicopter base with [[298 Squadron RNLAF]] ([[CH-47D Chinook]]) and 300 Squadron ([[Eurocopter Cougar|AS 532U2 Cougar Mk2]] and [[SA 316|SA 316 Alouette III]]) stationed at the base.\n\nRNLAF F-16s participated in all operations over [[Yugoslavia]] from 1993 [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], including [[Deliberate Force]] in 1995 and ending with [[Operation Allied Force]] in 1999 from two bases in Italy. Initially from Villafranca AB in the north of Italy, later moving south to Amendola AB. During the operations over FRY RNLAF F-16s flew reconnaissance (306 Sqn detachments from Volkel AB were in theatre throughout the operations), enforced the Bosnian no-fly zone, dropped bombs on Udbina AB (1994), successfully dropped an unguided bomb on a moving Serb tank during the fall of Srebrenica (1995), and took part in Deliberate Force later in the summer of 1995.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997 Dutch GCI personnel, along with Canadian GCI controllers, provided many hundreds of hours of fighter control and surveillance as integrated members of USAF/ANG Air Control Squadrons.

Allied Force was also the operational debut for the upgraded F-16AM. Besides the [[Close Air Support|CAP]] missions, offensive bombing and photo reconnaissance missions were flown. KDC-10 tankers refuelled allied aircraft over the Adriatic Sea, and C-130 Hercules transports flew daily sorties from Eindhoven AB to logistically support the operation. Dutch F-16s also dropped [[Cluster bombing of Ni\u0161|cluster bombs on Ni\u0161]]. In total, RNLAF aircraft flew 1,194 sorties during operation Allied Force, which is about 7.5% of the total 37,000 sorties flown.\n\n===Operation Enduring Freedom and NATO in Afghanistan===\n[[File:Dutch F-16.jpg|thumb|An F-16 of the RNLAF over Afghanistan]]\nOn 2 October 2002 a tri-national detachment of 18 Dutch, [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish]] and [[Royal Norwegian Air Force|Norwegian]] F-16 ground attack aircraft and one Dutch KDC-10 tanker deployed to [[Manas Air Base]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] in support of ground forces in [[Afghanistan]] as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. On 1 October 2003 the Dutch F-16 detachment returned to the Netherlands and the KDC-10 returned even earlier (1 April 2003). The RNLAF returned to Manas AB on 8 September 2004 with five F-16 and one KDC-10 in support of the presidential elections of Afghanistan.

Candidates for the replacement were the [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]] [[Rafale]], the [[Lockheed Martin]] F-16 Block 52/60, the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], the [[Saab Gripen]], the [[F/A-18 Super Hornet]] and the [[Lockheed Martin]] [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]]. In 2002 the Netherlands signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) to co-develop the F-35 as a 'Tier 2' Partner. That deal is worth approximately 800 million US dollars, advanced by the Dutch government on behalf of Dutch industries: After the demise of [[Fokker Aircraft]], the government wanted to retain whatever aerospace industry it could.\n\nIn early 2008, a decision was put before Parliament to buy two test aircraft for Dutch pilots to train in the US.  But instead, in April 2009 it was decided to buy just one test aircraft and defer the final decision as to what to buy to 2011, after the elections. The new government announced plans to acquire the second test aircraft in April 2011 in order to remain with the test program, but a next government and Parliament will review the whole process again while opposition to the F-35 is growing ever stronger. Reasons for this are ever rising costs, uncertainty about the exact cost of the aircraft, slips in the schedule of delivery and thus uncertainty about delivery dates. Also, Dutch industries have been complaining about their offsets from the US.<ref>{{cite web |author=Van onze redactie politiek |url=http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/politiek/article2739485.ece/Uitgelachen_PvdA_boekt_toch_winst_.html |title=Uitgelachen PvdA boekt toch winst \u2013 Nieuws \u2013 TROUW |publisher=Trouw.nl |accessdate=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429022658/http://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/politiek/article2739485.ece/Uitgelachen_PvdA_boekt_toch_winst_.html |archive-date=29 April 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nOn 17 September 2013 it was announced that the F-35A is the official replacement for the Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 MLU.

[[military aviation]] branch of the [[Military of the Netherlands|Netherlands Armed Forces]]. It was created in 1953; its ancestor, the ''Luchtvaartafdeling'' (aviation department) of the Dutch Army was founded in 1913. The aerobatic display team of the Royal Netherlands Air Force is the [[Solo Display Team]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin in 1913===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Farman HF 20 at militare luchtvaart museum Soesterberg.jpg|thumb|Farman]]\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF) is the second youngest operational part of the Dutch Armed Forces, which consists of four parts: Navy, Army, Air Force and Marechaussee.\n\nDutch air power started on 1 July 1913 with the founding of the Army Aviation Group (''Luchtvaartafdeeling'' or LVA) at Soesterberg airfield (''vliegbasis Soesterberg'') with four pilots. When founded, the Army Aviation Group operated one aircraft, the ''Brik'', which was supplemented with three French [[Farman HF.20]] aircraft a few months later.\n\nThese aircraft were soon outdated and the Dutch government ordered several fighter/reconnaissance [[Nieuport]] and [[Caudron]] aircraft to replace them.\n\n===World War I (1914\u20131918)===\nThe Netherlands maintained a neutral position during World War I and the Army Aviation Group did not take part in any action, instead developing the force's capabilities.\n\nPilot training was opened for ranks below officer, and technical, aerial photography, meteorological and navigation flights were established.\n\nNew airfields were established at Arnhem, [[Gilze-Rijen|Gilze-Rijen air base]], Venlo and Vlissingen.\n\nBecause of the war it was difficult to procure suitable aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1917 this changed and 1918 personnel numbered 650.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn5/sacre|title=bwn5|last=owner|first=No|date=2013-11-12|website=resources.huygens.knaw.nl|language=Dutch|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n===Between the wars===\nAfter the end of World War I the Dutch government cut the defence budget and the Army Aviation Group was almost dissolved. As political tensions in Europe increased during the late 1930s the government tried to rebuild the armed forces again in 1938 but there were many problems, not least the shortage of pilot instructors, navigators and pilots to fly the new multiple engine aircraft. Lack of standardisation and resulting maintenance issues added to the complexity of the rebuilding task.\n\n===World War II and late 1940s===\n[[File:Fokker g1.gif|thumb|[[Fokker G.I]] ''Jachtkruiser'']]\n\nAs war loomed, in July 1939 the Army Aviation Group was renamed the Army Aviation Brigade (''Luchtvaartbrigade'').\n\nIn August 1939, the Netherlands government mobilised its armed forces, but due to limited budgets the Army Aviation Brigade operated only 176 combat aircraft of the following types:\n\n* 16 [[Fokker T.V]] type bombers\n* 36 [[Fokker D.XXI]] single-engine fighters\n* 35 [[Fokker G.I]] twin-engine fighters\n*  7 [[Fokker D.XVII]] single engine fighters\n* 17 [[Douglas DB-8|Douglas DB-8A-3N]] light bombers\n* 20 [[Fokker C.X]] light bombers\n* 33 [[Fokker C.V]] reconnaissance aircraft\n* 20 [[Koolhoven FK-51]] artillery observer aircraft\n\n[[File:Fokker D.XXI Soesterberg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fokker D.XXI]] at the Air Force Museum in Soesterberg]]\n\nIn May 1940, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] [[battle of the Netherlands|invaded]] the Netherlands. Within five days the Dutch Army Aviation Brigade was defeated by the [[Luftwaffe]]. All of the Brigade's bombers, along with 30 D.XXI and 17 G.I fighters were shot down; two D.XXI and eight G.I were destroyed on the ground. Two G.I were captured by German forces, one of which was later flown to England by a Fokker pilot. The Douglas bombers were used as fighters because no suitable bombs were available; these aircraft were poorly suited for this role and eight were shot down and three destroyed on the ground in the first hours of the conflict.\n\nIn spite of their numerical inferiority the Dutch Armed Forces did achieve some success against the Luftwaffe, which lost 350 aircraft in the conquest of the Netherlands, although many of these were lost to [[anti-aircraft]] fire and crashes at improvised landing fields in the Netherlands rather than due to action by Dutch fighter-aircraft. The cost was high \u2013 almost 95% of the Dutch pilots were lost. In recognition of their actions [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] granted the highest Dutch military decoration, the ''[[Militaire Willemsorde]]'' (MWO), to the Army Aviation Brigade collectively.\n\nSome aircrews escaped to England and on 1 June 1940, [[No. 320 Squadron RAF|320 Squadron]] and [[No. 321 Squadron RAF|321 Squadron]] were established there under [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] operational command. Due to a shortage of personnel, 321 Squadron was absorbed by 320 Sqn in January 1941. Although their personnel were predominantly from the Navy Air Service, Army Aviation aircrew also served with 320 Sqn until the end of the war.\n\nIn 1941, the '''Royal Netherlands Military Flying-School''' was re-established, in the [[United States]] at [[Hawkins Field (airport)|Jackson Field]] (also known as Hawkins Field), [[Jackson, Mississippi]], operating [[lend-lease]] aircraft and training all military aircrew for the Netherlands.\n\nThe separate ''[[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force|Militaire Luchtvaart van het Koninklijk Nederlands-Indisch Leger]]'' (ML-KNIL; Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Military Air Service) continued in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (NEI), until its [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|occupation by Japan]] in 1942.<ref>{{cite web |last = Klemen |first = L |url = http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/ |title = Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942 |access-date = 2 June 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110417021949/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/ |archive-date = 17 April 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last = Broshot |first = James A. |url = http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/Dutch_OOB.html |title = Dutch Air Force Order of Battle in the Dutch East Indies, 30 November 1941 |date = 1999\u20132000 |work = Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941\u20131942 |access-date = 2 June 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726052128/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/Dutch_OOB.html |archive-date = 26 July 2011 |url-status = live }}</ref> Some personnel escaped to [[Australia]] and [[Ceylon]].

The Dutch government considered the area Dutch territory. Negotiations over the country were conducted for years, but tensions grew until Indonesia broke diplomatic relations with the Netherlands at the end of the 1950s.\n\nIn response, in 1958, the Netherlands deployed military reinforcements to New Guinea, including an Air Force detachment for the air defense of the island ''Biak'' as there was evidence that Indonesia was infiltrating the island in advance of a military operation.\n\nThe first Air Force contribution was the installation of two MkIV early warning radars on  ''Biak'' and neighbouring ''Woendi'' island.\n\nThe political situation between the Netherlands and Indonesia continued to deteriorate and in 1960 the Dutch government deployed reinforcements. The operations were known by name as 'Plan Fidelio'. For the Dutch Air Force this meant the establishment of an Air Defense Command for New Guinea (''Commando Luchtverdediging Nederlands Nieuw-Guinea \u2013 CLV NNG'') consisting of:\n* one Hawker Hunter Mk.4 air defence squadron;\n* a radar navigation system at ''Biak'', and;\n* a reserve airstrip at ''Noemfoer''.\n\nThe Dutch government deployed a squadron consisting of 12 Hawker Hunter Mk.4 AD fighters and two Alouette II SAR helicopters. They were transported to Southeast Asia by the [[HNLMS Karel Doorman (R81)|''Karel Doorman'']]. One year later the Dutch government deployed another 12 Hawker Hunter Mk6 AD fighters; these aircraft carried more fuel and had a larger combat radius.\n\nIn August 1962 Indonesia was ready to attack New Guinea. Despite reinforcements the Dutch defences would be insufficient to withstand the coming attack. Therefore, and because of international political pressure the Dutch government was forced to agree to the peaceful surrender of New Guinea. Dutch forces were withdrawn from the territory.\n\nThe establishment of 336 transport squadron is closely connected to New Guinea. Soon after activation this unit was deployed to New Guinea to take over air transport from the Dutch Navy. 336 Sqn deployed and took over three Navy Dakotas and three US supplied aircraft. 336 Sqn operated from ''Mokmer'' airstrip and transported more than 5,400 passengers between September 1961 and September 1962.\n\n===Cold War era, 1960s, 1970s and later===\nDuring the [[cold war]] Dutch Air Force flying units were integrated in [[NATO]]'s [[Second Allied Tactical Air Force]] tasked with defending northern [[West Germany]] against [[Warsaw Pact]] forces. Additionally the Dutch Air Force manned five fully operational self-supporting Missile Groups in West Germany (1 and 2 MslGrp were initially equipped with [[Nike-Hercules Missile|NIKE]] batteries, while 3,4 and 5 MslGrp were equipped with [[MIM-23 HAWK|Hawk]]) and replaced by the [[MIM-104 Patriot]] Air Defence Missile System. \n\n* 306, 311, 312, 322 and 323 Sqn changed configuration again from 1962\u20131984 after the dual role [[F-104 Starfighter]] was introduced.\n* 313, 314, 315 and 316 Sqn switched over to the [[Canadair CF-5|NF-5 Freedom Fighter]] from 1969\u20131991. The NF-5 was a development of the Canadair CF-5 fighter. Northrop incorporated some NF-5 features into the F-5E/F Tiger II.\n* Since 1979 all RNLAF fast-jet squadrons (originally 306, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 322 and 323) have operated the multi role [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]].\n\nThe Dutch Air Force played a key role in ending the [[1977 Dutch train hostage crisis]] when six F-104 Starfighters flew low over the train to distract the hijackers while Dutch anti-terrorist forces stormed the train.\n\n===Former Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Royal Netherlands Air Force F-16 arrives RIAT Fairford 10thJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|Royal Netherlands Air Force [[F-16]] arriving for the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], [[England]], 2014]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas KDC-10-30CF der RNLAF.jpg|thumb|KDC-10 in support of NATO aircraft]]\nIn 1992 [[Ypenburg Air Base]] closed.

Initially from Villafranca AB in the north of Italy, later moving south to Amendola AB. During the operations over FRY RNLAF F-16s flew reconnaissance (306 Sqn detachments from Volkel AB were in theatre throughout the operations), enforced the Bosnian no-fly zone, dropped bombs on Udbina AB (1994), successfully dropped an unguided bomb on a moving Serb tank during the fall of Srebrenica (1995), and took part in Deliberate Force later in the summer of 1995.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997 Dutch GCI personnel, along with Canadian GCI controllers, provided many hundreds of hours of fighter control and surveillance as integrated members of USAF/ANG Air Control Squadrons.

KDC-10 tankers refuelled allied aircraft over the Adriatic Sea, and C-130 Hercules transports flew daily sorties from Eindhoven AB to logistically support the operation. Dutch F-16s also dropped [[Cluster bombing of Ni\u0161|cluster bombs on Ni\u0161]].

Candidates for the replacement were the [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]] [[Rafale]], the [[Lockheed Martin]] F-16 Block 52/60, the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], the [[Saab Gripen]], the [[F/A-18 Super Hornet]] and the [[Lockheed Martin]] [[F-35 Lightning II|F-35]]. In 2002 the Netherlands signed a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) to co-develop the F-35 as a 'Tier 2' Partner. That deal is worth approximately 800 million US dollars, advanced by the Dutch government on behalf of Dutch industries: After the demise of [[Fokker Aircraft]], the government wanted to retain whatever aerospace industry it could.\n\nIn early 2008, a decision was put before Parliament to buy two test aircraft for Dutch pilots to train in the US.  But instead, in April 2009 it was decided to buy just one test aircraft and defer the final decision as to what to buy to 2011, after the elections. The new government announced plans to acquire the second test aircraft in April 2011 in order to remain with the test program, but a next government and Parliament will review the whole process again while opposition to the F-35 is growing ever stronger.
