He grew up in his family home at Trikomo. After attending his village school he studied at the [[Pancyprian Gymnasium]] in Nicosia (1909\u20131915) where he stayed with his grandmother.\n\n==Early military career==\nIn 1916, Grivas moved to Greece; according to his obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' of London, he had left the family home after learning that his father intended him to become a physician. He took Greek citizenship and enrolled at the [[Hellenic Military Academy|Athens Military Academy]]. He completed his military studies at the [[\u00c9cole Militaire]] in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Times Obituary\"/> He graduated in 1919, and joined the [[Greek Army]] with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant and was immediately posted on the Asia Minor front of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|Greco-Turkish War]]. He served in the Greek Army's 10th Division and participated in its advance from [[\u0130zmir]] to Panormos (today [[Bandirma]]) and [[Eski\u015fehir]], past [[Bursa]] and the [[Battle of Sakarya]]. With the subsequent rout and defeat of the Greek Army and its complete withdrawal from Asia Minor in 1922 he was placed at Redestos, [[Thrace]]. He was decorated for his bravery and promoted to Lieutenant. He was later selected to study at the French Military Academy and upon his return to Greece he served in a number of posts, including that of a lecturer at the Military School of Greece. He was promoted to Captain in 1925 and to Major in 1935. Two years later he married Vasiliki Deka, the daughter of an Athenian [[pharmacist]].\n\n==World War II and German occupation==\nWith the beginning of [[World War II]], Grivas was transferred to the operations department of the central headquarters of the Greek Army, working on the northern Greece's strategic defensive plans. When the [[Greco-Italian War]] broke out, Grivas was deployed to the Albanian front in December 1940, and served as Chief of Staff of the 2nd Division.\n\nFollowing the German-Italian-Bulgarian occupation of Greece during World War II, Grivas founded and led the [[Organization X|Organisation ''X'']], a minor far-right guerrilla organisation made up of officers of the Greek Army whose influence was limited to certain neighbourhoods of Athens. It played a minor role in the [[Greek Resistance]] to the [[Axis occupation of Greece]]. Its activities included spying for the Allied powers and launching minor attacks and sabotage operations against the occupiers. During the [[Dekemvriana|events of December 1944]], members of Organisation X, using weapons recovered from the retreating Germans, fought at the Theseon alongside British and Greek monarchist forces to take control of Athens from EAM/ELAS fighters.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kofas | first = Jon | authorlink = | title = Intervention and Underdevelopment: Greece During the Cold War | publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press | date = 31 May 1985 | location = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R_Glr2QP-RMC&pg=PA40&dq=x+elas+nazi | doi = | isbn = 978-0-271-02647-3| page = 40 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Ganser | first = Daniele | authorlink = | title = Nato's Secret Armies: Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe | publisher = Routledge | date = 12 July 2005 | location = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VAbkogswOmEC&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=x+elas+nazi | doi = | isbn = 978-0-7146-5607-6| page = 213 }}</ref><ref name=\"The Memoirs of General Grivas\">{{cite book |last= Grivas |first= George |authorlink= |author2=Charles Foley |title= The Memoirs of General Grivas |year= 1964 |publisher= Longmans |location= London |isbn= }}</ref> \n\nIn 1946, he retired from the Greek Army on his own request but his subsequent attempts to enter politics were unsuccessful.\n\n==The EOKA guerrilla campaign==\nFollowing his retirement, Grivas focused on the idea of ridding Cyprus of British colonial rule and annexing it to Greece ([[Enosis]]). As a member of the secret Committee for the Cyprus Struggle he took the oath of Enosis together with the newly elected [[Archbishop of Cyprus|Archbishop]] [[Makarios III]], with whom he collaborated for preparing the armed struggle. He arrived secretly in Cyprus in November 1954 and began immediately the formation of his guerrilla organisation EOKA. On 1 April 1955 with a declaration that he signed as DIGENIS and a number of bombings against various targets in the four major cities and military installations, he announced the beginning of his campaign for Self Determination \u2013 Union with Greece. \n{{Quote box|\n width=30%\n|align=right\n|quote=\"One does not use a tank to catch field mice\u2014a cat will do the job better.\"\n|source='''George Grivas-Dighenis''', referring to British Military strategies, in his book ''Guerrilla warfare and Eoka's struggle: A politicomilitary study''<ref>{{cite book | last = Grivas | first = George | authorlink = | title = Guerrilla Warfare and Eoka's Struggle | publisher = Longman | year = 1964 | location = London | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = }}</ref>\n|}}\n\nHe directed the first EOKA operations from his hideout in Nicosia but soon after he moved to the Troodos mountains to lead his guerrilla teams.

His views were at odds with those of Makarios who had accepted the above agreements on behalf of the Greek Cypriot population. In March 1959, Grivas came out of his hideout and departed (in exile, requested by the UK as part of the cease fire agreement) for Athens where he received a hero's welcome as the liberator of the Greek Cypriots and was subsequently decorated with the highest honours by the [[Greek Parliament]] and the Athens Academy and promoted to the rank of General. Not long after his return, Grivas was persuaded to enter politics as head of a coalition party but soon abandoned this route after the disappointing percentage his party obtained in the general election of 1963.\n\n===1964===\nHe returned to Cyprus in 1964 after the outbreak of intercommunal violence between [[Turkish Cypriots]] and [[Greek Cypriots]] to take over the Supreme Command of the Greek Cypriot forces organised under Makarios's National Guard as well as the Greek military division sent to Cyprus by the government of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George Papandreou]] to assist in the island's defence against a possible Turkish attack. He directed the construction of defence forts and complexes aiming at withstanding a Turkish invasion. On 15 November 1967, Greek Cypriot National Guard under his direct command overran two small villages on the critical Larnaca, Limassol, Nicosia intersection, resulting in the deaths of 27 people, mostly armed Turkish Cypriot civilians as well as Turkish Cypriot paramilitaries at [[Kofinou]] and [[Agios Theodoros, Larnaca|Agios Theodoros]]. The immediate result of this event was Turkey's ultimatum, which prompted the Greek military government to recall both the Greek Division and General Grivas to Athens.\n\n===1968===\nFrom 1968 to 1969, under strict surveillance, he participated in a resistance movement aiming at deposing the ruling military junta and restoring democracy in Greece, along with a number of Greek Army officers including Colonel [[Dimitrios Opropoulos]] and Majors [[Spyros Moustaklis]], [[Nikolaos Lytras (military officer)|Nikolaos Lytras]] and [[George Karousos]] as well as Greek Cypriot students and professionals many of them former EOKA fighters. Grivas began the formation of armed resistance cells in a number of neighbourhoods in Athens which were armed with guns and explosives that were brought in secretly from Cyprus. The organisation, however, was discovered by the authorities and many of its members were arrested.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222173601/http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=12519&m=A30&aa=1 Letter of General Karousos to the Greek Newspaper \"To Vima\"].

The post-Grivas EOKA B then signed a secret agreement with Brigadier [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]], the \"invisible dictator\" of Greece, and was controlled directly from Athens. Grivas' funeral and burial was held on 29 January 1974, in the garden of the house that had been Grivas' last hideout during the EOKA struggle (1955\u20131959) and was attended by tens of thousands of Greek Cypriots. Upon his death, the Cypriot Government declared a three-day official mourning and three days later, the [[Parliament of Cyprus]] declared General Grivas \"A worthy son of the motherland\".<ref>Leonidas Leonidou, Georgios Grivas Digenis, Viografia, Volume IV</ref> The government of Makarios, the target of Grivas' campaign for enosis, formally boycotted the event.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bitter Lessons: How We Failed in Cyprus|journal=Foreign Policy|date=Summer 1975|first=Laurence|last=Stern|volume=19|issue=19|pages=34\u201378 |jstor=1147991}}</ref>\n\nThe Second Junta of Greece, under Ioannidis, overthrew Makarios just six months after Grivas' death. Ioannidis had been planning to overthrow Makarios in spring 1974, but the final decision to act was made on 2 July 1974 after Makarios decided to directly oppose the Ioannidis regime by expelling from the Cypriot National Guard 550 Greek officers. That meant the loss of military control of Cyprus for Greece as well as the humiliation of Ioannidis.<ref>See secret minutes of a conversation between Makarios and British Prime Minister-London 17 July 1974.</ref> The [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] of 15 July 1974 that overthrew Makarios were executed by forces of the [[Cypriot National Guard]] under direct instructions from Greece. The National Guard was led by Greek officers and consisted of Greek-Cypriot conscripts. The EOKA B members and other pro-enosis forces joined the National Guard in the afternoon of Monday 15 July 1974 in the fight against Makarios' forces. The coup was swiftly followed by the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] on 20 July. This invasion took Ioannides by surprise, who failed to prepare Cyprus for a Turkish invasion and failed to coerce the Greek generals whom he had appointed to apply \"Plan K\" and provide military assistance to Cyprus. That marked the downfall of Ioannidis.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n* Grivas Georgios-Digenis, Apomnimoneumata Agonos E.O.K.A. 1955\u201359, Athens 1961.\n* Grivas Georgios-Digenis, Crhonikon Agonos E.O.K.A. 1955059, Nicosia 1972\n* Grivas George, General Grivas on Guerrilla Warfare.

On 15 November 1967, Greek Cypriot National Guard under his direct command overran two small villages on the critical Larnaca, Limassol, Nicosia intersection, resulting in the deaths of 27 people, mostly armed Turkish Cypriot civilians as well as Turkish Cypriot paramilitaries at [[Kofinou]] and [[Agios Theodoros, Larnaca|Agios Theodoros]]. The immediate result of this event was Turkey's ultimatum, which prompted the Greek military government to recall both the Greek Division and General Grivas to Athens.\n\n===1968===\nFrom 1968 to 1969, under strict surveillance, he participated in a resistance movement aiming at deposing the ruling military junta and restoring democracy in Greece, along with a number of Greek Army officers including Colonel [[Dimitrios Opropoulos]] and Majors [[Spyros Moustaklis]], [[Nikolaos Lytras (military officer)|Nikolaos Lytras]] and [[George Karousos]] as well as Greek Cypriot students and professionals many of them former EOKA fighters. Grivas began the formation of armed resistance cells in a number of neighbourhoods in Athens which were armed with guns and explosives that were brought in secretly from Cyprus. The organisation, however, was discovered by the authorities and many of its members were arrested.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222173601/http://tovima.dolnet.gr/print_article.php?e=B&f=12519&m=A30&aa=1 Letter of General Karousos to the Greek Newspaper \"To Vima\"].

Ioannidis had been planning to overthrow Makarios in spring 1974, but the final decision to act was made on 2 July 1974 after Makarios decided to directly oppose the Ioannidis regime by expelling from the Cypriot National Guard 550 Greek officers. That meant the loss of military control of Cyprus for Greece as well as the humiliation of Ioannidis.<ref>See secret minutes of a conversation between Makarios and British Prime Minister-London 17 July 1974.</ref> The [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] of 15 July 1974 that overthrew Makarios were executed by forces of the [[Cypriot National Guard]] under direct instructions from Greece. The National Guard was led by Greek officers and consisted of Greek-Cypriot conscripts. The EOKA B members and other pro-enosis forces joined the National Guard in the afternoon of Monday 15 July 1974 in the fight against Makarios' forces. The coup was swiftly followed by the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] on 20 July. This invasion took Ioannides by surprise, who failed to prepare Cyprus for a Turkish invasion and failed to coerce the Greek generals whom he had appointed to apply \"Plan K\" and provide military assistance to Cyprus. That marked the downfall of Ioannidis.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n* Grivas Georgios-Digenis, Apomnimoneumata Agonos E.O.K.A. 1955\u201359, Athens 1961.\n* Grivas Georgios-Digenis, Crhonikon Agonos E.O.K.A. 1955059, Nicosia 1972\n* Grivas George, General Grivas on Guerrilla Warfare.

This newly created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing army, police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II\", at a cost of over $11 billion.<ref>Ajami, Faoud. The Foreigner's Gift (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2006) pages 295\u2013298.</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses \u2013 not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49283-2004Sep25.html |title=Battling for Iraq |work=The Washington Post |date=September 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |first=David H. |last=Petraeus}}</ref> Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency\u2014or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight \u2013 and while being shot at\". Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former [[Interim Iraq Governing Council]] member [[Ali A.

Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister.

This newly created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing army, police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II\", at a cost of over $11 billion.<ref>Ajami, Faoud. The Foreigner's Gift (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2006) pages 295\u2013298.</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses \u2013 not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49283-2004Sep25.html |title=Battling for Iraq |work=The Washington Post |date=September 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |first=David H. |last=Petraeus}}</ref> Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency\u2014or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight \u2013 and while being shot at\". Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former [[Interim Iraq Governing Council]] member [[Ali A.

On January 23, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]]\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/world/middleeast/24petraeustextcnd.html |title=General Petraeus' Opening Statement |work=The New York Times|date=January 23, 2007 |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThroughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, [[Multi-National Force-Iraq]] endeavored to work with the [[Iraq|Government of Iraq]] to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population.

{"title_page": "Race and genetics", "text_new": "{{short description|Relevance of genotype to race classification}}\n{{Race}}\nThe relationship between '''race and genetics''' is relevant to the controversy concerning [[Race (human categorization)|race classification]]. In everyday life, many societies classify populations into groups based on [[phenotype|phenotypical]] traits and impressions of probable geographic ancestry and cultural identity\u2014these are the groups usually called \"races\" in countries like the United States, Brazil, and South Africa. Patterns of variation of human genetic traits are generally [[cline (biology)|clinal]], with more abrupt shifts at places where steady gene flow is interrupted. The pattern of genetic variants tend to form larger regional clusters.

In that way there is a distinct statistical correlation between gene frequencies and racial categories. However, because all populations are genetically diverse, and because there is a complex relation between ancestry, genetic makeup and phenotype, and because racial categories are based on subjective evaluations of the traits, there is no specific gene that can be used to determine a person's race.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"ambiguous\" /><ref name=JW2004/>\n\nSome genetic variants that contribute to the risk of complex diseases are differently distributed among human populations.

Resultantly, different polypeptide proteins are coded. . Some mutations may be positive and can help the individual survive more effectively in their environment. Variation is counteracted by [[natural selection]] and by [[genetic drift]]; note too the [[founder effect]], when a small number of initial founders establish a population which hence starts with a correspondingly small degree of genetic variation. [[Epigenetic inheritance]] involves [[Heredity|heritable]] changes in [[phenotype]] (appearance) or [[gene expression]] caused by mechanisms other than changes in the DNA sequence.\n\nHuman phenotypes are highly [[polygenic]] (dependent on interaction by many genes) and are influenced by environment as well as by genetics.\n\n[[Nucleotide diversity]] is based on single mutations, [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs). The nucleotide diversity between humans is about 0.1 percent (one difference per one thousand [[nucleotide]]s between two humans chosen at random). This amounts to approximately three million SNPs (since the human genome has about three billion nucleotides). There are an estimated ten million SNPs in the human population.\n\nResearch has shown that non-SNP ([[structural variation|structural]]) variation accounts for more human genetic variation than single nucleotide diversity. Structural variation includes [[copy-number variation]] and results from [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]], [[Genetic insertion|insertions]] and [[Gene duplication|duplications]]. It is estimated that approximately 0.4 percent of the genomes of unrelated people differ, apart from copy number. When copy-number variation is included, human-to-human genetic variation is estimated to be at least 0.5 percent.\n\n=={{anchor|Methods in human ancestry and population genetic structure research}}Research methods==\n\n==={{anchor|Visible traits, proteins, and genes studied}}Trait, protein and gene studies===\n{{See also|Race (classification of human beings)}}\nEarly racial classification attempts measured [[anthropometry|surface traits]], particularly skin color, hair color and texture, eye color, and head size and shape.

Eastern Europeans and Russians had a higher incidence of group B; people from India had the greatest incidence. The Herschfelds concluded that humans comprised two \"biochemical races\", originating separately. It was hypothesized that these two races later mixed, resulting in the patterns of groups A and B. This was one of the first theories of racial differences to include the idea that human variation did not correlate with genetic variation. It was expected that groups with similar proportions of blood groups would be more closely related, but instead it was often found that groups separated by great distances (such as those from Madagascar and Russia), had similar incidences.<ref name=\"bryansykes\">{{cite book |author=Sykes, Bryan |chapter=From Blood Groups to Genes |title=The seven daughters of Eve |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sevendaughtersof00syke/page/32 32]\u201351 |isbn=978-0-393-02018-2 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sevendaughtersof00syke }}</ref> It was later discovered that the [[ABO blood group system]] is not just common to humans, but shared with other primates,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular biology and evolution of blood group and MHC antigens in primates|last2=Klein|first2=Jan|last3=Socha|first3=Wladyslaw W.|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-59086-3|last1=Blancher|first1=Antoine}}</ref> and likely predates all human groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last2=Thompson|first2=Emma E.|last3=Flutre|first3=Timoth\u00e9e|last4=Lovstad|first4=Jessica|last5=Venkat|first5=Aarti|last6=Margulis|first6=Susan W.|last7=Moyse|first7=Jill|last8=Ross|first8=Steve|last9=Gamble|first9=Kathryn|date=2012-11-06|title=The ABO blood group is a trans-species polymorphism in primates|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=45|pages=18493\u201318498|doi=10.1073/pnas.1210603109|issn=0027-8424|pmid=23091028|last1=S\u00e9gurel|first1=Laure|last10=Sella|first10=Guy|last11=Ober|first11=Carole|last12=Przeworski|first12=Molly|pmc=3494955|arxiv=1208.4613|bibcode=2012PNAS..10918493S}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Population genetic structure and genetic distance}}Population genetics===\nResearchers currently use [[genetic testing]], which may involve hundreds (or thousands) of [[genetic marker]]s or the entire genome.\n\n===={{anchor|Population genetic structure}}Structure====\n[[File:Principle component analysis of Levantine populations.png|thumb|Principal component analysis of fifty populations, color-coded by region, illustrates the differentiation and overlap of populations found using this method of analysis.]]\nSeveral methods to examine and quantify genetic subgroups exist, including [[cluster analysis|cluster]] and [[principal components analysis]].

In fact, the formulas derived in Harpending's paper in the 'Kinship in a subdivided population' section imply that two unrelated individuals of the same race have a higher coefficient of kinship (0.125) than an individual and their mixed race half-sibling (0.109).<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1023/A:1020815420693\n| volume = 24\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 141\u2013147\n| last = Harpending | first = Henry\n| title = Kinship and Population Subdivision\n| journal = [[Population & Environment]]\n| date = 2002-11-01\n| jstor = 27503827\n| url = http://www.humanbiologicaldiversity.com/articles/Harpending,%20Henry.%20%22Kinship%20and%20Population%20Subdivision.%22%20Population%20and%20Environment%2024,%20no.%202%20(2002).pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Historic and geographic analysis of ancestry}}History and geography===\n[[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] has described two methods of ancestry analysis.<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\">Genes, peoples, and languages, Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 1997, vol.94, pp.7719\u20137724, doi=10.1073/pnas.94.15.7719  http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/94/15/7719</ref> Current-population genetic structure does not imply that differing clusters or components indicate only one ancestral home per group; for example, a genetic cluster in the US comprises Hispanics with European, Native American and African ancestry.<ref name=Tang2005/>\n\nGeographic analyses attempt to identify places of origin, their relative importance and possible causes of genetic variation in an area. The results can be presented as maps showing genetic variation. Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues argue that if genetic variations are investigated, they often correspond to population migrations due to new sources of food, improved transportation or shifts in political power. For example, in Europe the most significant direction of genetic variation corresponds to the spread of agriculture from the Middle East to Europe between 10,000 and 6,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\"/> Such geographic analysis works best in the absence of recent large-scale, rapid migrations.\n\nHistoric analyses use differences in genetic variation (measured by genetic distance) as a [[molecular clock]] indicating the evolutionary relation of species or groups, and can be used to create [[evolutionary tree]]s reconstructing population separations.<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Validating the genetic ancestry research}}Validation===\nResults of genetic-ancestry research are supported if they agree with research results from other fields, such as [[linguistics]] or [[archeology]].<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\"/> Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues have argued that there is a correspondence between [[language families]] found in linguistic research and the population tree they found in their 1994 study.

Exceptions to this rule are [[Sami people|Sami]], who are genetically associated with populations speaking languages from other language families.

Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.\" </blockquote>They also wrote, regarding a model with five clusters corresponding to Africa, Eurasia (Europe, Middle East, and Central/South Asia), East Asia, Oceania, and the Americas: \"For population pairs from the same cluster, as geographic distance increases, genetic distance increases in a linear manner, consistent with a clinal population structure. However, for pairs from different clusters, genetic distance is generally larger than that between intracluster pairs that have the same geographic distance. For example, genetic distances for population pairs with one population in Eurasia and the other in East Asia are greater than those for pairs at equivalent geographic distance within Eurasia or within East Asia. Loosely speaking, it is these small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance\u2014across [[ocean]]s, the [[Himalaya]]s, and the [[Sahara]]\u2014that provide the basis for the ability of STRUCTURE to identify clusters that correspond to geographic regions\".<ref name=\"Rosenberg2005\" /> This applies to populations in their ancestral homes when migrations and gene flow were slow; large, rapid migrations exhibit different characteristics. Tang and colleagues (2004) wrote, \"we detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity\u2014as opposed to current residence\u2014is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population\".<ref name=\"Tang2005\" />\n\n=== Number of clusters ===\n{{See also|Human genetic clustering}}\n[[File:Rosenberg2007.png|thumb|right|150px|Gene clusters from Rosenberg (2006) for K=7 clusters.

The Kalash did not fit into the general pattern for it had been a genetically isolated population that happened to be reflected in this study. Potentially numerous genetically drifted groups, such as the [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]] [[Sentinelese]], are not represented in the study.\n\n=== Utility ===\nIt has been argued that knowledge of a person's race is limited in value, since people of the same race vary from one another.<ref name=JW2004/> [[David J. Witherspoon]] and colleagues have argued that when individuals are assigned to population groups, two randomly chosen individuals from different populations can resemble each other more than a randomly chosen member of their own group. They found that many thousands of genetic markers had to be used for the answer to \"How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?\" to be \"never\". This assumed three population groups, separated by large geographic distances (European, African and East Asian). The global human population is more complex, and studying a large number of groups would require an increased number of markers for the same answer. They conclude that \"caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes\",<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Witherspoon DJ, Wooding S, Rogers AR, etal |title=Genetic Similarities Within and Between Human Populations |journal=Genetics |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=351\u20139 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17339205 |pmc=1893020 |doi=10.1534/genetics.106.067355}}</ref> and \"The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them.

Sauer said, \"the successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed 'racial' category. A specimen may display features that point to African ancestry. In this country that person is likely to have been labeled Black regardless of whether or not such a race actually exists in nature\".<ref name=\"Sauer 1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Sauer|first1=NJ|title=Forensic anthropology and the concept of race: if races don't exist, why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them?|journal=Social Science & Medicine|date=January 1992|volume=34|issue=2|pages=107\u201311|pmid=1738862|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(92)90086-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Ancestry Informative Markers ===\n[[Ancestry-informative marker|Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs)]] is a genealogy tracing technology that has come under much criticism due to its reliance on reference populations. In a 2015 article, Troy Duster outlines how contemporary technology allows the tracing of ancestral lineage but along only the lines of one maternal and one paternal line. That is, of 64 total great-great-great-great-grandparents, only one from each parent is identified, implying the other 62 ancestors are ignored in tracing efforts.<ref name=\"Duster 1\u201327\">{{Cite journal|last=Duster|first=Troy|date=March 2015|title=A post-genomic surprise.

In other words, using populations who currently reside in given places as references for certain races and ethnic groups is unreliable due to the demographic changes which have occurred over many centuries in those places. \nFurthermore, ancestry-informative markers being widely shared among the whole human population, it is their frequency which is tested, not their mere absence/presence. A threshold of relative frequency has, therefore, to be set. According to Duster the criteria for setting such thresholds are a trade secret of the companies marketing the tests. Thus, we cannot say anything conclusive on whether they are appropriate. \nResults of AIMs are extremely sensitive to where this bar is set.<ref>Fullwiley, D. (2008). The Biologistical Construction of Race: `Admixture\u2019 Technology and the New Genetic Medicine. Social Studies of Science, 38(5), 695\u2013735. https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312708090796\n</ref> Given that many genetic traits are found very similar amid many different populations, the rate of frequency which is taken to be enough for being part of a reference population is very important. This can also lead to mistakes, given that many populations may share the same patterns, if not exactly the same genes. \"This means that someone from Bulgaria whose ancestors go back to the fifteenth century could (and sometime does) map as partly \u2018Native American\u2019\".<ref name=\"Duster 1\u201327\"/> This happens because AIMs  rely on a '100% purity' assumption of reference populations. That is, they assume that a pattern of traits would ideally be necessary and sufficient condition for assigning an individual to an ancestral reference populations.\n\n==Race and medicine==\n{{Main|Race and health}}\nThere are certain statistical differences between racial groups in susceptibility to certain diseases.<ref name=Gitschier2005>{{cite journal |author=Risch N |title=The whole side of it--an interview with Neil Risch by Jane Gitschier |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=e14 |date=July 2005 |pmid=17411332 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010014 |pmc=1183530}}</ref> Genes change in response to local diseases; for example, people who are [[Duffy antigen system|Duffy-negative]] tend to have a higher resistance to malaria.

They summarise evidence of the link between racial discrimination and health outcomes due to poorer food quality, access to healthcare, housing conditions, education, access to information, exposure to infectious agents and toxic substances, and material scarcity. They also cite evidence that this process can work positively \u2013 for example, the psychological advantage of perceiving oneself at the top of a social hierarchy is linked to improved health. However they caution that the effects of discrimination do not offer a complete explanation for differential rates of disease and risk factors between racial groups, and the employment of self-identified race has the potential to reinforce racial inequalities.\n\n== Objections to racial naturalism ==\nRacial naturalism is the view that racial classifications are grounded in objective patterns of genetic similarities and differences. Proponents of this view have justified it using the scientific evidence described above. However, this view is controversial and philosophers of race have put forward four main objections to it.\n\nSemantic objections, such as the discreteness objection, argue that the human populations picked out in population-genetic research are not races and do not correspond to what \"race\" means in the United States. \"The discreteness objection does not require there to be no genetic admixture in the human species in order for there to be US 'racial groups' ... rather ... what the objection claims is that membership in US racial groups is different from membership in continental populations. ... Thus, strictly speaking, Blacks are not identical to Africans, Whites are not identical to Eurasians, Asians are not identical to East Asians and so forth.\"<ref name=spencer>{{cite journal |last1=Spencer |first1=Quayshawn |title=Philosophy of race meets population genetics |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |date=2015 |volume=52 |pages=49|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.04.003 |pmid=25963045 }}</ref> Therefore, it could be argued that scientific research is not really about race.\n\nThe next two objections, are metaphysical objections which argue that even if the semantic objections fail, human genetic clustering results do not support the biological reality of race. The 'very important objection' stipulates that races in the US definition fail to be important to biology, in the sense that continental populations do not form biological subspecies. The 'objectively real objection' states that \"US racial groups are not biologically real because they are not objectively real in the sense of existing independently of human interest, belief, or some other mental state of humans.\"<ref >{{cite journal |last1=Spencer |first1=Quayshawn |title=Philosophy of race meets population genetics |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |date=2015 |volume=52 |pages=51|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.04.003 |pmid=25963045 }}</ref> Racial naturalists, such as [[Quayshawn Spencer]], have responded to each of these objections with counter-arguments.

Philosophers such as Joshua Glasgow and [[Naomi Zack]] believe that US racial groups cannot be defined by visible traits, such as skin colour and physical attributes: \"The ancestral genetic tracking material has no effect on phenotypes, or biological traits of organisms, which would include the traits deemed racial, because the ancestral tracking genetic material plays no role in the production of proteindit is not the kind of material that 'codes' for protein production.\"<ref name=\"zach\">{{cite journal |last1=Zach |first1=Naomi |title=Philosophy of Science and Race |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |date=2002 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=656\u2013658|doi=10.2307/3559445 |jstor=3559445}}</ref> Spencer contends that certain racial discourses require visible groups, but disagrees that this is a requirement in all US racial discourse.\n\nA different objection states that US racial groups are not biologically real because they are not objectively real in the sense of existing independently of some mental state of humans.

Spencer states that in order to accurately capture real biological entities, social factors must also be considered.\n\n=== Criticism of race-based medicines ===\n[[Troy Duster]] points out that genetics is often not the predominant determinant of disease susceptibilities, even though they might correlate with specific socially defined categories. This is because this research oftentimes lacks control for a multiplicity of socio-economic factors. He cites data collected by King and Rewers that indicates how dietary differences play a significant role in explaining variations of diabetes prevalence between populations.\n\nDuster elaborates by putting forward the example of [[Pima people|the Pima]] of [[Arizona]], a population suffering from disproportionately high rates of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. The reason for such, he argues, was not necessarily a result of the prevalence of the [[FABP2]] gene, which is associated with [[insulin resistance]]. Rather he argues that scientists often discount the lifestyle implications under specific socio-historical contexts. For instance, near the end of the 19th century, the Pima economy was predominantly agriculture-based. However, as the European American population settles into traditionally Pima territory, the Pima lifestyles became heavily Westernised. Within three decades, the incidence of diabetes increased multiple folds. Governmental provision of free food to alleviate the prevalence of poverty in the population, which had comparatively high-fat contents, is noted as an explanation of this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Duster |first=Troy |date=2015 |title=A post-genomic surprise.

In that way there is a distinct statistical correlation between gene frequencies and racial categories. However, because all populations are genetically diverse, and because there is a complex relation between ancestry, genetic makeup and phenotype, and because racial categories are based on subjective evaluations of the traits, there is no specific gene that can be used to determine a person's race.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"ambiguous\" /><ref name=JW2004/>\n\nSome genetic variants that contribute to the risk of complex diseases are differently distributed among human populations.

Resultantly, different polypeptide proteins are coded. . Some mutations may be positive and can help the individual survive more effectively in their environment. Variation is counteracted by [[natural selection]] and by [[genetic drift]]; note too the [[founder effect]], when a small number of initial founders establish a population which hence starts with a correspondingly small degree of genetic variation. [[Epigenetic inheritance]] involves [[Heredity|heritable]] changes in [[phenotype]] (appearance) or [[gene expression]] caused by mechanisms other than changes in the DNA sequence.\n\nHuman phenotypes are highly [[polygenic]] (dependent on interaction by many genes) and are influenced by environment as well as by genetics.\n\n[[Nucleotide diversity]] is based on single mutations, [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs). The nucleotide diversity between humans is about 0.1 percent (one difference per one thousand [[nucleotide]]s between two humans chosen at random). This amounts to approximately three million SNPs (since the human genome has about three billion nucleotides). There are an estimated ten million SNPs in the human population.\n\nResearch has shown that non-SNP ([[structural variation|structural]]) variation accounts for more human genetic variation than single nucleotide diversity. Structural variation includes [[copy-number variation]] and results from [[Deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[Chromosomal inversion|inversions]], [[Genetic insertion|insertions]] and [[Gene duplication|duplications]]. It is estimated that approximately 0.4 percent of the genomes of unrelated people differ, apart from copy number. When copy-number variation is included, human-to-human genetic variation is estimated to be at least 0.5 percent.\n\n=={{anchor|Methods in human ancestry and population genetic structure research}}Research methods==\n\n==={{anchor|Visible traits, proteins, and genes studied}}Trait, protein and gene studies===\n{{See also|Race (classification of human beings)}}\nEarly racial classification attempts measured [[anthropometry|surface traits]], particularly skin color, hair color and texture, eye color, and head size and shape.

Eastern Europeans and Russians had a higher incidence of group B; people from India had the greatest incidence. The Herschfelds concluded that humans comprised two \"biochemical races\", originating separately. It was hypothesized that these two races later mixed, resulting in the patterns of groups A and B. This was one of the first theories of racial differences to include the idea that human variation did not correlate with genetic variation. It was expected that groups with similar proportions of blood groups would be more closely related, but instead it was often found that groups separated by great distances (such as those from Madagascar and Russia), had similar incidences.<ref name=\"bryansykes\">{{cite book |author=Sykes, Bryan |chapter=From Blood Groups to Genes |title=The seven daughters of Eve |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2001 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sevendaughtersof00syke/page/32 32]\u201351 |isbn=978-0-393-02018-2 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sevendaughtersof00syke }}</ref> It was later discovered that the [[ABO blood group system]] is not just common to humans, but shared with other primates,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular biology and evolution of blood group and MHC antigens in primates|last2=Klein|first2=Jan|last3=Socha|first3=Wladyslaw W.|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-59086-3|last1=Blancher|first1=Antoine}}</ref> and likely predates all human groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last2=Thompson|first2=Emma E.|last3=Flutre|first3=Timoth\u00e9e|last4=Lovstad|first4=Jessica|last5=Venkat|first5=Aarti|last6=Margulis|first6=Susan W.|last7=Moyse|first7=Jill|last8=Ross|first8=Steve|last9=Gamble|first9=Kathryn|date=2012-11-06|title=The ABO blood group is a trans-species polymorphism in primates|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=109|issue=45|pages=18493\u201318498|doi=10.1073/pnas.1210603109|issn=0027-8424|pmid=23091028|last1=S\u00e9gurel|first1=Laure|last10=Sella|first10=Guy|last11=Ober|first11=Carole|last12=Przeworski|first12=Molly|pmc=3494955|arxiv=1208.4613|bibcode=2012PNAS..10918493S}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Population genetic structure and genetic distance}}Population genetics===\nResearchers currently use [[genetic testing]], which may involve hundreds (or thousands) of [[genetic marker]]s or the entire genome.\n\n===={{anchor|Population genetic structure}}Structure====\n[[File:Principle component analysis of Levantine populations.png|thumb|Principal component analysis of fifty populations, color-coded by region, illustrates the differentiation and overlap of populations found using this method of analysis.]]\nSeveral methods to examine and quantify genetic subgroups exist, including [[cluster analysis|cluster]] and [[principal components analysis]].

In fact, the formulas derived in Harpending's paper in the 'Kinship in a subdivided population' section imply that two unrelated individuals of the same race have a higher coefficient of kinship (0.125) than an individual and their mixed race half-sibling (0.109).<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1023/A:1020815420693\n| volume = 24\n| issue = 2\n| pages = 141\u2013147\n| last = Harpending | first = Henry\n| title = Kinship and Population Subdivision\n| journal = [[Population & Environment]]\n| date = 2002-11-01\n| jstor = 27503827\n| url = http://www.humanbiologicaldiversity.com/articles/Harpending,%20Henry.%20%22Kinship%20and%20Population%20Subdivision.%22%20Population%20and%20Environment%2024,%20no.%202%20(2002).pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Historic and geographic analysis of ancestry}}History and geography===\n[[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] has described two methods of ancestry analysis.<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\">Genes, peoples, and languages, Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 1997, vol.94, pp.7719\u20137724, doi=10.1073/pnas.94.15.7719  http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/94/15/7719</ref> Current-population genetic structure does not imply that differing clusters or components indicate only one ancestral home per group; for example, a genetic cluster in the US comprises Hispanics with European, Native American and African ancestry.<ref name=Tang2005/>\n\nGeographic analyses attempt to identify places of origin, their relative importance and possible causes of genetic variation in an area. The results can be presented as maps showing genetic variation. Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues argue that if genetic variations are investigated, they often correspond to population migrations due to new sources of food, improved transportation or shifts in political power. For example, in Europe the most significant direction of genetic variation corresponds to the spread of agriculture from the Middle East to Europe between 10,000 and 6,000 years ago.<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\"/> Such geographic analysis works best in the absence of recent large-scale, rapid migrations.\n\nHistoric analyses use differences in genetic variation (measured by genetic distance) as a [[molecular clock]] indicating the evolutionary relation of species or groups, and can be used to create [[evolutionary tree]]s reconstructing population separations.<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Validating the genetic ancestry research}}Validation===\nResults of genetic-ancestry research are supported if they agree with research results from other fields, such as [[linguistics]] or [[archeology]].<ref name=\"Cavalli-Sforza1997\"/> Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues have argued that there is a correspondence between [[language families]] found in linguistic research and the population tree they found in their 1994 study.

Exceptions to this rule are [[Sami people|Sami]], who are genetically associated with populations speaking languages from other language families.

Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.\" </blockquote>They also wrote, regarding a model with five clusters corresponding to Africa, Eurasia (Europe, Middle East, and Central/South Asia), East Asia, Oceania, and the Americas: \"For population pairs from the same cluster, as geographic distance increases, genetic distance increases in a linear manner, consistent with a clinal population structure. However, for pairs from different clusters, genetic distance is generally larger than that between intracluster pairs that have the same geographic distance. For example, genetic distances for population pairs with one population in Eurasia and the other in East Asia are greater than those for pairs at equivalent geographic distance within Eurasia or within East Asia. Loosely speaking, it is these small discontinuous jumps in genetic distance\u2014across [[ocean]]s, the [[Himalaya]]s, and the [[Sahara]]\u2014that provide the basis for the ability of STRUCTURE to identify clusters that correspond to geographic regions\".<ref name=\"Rosenberg2005\" /> This applies to populations in their ancestral homes when migrations and gene flow were slow; large, rapid migrations exhibit different characteristics. Tang and colleagues (2004) wrote, \"we detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity\u2014as opposed to current residence\u2014is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population\".<ref name=\"Tang2005\" />\n\n=== Number of clusters ===\n{{See also|Human genetic clustering}}\n[[File:Rosenberg2007.png|thumb|right|150px|Gene clusters from Rosenberg (2006) for K=7 clusters.

The Kalash did not fit into the general pattern for it had been a genetically isolated population that happened to be reflected in this study. Potentially numerous genetically drifted groups, such as the [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]] [[Sentinelese]], are not represented in the study.\n\n=== Utility ===\nIt has been argued that knowledge of a person's race is limited in value, since people of the same race vary from one another.<ref name=JW2004/> [[David J. Witherspoon]] and colleagues have argued that when individuals are assigned to population groups, two randomly chosen individuals from different populations can resemble each other more than a randomly chosen member of their own group. They found that many thousands of genetic markers had to be used for the answer to \"How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?\" to be \"never\". This assumed three population groups, separated by large geographic distances (European, African and East Asian). The global human population is more complex, and studying a large number of groups would require an increased number of markers for the same answer. They conclude that \"caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes\",<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Witherspoon DJ, Wooding S, Rogers AR, etal |title=Genetic Similarities Within and Between Human Populations |journal=Genetics |volume=176 |issue=1 |pages=351\u20139 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17339205 |pmc=1893020 |doi=10.1534/genetics.106.067355}}</ref> and \"The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them.

Sauer said, \"the successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed 'racial' category. A specimen may display features that point to African ancestry. In this country that person is likely to have been labeled Black regardless of whether or not such a race actually exists in nature\".<ref name=\"Sauer 1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Sauer|first1=NJ|title=Forensic anthropology and the concept of race: if races don't exist, why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them?|journal=Social Science & Medicine|date=January 1992|volume=34|issue=2|pages=107\u201311|pmid=1738862|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(92)90086-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Ancestry Informative Markers ===\n[[Ancestry-informative marker|Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs)]] is a genealogy tracing technology that has come under much criticism due to its reliance on reference populations. In a 2015 article, Troy Duster outlines how contemporary technology allows the tracing of ancestral lineage but along only the lines of one maternal and one paternal line. That is, of 64 total great-great-great-great-grandparents, only one from each parent is identified, implying the other 62 ancestors are ignored in tracing efforts.<ref name=\"Duster 1\u201327\">{{Cite journal|last=Duster|first=Troy|date=March 2015|title=A post-genomic surprise.

In other words, using populations who currently reside in given places as references for certain races and ethnic groups is unreliable due to the demographic changes which have occurred over many centuries in those places. \nFurthermore, ancestry-informative markers being widely shared among the whole human population, it is their frequency which is tested, not their mere absence/presence. A threshold of relative frequency has, therefore, to be set. According to Duster the criteria for setting such thresholds are a trade secret of the companies marketing the tests. Thus, we cannot say anything conclusive on whether they are appropriate. \nResults of AIMs are extremely sensitive to where this bar is set.<ref>Fullwiley, D. (2008). The Biologistical Construction of Race: `Admixture\u2019 Technology and the New Genetic Medicine. Social Studies of Science, 38(5), 695\u2013735. https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312708090796\n</ref> Given that many genetic traits are found very similar amid many different populations, the rate of frequency which is taken to be enough for being part of a reference population is very important. This can also lead to mistakes, given that many populations may share the same patterns, if not exactly the same genes. \"This means that someone from Bulgaria whose ancestors go back to the fifteenth century could (and sometime does) map as partly \u2018Native American\u2019\".<ref name=\"Duster 1\u201327\"/> This happens because AIMs  rely on a '100% purity' assumption of reference populations. That is, they assume that a pattern of traits would ideally be necessary and sufficient condition for assigning an individual to an ancestral reference populations.\n\n==Race and medicine==\n{{Main|Race and health}}\nThere are certain statistical differences between racial groups in susceptibility to certain diseases.<ref name=Gitschier2005>{{cite journal |author=Risch N |title=The whole side of it--an interview with Neil Risch by Jane Gitschier |journal=PLOS Genetics |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=e14 |date=July 2005 |pmid=17411332 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010014 |pmc=1183530}}</ref> Genes change in response to local diseases; for example, people who are [[Duffy antigen system|Duffy-negative]] tend to have a higher resistance to malaria.

They summarise evidence of the link between racial discrimination and health outcomes due to poorer food quality, access to healthcare, housing conditions, education, access to information, exposure to infectious agents and toxic substances, and material scarcity. They also cite evidence that this process can work positively \u2013 for example, the psychological advantage of perceiving oneself at the top of a social hierarchy is linked to improved health. However they caution that the effects of discrimination do not offer a complete explanation for differential rates of disease and risk factors between racial groups, and the employment of self-identified race has the potential to reinforce racial inequalities.\n\n== Objections to racial naturalism ==\nRacial naturalism is the view that racial classifications are grounded in objective patterns of genetic similarities and differences. Proponents of this view have justified it using the scientific evidence described above. However, this view is controversial and philosophers of race have put forward four main objections to it.\n\nSemantic objections, such as the discreteness objection, argue that the human populations picked out in population-genetic research are not races and do not correspond to what \"race\" means in the United States. \"The discreteness objection does not require there to be no genetic admixture in the human species in order for there to be US 'racial groups' ... rather ... what the objection claims is that membership in US racial groups is different from membership in continental populations. ... Thus, strictly speaking, Blacks are not identical to Africans, Whites are not identical to Eurasians, Asians are not identical to East Asians and so forth.\"<ref name=spencer>{{cite journal |last1=Spencer |first1=Quayshawn |title=Philosophy of race meets population genetics |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |date=2015 |volume=52 |pages=49|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.04.003 |pmid=25963045 }}</ref> Therefore, it could be argued that scientific research is not really about race.\n\nThe next two objections, are metaphysical objections which argue that even if the semantic objections fail, human genetic clustering results do not support the biological reality of race. The 'very important objection' stipulates that races in the US definition fail to be important to biology, in the sense that continental populations do not form biological subspecies. The 'objectively real objection' states that \"US racial groups are not biologically real because they are not objectively real in the sense of existing independently of human interest, belief, or some other mental state of humans.\"<ref >{{cite journal |last1=Spencer |first1=Quayshawn |title=Philosophy of race meets population genetics |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |date=2015 |volume=52 |pages=51|doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2015.04.003 |pmid=25963045 }}</ref> Racial naturalists, such as [[Quayshawn Spencer]], have responded to each of these objections with counter-arguments.

Philosophers such as Joshua Glasgow and [[Naomi Zack]] believe that US racial groups cannot be defined by visible traits, such as skin colour and physical attributes: \"The ancestral genetic tracking material has no effect on phenotypes, or biological traits of organisms, which would include the traits deemed racial, because the ancestral tracking genetic material plays no role in the production of proteindit is not the kind of material that 'codes' for protein production.\"<ref name=\"zach\">{{cite journal |last1=Zach |first1=Naomi |title=Philosophy of Science and Race |journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies |date=2002 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=656\u2013658|doi=10.2307/3559445 |jstor=3559445}}</ref> Spencer contends that certain racial discourses require visible groups, but disagrees that this is a requirement in all US racial discourse.\n\nA different objection states that US racial groups are not biologically real because they are not objectively real in the sense of existing independently of some mental state of humans.

Spencer states that in order to accurately capture real biological entities, social factors must also be considered.\n\n=== Criticism of race-based medicines ===\n[[Troy Duster]] points out that genetics is often not the predominant determinant of disease susceptibilities, even though they might correlate with specific socially defined categories. This is because this research oftentimes lacks control for a multiplicity of socio-economic factors. He cites data collected by King and Rewers that indicates how dietary differences play a significant role in explaining variations of diabetes prevalence between populations.\n\nDuster elaborates by putting forward the example of [[Pima people|the Pima]] of [[Arizona]], a population suffering from disproportionately high rates of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]]. The reason for such, he argues, was not necessarily a result of the prevalence of the [[FABP2]] gene, which is associated with [[insulin resistance]]. Rather he argues that scientists often discount the lifestyle implications under specific socio-historical contexts. For instance, near the end of the 19th century, the Pima economy was predominantly agriculture-based. However, as the European American population settles into traditionally Pima territory, the Pima lifestyles became heavily Westernised. Within three decades, the incidence of diabetes increased multiple folds. Governmental provision of free food to alleviate the prevalence of poverty in the population, which had comparatively high-fat contents, is noted as an explanation of this phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Duster |first=Troy |date=2015 |title=A post-genomic surprise.
