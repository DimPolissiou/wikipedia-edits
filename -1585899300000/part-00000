{"title_page": "Dippy (London)", "text_new": "[[File:Diplodocus (replica).001 - London.JPG|thumb|280px|Dippy in the Hintze Hall at the Natural History Museum in 2008]]\n\nThe '''London cast of Dippy''' is a [[plaster cast]] replica of the fossilised bones of a ''[[Diplodocus carnegii]]'' skeleton, [[Dippy|the original of which \u2013 also known as Dippy]] \u2013 is on display at [[Pittsburgh]]'s [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]].  The {{convert|21.3|m|ft|sing=on}} long cast was displayed between 1905 and 2017 in the [[Natural History Museum]] in London, becoming an iconic representation of the museum. It began a national tour of British museums in February 2018.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Dippy}}\nThe genus ''[[Diplodocus]]'' was first described in 1878 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]].  The fossilised skeleton from which Dippy was cast was discovered in Wyoming in 1898, and acquired by the Scottish-American industrialist [[Andrew Carnegie]] for his newly-founded [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] in [[Pittsburgh]].  The bones were soon recognised as a new species, and named ''Diplodocus carnegii''.\n\nKing [[Edward VII]], then a keen trustee of the [[British Museum]], saw a sketch of the bones at Carnegie's Scottish home, [[Skibo Castle]], in 1902, and Carnegie agreed to donate a cast to the Natural History Museum as a gift.  Carnegie paid \u00a32,000 for the casting in [[plaster of paris]], copying the original fossil bones held by the Carnegie Museum (not mounted until 1907, as a new museum building was still being constructed to house it).\n\n==Natural History Museum==\n[[File:Large holland diplodocus.jpg|thumb|Unveiling ceremony at the Reptile Gallery of the Natural History Museum in 1905]]\n[[File:A Short History of the World, p0047.jpg|thumb|1922 illustration, with trailing tail]]\n===Early history===\nThe 292 cast pieces of the skeleton <!--another source says 324 bones from three specimens--> were sent to London in 36 crates, and the {{convert|21.3|m|}} long exhibit was unveiled on 12 May 1905, to great public and media interest, with speeches from the museum director Professor [[Ray Lankester]], Andrew Carnegie, [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Lord Avebury]] on behalf of the trustees, the director of the Carnegie Museum [[William Jacob Holland]], and finally the geologist Sir [[Archibald Geikie]].  \n\n===Reptile Gallery===\nThe cast was mounted in the museum's Reptile Gallery to the left of the main hall (now the gallery of Human Biology) as it was too large to display in the Fossil Reptile Gallery (to the right of the main hall; now the gallery of Creepy Crawlies).  \n\nCarnegie paid to have additional casts made for display in many European capitals \u2013 including Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Bologna, St Petersburg and Madrid; one sent to Munich was never erected \u2013 as well as Mexico City and La Plata in Argentina, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The cast in London quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]''.  \n\nDippy was taken to pieces and stored in the museum's basement during the Second World War to protect it from [[the Blitz|bomb damage]], and reinstalled in the Reptile Gallery after the war.  The original presentation of the cast was altered several times to reflect changes in scientific opinion on the animal's stance.  The head and neck were originally posed in a downwards position, and were later moved to a more horizontal position in the 1960s.\n\n===Move to Hintze Hall===\nDippy was removed from the Reptile Gallery in 1979 and repositioned as the centrepiece of the main central hall of the museum, later renamed the Hintze Hall in recognition of a large donation by [[Michael Hintze]].  Dippy replaced a mounted [[African elephant]], nicknamed George, which had been on display as the central exhibit in the main hall since 1907, with various other animal specimens.  The elephant had itself replaced the skeleton of a [[sperm whale]] which was the first significant exhibit in the hall and had been on display since at least 1895: earlier, the hall had been left largely empty.\n\nDippy was originally displayed alongside a cast of a ''[[Triceratops]]'' skeleton, which was removed around 1993.  The tail of the Diplodocus cast was also lifted to waft over the heads of visitors; originally it drooped to trail along the floor.\n\nAfter 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the skeleton of a young [[blue whale]], {{convert|25|m}} long, dubbed \"Hope\", suspended from the [[Ceilings of the Natural History Museum, London|ceiling]].  The whale had been [[whale stranding|stranded]] on sandbanks at the mouth of [[Wexford Harbour]], Ireland in March 1891.  Its skeleton was acquired by the museum and had been displayed in the Large Mammals Hall (originally the New Whale Hall) since 1934.\n\n==Removal and tour==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = <center>Dippy on Tour</center>\n | header_align = center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Dippy the Diplodocus carnegii on tour at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in 2018.jpg\n | width1    = 138\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Dippy at [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] in May 2018\n | image2    = Dippy the dinosaur (Cardiff) geograph-6361981-by-Philip-Halling (cropped).jpg\n | width2    = 211\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Dippy at the [[National Museum Cardiff]] in January 2020\n}}\n\nThe work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with the whale skeleton was documented in a [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] Television special, ''[[Horizon (UK TV series)|Horizon]]: Dippy and the Whale'', narrated by [[David Attenborough]], which was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 13 July 2017, the day before the whale skeleton was unveiled for public display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Dippy_and_the_Whale|title=Dippy and the Whale|publisher=DocuWiki|date=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nDippy started a tour of British museums in February 2018, mounted on a new and more mobile armature.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/01/dippy-diplodocus-london-tour-replica-dinosaur-whale-natural-history-museum |title=Dippy\u2019s last days: diplodocus leaves London after 112 years for farewell UK tour |first=Tracy |last=McVeigh |work=The Observer |date= 1 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"telegraph 2017\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/04/dippy-diplodocus-bids-farewell-public-natural-history-museum/ |title=Dippy the Diplodocus bids farewell to his public at the Natural History Museum |first=George|last= Fuller|date=4 January 2017 |work=The Daily Telegraph }}</ref> Dippy is and has been on display at locations around the United Kingdom:<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/15/dinosaur-on-tour-host-venues-for-dippy-the-diplodocus-announced-natural-history-museum Dinosaur on tour: host venues for Dippy the diplodocus announced ], The Guardian, 15 November 2016</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Dippy on Tour: A Natural History Adventure {{!}} Natural History Museum |url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/take-part/dippy-on-tour.html |website=www.nhm.ac.uk |accessdate=17 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Dorset County Museum]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] (10 February \u2013 7 May 2018)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dorsetcountymuseum.org/dcm/events/list/65/dippy-on-tour/ | title=Dorset County Museum}}</ref>\n*[[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] (26 May \u2013 9 September 2018)<ref>{{cite web|title=Dippy on Tour: A Natural History Adventure|url=http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/bmag/whats-on/dippy-on-tour-a-natural-history-adventure|website=www.birminghammuseums.org.uk|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Ulster Museum]], [[Belfast]] (17 September 2018 \u2013 6 January 2019)<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/dippy-the-dinosaur-begins-epic-journey-to-belfast-36585527.html | title='Dippy' the Dinosaur begins epic journey to Belfast| newspaper=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n*[[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], [[Glasgow]] (22 January \u2013 6 May 2019)\n*[[Great North Museum]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] (18 May \u2013 6 October 2019)\n*[[National Museum Cardiff]] (19 October 2019 \u2013 26 January 2020)\n*[[Number One Riverside]], [[Rochdale]] (10 February \u2013 28 June 2020)\n*[[Norwich Cathedral]] (11 July \u2013 31 October 2020)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Archie (squid)]]\n* [[Sophie the Stegosaurus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/diplodocus-this-is-your-life.html Diplodocus: this is your life], Natural History Museum\n* [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/national-impact/diplodocus-on-tour.html Dippy on Tour], Natural History Museum\n* [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/taking-dippy-down.html Taking Dippy down: the first steps], Natural History Museum\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/natural-history-museum-blue-whale-skeleton-hope-main-hintze-hall-dippy-the-diplodocus-a7840646.html Natural History Museum unveils 'Dippy' the Diplodocus replacement Hope the blue whale], ''The Independent'', 14 July 2017\n* [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gsPyr7N3nBwC ''Bone Wars: The Excavation and Celebrity of Andrew Carnegie's Dinosaur''], Tom Rea, pp. 1\u201311\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category inline|Dippy the Diplodocus (London cast)}}\n\n[[Category:Dinosaur sculptures]]\n[[Category:Natural History Museum, London]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Diplodocus (replica).001 -

RNA editing-dependent amino acid substitutions can produce missense mRNA's of which occur through hydrolytic deaminase reactions. Two of the most prevalent deaminase reactions occur through the Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme ([[APOBEC]]) and the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA enzyme ([[ADAR]]) which are responsible for the conversion of [[cytidine]] to [[uridine]] (C-to-U), and the deamination of [[adenosine]] to [[inosine]] (A-to-I), respectively. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meier JC, Kankowski S, Krestel H, Hetsch F | title = RNA Editing-Systemic Relevance and Clue to Disease Mechanisms? | language = English | journal = Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | volume = 9 | pages = 124 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27932948 | pmc = 5120146 | doi = 10.3389/fnmol.2016.00124 }}</ref> Such selective substitutions of uridine for cytidine, and inosine for adenosine  in RNA editing can produce differential isoforms of missense mRNA transcripts, and confer transcriptome diversity and enhanced protein function in response to selective pressures. <ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yablonovitch AL, Deng P, Jacobson D, Li JB | title = The evolution and adaptation of A-to-I RNA editing | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = e1007064 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 29182635 | pmc = 5705066 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1007064 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nonsense mutation]]\n* [[Start codon]]\n* [[Stop codon]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:RNA]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n\n{{molecular-cell-biology-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Manudouz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding wikilinks.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missense_mRNA"}
