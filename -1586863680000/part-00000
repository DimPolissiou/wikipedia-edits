''[[Screen Daily]]'', 10 September 2019.</ref> It was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nGoreng awakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them, and they cannot hoard food (the cell is heated or cooled to fatal levels if food is kept). Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife called the Samurai Plus. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng sees her being attacked by the two people on the level below, and he considers jumping down to help her, but she kills them both and rides the platform down again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the \"Vertical Self-Management Center\" in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the month, they become friendly, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both, but only in moderate amounts so he doesn't bleed out. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down.\n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but she appears critically injured, presumably from being in a fight on the higher levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child, but Imoguiri says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and says Miharu entered alone. \n\nGoreng awakens to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a standoff, as Miharu has eaten Imoguiri's dog.  Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He then awakens the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up through the upper level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on the level above first help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back down. Estimating that there are around 250 levels, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food so all get a share, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but she is killed, and both men are injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child hiding under the bed, and assumes it is Miharu's son. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. They then discover the child is actually a girl, who turns out to be Miharu's  daughter. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the Administrators at the top. \n\nGoreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported upwards.\n\n== Cast==\n[[File:El hoyo prentsaurrekoa rueda de prensa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew members at a press conference in October 2019.]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]'', which means \"fried\" in Malay/Indonesian.\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]'', a royal graveyard in Indonesia. \n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]'', a spice blend used in Turkish and Greek cuisine.\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

''[[Screen Daily]]'', 10 September 2019.</ref> It was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nGoreng awakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them, and they cannot hoard food (the cell is heated or cooled to fatal levels if food is kept). Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife called the Samurai Plus. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng sees her being attacked by the two people on the level below, and he considers jumping down to help her, but she kills them both and rides the platform down again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the \"Vertical Self-Management Center\" in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the month, they become friendly, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both, but only in moderate amounts so he doesn't bleed out. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down.\n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but she appears critically injured, presumably from being in a fight on the higher levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child, but Imoguiri says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and says Miharu entered alone. \n\nGoreng awakens to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a standoff, as Miharu has eaten Imoguiri's dog.  Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. He then awakens the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up through the upper level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on the level above first help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back down. Estimating that there are around 250 levels, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food so all get a share, and convinces Baharat to go with him.\n\nAs they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but she is killed, and both men are injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child hiding under the bed, and assumes it is Miharu's son. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. They then discover the child is actually a girl, who turns out to be Miharu's  daughter. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the Administrators at the top. \n\nGoreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported upwards.\n\n== Cast==\n[[File:El hoyo prentsaurrekoa rueda de prensa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew members at a press conference in October 2019.]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]'', which means \"fried\" in Malay/Indonesian.\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]'', a royal graveyard in Indonesia. \n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]'', a spice blend used in Turkish and Greek cuisine.\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

It also set the precedent that religious law, such as sharia, can overlap and supersede [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil laws]], that elected legislators may not revise or enact laws that supersede religious laws, that people of one nation need not live under the same laws, and that law enforcement process for different individuals shall depend on their religion.{{sfn|Smith|2011}}{{sfn|Larson|2001}} The Indian Muslim Personal Law ([[Sharia]]t) Application Act of 1937 continues to be the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}<ref>Chandra Mallampalli, Christians and Public Life in Colonial India: Contending with Marginality (London, 2004)</ref>\n\n==Current status==\nThe 7th schedule of Indian constitution places religious institutions, charities and trusts into so-called Concurrent List, which means that both the central government of India, and various state governments in India can make their own laws about religious institutions, charities and trusts.

Pacific Affairs, 56(2), 232-246</ref> Indian law also allows Islamic religious schools to receive partial financial support from state and central government of India, to offer religious indoctrination, if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race or other grounds. Educational institutions wholly owned and operated by government may not impart religious indoctrination, but religious sects and endowments may open their own school, impart religious indoctrination and have a right to partial state financial assistance.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}\n\nIn matters of personal law, such as acceptable age of marriage for girls, female circumcision, polygamy, divorce and inheritance, Indian law permits each religious group to implement their religious law if the religion so dictates, otherwise the state laws apply. In terms of religions of India with significant populations, only Islam has religious laws in form of sharia which India allows as Muslim Personal Law.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSecularism in India, thus, does not mean the separation of religion from state. Instead, secularism in India means a state that supports or participates in a neutral manner in the affairs of all religious groups. Religious laws in personal domain, particularly for Muslim Indians, supersede parliamentary laws in India; and currently, in some situations such as religious indoctrination schools the state partially finances certain religious schools. These differences have led a number of scholars<ref name=ddace/><ref name=madan>Madan, T. N.

The attempt to have a Uniform Civil Code has long been discussed as a means to realize a secular Indian state.<ref name=ddace/><ref name=madan/> The overlap between religion and state has created tension between supporters of Indian form of secularism and the supporters of Hindu nationalism.

Everyone is equal under law, and subject to the same laws irrespective of his or her religion, in the West.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=3-8}}\n\nIn contrast, in India, the word secular does not mean a \"thorough-going separation of religion and state\" states Donald Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013128}} However, some separation exists. According to the Constitution of India, states Smith, there is no official state religion in India, schools that are wholly owned by the state can not mandate religious instruction (Article 28), and there can be no taxes to support any particular religion (Article 27).{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013132}} Overlap is permitted, whereby institutions that are not entirely financed by the state can mandate religious instruction, and state can provide financial aid to maintain and construct religious buildings or infrastructure.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013133}} Furthermore, India's constitutional framework allows \"extensive state interference in religious affairs\".{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nAccording to R.A.

The Indian structure has created incentives for various religious denominations to start and maintain schools, impart religious education, and receive partial but significant financial support from the Indian government. Similarly, the Indian government has established statutory institutions to regulate and financially administer the Islamic [[Central Wakf Council]], historic [[Hindu temple]]s, Buddhist monasteries, and certain Christian religious institutions; this direct Indian government involvement in various religions is markedly different from Western secularism.<ref name=ddace>DD Acevedo (2013), Secularism in the Indian Context, Law & Social Inquiry, Volume 38, Issue 1, pp 138\u2013167, {{doi|10.1111/j.1747-4469.2012.01304.x}}</ref><ref>Gary Jacobsohn, The Wheel of Law: India\u2019s Secularism in Comparative Constitutional Context, Princeton University Press, 2005</ref> According to Ashis Nandy, a better term for \"Indian secularism\" would be \"religious tolerance\", rather than importing and redefining the Western concept of secularism.<ref>Nandy A, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-billion-gandhis/224252 A Billion Gandhis], Outlook India, 21 June 2004</ref>\n\n==Issues==\nIndian concept of secularism, where religious laws supersede state laws and the state is expected to even-handedly involve itself in religion, is a controversial subject.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}<ref name=\"duncan\">Craig Duncan, [http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/cduncan/340/shahbano.doc Shah Bano: The Dilemma of Religious Liberty and Sex Equality], Cornell University, Ithaca, 2009</ref><ref name=madan/> Any attempts and demand by the Indian populace to a uniform civil code is considered a threat to right to religious personal laws by Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}<ref name=intoday/>\n\n===Shah Bano case===\n{{Main|Mohd.

Shah Bano sued for regular maintenance payments under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1978.<ref name=mansfield/>  Shah Bano won her case, as well appeals to the highest court. Along with alimony, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India wrote in his opinion just how unfairly Islamic personal laws treated women and thus how necessary it was for the nation to adopt a Uniform Civil Code. The Chief Justice further ruled that no authoritative text of Islam forbade the payment of regular maintenance to ex-wives.<ref name=duncan/><ref name=\"jenkins\">Laura Jenkins, [http://homepages.uc.edu/thro/shahbano/allshahbano.htm Shah Bano: Muslim Women\u2019s Rights], University of Cincinnati, Ohio (2000)</ref>\n\nThe Shah Bano ruling immediately triggered a controversy and mass demonstrations by Muslim men.

Indian Muslims consider the new 1986 law, which selectively exempts them from maintenance payment to ex-wife because of their religion, as secular because it respects Muslim men's religious rights and recognises that they are culturally different from Indian men and women of other religions.

The idea here in its weaker publicly reiterated form was that the government would not interfere in 'personal' religious matters and would create circumstances in which people of all religions could live in harmony. The idea in its stronger, unofficially stated form was that in order to modernise, India would have to set aside centuries of traditional religious ignorance and superstition and eventually eliminate Hinduism and Islam from people's lives altogether.

The second view insists that the state must not have any relation at all with any religion\", quotes Minhaz Merchant.<ref name=mm2013/> In both interpretations, secularism goes against giving any religion a privileged position in the activities of the state. Sen argues that the first form is more suited to India, where there is no demand that the state stay clear of any association with any religious matter whatsoever. Rather what is needed is to make sure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment.<ref name=mm2013/> Sen does not claim that modern India is symmetric in its treatment or offer any views of whether acceptance of [[sharia]] in matters such as child marriage is equivalent to having a neutral attitude towards a religion.

One such law enacted during the colonial era was the 1937 Indian Muslim Personal Law ([[Sharia]]t) Application Act, which instead of separating state and religion for Western secularism, did the reverse.{{sfn|Smith|2011}}\n\nIt, along with additional laws such as Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act of 1939 that followed, established the principle that religious laws of Indian Muslims can be their personal laws. It also set the precedent that religious law, such as sharia, can overlap and supersede [[common law|common]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil laws]], that elected legislators may not revise or enact laws that supersede religious laws, that people of one nation need not live under the same laws, and that law enforcement process for different individuals shall depend on their religion.{{sfn|Smith|2011}}{{sfn|Larson|2001}} The Indian Muslim Personal Law ([[Sharia]]t) Application Act of 1937 continues to be the law of land of modern India for Indian Muslims, while parliament-based, non-religious uniform civil code passed in mid-1950s applies to Indians who are Hindus (which includes Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Parsees), as well as to Indian Christians and Jews.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}<ref>Chandra Mallampalli, Christians and Public Life in Colonial India: Contending with Marginality (London, 2004)</ref>\n\n==Current status==\nThe 7th schedule of Indian constitution places religious institutions, charities and trusts into so-called Concurrent List, which means that both the central government of India, and various state governments in India can make their own laws about religious institutions, charities and trusts.

This principle of overlap, rather than separation of religion and state in India was further recognised in a series of constitutional amendments starting with Article 290 in 1956, to the addition of word \u2018secular\u2019 to the Preamble of Indian Constitution in 1975.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}\n\n[[File:Manmohan Singh at the inauguration of the newly established National Waqf Development Corporation (NAWADCO) Ltd., in New Delhi.

This state intervention while resonant with the dictates of each religion, are unequal and conflicting. For example, a 1951 Religious and Charitable Endowment Indian law allows state governments to forcibly take over, own and operate Hindu temples,<ref>KN Kumari (1998), History of the Hindu Religious Endowments in Andhra Pradesh, Northern Books, {{ISBN|978-8172110857}}</ref> and collect revenue from offerings and redistribute that revenue to any non-temple purposes including maintenance of religious institutions opposed to the temple;<ref>Presler, F. A. (1983). The structure and consequences of temple policy in Tamil Nadu, 1967-81. Pacific Affairs, 56(2), 232-246</ref> Indian law also allows Islamic religious schools to receive partial financial support from state and central government of India, to offer religious indoctrination, if the school agrees that the student has an option to opt out from religious indoctrination if he or she so asks, and that the school will not discriminate any student based on religion, race or other grounds. Educational institutions wholly owned and operated by government may not impart religious indoctrination, but religious sects and endowments may open their own school, impart religious indoctrination and have a right to partial state financial assistance.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}\n\nIn matters of personal law, such as acceptable age of marriage for girls, female circumcision, polygamy, divorce and inheritance, Indian law permits each religious group to implement their religious law if the religion so dictates, otherwise the state laws apply. In terms of religions of India with significant populations, only Islam has religious laws in form of sharia which India allows as Muslim Personal Law.<ref name=jenkins/>\n\nSecularism in India, thus, does not mean the separation of religion from state. Instead, secularism in India means a state that supports or participates in a neutral manner in the affairs of all religious groups. Religious laws in personal domain, particularly for Muslim Indians, supersede parliamentary laws in India; and currently, in some situations such as religious indoctrination schools the state partially finances certain religious schools.

Everyone is equal under law, and subject to the same laws irrespective of his or her religion, in the West.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=3-8}}\n\nIn contrast, in India, the word secular does not mean a \"thorough-going separation of religion and state\" states Donald Smith.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013128}} However, some separation exists. According to the Constitution of India, states Smith, there is no official state religion in India, schools that are wholly owned by the state can not mandate religious instruction (Article 28), and there can be no taxes to support any particular religion (Article 27).{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013132}} Overlap is permitted, whereby institutions that are not entirely financed by the state can mandate religious instruction, and state can provide financial aid to maintain and construct religious buildings or infrastructure.{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=126\u2013133}} Furthermore, India's constitutional framework allows \"extensive state interference in religious affairs\".{{sfn|Smith|2011|pp=133\u2013134}}\n\nAccording to R.A.

The Indian structure has created incentives for various religious denominations to start and maintain schools, impart religious education, and receive partial but significant financial support from the Indian government. Similarly, the Indian government has established statutory institutions to regulate and financially administer the Islamic [[Central Wakf Council]], historic [[Hindu temple]]s, Buddhist monasteries, and certain Christian religious institutions; this direct Indian government involvement in various religions is markedly different from Western secularism.<ref name=ddace>DD Acevedo (2013), Secularism in the Indian Context, Law & Social Inquiry, Volume 38, Issue 1, pp 138\u2013167, {{doi|10.1111/j.1747-4469.2012.01304.x}}</ref><ref>Gary Jacobsohn, The Wheel of Law: India\u2019s Secularism in Comparative Constitutional Context, Princeton University Press, 2005</ref> According to Ashis Nandy, a better term for \"Indian secularism\" would be \"religious tolerance\", rather than importing and redefining the Western concept of secularism.<ref>Nandy A, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/a-billion-gandhis/224252 A Billion Gandhis], Outlook India, 21 June 2004</ref>\n\n==Issues==\nIndian concept of secularism, where religious laws supersede state laws and the state is expected to even-handedly involve itself in religion, is a controversial subject.{{sfn|Larson|2001}}<ref name=\"duncan\">Craig Duncan, [http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/cduncan/340/shahbano.doc Shah Bano: The Dilemma of Religious Liberty and Sex Equality], Cornell University, Ithaca, 2009</ref><ref name=madan/> Any attempts and demand by the Indian populace to a uniform civil code is considered a threat to right to religious personal laws by Indian Muslims.{{sfn|Rajagopalan|2003}}<ref name=intoday/>\n\n===Shah Bano case===\n{{Main|Mohd.

The idea here in its weaker publicly reiterated form was that the government would not interfere in 'personal' religious matters and would create circumstances in which people of all religions could live in harmony. The idea in its stronger, unofficially stated form was that in order to modernise, India would have to set aside centuries of traditional religious ignorance and superstition and eventually eliminate Hinduism and Islam from people's lives altogether.

This, claims Sen, can be interpreted in at least two different ways: \"The first view argues the state be equidistant from all religions \u2013 refusing to take sides and having a neutral attitude towards them. The second view insists that the state must not have any relation at all with any religion\", quotes Minhaz Merchant.<ref name=mm2013/> In both interpretations, secularism goes against giving any religion a privileged position in the activities of the state. Sen argues that the first form is more suited to India, where there is no demand that the state stay clear of any association with any religious matter whatsoever. Rather what is needed is to make sure that in so far as the state has to deal with different religions and members of different religious communities, there must be a basic symmetry of treatment.<ref name=mm2013/> Sen does not claim that modern India is symmetric in its treatment or offer any views of whether acceptance of [[sharia]] in matters such as child marriage is equivalent to having a neutral attitude towards a religion.

{"title_page": "User interface", "text_new": "{{About||the boundary between computer systems|Interface (computing)|other uses|Interface (disambiguation){{!}}Interface}}\n[[Image:Reactable Multitouch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Reactable]], an example of a [[tangible user interface]]]]\n\nThe '''user interface''' ('''UI'''), in the [[industrial design]] field of [[human\u2013computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur. The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' [[decision-making]] process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer [[operating system]]s, hand [[tools]], [[heavy machinery]] operator controls, and [[Unit operation|process]] controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as [[ergonomics]] and [[psychology]].\n\nGenerally, the goal of [[user interface design]] is to produce a user interface which makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result. This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human.\n\nUser interfaces are composed of one or more layers including a '''human-machine interface''' ('''HMI''') that interfaces machines with physical input hardware such as keyboards, mice, game pads and output hardware such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers. A device that implements an HMI is called a [[human interface device]] (HID). Other terms for human-machine interfaces are '''man-machine interface''' ('''MMI''') and when the machine in question is a computer '''human-computer interface'''. Additional UI layers may interact with one or more human sense, including: tactile UI (touch), visual UI (sight), auditory UI (sound), olfactory UI (smell), equilibrial UI (balance), and gustatory UI (taste).\n\nComposite user interfaces (CUI) are UIs that interact with two or more senses. The most common CUI is a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which is composed of a tactile UI and a visual UI capable of displaying [[graphics]]. When sound is added to a GUI it becomes a multimedia user interface (MUI). There are three broad categories of CUI: ''standard'', ''virtual'' and ''augmented''. Standard composite user interfaces use standard human interface devices like keyboards, mice, and computer monitors. When the CUI blocks out the real world to create a [[virtual reality]], the CUI is virtual and uses a virtual reality interface. When the CUI does not block out the real world and creates [[augmented reality]], the CUI is augmented and uses an augmented reality interface. When a UI interacts with all human senses, it is called a qualia interface, named after the theory of [[qualia]]. CUI may also be classified by how many senses they interact with as either an X-sense virtual reality interface or X-sense augmented reality interface, where X is the number of senses interfaced with. For example, a [[Smell-O-Vision]] is a 3-sense (3S) Standard CUI with visual display, sound and smells; when ''virtual reality interfaces'' interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) virtual reality interface; and when ''augmented reality interfaces'' interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) augmented reality interface.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:XFCE-4.10-Desktop.png|thumb|right|A [[graphical user interface]] following the [[desktop metaphor]]]]\n\nThe user interface or ''human\u2013machine interface'' is the part of the machine that handles the human\u2013machine interaction. Membrane switches, rubber keypads and touchscreens are examples of the physical part of the Human Machine Interface which we can see and touch.\n\nIn complex systems, the human\u2013machine interface is typically computerized. The term ''human\u2013computer interface'' refers to this kind of system. In the context of computing, the term typically extends as well to the software dedicated to control the physical elements used for [[human-computer interaction]].\n\nThe engineering of human\u2013machine interfaces is enhanced by considering [[ergonomics]] ([[human factors]]). The corresponding disciplines are [[human factors engineering]] (HFE) and [[usability engineering]] (UE), which is part of [[systems engineering]].\n\nTools used for incorporating human factors in the interface design are developed based on knowledge of [[computer science]], such as [[computer graphics]], [[operating systems]], [[programming language]]s. Nowadays, we use the expression [[graphical user interface]] for human\u2013machine interface on computers, as nearly all of them are now using graphics.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Linux kernel INPUT OUPUT evdev gem USB framebuffer.svg|thumb|300px|A human\u2013machine interface usually involves [[peripheral|peripheral hardware]] for the INPUT and for the OUTPUT. Often, there is an additional component implemented in software, like e.g. a [[graphical user interface]].]]\n\nThere is a difference between a user interface and an operator interface or a human\u2013machine interface (HMI).\n\n* The term \"user interface\" is often used in the context of (personal) computer systems and [[electronics|electronic devices]].\n** Where a network of equipment or computers are interlinked through an MES (Manufacturing Execution System)-or Host to display information.\n** A human-machine interface (HMI) is typically local to one machine or piece of equipment, and is the interface method between the human and the equipment/machine. An operator interface is the interface method by which multiple pieces of equipment that are linked by a host control system are accessed or controlled.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}\n** The system may expose several user interfaces to serve different kinds of users. For example, a [[digital library|computerized library database]] might provide two user interfaces, one for library patrons (limited set of functions, optimized for ease of use) and the other for library personnel (wide set of functions, optimized for efficiency).{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}\n* The user interface of a [[Machine|mechanical]] system, a vehicle or an [[industry|industrial]] installation is sometimes referred to as the human\u2013machine interface (HMI).<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Griffin, Ben|author2=Baston, Laurel|title=Interfaces|page=5|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/CS/Interfaces2007_files/Interfaces2007.ppt|accessdate=7 June 2014|format=Presentation|quote=The user interface of a mechanical system, a vehicle or an industrial installation is sometimes referred to as the human-machine interface (HMI).|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160915/http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/CS/Interfaces2007_files/Interfaces2007.ppt|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref> HMI is a modification of the original term MMI (man-machine interface).<ref name=\"Nigeria\">{{cite journal|title=User Interface Design and Ergonomics|journal=Course Cit 811|page=19|url=http://www.nou.edu.ng/NOUN_OCL/pdf/SST/CIT%20811.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY|location=NATIONAL OPEN UNIVERSITY OF NIGERIA|quote=In practice, the abbreviation MMI is still frequently used although some may claim that MMI stands for something different now.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234100/http://www.nou.edu.ng/NOUN_OCL/pdf/SST/CIT%20811.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref> In practice, the abbreviation MMI is still frequently used<ref name=\"Nigeria\"/> although some may claim that MMI stands for something different now.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Another abbreviation is HCI, but is more commonly used for [[human\u2013computer interaction]].<ref name=\"Nigeria\"/> Other terms used are operator interface console (OIC) and operator interface terminal (OIT).<ref>{{cite book|title=Recent advances in business administration|date=2010|publisher=Wseas|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-960-474-161-8|page=190|chapter=Introduction Section|quote=Other terms used are operator interface console (OIC) and operator interface terminal (OIT)}}</ref> However it is abbreviated, the terms refer to the 'layer' that separates a human that is operating a machine from the machine itself.<ref name=\"Nigeria\"/> Without a clean and usable interface, humans would not be able to interact with information systems.\n\nIn [[science fiction]], HMI is sometimes used to refer to what is better described as a [[direct neural interface]].

User interfaces were rudimentary. Users had to accommodate computers rather than the other way around; user interfaces were considered overhead, and software was designed to keep the processor at maximum utilization with as little overhead as possible.\n\nThe input side of the user interfaces for batch machines was mainly [[punched card]]s or equivalent media like [[paper tape]]. The output side added [[line printer]]s to these media. With the limited exception of the system [[System console|operator's console]], human beings did not interact with batch machines in real time at all.\n\nSubmitting a job to a batch machine involved, first, preparing a deck of punched cards describing a program and a dataset. Punching the program cards wasn't done on the computer itself, but on [[keypunch]]es, specialized typewriter-like machines that were notoriously bulky, unforgiving, and prone to mechanical failure. The software interface was similarly unforgiving, with very strict syntaxes meant to be parsed by the smallest possible compilers and interpreters.\n\n[[File:Card puncher - NARA - 513295.jpg|left|thumb|Holes are punched in the card according to a prearranged code transferring the facts from the census questionnaire into [[statistics]]]]\nOnce the cards were punched, one would drop them in a job queue and wait. Eventually, operators would feed the deck to the computer, perhaps mounting [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tapes]] to supply another dataset or helper software. The job would generate a printout, containing final results or an abort notice with an attached error log. Successful runs might also write a result on magnetic tape or generate some data cards to be used in a later computation.\n\nThe [[turnaround time]] for a single job often spanned entire days. If one were very lucky, it might be hours; there was no real-time response. But there were worse fates than the card queue; some computers required an even more tedious and error-prone process of toggling in programs in binary code using console switches. The very earliest machines had to be partly rewired to incorporate program logic into themselves, using devices known as [[plugboard]]s.\n\nEarly batch systems gave the currently running job the entire computer; program decks and tapes had to include what we would now think of as [[operating system]] code to talk to I/O devices and do whatever other housekeeping was needed. Midway through the batch period, after 1957, various groups began to experiment with so-called \u201c[[Compile and go system|load-and-go]]\u201d systems. These used a [[Resident monitor|monitor program]] which was always resident on the computer. Programs could call the monitor for services. Another function of the monitor was to do better error checking on submitted jobs, catching errors earlier and more intelligently and generating more useful feedback to the users. Thus, monitors represented the first step towards both operating systems and explicitly designed user interfaces.\n\n===1969\u2013present: Command-line user interface===\n{{main|Command-line interface}}\n[[File:ASR-33 at CHM.agr.jpg|thumb|alt=Teletype Model 33|Teletype Model 33 ASR]]\n\n'''Command-line interfaces''' (CLIs) evolved from batch monitors connected to the system console. Their interaction model was a series of request-response transactions, with requests expressed as textual commands in a specialized vocabulary. Latency was far lower than for batch systems, dropping from days or hours to seconds. Accordingly, command-line systems allowed the user to change his or her mind about later stages of the transaction in response to real-time or near-real-time feedback on earlier results. Software could be exploratory and interactive in ways not possible before. But these interfaces still placed a relatively heavy [[mnemonic]] load on the user, requiring a serious investment of effort and learning time to master.<ref name=\"anaheimguide\">{{cite web|title=HMI Guide|url=http://www.anaheimautomation.com/manuals/forms/hmi-guide.php#sthash.2McqS5xo.dpbs|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620001341/http://www.anaheimautomation.com/manuals/forms/hmi-guide.php#sthash.2McqS5xo.dpbs|archivedate=2014-06-20}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest command-line systems combined [[teleprinter]]s with computers, adapting a mature technology that had proven effective for mediating the transfer of information over wires between human beings. Teleprinters had originally been invented as devices for automatic telegraph transmission and reception; they had a history going back to 1902 and had already become well-established in newsrooms and elsewhere by 1920. In reusing them, economy was certainly a consideration, but psychology and the [[Principle of least astonishment|Rule of Least Surprise]] mattered as well; teleprinters provided a point of interface with the system that was familiar to many engineers and users.\n\n[[File:DEC VT100 terminal.jpg|left|thumb|alt=The VT100, introduced in 197\u20338, was the most popular VDT of all time. Most terminal emulators still default to VT100 mode.|DEC VT100 terminal]]\n\nThe widespread adoption of video-display terminals (VDTs) in the mid-1970s ushered in the second phase of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a printer head or carriage can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.\n\nJust as importantly, the existence of an accessible screen \u2014 a two-dimensional display of text that could be rapidly and reversibly modified \u2014 made it economical for software designers to deploy interfaces that could be described as visual rather than textual. The pioneering applications of this kind were computer games and text editors; close descendants of some of the earliest specimens, such as [[Rogue (video game)|rogue]](6), and [[vi]](1), are still a live part of [[Unix]] tradition.\n\n===1985: SAA User Interface or Text-Based User Interface===\nIn 1985, with the beginning of [[Microsoft Windows]] and other [[graphical user interface]]s, IBM created what is called the [[IBM Systems Application Architecture|Systems Application Architecture]] (SAA) standard which include the [[IBM Common User Access|Common User Access]] (CUA) derivative. CUA successfully created what we know and use today in Windows, and most of the more recent [[DOS]] or Windows Console Applications will use that standard as well.\n\nThis defined that a pulldown menu system should be at the top of the screen, status bar at the bottom, shortcut keys should stay the same for all common functionality (F2 to Open for example would work in all applications that followed the SAA standard). This greatly helped the speed at which users could learn an application so it caught on quick and became an industry standard.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Richard|first1=St\u00e9phane|title=Text User Interface Development Series Part One - T.U.I.

The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' [[decision-making]] process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer [[operating system]]s, hand [[tools]], [[heavy machinery]] operator controls, and [[Unit operation|process]] controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as [[ergonomics]] and [[psychology]].\n\nGenerally, the goal of [[user interface design]] is to produce a user interface which makes it easy, efficient, and enjoyable (user-friendly) to operate a machine in the way which produces the desired result. This generally means that the operator needs to provide minimal input to achieve the desired output, and also that the machine minimizes undesired outputs to the human.\n\nUser interfaces are composed of one or more layers including a '''human-machine interface''' ('''HMI''') interfaces machines with physical input hardware such as keyboards, mice, game pads and output hardware such as computer monitors, speakers, and printers. A device that implements an HMI is called a [[human interface device]] (HID). Other terms for human-machine interfaces are '''man-machine interface''' ('''MMI''') and when the machine in question is a computer '''human-computer interface'''. Additional UI layers may interact with one or more human sense, including: tactile UI (touch), visual UI (sight), auditory UI (sound), olfactory UI (smell), equilibrial UI (balance), and gustatory UI (taste).\n\nComposite user interfaces (CUI) are UIs that interact with two or more senses. The most common CUI is a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), which is composed of a tactile UI and a visual UI capable of displaying [[graphics]]. When sound is added to a GUI it becomes a multimedia user interface (MUI). There are three broad categories of CUI: ''standard'', ''virtual'' and ''augmented''. Standard composite user interfaces use standard human interface devices like keyboards, mice, and computer monitors. When the CUI blocks out the real world to create a [[virtual reality]], the CUI is virtual and uses a virtual reality interface. When the CUI does not block out the real world and creates [[augmented reality]], the CUI is augmented and uses an augmented reality interface. When a UI interacts with all human senses, it is called a qualia interface, named after the theory of [[qualia]]. CUI may also be classified by how many senses they interact with as either an X-sense virtual reality interface or X-sense augmented reality interface, where X is the number of senses interfaced with. For example, a [[Smell-O-Vision]] is a 3-sense (3S) Standard CUI with visual display, sound and smells; when ''virtual reality interfaces'' interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) virtual reality interface; and when ''augmented reality interfaces'' interface with smells and touch it is said to be a 4-sense (4S) augmented reality interface.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:XFCE-4.10-Desktop.png|thumb|right|A [[graphical user interface]] following the [[desktop metaphor]]]]\n\nThe user interface or ''human\u2013machine interface'' is the part of the machine that handles the human\u2013machine interaction. Membrane switches, rubber keypads and touchscreens are examples of the physical part of the Human Machine Interface which we can see and touch.\n\nIn complex systems, the human\u2013machine interface is typically computerized. The term ''human\u2013computer interface'' refers to this kind of system. In the context of computing, the term typically extends as well to the software dedicated to control the physical elements used for [[human-computer interaction]].\n\nThe engineering of human\u2013machine interfaces is enhanced by considering [[ergonomics]] ([[human factors]]). The corresponding disciplines are [[human factors engineering]] (HFE) and [[usability engineering]] (UE), which is part of [[systems engineering]].\n\nTools used for incorporating human factors in the interface design are developed based on knowledge of [[computer science]], such as [[computer graphics]], [[operating systems]], [[programming language]]s. Nowadays, we use the expression [[graphical user interface]] for human\u2013machine interface on computers, as nearly all of them are now using graphics.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Linux kernel INPUT OUPUT evdev gem USB framebuffer.svg|thumb|300px|A human\u2013machine interface usually involves [[peripheral|peripheral hardware]] for the INPUT and for the OUTPUT. Often, there is an additional component implemented in software, like e.g. a [[graphical user interface]].]]\n\nThere is a difference between a user interface and an operator interface or a human\u2013machine interface (HMI).\n\n* The term \"user interface\" is often used in the context of (personal) computer systems and [[electronics|electronic devices]].\n** Where a network of equipment or computers are interlinked through an MES (Manufacturing Execution System)-or Host to display information.\n** A human-machine interface (HMI) is typically local to one machine or piece of equipment, and is the interface method between the human and the equipment/machine. An operator interface is the interface method by which multiple pieces of equipment that are linked by a host control system are accessed or controlled.{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}\n** The system may expose several user interfaces to serve different kinds of users. For example, a [[digital library|computerized library database]] might provide two user interfaces, one for library patrons (limited set of functions, optimized for ease of use) and the other for library personnel (wide set of functions, optimized for efficiency).{{Clarify|date=January 2010}}\n* The user interface of a [[Machine|mechanical]] system, a vehicle or an [[industry|industrial]] installation is sometimes referred to as the human\u2013machine interface (HMI).<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Griffin, Ben|author2=Baston, Laurel|title=Interfaces|page=5|url=http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/CS/Interfaces2007_files/Interfaces2007.ppt|accessdate=7 June 2014|format=Presentation|quote=The user interface of a mechanical system, a vehicle or an industrial installation is sometimes referred to as the human-machine interface (HMI).|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714160915/http://peace.saumag.edu/faculty/kardas/Courses/CS/Interfaces2007_files/Interfaces2007.ppt|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref> HMI is a modification of the original term MMI (man-machine interface).<ref name=\"Nigeria\">{{cite journal|title=User Interface Design and Ergonomics|journal=Course Cit 811|page=19|url=http://www.nou.edu.ng/NOUN_OCL/pdf/SST/CIT%20811.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2014|publisher=SCHOOL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY|location=NATIONAL OPEN UNIVERSITY OF NIGERIA|quote=In practice, the abbreviation MMI is still frequently used although some may claim that MMI stands for something different now.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234100/http://www.nou.edu.ng/NOUN_OCL/pdf/SST/CIT%20811.pdf|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref> In practice, the abbreviation MMI is still frequently used<ref name=\"Nigeria\"/> although some may claim that MMI stands for something different now.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Another abbreviation is HCI, but is more commonly used for [[human\u2013computer interaction]].<ref name=\"Nigeria\"/> Other terms used are operator interface console (OIC) and operator interface terminal (OIT).<ref>{{cite book|title=Recent advances in business administration|date=2010|publisher=Wseas|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-960-474-161-8|page=190|chapter=Introduction Section|quote=Other terms used are operator interface console (OIC) and operator interface terminal (OIT)}}</ref> However it is abbreviated, the terms refer to the 'layer' that separates a human that is operating a machine from the machine itself.<ref name=\"Nigeria\"/> Without a clean and usable interface, humans would not be able to interact with information systems.\n\nIn [[science fiction]], HMI is sometimes used to refer to what is better described as a [[direct neural interface]].

User interfaces were rudimentary. Users had to accommodate computers rather than the other way around; user interfaces were considered overhead, and software was designed to keep the processor at maximum utilization with as little overhead as possible.\n\nThe input side of the user interfaces for batch machines was mainly [[punched card]]s or equivalent media like [[paper tape]]. The output side added [[line printer]]s to these media. With the limited exception of the system [[System console|operator's console]], human beings did not interact with batch machines in real time at all.\n\nSubmitting a job to a batch machine involved, first, preparing a deck of punched cards describing a program and a dataset. Punching the program cards wasn't done on the computer itself, but on [[keypunch]]es, specialized typewriter-like machines that were notoriously bulky, unforgiving, and prone to mechanical failure. The software interface was similarly unforgiving, with very strict syntaxes meant to be parsed by the smallest possible compilers and interpreters.\n\n[[File:Card puncher - NARA - 513295.jpg|left|thumb|Holes are punched in the card according to a prearranged code transferring the facts from the census questionnaire into [[statistics]]]]\nOnce the cards were punched, one would drop them in a job queue and wait. Eventually, operators would feed the deck to the computer, perhaps mounting [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tapes]] to supply another dataset or helper software. The job would generate a printout, containing final results or an abort notice with an attached error log. Successful runs might also write a result on magnetic tape or generate some data cards to be used in a later computation.\n\nThe [[turnaround time]] for a single job often spanned entire days. If one were very lucky, it might be hours; there was no real-time response. But there were worse fates than the card queue; some computers required an even more tedious and error-prone process of toggling in programs in binary code using console switches. The very earliest machines had to be partly rewired to incorporate program logic into themselves, using devices known as [[plugboard]]s.\n\nEarly batch systems gave the currently running job the entire computer; program decks and tapes had to include what we would now think of as [[operating system]] code to talk to I/O devices and do whatever other housekeeping was needed. Midway through the batch period, after 1957, various groups began to experiment with so-called \u201c[[Compile and go system|load-and-go]]\u201d systems. These used a [[Resident monitor|monitor program]] which was always resident on the computer. Programs could call the monitor for services. Another function of the monitor was to do better error checking on submitted jobs, catching errors earlier and more intelligently and generating more useful feedback to the users. Thus, monitors represented the first step towards both operating systems and explicitly designed user interfaces.\n\n===1969\u2013present: Command-line user interface===\n{{main|Command-line interface}}\n[[File:ASR-33 at CHM.agr.jpg|thumb|alt=Teletype Model 33|Teletype Model 33 ASR]]\n\n'''Command-line interfaces''' (CLIs) evolved from batch monitors connected to the system console. Their interaction model was a series of request-response transactions, with requests expressed as textual commands in a specialized vocabulary. Latency was far lower than for batch systems, dropping from days or hours to seconds. Accordingly, command-line systems allowed the user to change his or her mind about later stages of the transaction in response to real-time or near-real-time feedback on earlier results. Software could be exploratory and interactive in ways not possible before. But these interfaces still placed a relatively heavy [[mnemonic]] load on the user, requiring a serious investment of effort and learning time to master.<ref name=\"anaheimguide\">{{cite web|title=HMI Guide|url=http://www.anaheimautomation.com/manuals/forms/hmi-guide.php#sthash.2McqS5xo.dpbs|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620001341/http://www.anaheimautomation.com/manuals/forms/hmi-guide.php#sthash.2McqS5xo.dpbs|archivedate=2014-06-20}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest command-line systems combined [[teleprinter]]s with computers, adapting a mature technology that had proven effective for mediating the transfer of information over wires between human beings. Teleprinters had originally been invented as devices for automatic telegraph transmission and reception; they had a history going back to 1902 and had already become well-established in newsrooms and elsewhere by 1920. In reusing them, economy was certainly a consideration, but psychology and the [[Principle of least astonishment|Rule of Least Surprise]] mattered as well; teleprinters provided a point of interface with the system that was familiar to many engineers and users.\n\n[[File:DEC VT100 terminal.jpg|left|thumb|alt=The VT100, introduced in 197\u20338, was the most popular VDT of all time. Most terminal emulators still default to VT100 mode.|DEC VT100 terminal]]\n\nThe widespread adoption of video-display terminals (VDTs) in the mid-1970s ushered in the second phase of command-line systems. These cut latency further, because characters could be thrown on the phosphor dots of a screen more quickly than a printer head or carriage can move. They helped quell conservative resistance to interactive programming by cutting ink and paper consumables out of the cost picture, and were to the first TV generation of the late 1950s and 60s even more iconic and comfortable than teleprinters had been to the computer pioneers of the 1940s.\n\nJust as importantly, the existence of an accessible screen \u2014 a two-dimensional display of text that could be rapidly and reversibly modified \u2014 made it economical for software designers to deploy interfaces that could be described as visual rather than textual. The pioneering applications of this kind were computer games and text editors; close descendants of some of the earliest specimens, such as [[Rogue (video game)|rogue]](6), and [[vi]](1), are still a live part of [[Unix]] tradition.\n\n===1985: SAA User Interface or Text-Based User Interface===\nIn 1985, with the beginning of [[Microsoft Windows]] and other [[graphical user interface]]s, IBM created what is called the [[IBM Systems Application Architecture|Systems Application Architecture]] (SAA) standard which include the [[IBM Common User Access|Common User Access]] (CUA) derivative. CUA successfully created what we know and use today in Windows, and most of the more recent [[DOS]] or Windows Console Applications will use that standard as well.\n\nThis defined that a pulldown menu system should be at the top of the screen, status bar at the bottom, shortcut keys should stay the same for all common functionality (F2 to Open for example would work in all applications that followed the SAA standard). This greatly helped the speed at which users could learn an application so it caught on quick and became an industry standard.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Richard|first1=St\u00e9phane|title=Text User Interface Development Series Part One - T.U.I.

From ''Kompagnietor'', [[Flensburg]].]]\n\nChristian took an interest in many and varied matters, including a series of domestic reforms and improving Danish national armaments. New fortresses were constructed under the direction of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] engineers. The [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Danish navy]], which in 1596 had consisted of but twenty-two vessels, in 1610 rose to sixty, some of them built after Christian's own designs. The formation of a national army proved more difficult. Christian had to depend mainly upon hired [[mercenary]] troops as was common practice in the times\u2014well before the establishment of standing armies\u2014augmented by native [[conscription|peasant levies]] recruited for the most part from the peasantry on the crown domains.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nUp until the early 1620s, Denmark's economy profited from general boom conditions in Europe. This inspired Christian to initiate a policy of expanding Denmark's overseas trade as part of the [[mercantilist]] wave fashionable in Europe. He founded a number of merchant cities, and supported the building of factories. He also built a large number of buildings in [[Dutch Renaissance]] style.\n\nHis sister [[Anne of Denmark|Anne]] had married King [[James VI of Scotland]], who succeeded to the [[English throne]] in 1603. To foster friendly relations between the two kingdoms, Christian paid a state visit to England in 1606. The visit was generally judged to be a success, although the heavy drinking indulged in by English and Danes alike caused some unfavourable comments: both Christian and James had an ability to consume great amounts of alcohol, while remaining lucid,  which  most of their courtiers did not share. The entertainment which was intended to crown the visit- a [[masque]] of [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]]- was described by the audience as a drunken fiasco, where most of the players simply fell over from the effects of too much wine.\n\nDespite Christian's many efforts, the new economic projects did not return a profit. He looked abroad for new income. [[Christian IV's Expeditions to Greenland]] involved a series of voyages in the years 1605\u20131607 to Greenland and to Arctic waterways in order to locate the lost [[Eastern Settlement|Eastern Norse Settlement]] and to assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were unsuccessful, partly due to leaders lacking experience with the difficult Arctic ice and weather conditions. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer [[James Hall (explorer)|James Hall]]. An expedition to North America was commissioned in 1619. The expedition was captained by [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Dano-Norwegian]] navigator and explorer, [[Jens Munk]]. The ships, searching for the [[Northwest Passage]], arrived in [[Hudson Bay]] landing at the mouth of [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]], settling at what is now [[Churchill, Manitoba]]. However, it was a disastrous voyage, with cold, famine, and scurvy killing most of the crew.<ref name=\"gad\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/munk.htm |title='&#39;Jens Munk \u2013 Scandinavia's First Great Polar Explorer'&#39; (The Council of Europe Cultural Routes) |publisher=Ub.uit.no |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tranquebar 1600.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tranquebar]] on India's south coast.]]\nIn 1618, Christian appointed Admiral [[Ove Gjedde]] to lead an expedition establish a Danish colony in [[Ceylon]].

Despite the reluctance of ''Rigsraadet'', Christian initiated a war with Sweden for the supremacy of the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=\"gad\"/> It was later known as the [[Kalmar War]] because its chief operation was the Danish capture of [[Kalmar]], the southernmost fortress of Sweden. Christian compelled King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] to give way on all essential points at the resulting [[Treaty of Kn\u00e4red]] of 20 January 1613.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> However, despite Denmark's greater strength, the gains of the war were not decisive.<ref name=\"gad\"/>\n\nHe now turned his attention to the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Germany. Here, his objectives were twofold: first, to obtain control of the great German rivers\u2014 the [[Elbe]] and the [[Weser]]\u2014&nbsp;as a means of securing his dominion of the northern seas; and secondly, to acquire the secularised German [[Archdiocese of Bremen]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Verden]] as [[appanage]]s for his younger sons. He skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the German [[Protestant]]s after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, to secure co-adjutorship of the See of Bremen for his son [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick]] (September 1621). A similar arrangement was reached in November at [[Verden (Aller)|Verden]]. Hamburg was also induced to acknowledge the Danish overlordship of [[Holstein]] by the [[compact of Steinburg]] in July 1621.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\n===Thirty Years' War===\n{{Main|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:ChristianIV of denmark receives homage.jpg|thumb|left|Christian IV receives homage from the countries of Europe as mediator in the [[Thirty Years' War]].<br/>[[Grisaille]] by [[Adrian van de Venne]], 1643.]]\nChristian IV had obtained for his kingdom a level of stability and wealth that was virtually unmatched elsewhere in Europe.<ref>Paul D.

Penguin, 2009, p.&nbsp;400\u2013433</ref> Denmark's intervention in the Thirty Years' War was aided by France and by Charles I of England, who agreed to help subsidise the war partly because Christian was the uncle of both the Stuart king and his sister [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]] through their mother, [[Anne of Denmark]]. Some 13,700 Scottish soldiers were to be sent as allies to help Christian IV under the command of General [[Robert Maxwell, 1st Earl of Nithsdale]].<ref>Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.43\u201346</ref> Moreover, some 6000 English troops under Charles Morgan also eventually arrived to bolster the defence of Denmark though it took longer for these to arrive than Christian hoped, not least due to the ongoing British campaigns against France and Spain. Thus Christian, as war-leader of the Lower Saxon Circle, entered the war with an army of only 20,000 mercenaries, some of his allies from Britain and a national army 15,000 strong, leading them as Duke of Holstein rather than as King of Denmark.\n\nDespite the growing power of Roman Catholics in North Germany, and the threat to the Danish holdings in the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] duchies, Christian for a time stayed his hand. The urgent solicitations of other powers, and his fear that Gustavus Adolphus should supplant him as the champion of the Protestant cause, finally led him to enter the war on 9 May 1625.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> He also feared that Sweden could use a war to further expand their holdings in the Baltic Sea. Christian embarked on a military campaign which was later known in Denmark and Norway as \"The Emperor War\" ({{lang-da|Kejserkrigen}}, {{lang-no|Keiserkrigen}}).<ref>{{cite book|title=Denmark, 1513\u20131660: the rise and decline of a Renaissance monarchy|first=Paul Douglas|last=Lockhart|publisher=[[Oxford University]] Press|year=2007|isbn=0-19-927121-6|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TkteH2TrSSsC&pg=PA166|accessdate=2009-08-07|page=166}}</ref>\n\nHe had at his disposal from 19,000 to 25,000 men, and at first gained some successes but on 27 August 1626 he was routed by [[Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly]] in the [[Battle of Lutter]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Christian had not thoroughly planned the advance against the combined forces of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], as promises of military support from the Netherlands and England did not materialise.<ref name=\"kejserkrigen\">\"Gads Historieleksikon\", 3rd edition, 2006.

Thus with the help of Sweden, the superior sea-power enabled Denmark to tide over her worst difficulties, and in May 1629 Christian was able to conclude peace with the emperor in the [[Treaty of L\u00fcbeck]], without any diminution of territory.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> However, the treaty bound Christian not to interfere in the Thirty Years' War any further, removing any Danish obstacles when Gustavus Adolphus entered the war in 1630.<ref name=\"kejserkrigen\"/>\n\n===Containment of Sweden===\nChristian's foreign policy did not suffer from lack of confidence following the Danish defeat in The Thirty Years' War. To compensate for lacking export revenues, and also in order to stifle the Swedish advances in the Thirty Years' War, Christian enacted a number of increases in the [[Sound Dues]] throughout the 1630s.<ref name=\"gad\"/> Christian gained both in popularity and influence at home, and he hoped to increase his external power still further with the assistance of his sons-in-law, [[Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606\u20131664)|Corfitz Ulfeldt]] and [[Hannibal Sehested (governor)|Hannibal Sehested]], who now came prominently forward.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nBetween 1629 and 1643 the European situation presented infinite possibilities to politicians with a taste for adventure. However, Christian was incapable of a consistent diplomatic policy. He would neither conciliate Sweden, henceforth his most dangerous enemy, nor guard himself against her by a definite system of counter-alliances.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Christian contacted the Roman Catholic part of the Thirty Years' War, and offered to broker a deal with Sweden. However, his mediating was highly skewed in favour of the Holy Roman Emperor, and was a transparent attempt at minimising the Swedish influence in the Baltics.<ref name=\"torstensson\">\"Gads Historieleksikon\", 3rd edition, 2006.

In May 1643 the Swedish [[Privy Council of Sweden|Privy Council]] decided upon war; on 12 December the Swedish [[List of Swedish Field Marshals|Field Marshal]] [[Lennart Torstensson]], advancing from [[Bohemia]], crossed the southern frontier of Denmark; and by the end of January 1644 the whole peninsula of [[Jutland]] was in Swedish hands. This unexpected attack, conducted from first to last with consummate ability and lightning-like rapidity, had a paralysing effect upon Denmark.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nIn his sixty-sixth year he once more displayed something of the energy of his triumphant youth. Night and day he laboured to levy armies and equip fleets. Fortunately for him, the Swedish government delayed hostilities in [[Scania]] until February 1644, and the Danes were able to make adequate defensive preparations and save the important fortress of [[Malm\u00f6]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The Danish fleet denied Torstensson crossing from Jutland to [[Funen]], and defeated the Dutch auxiliary fleet which came to Torstensson's assistance at the [[Action of 16 May 1644]].<ref name=\"torstensson\"/> Another attempt to transport Torstensson and his army to the Danish islands by a large Swedish fleet was frustrated by Christian IV in person on 1 July 1644. On that day the two fleets encountered at the [[Battle of Colberger Heide]]. As Christian stood on the quarter-deck of the ''Trinity'' a cannon close by was exploded by a Swedish cannonball, and splinters of wood and metal wounded the king in thirteen places, blinding one eye and flinging him to the deck. But he was instantly on his feet again, cried with a loud voice that it was well with him, and set every one an example of duty by remaining on deck till the fight was over. Darkness at last separated the contending fleets; and the battle was drawn.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe Danish fleet subsequently blockaded the Swedish ships in the [[Bay of Kiel]]. But the Swedish fleet escaped, and the annihilation of the Danish fleet by the combined navies of Sweden and the Netherlands, after an obstinate fight between [[Fehmarn]] and [[Lolland]] at the end of September, exhausted the military resources of Denmark and compelled Christian to accept the mediation of France and the Netherlands; and peace was finally signed with the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]] on 8 February 1645.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Here Denmark had to cede [[Gotland]], [[Saaremaa|\u00d6sel]] and (for thirty years) [[Halland]], while Norway lost the two provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]] and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], giving Sweden the supremacy of the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"torstensson\"/>\n\n===Norwegian issue===\n[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9253.tif|thumb|Engraving of Christian IV]]\nChristian IV spent more time in Norway than any other Oldenberg monarch and no Oldenburg king made such a lasting impression on the Norwegian people. He visited the country a number of times and founded four cities. He also established and took control over one silver mine ([[Kongsberg]]), one copper mine ([[R\u00f8ros]]), and tried to make an iron plant with limited success in Eiker. He also restored and restructured the castle [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus]], where he invited the people of Norway to the official and age-old installment of the king in 1590, and again in 1610.\n\nWhen the king was busy overseeing the reparations and re-building of the fortress at Oslo, he lived in the country all summer, and at the same time tried to establish a centre for producing iron at [[Eiker]], [[Buskerud]]. History tells he actually ruled the entire kingdom from this area in the summer of 1603.\n\nIn 1623, Christian again visited Norway for an entire summer, this time to oversee the foundation of [[Kongsberg]]. He was also present in the area in 1624, when Oslo burned in August of that year. The king was able to reach the area in a few weeks, being in Eiker. Over the years, fire had destroyed major parts of the city many times, as many of the city's buildings were built entirely of wood.  After the fire in 1624 which lasted for three days, Christian IV decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again. He decided that the new town be rebuilt in the area below [[Akershus Fortress]], a castle which later was converted into a palace and royal residence. His men built a network of roads in Akershagen and demanded that all citizens should move their shops and workplaces to the newly built city of Christiania.<ref>{{cite web|url=   http://www.visitoslo.com/en/articles/history/|title=  History of Oslo|publisher =    visitoslo \n|accessdate= August 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Securing the Northern Lands under the Danish Crown===\nDuring the fourteenth century the Swedish kings tried to push the areas of their control towards the north, and [[contemporary]] maps depicted the now Norwegian coastal areas of [[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]] as a part of Sweden.

Many English musicians were employed by him at several times, among them [[William Brade]], [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] and [[John Dowland]]. Dowland accompanied the king on his tours, and as he was employed in 1603, rumour has it he was in Norway as well. Christian was an agile dancer, and his court was reckoned the second most \"musical\" court in Europe, only ranking behind that of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Christian maintained good contact with his sister Anne, who was married to [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]]. His other sister, [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Elizabeth]], was married to the [[Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], and artists and musicians travelled freely between the courts.\n\n==City foundations==\nChristian IV is renowned for his many city (town) foundations, and is most likely the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[head of state]] that can be accredited for the highest number of new cities in his [[realm]]. These towns/cities are:\n* [[Kristianopel|Christianopel]], now Kristianopel in Sweden. Founded in 1599 in the then Danish territory of [[Blekinge]] as a garrison town near the Swedish border.\n* [[Kristianstad|Christianstad]], now Kristianstad in Sweden.

After a devastating fire in 1624 the king ordered the old city of Oslo to be moved closer to the fortification of [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus slot]] and also renamed it Christiania. The city name was altered to Kristiania in 1877 and then back to Oslo in 1924.

Nevertheless, Christian was one of the few kings from the [[House of Oldenburg]] that achieved a lasting legacy of popularity with both the Danish and Norwegian people. As such, he featured in the Danish national play ''[[Elverh\u00f8j]]''. Furthermore, his great building activities also furthered his popularity.<ref name=\"gad\"/>\n\nChristian IV spoke Danish, German, [[Latin]], French and Italian. Naturally cheerful and hospitable, he delighted in lively society; but he was also passionate, irritable and sensual. He had courage, a vivid sense of duty, an indefatigable love of work, and all the inquisitive zeal and inventive energy of a born reformer. His own pleasure, whether it took the form of love or ambition, was always his first consideration. His capacity for drink was proverbial: when he visited England in 1606, even the notoriously hard-drinking English Court were astonished by his alcohol  consumption.   In the heyday of his youth his high spirits and passion for adventure enabled him to surmount every obstacle with elan. But in the decline of life he reaped the bitter fruits of his lack of self-control, and sank into the grave a weary and brokenhearted old man.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe [[Christian IV Glacier]] in [[Greenland]] is named after him.\n\n===In fiction===\n*Christian IV is depicted as a brilliant but hard-drinking monarch in the [[Eric Flint]] and [[David Weber]] alternate-history novel ''[[1634: The Baltic War]]''.\n*Christian IV is featured several times in the book series ''[[The Legend of the Ice People]]''.\n*Christian IV also features prominently in the novel ''[[Music and Silence]]'' by [[Rose Tremain]], which is primarily set in and around the Danish court in the years 1629 and 1630.\n*Christian IV is depicted as a foul-natured person, but a good king who did a lot to make his realm flourish, by the Danish alternative music band [[Mew (band)|Mew]] in their song, [[King Christian (Song)|\"King Christian\"]].\n*[[Jeg, Christian]] (2017) is a biographical movie about the last days of Christian IV's life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeg, Christian|url=http://goodcompanyfilms.com/film/jeg-christian/|website=goodcompanyfilms.com|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Issue and private life==\n[[File:Christian IV and Anne Cathrine.jpg|thumb|King Christian IV and Queen [[Anne Catherine of Brandenburg|Anne Catherine]] with the [[Christian, Prince Elect of Denmark|Prince-Elect]].

New fortresses were constructed under the direction of [[Netherlands|Dutch]] engineers. The [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy|Danish navy]], which in 1596 had consisted of but twenty-two vessels, in 1610 rose to sixty, some of them built after Christian's own designs. The formation of a national army proved more difficult. Christian had to depend mainly upon hired [[mercenary]] troops as was common practice in the times\u2014well before the establishment of standing armies\u2014augmented by native [[conscription|peasant levies]] recruited for the most part from the peasantry on the crown domains.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nUp until the early 1620s, Denmark's economy profited from general boom conditions in Europe. This inspired Christian to initiate a policy of expanding Denmark's overseas trade as part of the [[mercantilist]] wave fashionable in Europe. He founded a number of merchant cities, and supported the building of factories. He also built a large number of buildings in [[Dutch Renaissance]] style.\n\nHis sister [[Anne of Denmark|Anne]] had married King [[James VI of Scotland]], who succeeded to the [[English throne]] in 1603. To foster friendly relations between the two kingdoms, Christian paid a state visit to England in 1606. The visit was generally judged to be a success, although the heavy drinking indulged in by English and Danes alike caused some unfavourable comments: both Christian and James had an ability to consume great amounts of alcohol, while remaining lucid,  which  most of their courtiers did not share. The entertainment which was intended to crown the visit- a [[masque]] of [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]]- was described by the audience as a drunken fiasco, where most of the players simply fell over from the effects of too much wine.\n\nDespite Christian's many efforts, the new economic projects did not return a profit. He looked abroad for new income. [[Christian IV's Expeditions to Greenland]] involved a series of voyages in the years 1605\u20131607 to Greenland and to Arctic waterways in order to locate the lost [[Eastern Settlement|Eastern Norse Settlement]] and to assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were unsuccessful, partly due to leaders lacking experience with the difficult Arctic ice and weather conditions. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer [[James Hall (explorer)|James Hall]]. An expedition to North America was commissioned in 1619. The expedition was captained by [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Dano-Norwegian]] navigator and explorer, [[Jens Munk]]. The ships, searching for the [[Northwest Passage]], arrived in [[Hudson Bay]] landing at the mouth of [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]], settling at what is now [[Churchill, Manitoba]]. However, it was a disastrous voyage, with cold, famine, and scurvy killing most of the crew.<ref name=\"gad\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.uit.no/northernlights/eng/munk.htm |title='&#39;Jens Munk \u2013 Scandinavia's First Great Polar Explorer'&#39; (The Council of Europe Cultural Routes) |publisher=Ub.uit.no |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tranquebar 1600.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tranquebar]] on India's south coast.]]\nIn 1618, Christian appointed Admiral [[Ove Gjedde]] to lead an expedition establish a Danish colony in [[Ceylon]].

Despite the reluctance of ''Rigsraadet'', Christian initiated a war with Sweden for the supremacy of the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref name=\"gad\"/> It was later known as the [[Kalmar War]] because its chief operation was the Danish capture of [[Kalmar]], the southernmost fortress of Sweden. Christian compelled King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] to give way on all essential points at the resulting [[Treaty of Kn\u00e4red]] of 20 January 1613.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> However, despite Denmark's greater strength, the gains of the war were not decisive.<ref name=\"gad\"/>\n\nHe now turned his attention to the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Germany. Here, his objectives were twofold: first, to obtain control of the great German rivers\u2014 the [[Elbe]] and the [[Weser]]\u2014&nbsp;as a means of securing his dominion of the northern seas; and secondly, to acquire the secularised German [[Archdiocese of Bremen]] and [[Prince-Bishopric of Verden]] as [[appanage]]s for his younger sons. He skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the German [[Protestant]]s after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] in 1620, to secure co-adjutorship of the See of Bremen for his son [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick]] (September 1621). A similar arrangement was reached in November at [[Verden (Aller)|Verden]]. Hamburg was also induced to acknowledge the Danish overlordship of [[Holstein]] by the [[compact of Steinburg]] in July 1621.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\n===Thirty Years' War===\n{{Main|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:ChristianIV of denmark receives homage.jpg|thumb|left|Christian IV receives homage from the countries of Europe as mediator in the [[Thirty Years' War]].<br/>[[Grisaille]] by [[Adrian van de Venne]], 1643.]]\nChristian IV had obtained for his kingdom a level of stability and wealth that was virtually unmatched elsewhere in Europe.<ref>Paul D.

Penguin, 2009, p.&nbsp;400\u2013433</ref> Denmark's intervention in the Thirty Years' War was aided by France and by Charles I of England, who agreed to help subsidise the war partly because Christian was the uncle of both the Stuart king and his sister [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]] through their mother, [[Anne of Denmark]]. Some 13,700 Scottish soldiers were to be sent as allies to help Christian IV under the command of General [[Robert Maxwell, 1st Earl of Nithsdale]].<ref>Murdoch and Grosjean, pp.43\u201346</ref> Moreover, some 6000 English troops under Charles Morgan also eventually arrived to bolster the defence of Denmark though it took longer for these to arrive than Christian hoped, not least due to the ongoing British campaigns against France and Spain. Thus Christian, as war-leader of the Lower Saxon Circle, entered the war with an army of only 20,000 mercenaries, some of his allies from Britain and a national army 15,000 strong, leading them as Duke of Holstein rather than as King of Denmark.\n\nDespite the growing power of Roman Catholics in North Germany, and the threat to the Danish holdings in the [[Schleswig-Holstein]] duchies, Christian for a time stayed his hand. The urgent solicitations of other powers, and his fear that Gustavus Adolphus should supplant him as the champion of the Protestant cause, finally led him to enter the war on 9 May 1625.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> He also feared that Sweden could use a war to further expand their holdings in the Baltic Sea. Christian embarked on a military campaign which was later known in Denmark and Norway as \"The Emperor War\" ({{lang-da|Kejserkrigen}}, {{lang-no|Keiserkrigen}}).<ref>{{cite book|title=Denmark, 1513\u20131660: the rise and decline of a Renaissance monarchy|first=Paul Douglas|last=Lockhart|publisher=[[Oxford University]] Press|year=2007|isbn=0-19-927121-6|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=TkteH2TrSSsC&pg=PA166|accessdate=2009-08-07|page=166}}</ref>\n\nHe had at his disposal from 19,000 to 25,000 men, and at first gained some successes but on 27 August 1626 he was routed by [[Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly]] in the [[Battle of Lutter]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Christian had not thoroughly planned the advance against the combined forces of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], as promises of military support from the Netherlands and England did not materialise.<ref name=\"kejserkrigen\">\"Gads Historieleksikon\", 3rd edition, 2006.

Thus with the help of Sweden, the superior sea-power enabled Denmark to tide over her worst difficulties, and in May 1629 Christian was able to conclude peace with the emperor in the [[Treaty of L\u00fcbeck]], without any diminution of territory.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> However, the treaty bound Christian not to interfere in the Thirty Years' War any further, removing any Danish obstacles when Gustavus Adolphus entered the war in 1630.<ref name=\"kejserkrigen\"/>\n\n===Containment of Sweden===\nChristian's foreign policy did not suffer from lack of confidence following the Danish defeat in The Thirty Years' War. To compensate for lacking export revenues, and also in order to stifle the Swedish advances in the Thirty Years' War, Christian enacted a number of increases in the [[Sound Dues]] throughout the 1630s.<ref name=\"gad\"/> Christian gained both in popularity and influence at home, and he hoped to increase his external power still further with the assistance of his sons-in-law, [[Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606\u20131664)|Corfitz Ulfeldt]] and [[Hannibal Sehested (governor)|Hannibal Sehested]], who now came prominently forward.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nBetween 1629 and 1643 the European situation presented infinite possibilities to politicians with a taste for adventure. However, Christian was incapable of a consistent diplomatic policy. He would neither conciliate Sweden, henceforth his most dangerous enemy, nor guard himself against her by a definite system of counter-alliances.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Christian contacted the Roman Catholic part of the Thirty Years' War, and offered to broker a deal with Sweden.

In May 1643 the Swedish [[Privy Council of Sweden|Privy Council]] decided upon war; on 12 December the Swedish [[List of Swedish Field Marshals|Field Marshal]] [[Lennart Torstensson]], advancing from [[Bohemia]], crossed the southern frontier of Denmark; and by the end of January 1644 the whole peninsula of [[Jutland]] was in Swedish hands. This unexpected attack, conducted from first to last with consummate ability and lightning-like rapidity, had a paralysing effect upon Denmark.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nIn his sixty-sixth year he once more displayed something of the energy of his triumphant youth. Night and day he laboured to levy armies and equip fleets. Fortunately for him, the Swedish government delayed hostilities in [[Scania]] until February 1644, and the Danes were able to make adequate defensive preparations and save the important fortress of [[Malm\u00f6]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The Danish fleet denied Torstensson crossing from Jutland to [[Funen]], and defeated the Dutch auxiliary fleet which came to Torstensson's assistance at the [[Action of 16 May 1644]].<ref name=\"torstensson\"/> Another attempt to transport Torstensson and his army to the Danish islands by a large Swedish fleet was frustrated by Christian IV in person on 1 July 1644. On that day the two fleets encountered at the [[Battle of Colberger Heide]]. As Christian stood on the quarter-deck of the ''Trinity'' a cannon close by was exploded by a Swedish cannonball, and splinters of wood and metal wounded the king in thirteen places, blinding one eye and flinging him to the deck. But he was instantly on his feet again, cried with a loud voice that it was well with him, and set every one an example of duty by remaining on deck till the fight was over. Darkness at last separated the contending fleets; and the battle was drawn.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe Danish fleet subsequently blockaded the Swedish ships in the [[Bay of Kiel]]. But the Swedish fleet escaped, and the annihilation of the Danish fleet by the combined navies of Sweden and the Netherlands, after an obstinate fight between [[Fehmarn]] and [[Lolland]] at the end of September, exhausted the military resources of Denmark and compelled Christian to accept the mediation of France and the Netherlands; and peace was finally signed with the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]] on 8 February 1645.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Here Denmark had to cede [[Gotland]], [[Saaremaa|\u00d6sel]] and (for thirty years) [[Halland]], while Norway lost the two provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]] and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], giving Sweden the supremacy of the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"torstensson\"/>\n\n===Norwegian issue===\n[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9253.tif|thumb|Engraving of Christian IV]]\nChristian IV spent more time in Norway than any other Oldenberg monarch and no Oldenburg king made such a lasting impression on the Norwegian people. He visited the country a number of times and founded four cities. He also established and took control over one silver mine ([[Kongsberg]]), one copper mine ([[R\u00f8ros]]), and tried to make an iron plant with limited success in Eiker. He also restored and restructured the castle [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus]], where he invited the people of Norway to the official and age-old installment of the king in 1590, and again in 1610.\n\nWhen the king was busy overseeing the reparations and re-building of the fortress at Oslo, he lived in the country all summer, and at the same time tried to establish a centre for producing iron at [[Eiker]], [[Buskerud]]. History tells he actually ruled the entire kingdom from this area in the summer of 1603.\n\nIn 1623, Christian again visited Norway for an entire summer, this time to oversee the foundation of [[Kongsberg]]. He was also present in the area in 1624, when Oslo burned in August of that year. The king was able to reach the area in a few weeks, being in Eiker. Over the years, fire had destroyed major parts of the city many times, as many of the city's buildings were built entirely of wood.  After the fire in 1624 which lasted for three days, Christian IV decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again. He decided that the new town be rebuilt in the area below [[Akershus Fortress]], a castle which later was converted into a palace and royal residence. His men built a network of roads in Akershagen and demanded that all citizens should move their shops and workplaces to the newly built city of Christiania.<ref>{{cite web|url=   http://www.visitoslo.com/en/articles/history/|title=  History of Oslo|publisher =    visitoslo \n|accessdate= August 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Securing the Northern Lands under the Danish Crown===\nDuring the fourteenth century the Swedish kings tried to push the areas of their control towards the north, and [[contemporary]] maps depicted the now Norwegian coastal areas of [[Troms]] and [[Finnmark]] as a part of Sweden.

Many English musicians were employed by him at several times, among them [[William Brade]], [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] and [[John Dowland]]. Dowland accompanied the king on his tours, and as he was employed in 1603, rumour has it he was in Norway as well. Christian was an agile dancer, and his court was reckoned the second most \"musical\" court in Europe, only ranking behind that of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. Christian maintained good contact with his sister Anne, who was married to [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]]. His other sister, [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Elizabeth]], was married to the [[Henry Julius, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], and artists and musicians travelled freely between the courts.\n\n==City foundations==\nChristian IV is renowned for his many city (town) foundations, and is most likely the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] [[head of state]] that can be accredited for the highest number of new cities in his [[realm]].

After a devastating fire in 1624 the king ordered the old city of Oslo to be moved closer to the fortification of [[Akershus Fortress|Akershus slot]] and also renamed it Christiania. The city name was altered to Kristiania in 1877 and then back to Oslo in 1924. The original town of Christian is now known as ''Kvadraturen'' = ''The Quarters''.\n* [[Kristiansand|Christian(s)sand]], now Kristiansand in Norway, founded in 1641 to promote trade at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Agdesiden len|no}} in Southern Norway.\n* [[R\u00f8ros]], now in Norway, founded as an industrial town after the discovery of copper ores.\n\nA short-lived town was:\n* [[Christianspris]], now in [[Schleswig]], Germany, founded as a garrison town near [[Kiel]] in the then Danish territory of Holstein.\n\nFurthermore, Christian is known for erecting many important buildings in his realm, including the observatory [[Rundet\u00e5rn]], the [[stock exchange]] [[B\u00f8rsen]], the Copenhagen fortress [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Kastellet]], [[Rosenborg Castle]], workers' district [[Nyboder]]'','' the Copenhagen naval [[Holmen Church]] (Holmens Kirke), [[Proviantg\u00e5rden]], a brewery, the [[T\u00f8jhus Museum]] [[arsenal]], and two Trinity Churches in Copenhagen and modern Kristianstad, now known as respectively [[Trinitatis Church]] and [[Trinity Church, Kristianstad|Holy Trinity Church]].

Nevertheless, Christian was one of the few kings from the [[House of Oldenburg]] that achieved a lasting legacy of popularity with both the Danish and Norwegian people. As such, he featured in the Danish national play ''[[Elverh\u00f8j]]''. Furthermore, his great building activities also furthered his popularity.<ref name=\"gad\"/>\n\nChristian IV spoke Danish, German, [[Latin]], French and Italian. Naturally cheerful and hospitable, he delighted in lively society; but he was also passionate, irritable and sensual. He had courage, a vivid sense of duty, an indefatigable love of work, and all the inquisitive zeal and inventive energy of a born reformer. His own pleasure, whether it took the form of love or ambition, was always his first consideration. His capacity for drink was proverbial: when he visited England in 1606, even the notoriously hard-drinking English Court were astonished by his alcohol  consumption.   In the heyday of his youth his high spirits and passion for adventure enabled him to surmount every obstacle with elan. But in the decline of life he reaped the bitter fruits of his lack of self-control, and sank into the grave a weary and brokenhearted old man.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe [[Christian IV Glacier]] in [[Greenland]] is named after him.\n\n===In fiction===\n*Christian IV is depicted as a brilliant but hard-drinking monarch in the [[Eric Flint]] and [[David Weber]] alternate-history novel ''[[1634: The Baltic War]]''.\n*Christian IV is featured several times in the book series ''[[The Legend of the Ice People]]''.\n*Christian IV also features prominently in the novel ''[[Music and Silence]]'' by [[Rose Tremain]], which is primarily set in and around the Danish court in the years 1629 and 1630.\n*Christian IV is depicted as a foul-natured person, but a good king who did a lot to make his realm flourish, by the Danish alternative music band [[Mew (band)|Mew]] in their song, [[King Christian (Song)|\"King Christian\"]].\n*[[Jeg, Christian]] (2017) is a biographical movie about the last days of Christian IV's life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeg, Christian|url=http://goodcompanyfilms.com/film/jeg-christian/|website=goodcompanyfilms.com|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Issue and private life==\n[[File:Christian IV and Anne Cathrine.jpg|thumb|King Christian IV and Queen [[Anne Catherine of Brandenburg|Anne Catherine]] with the [[Christian, Prince Elect of Denmark|Prince-Elect]].
